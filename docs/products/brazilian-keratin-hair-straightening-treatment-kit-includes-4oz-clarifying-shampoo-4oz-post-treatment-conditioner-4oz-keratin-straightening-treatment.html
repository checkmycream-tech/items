            <li>I loved the way my hair feels.  </li>
            <li>It takes a while, and is good for a Sunday afternoon.  </li>
            <li>This is important to get the best from your treatment.  </li>
            <li>If youre looking for a good keratin treatment, search for encanto on ebay  or perhaps the keratin diamond on amazon.  </li>
            <li>b/c it smelled good too.</li>
            <li>And this is how good this product is....</li>
            <li>My hair looked really good when I used this</li>
            <li>Works great and very easy to use if you follow the directions.  </li>
            <li>It can be straightened, but it never had that beautiful healthy shine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I waited the appropriate time and applied a plastic cap (glad makes covers for bowls that work great!).  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love! !!</li>
            <li>I bought and used this on my 14-year-old daughter&#x27;s top of the shoulder length curly hair with GREAT results -</li>
            <li>works great - love the product</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t do exactly as the instructions say you can&#x27;t expect to have perfect results like I do every</li>
            <li>Again, the HSI had great reviews and I purchased it and it was adequate and good.  </li>
            <li>I realy liked it ..</li>
            <li>My comments are from my own experiences and also suggestions from professionals that have done my hair.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with my straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I loved this treatment, it was even better than the Coppola that my friend did on me.</li>
            <li>excellent product high quality</li>
            <li>The directions were very easy to follow and it was even fun!!!  </li>
            <li>It has a very very strong smell.</li>
            <li>There is a very strong odor with the treatment, so as directed, use in a well ventilated area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Magic Sleek is an amazing hair straightening treatment that does NOT contain formaldyhde.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best one!  </li>
            <li>I had Brazilian straightening many times before mostly have done my own, but the fumes of this product are unbearable.</li>
            <li>This part the process is very important so don&#x27;t rush or skip</li>
            <li>easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li>It is shiny and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>i LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I did read that the more you use the product the longer the results are and the better the results get.</li>
            <li>if i dont start to feel better</li>
            <li>This is just ok.</li>
            <li>Never worked for me I have a wavy hair followed every instructions my hair didn&#x27;t look any better.</li>
            <li>I was able to get 6 weeks out of the treatment.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>This product worked fantastic!  </li>
            <li>It even holds the curl better when I want to make waves with a curling iron.</li>
            <li>product does not work my hair dresser done it for me and followed instructions did not work at all my hair is still the same as b4 very dissapointed!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It looks so healthy</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>It deserves more.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s better to have</li>
            <li>if you do it yourself you have your hair on your face most of the time and</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>And I LOVE THE RESULTS.</li>
            <li>It has only been a week, but I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Interesting</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>really itchy on scalp!!!!</li>
            <li>also would recommend an excellent flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I waited the full 72 hours before I washed my hair and conditioned with the included conditioner and then again with my own to make sure it got plenty of remoisturizing.   </li>
            <li>You may wanna start off quick and an inch from your scalp until you get a good rythem where you feel comfortable that you won&#x27;t burn your scalp.</li>
            <li>I had a 1.5 inch Sedu which is a much better iron, but again my hair is fine</li>
            <li>I have incredibly curly hair and following the directions...</li>
            <li>great product to use in the summer months as it makes your hair manageable and its stays soft even after lots of sun and water play</li>
            <li>and you will have a great natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>b/c i love my straight hair !! :)</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>hints, wash your hair with the clarifying shampoo 3 times to make sure it&#x27;s totally clean of any residue from styling products and hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I applied this treatment about a month ago and the results are still going strong.</li>
            <li>I must say they were correct on the strong odor and your eyes watering.  </li>
            <li>Others have said it has a strong smell</li>
            <li>As for the strength of the chemicals, the fact that my hair is flat now attests to that - I experienced more burning in my eyes and throat while applying the treatment than blowdrying and flat-ironing</li>
            <li>I have already made ​​Keratin treatments on my hair and previous ones have performed better than this one, not bad but not the best on the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally fine with that.</li>
            <li>Fine color treated blond, over 50, curly in humidity.</li>
            <li>and I can not explain how wonderful it is to wake up and not have my hair with kinks in odd places and curls.  </li>
            <li>You have to follow the instructions carefully and work brilliantly.</li>
            <li>Its not stick straight, but it looks nice, and if I want it to look nicer</li>
            <li>If you wanna have your hair smooth for a month...</li>
            <li>I spent a great deal of time on this step and feel this is probably the most important step in the DIY process.  </li>
            <li>Even cheap hair dye products provide gloves.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions precisely.</li>
            <li>My hair has been fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I used sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li>Once I finished the shampoo and conditioner in the kit; I used the herbal essences smooth shampoo and conditioner b/c it gives it that smooth feel and</li>
            <li>It keeps it smooth.</li>
            <li>When I dried it, it was perfect.</li>
            <li>we used the nitrile medical gloves but any good fitting latex gloves will work)</li>
            <li>far so good.</li>
            <li>Ok... first off 5 stars does not give this justice.</li>
            <li>It takes a while, but it&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li>Remember I have very fine hair having completely straight hair</li>
            <li>Several of my friends have done the Brazilian Blowout and I loved the look of their hair, but I was way to cheap to go and get it done.  </li>
            <li>More is not better but you do need to make sure you the hair gets good coverage.  </li>
            <li>so it sat for the full 40  minutes.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even wait the full 72 hours to wash it out.  </li>
            <li>I knew my hair would not be perfectly straight, but that was ok with me.</li>
            <li>It leaves it full and glossy.</li>
            <li>I found that combing with a fine tooth comb moved the products easily, and I then applied more with my gloves to saturate the area, and then combed out the extra.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t do this treatment if I were pregnant or breastfeeding.</li>
            <li>It is a good product and it lasts a few weeks, but there are better products out there.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I have super curly frizzy hair</li>
            <li>Maybe I got lucky.</li>
            <li>the product is ok/ quick transaction</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had the treatment in for two weeks so more on how it react with new growth</li>
            <li>I have had several Keratin treatments in salons and loved them all except the first one.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and my hair is straight.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so easy now to get ready for work in morning.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to stay indoors for most of the 60 hours prior to my first wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Results:  My hair was straight, smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>This is definately worth a try.....</li>
            <li>My eyes,nose and throat were burning and I kept taking breaks to get some relief with fresh air.</li>
            <li>also want to note that I am not a licensed hairdresser, I only do my own hair.  </li>
            <li>and it feel so soft and looks so healthy.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the time and money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair feels smooth and silky all the time, doesn&#x27;t get knotted,  and my hair is stick straight right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>As I said I do feel that the flat iron is the most important part.  </li>
            <li>going to order other kits to bring back to France , I&#x27;m very happy !</li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>results are worth it though because this is a great product for anyone with 4c, african, afro-caribbean or mixed hair who want to &amp;#34;relax&amp;#34; the curl or kink of their hair without using a permanent solution.</li>
            <li>Ive had keratin tratments for several years and thought I would give this one a chance to do it myself based also in the attractive low cost.</li>
            <li>:) The extra work is so worth it</li>
            <li>Then I flat ironed at 410degF, as I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>The first time I followed the instructions and washed my hair, then dryed and then applied.  </li>
            <li>I will say first and foremost, this product DOES work.....</li>
            <li>The first time I use the Organix one from the drug store.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time at the end of August.</li>
            <li>When I first posted my review</li>
            <li>I did exactly as it says.</li>
            <li>I know exactly what i should expect.</li>
            <li>and I used exactly as the directions said to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Experience:  I regularly color my hair mostly DIY and sometimes salon.  </li>
            <li>Since this was my first application</li>
            <li>It would not matter how I styled my hair or how much product my morning hair was always a SURPRISE!</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing another bottle of just the treatment as I can still get one more use out of the shampoo, so that&#x27;s only like $30 to do another treatment!</li>
            <li>This is the first time for me i tried this IQ Keratin.</li>
            <li>First if all, i dont have curly hair.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes : my hair is soft, smooth, and straight !</li>
            <li>Your hair will get hot and you should see some \\&quot;white\\&quot; smoke.  </li>
            <li>First off, the instructions called for gloves, but didn&#x27;t provide any.</li>
            <li>here I am after the first wash....</li>
            <li>your hair is hot it will burn your fingers.</li>
            <li>With this keratin my hair is straight!</li>
            <li>was my first time using the product and also first time using a Keratin treatment</li>
            <li>It also leaves your hairy somewhat greasy the first 72 hours.  </li>
            <li>Good for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>It is very important that you have a flat iron that gets to the required 450 degrees.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work great, or last very long.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s now flat iron free!</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t put on conditioner or any other kind of product b4</li>
            <li>I realy recommend this treatment for any one wants her hair more straighter or even softer , my hair was curly but frizzy in the same time ..</li>
            <li>I just tried Kerapremium because of the great reviews , I washed my hair yesterday and can say its not nearly as good as the IQ Keratin .</li>
            <li>My gut tells me that she has very stubborn hair and that she would need to do that during that first 72 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been happier to not be able to put on a scrunchie and it not keep my hair up for too long.</li>
            <li>sure you have the correct tools, time, and a ventilated area, and you will save yourself a ton in the long run.</li>
            <li>I left the product on for 3 days prior to washing my hair, as it looked absolutely beautiful, and didn&#x27;t need a touch up, although, I did run my flat iron through it daily at 350 degrees just to make sure it was</li>
            <li>You have to be able to handle the iron and your hair at the same time at really high tempatures.  </li>
            <li>I certainly didn&#x27;t want to spend over $200 at a salon</li>
            <li>I came across this product purely by chance on the internet and decided...</li>
            <li>I love how straight it makes my hair, I cant be completely sure how long it lasts because I put in a partial weave after.</li>
            <li>I still have to spend an hour straightening it with an iron after I wash it, but it stays straight until it&#x27;s washed</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get as straight as when I went to the salon, but it was doable.  </li>
            <li>Once I coated my whole head of hair</li>
            <li>My hair is not curly, but it does get frizzy and humiditiy really takes a toll on it.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Not as straight as I would like,</li>
            <li>well as very bed odor that canot do this indoors</li>
            <li>was stick straight.  </li>
            <li>It felt like my hair had too much product.  </li>
            <li>It really worked for me.  </li>
            <li>and it had the whole package instructions an all.</li>
            <li>and I just hit it up with the blow dryer and it&#x27;s straight.  </li>
            <li>and so I was really hoping this would work.</li>
            <li>It was very sticky though.</li>
            <li>This works really well with my hair (I have afro hair)</li>
            <li>It is not poker straight</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t care because it is no longer frizzy or breaking off.</li>
            <li>And I thank her so much for it</li>
            <li>I really tried to wait 3 days</li>
            <li>I really hope this helps you out.</li>
            <li>and it really is a 2 person task.</li>
            <li>It really burned my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It lasted around two months but considering how much O was swimming over the four week holiday</li>
            <li>But afterwards, your hair is much softer and easier to manage.  </li>
            <li>It is the real thing.</li>
            <li>I have used many products and have gotten it professionally straightened and numerous keratin treatments.  </li>
            <li>My hair looked even better that when I went to a professional and it cost me only one forth of what it will cost at a hair salon.</li>
            <li>I am caucasian with thick wavy/frizzy (not in a good way) hair.  </li>
            <li>It is a good hair treatment, but it doesn&#x27;t make the hair straight if you have a thick and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>In the first week,my hair was very soft.</li>
            <li>After 25 minutes, I sectioned my hair again, and began drying it from the back, at the nape of my neck, letting only as much as could fit into my hair straightener, because I found that if you dry a section, then flat iron it immediately after, making sure to go over the area 7-10 times to make sure the product is sealed and set in</li>
            <li>I feel that the Sedu is a better Iron due to heat settings and plate design.  </li>
            <li>I tried once to dry my hair curly and it just had some very mild waves on the ends.</li>
            <li>My hair felt really soft and was drying mostly straight after the first wash.  </li>
            <li>It felt healthy, soft, manageable, and I didn&#x27;t need to blow dry my hair immediately, as I use to, or it would curl up.</li>
            <li>I made sure that I went over areas several times and tried very hard to make sure I got everything very straight.  </li>
            <li>I am able to straighten with a flat iron with limited success depending on humidity.  </li>
            <li>I have since read that if you apply too much it will look greasy during those first 48-72 hours prior to your first wash, but it is working.  </li>
            <li>Salon keratin treatments I&#x27;ve had in the past got rid of the frizz but not the volume, which I liked.  </li>
            <li>IQ Natural does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>The less you wash your hair the better and longer it lasts.</li>
            <li>Most recently using a straightener daily</li>
            <li>We had just enough of the actual keratin solution - you&#x27;ll need more if your hair is longer than my daughter&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It takes several hours to do the whole process, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I found that my second and third treatments reflected more of what I was expecting from a Keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li>Inoar is more expensive but better.</li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t work for you that means you should have had a professional or at least a friend who&#x27;s good with hair, do it for you.</li>
            <li>The hair became super straight, but  not shiny and not soft.  </li>
            <li>high quality product....</li>
            <li>I set the HSI to high 410 degrees.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suggest that if you are not use to using a flat iron that gets this hot then PRACTICE first.  </li>
            <li>I am definately buying it again, my hair is really soft and has no frizz!!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll wait until it grows out a little bit more.</li>
            <li>Then with a fine tooth comb she would comb it down straight to evenly distribute the keratin.</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy and natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It got my natural wavy hair straight, thicker, and fuller.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny for those extra hours of sleep from lack of having to do my hair.  </li>
            <li>normally it is wavy and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d definitely try it again because the results were worth it - shiny hair</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money, though and a solid intro into keratin treatments.</li>
            <li>But new growth is normal.</li>
            <li>I definitely am gettingto the end of the benefits, but it&#x27;s been right at three months since I did the treatment.</li>
            <li>then blew dry my hair and true to my hair type</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll know cuz you get your new curly hair come out from the forehead area.</li>
            <li>I could do the keratin treatment to touch up the new growth</li>
            <li>I have a huge bottle of Kerapremium but will go back to IQ because the difference so big .</li>
            <li>I normally have natural wavy hair that gets frizzy and curly as soon as I walk out into the humid weather.</li>
            <li>My hair is sooooo unbelievably soft and shinier!</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s because I left it in longer but felt wayy better!</li>
            <li>I follwed the directions exactly, but it didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product, and I&#x27;ll only need to purchase the treatment in the future, as I have a lot of shampoo &amp; conditioner left.  </li>
            <li>Since I have fine hair, I feel I lost volume, but I will have to see, how long this will last.  </li>
            <li>My hair was a icky wavy type and this stuff made my hair smooth and straight!</li>
            <li>Do not know how well the product works since the first shipment was not enough product to complete the process.</li>
            <li>I finally washed my hair, I was pleasantly surprised that my hair was pin straight!  </li>
            <li>The first time I followed the instructions to a tee and used a flat iron with a heat of 450.</li>
            <li>and I certainly will be buying / using it regularly</li>
            <li>Let me begin by telling you I have shoulder length naturally curly hair which frizzes out to a mop the minute it hits any humidity.  </li>
            <li>can get a product that I can put in much like hair dye and wash out in the same fashion....</li>
            <li>It does not burn your eyes and there is no harsh smell.</li>
            <li>This totally reminds me of dissecting a frog in high school-same smell from formaldehyde!  </li>
            <li>....value for money....and give natural look.</li>
            <li>I also am not bothered much by fumes, I did notice the fumes both in my eyes and nose, and would definitely recommend a well ventilated area when doing this process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I did not feel I could finesse the Sedu to complete the process.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve cut at least an hour out of my day, maybe more.</li>
            <li>and it is so soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so soft.</li>
            <li>After 2 washings my hair feels extremely soft, frizz and curl-free, but flatter than I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend using this product indoors if at all possible and use the gloves during the whole process.  </li>
            <li>If I use it again I will only leave it in for 24-36 hours rather than the 72 hours recommended and hopefully not lose so much volume.  </li>
            <li>Immediately my hair looked so much healthier, and was noticed by my colleagues at work the next day.</li>
            <li>my hair is straight since I put it on the last weekend of February 2015</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do it cuz I have a busy life with 3 kids,a job and a household.</li>
            <li>but IQ left my hair straighter and much much softer .</li>
            <li>You can still rock a natural twist out on the days that you want but you can switch it up with ease if you want a sleek look for a night out or just want to change your look.  </li>
            <li>My hair is as curly as it was before (which is really curly) and the amount of frizz is about the same too.  </li>
            <li>I am a professional hairstylist.</li>
            <li>A couple of notes, as it is for professional use, it doesn&#x27;t come with gloves, an applicator brush, bowl, shower cap, alligator clips (or</li>
            <li>i was excited when i got this product but now its one of my biggest regrets!!!</li>
            <li>Now my hair feels super soft, shiny and blow drying took half the time.  </li>
            <li>I only wash my hair about once a week, unless I go swimming or am particularly sweaty, etc so this may effect the results of the treatment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When people discuss the formaldehyde content in these treatments, they aren&#x27;t talking about the stinky, cloying smell that is reminiscent of dissecting frogs in high school biology classes.</li>
            <li>I actually saw a big difference in my hair, it was really shinny and soft.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s much easier, as you end up covering your entirehead section by section, and not missing an area with your flat iron if you go back and try to section it after drying completely.</li>
            <li>Originally received the wrong item but company called me and quickly shipped the correct item.</li>
            <li>I decided to spend the next 40 minutes of wait time outside as I felt very affected by the fumes.  </li>
            <li>I woke up the next day and not only was my hair extrememly straight</li>
            <li>It is true that the less you wash it the longer it will last.  </li>
            <li>especially I have long hair , now I have wavy to straight hair ..</li>
            <li>I kept putting my face near an open window as my eyes and throat were extrememly affected.  </li>
            <li>i spent the whole night up coughing and wheezing.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Keratin treatment and used it in a well ventilated area in my house, when I was drying my hair, the fumes were intolerable, my eyes were watery and I could barely breath.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research prior to choosing the IQ Natural.</li>
            <li>But just stay outside for this just in case you are sensitive to the smell b/c you have to leave it on for a while.</li>
            <li>just have a well ventilated area (create a cross breeze by opening two windows and have a fan nearby - run it directly in front to draw the fumes away from your eyes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So comb and comb your hair again to evenly distribute the product after you&#x27;ve completely applied it prior to covering with a cap.</li>
            <li>If you have never had a keratin treatment I would suggest that you have professional do it the first few times</li>
            <li>Then as you let each section down to dry, you can incorporate the already flat ironed hair with the hair you just dried, and it becomes an easy process, that is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hair is left soft (not super straight, but natural looking).</li>
            <li>I have short hair, which may have helped, but I just followed the instructions and made sure I had a flat iron that gets to at least 450 degrees.  </li>
            <li>whatever ones you like to hold each section), and you need a professional flat iron that heats up to 450 degrees.  </li>
            <li>My hair kept this smell until I washed it off in a couple of days, but even after this first double wash, I couldn&#x27;t completely get rid of it for a few days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just blow dry the new growth in the front</li>
            <li>If this only lasts a few weeks it is well worth the money</li>
            <li>I made sure to comb out any extra after applying it, prior to placing the cap on my head, as I can see where some complain that if you leave too much product on, it&#x27;s too heavy and doesn&#x27;t dry well &amp; can feel heavy, sticky or feel like it&#x27;s still damp.</li>
            <li>This is not a professional keratin hair treatment, so if you have very curly and thick hair and are expecting to get straight non frizzy hair, go to a professional beauty salon and pay whatever the fee isfot the keratin treatment</li>
            <li>Remember comb straight down.</li>
            <li>Let it hang straight down.</li>
            <li>Worked really well for a lot less than I&#x27;ve paid in the salon.</li>
            <li>Application was fairly easy except I noticed caustic fumes that irritated my throat and eyes.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical because of the mixed reviews but it came next day, very easy to use with labeled bottles and step by step directions.</li>
            <li>And I HAVE NOT FLAT IRONED MY HAIR</li>
            <li>I have left my hair to dry naturally</li>
            <li>Run the flat iron straight down your hair and keep doing it until that strand is dry completely.</li>
            <li>This product definitely worked, just not long enough.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I loved the way my hair feels.  </li>
            <li> It takes a while, and is good for a Sunday afternoon.  </li>
            <li> This is important to get the best from your treatment.  </li>
            <li> If youre looking for a good keratin treatment, search for encanto on ebay  or perhaps the keratin diamond on amazon.  </li>
            <li> b/c it smelled good too.</li>
            <li> And this is how good this product is....</li>
            <li> My hair looked really good when I used this</li>
            <li> Works great and very easy to use if you follow the directions.  </li>
            <li> It can be straightened, but it never had that beautiful healthy shine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I waited the appropriate time and applied a plastic cap (glad makes covers for bowls that work great!).  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love! !!</li>
            <li> I bought and used this on my 14-year-old daughter&#x27;s top of the shoulder length curly hair with GREAT results -</li>
            <li> works great - love the product</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t do exactly as the instructions say you can&#x27;t expect to have perfect results like I do every</li>
            <li> Again, the HSI had great reviews and I purchased it and it was adequate and good.  </li>

            <li> excellent product high quality</li>
            <li> The directions were very easy to follow and it was even fun!!!  </li>
            <li> It has a very very strong smell.</li>
            <li> There is a very strong odor with the treatment, so as directed, use in a well ventilated area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Magic Sleek is an amazing hair straightening treatment that does NOT contain formaldyhde.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best one!  </li>
            <li> I had Brazilian straightening many times before mostly have done my own, but the fumes of this product are unbearable.</li>
            <li> This part the process is very important so don&#x27;t rush or skip</li>
            <li> easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> It is shiny and looks healthy.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I did read that the more you use the product the longer the results are and the better the results get.</li>
            <li> if i dont start to feel better</li>
            <li> This is just ok.</li>
            <li> Never worked for me I have a wavy hair followed every instructions my hair didn&#x27;t look any better.</li>
            <li> I was able to get 6 weeks out of the treatment.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> This product worked fantastic!  </li>
            <li> It even holds the curl better when I want to make waves with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> product does not work my hair dresser done it for me and followed instructions did not work at all my hair is still the same as b4 very dissapointed!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It looks so healthy</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> It deserves more.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s better to have</li>
            <li> if you do it yourself you have your hair on your face most of the time and</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> And I LOVE THE RESULTS.</li>
            <li> It has only been a week, but I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Interesting</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> really itchy on scalp!!!!</li>
            <li> also would recommend an excellent flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I waited the full 72 hours before I washed my hair and conditioned with the included conditioner and then again with my own to make sure it got plenty of remoisturizing.   </li>
            <li> You may wanna start off quick and an inch from your scalp until you get a good rythem where you feel comfortable that you won&#x27;t burn your scalp.</li>
            <li> I had a 1.5 inch Sedu which is a much better iron, but again my hair is fine</li>
            <li> I have incredibly curly hair and following the directions...</li>
            <li> great product to use in the summer months as it makes your hair manageable and its stays soft even after lots of sun and water play</li>
            <li> and you will have a great natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> b/c i love my straight hair !! :)</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> hints, wash your hair with the clarifying shampoo 3 times to make sure it&#x27;s totally clean of any residue from styling products and hairspray.  </li>
            <li> I applied this treatment about a month ago and the results are still going strong.</li>
            <li> I must say they were correct on the strong odor and your eyes watering.  </li>
            <li> Others have said it has a strong smell</li>
            <li> As for the strength of the chemicals, the fact that my hair is flat now attests to that - I experienced more burning in my eyes and throat while applying the treatment than blowdrying and flat-ironing</li>
            <li> I have already made ​​Keratin treatments on my hair and previous ones have performed better than this one, not bad but not the best on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally fine with that.</li>
            <li> Fine color treated blond, over 50, curly in humidity.</li>
            <li> and I can not explain how wonderful it is to wake up and not have my hair with kinks in odd places and curls.  </li>
            <li> You have to follow the instructions carefully and work brilliantly.</li>
            <li> Its not stick straight, but it looks nice, and if I want it to look nicer</li>
            <li> If you wanna have your hair smooth for a month...</li>
            <li> I spent a great deal of time on this step and feel this is probably the most important step in the DIY process.  </li>
            <li> Even cheap hair dye products provide gloves.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions precisely.</li>
            <li> My hair has been fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I used sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li> Once I finished the shampoo and conditioner in the kit; I used the herbal essences smooth shampoo and conditioner b/c it gives it that smooth feel and</li>
            <li> It keeps it smooth.</li>
            <li> When I dried it, it was perfect.</li>
            <li> we used the nitrile medical gloves but any good fitting latex gloves will work)</li>
            <li> far so good.</li>
            <li> Ok... first off 5 stars does not give this justice.</li>
            <li> It takes a while, but it&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li> Remember I have very fine hair having completely straight hair</li>
            <li> Several of my friends have done the Brazilian Blowout and I loved the look of their hair, but I was way to cheap to go and get it done.  </li>
            <li> More is not better but you do need to make sure you the hair gets good coverage.  </li>
            <li> so it sat for the full 40  minutes.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even wait the full 72 hours to wash it out.  </li>
            <li> I knew my hair would not be perfectly straight, but that was ok with me.</li>
            <li> It leaves it full and glossy.</li>
            <li> I found that combing with a fine tooth comb moved the products easily, and I then applied more with my gloves to saturate the area, and then combed out the extra.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t do this treatment if I were pregnant or breastfeeding.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and it lasts a few weeks, but there are better products out there.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have super curly frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Maybe I got lucky.</li>
            <li> the product is ok/ quick transaction</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the treatment in for two weeks so more on how it react with new growth</li>
            <li> I have had several Keratin treatments in salons and loved them all except the first one.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and my hair is straight.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so easy now to get ready for work in morning.  </li>
            <li> and I was able to stay indoors for most of the 60 hours prior to my first wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Results:  My hair was straight, smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> This is definately worth a try.....</li>
            <li> My eyes,nose and throat were burning and I kept taking breaks to get some relief with fresh air.</li>
            <li> also want to note that I am not a licensed hairdresser, I only do my own hair.  </li>
            <li> and it feel so soft and looks so healthy.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the time and money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair feels smooth and silky all the time, doesn&#x27;t get knotted,  and my hair is stick straight right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> As I said I do feel that the flat iron is the most important part.  </li>
            <li> going to order other kits to bring back to France , I&#x27;m very happy !</li>
            <li> The price was right</li>
            <li> results are worth it though because this is a great product for anyone with 4c, african, afro-caribbean or mixed hair who want to &amp;#34;relax&amp;#34; the curl or kink of their hair without using a permanent solution.</li>
            <li> Ive had keratin tratments for several years and thought I would give this one a chance to do it myself based also in the attractive low cost.</li>
            <li> :) The extra work is so worth it</li>
            <li> Then I flat ironed at 410degF, as I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> The first time I followed the instructions and washed my hair, then dryed and then applied.  </li>
            <li> I will say first and foremost, this product DOES work.....</li>
            <li> The first time I use the Organix one from the drug store.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time at the end of August.</li>
            <li> When I first posted my review</li>
            <li> I did exactly as it says.</li>
            <li> I know exactly what i should expect.</li>
            <li> and I used exactly as the directions said to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Experience:  I regularly color my hair mostly DIY and sometimes salon.  </li>
            <li> Since this was my first application</li>
            <li> It would not matter how I styled my hair or how much product my morning hair was always a SURPRISE!</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing another bottle of just the treatment as I can still get one more use out of the shampoo, so that&#x27;s only like $30 to do another treatment!</li>
            <li> This is the first time for me i tried this IQ Keratin.</li>
            <li> First if all, i dont have curly hair.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes : my hair is soft, smooth, and straight !</li>
            <li> Your hair will get hot and you should see some \\&quot;white\\&quot; smoke.  </li>
            <li> First off, the instructions called for gloves, but didn&#x27;t provide any.</li>
            <li> here I am after the first wash....</li>
            <li> your hair is hot it will burn your fingers.</li>
            <li> With this keratin my hair is straight!</li>
            <li> was my first time using the product and also first time using a Keratin treatment</li>
            <li> It also leaves your hairy somewhat greasy the first 72 hours.  </li>
            <li> Good for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It is very important that you have a flat iron that gets to the required 450 degrees.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work great, or last very long.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s now flat iron free!</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t put on conditioner or any other kind of product b4</li>
            <li> I realy recommend this treatment for any one wants her hair more straighter or even softer , my hair was curly but frizzy in the same time ..</li>
            <li> I just tried Kerapremium because of the great reviews , I washed my hair yesterday and can say its not nearly as good as the IQ Keratin .</li>
            <li> My gut tells me that she has very stubborn hair and that she would need to do that during that first 72 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been happier to not be able to put on a scrunchie and it not keep my hair up for too long.</li>
            <li> sure you have the correct tools, time, and a ventilated area, and you will save yourself a ton in the long run.</li>
            <li> I left the product on for 3 days prior to washing my hair, as it looked absolutely beautiful, and didn&#x27;t need a touch up, although, I did run my flat iron through it daily at 350 degrees just to make sure it was</li>
            <li> You have to be able to handle the iron and your hair at the same time at really high tempatures.  </li>
            <li> I certainly didn&#x27;t want to spend over $200 at a salon</li>
            <li> I came across this product purely by chance on the internet and decided...</li>
            <li> I love how straight it makes my hair, I cant be completely sure how long it lasts because I put in a partial weave after.</li>
            <li> I still have to spend an hour straightening it with an iron after I wash it, but it stays straight until it&#x27;s washed</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get as straight as when I went to the salon, but it was doable.  </li>
            <li> Once I coated my whole head of hair</li>
            <li> My hair is not curly, but it does get frizzy and humiditiy really takes a toll on it.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Not as straight as I would like,</li>
            <li> well as very bed odor that canot do this indoors</li>
            <li> was stick straight.  </li>
            <li> It felt like my hair had too much product.  </li>
            <li> It really worked for me.  </li>
            <li> and it had the whole package instructions an all.</li>
            <li> and I just hit it up with the blow dryer and it&#x27;s straight.  </li>
            <li> and so I was really hoping this would work.</li>
            <li> It was very sticky though.</li>
            <li> This works really well with my hair (I have afro hair)</li>
            <li> It is not poker straight</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t care because it is no longer frizzy or breaking off.</li>
            <li> And I thank her so much for it</li>
            <li> I really tried to wait 3 days</li>
            <li> I really hope this helps you out.</li>
            <li> and it really is a 2 person task.</li>
            <li> It really burned my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It lasted around two months but considering how much O was swimming over the four week holiday</li>
            <li> But afterwards, your hair is much softer and easier to manage.  </li>
            <li> It is the real thing.</li>
            <li> I have used many products and have gotten it professionally straightened and numerous keratin treatments.  </li>
            <li> My hair looked even better that when I went to a professional and it cost me only one forth of what it will cost at a hair salon.</li>
            <li> I am caucasian with thick wavy/frizzy (not in a good way) hair.  </li>
            <li> It is a good hair treatment, but it doesn&#x27;t make the hair straight if you have a thick and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> In the first week,my hair was very soft.</li>
            <li> After 25 minutes, I sectioned my hair again, and began drying it from the back, at the nape of my neck, letting only as much as could fit into my hair straightener, because I found that if you dry a section, then flat iron it immediately after, making sure to go over the area 7-10 times to make sure the product is sealed and set in</li>
            <li> I feel that the Sedu is a better Iron due to heat settings and plate design.  </li>
            <li> I tried once to dry my hair curly and it just had some very mild waves on the ends.</li>
            <li> My hair felt really soft and was drying mostly straight after the first wash.  </li>
            <li> It felt healthy, soft, manageable, and I didn&#x27;t need to blow dry my hair immediately, as I use to, or it would curl up.</li>
            <li> I made sure that I went over areas several times and tried very hard to make sure I got everything very straight.  </li>
            <li> I am able to straighten with a flat iron with limited success depending on humidity.  </li>
            <li> I have since read that if you apply too much it will look greasy during those first 48-72 hours prior to your first wash, but it is working.  </li>
            <li> Salon keratin treatments I&#x27;ve had in the past got rid of the frizz but not the volume, which I liked.  </li>
            <li> IQ Natural does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> The less you wash your hair the better and longer it lasts.</li>
            <li> Most recently using a straightener daily</li>
            <li> We had just enough of the actual keratin solution - you&#x27;ll need more if your hair is longer than my daughter&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It takes several hours to do the whole process, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I found that my second and third treatments reflected more of what I was expecting from a Keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li> Inoar is more expensive but better.</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t work for you that means you should have had a professional or at least a friend who&#x27;s good with hair, do it for you.</li>
            <li> The hair became super straight, but  not shiny and not soft.  </li>
            <li> high quality product....</li>
            <li> I set the HSI to high 410 degrees.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suggest that if you are not use to using a flat iron that gets this hot then PRACTICE first.  </li>
            <li> I am definately buying it again, my hair is really soft and has no frizz!!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll wait until it grows out a little bit more.</li>
            <li> Then with a fine tooth comb she would comb it down straight to evenly distribute the keratin.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy and natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It got my natural wavy hair straight, thicker, and fuller.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny for those extra hours of sleep from lack of having to do my hair.  </li>
            <li> normally it is wavy and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d definitely try it again because the results were worth it - shiny hair</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money, though and a solid intro into keratin treatments.</li>
            <li> But new growth is normal.</li>
            <li> I definitely am gettingto the end of the benefits, but it&#x27;s been right at three months since I did the treatment.</li>
            <li> then blew dry my hair and true to my hair type</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll know cuz you get your new curly hair come out from the forehead area.</li>
            <li> I could do the keratin treatment to touch up the new growth</li>
            <li> I have a huge bottle of Kerapremium but will go back to IQ because the difference so big .</li>
            <li> I normally have natural wavy hair that gets frizzy and curly as soon as I walk out into the humid weather.</li>
            <li> My hair is sooooo unbelievably soft and shinier!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s because I left it in longer but felt wayy better!</li>
            <li> I follwed the directions exactly, but it didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product, and I&#x27;ll only need to purchase the treatment in the future, as I have a lot of shampoo &amp; conditioner left.  </li>
            <li> Since I have fine hair, I feel I lost volume, but I will have to see, how long this will last.  </li>
            <li> My hair was a icky wavy type and this stuff made my hair smooth and straight!</li>
            <li> Do not know how well the product works since the first shipment was not enough product to complete the process.</li>
            <li> I finally washed my hair, I was pleasantly surprised that my hair was pin straight!  </li>
            <li> The first time I followed the instructions to a tee and used a flat iron with a heat of 450.</li>
            <li> and I certainly will be buying / using it regularly</li>
            <li> Let me begin by telling you I have shoulder length naturally curly hair which frizzes out to a mop the minute it hits any humidity.  </li>
            <li> can get a product that I can put in much like hair dye and wash out in the same fashion....</li>
            <li> It does not burn your eyes and there is no harsh smell.</li>
            <li> This totally reminds me of dissecting a frog in high school-same smell from formaldehyde!  </li>
            <li> ....value for money....and give natural look.</li>
            <li> I also am not bothered much by fumes, I did notice the fumes both in my eyes and nose, and would definitely recommend a well ventilated area when doing this process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I did not feel I could finesse the Sedu to complete the process.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve cut at least an hour out of my day, maybe more.</li>
            <li> and it is so soft.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so soft.</li>
            <li> After 2 washings my hair feels extremely soft, frizz and curl-free, but flatter than I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend using this product indoors if at all possible and use the gloves during the whole process.  </li>
            <li> If I use it again I will only leave it in for 24-36 hours rather than the 72 hours recommended and hopefully not lose so much volume.  </li>
            <li> Immediately my hair looked so much healthier, and was noticed by my colleagues at work the next day.</li>
            <li> my hair is straight since I put it on the last weekend of February 2015</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do it cuz I have a busy life with 3 kids,a job and a household.</li>
            <li> but IQ left my hair straighter and much much softer .</li>
            <li> You can still rock a natural twist out on the days that you want but you can switch it up with ease if you want a sleek look for a night out or just want to change your look.  </li>
            <li> My hair is as curly as it was before (which is really curly) and the amount of frizz is about the same too.  </li>
            <li> I am a professional hairstylist.</li>
            <li> A couple of notes, as it is for professional use, it doesn&#x27;t come with gloves, an applicator brush, bowl, shower cap, alligator clips (or</li>
            <li> i was excited when i got this product but now its one of my biggest regrets!!!</li>
            <li> Now my hair feels super soft, shiny and blow drying took half the time.  </li>
            <li> I only wash my hair about once a week, unless I go swimming or am particularly sweaty, etc so this may effect the results of the treatment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When people discuss the formaldehyde content in these treatments, they aren&#x27;t talking about the stinky, cloying smell that is reminiscent of dissecting frogs in high school biology classes.</li>
            <li> I actually saw a big difference in my hair, it was really shinny and soft.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s much easier, as you end up covering your entirehead section by section, and not missing an area with your flat iron if you go back and try to section it after drying completely.</li>
            <li> Originally received the wrong item but company called me and quickly shipped the correct item.</li>
            <li> I decided to spend the next 40 minutes of wait time outside as I felt very affected by the fumes.  </li>
            <li> I woke up the next day and not only was my hair extrememly straight</li>
            <li> It is true that the less you wash it the longer it will last.  </li>
            <li> especially I have long hair , now I have wavy to straight hair ..</li>
            <li> I kept putting my face near an open window as my eyes and throat were extrememly affected.  </li>
            <li> i spent the whole night up coughing and wheezing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Keratin treatment and used it in a well ventilated area in my house, when I was drying my hair, the fumes were intolerable, my eyes were watery and I could barely breath.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research prior to choosing the IQ Natural.</li>
            <li> But just stay outside for this just in case you are sensitive to the smell b/c you have to leave it on for a while.</li>
            <li> just have a well ventilated area (create a cross breeze by opening two windows and have a fan nearby - run it directly in front to draw the fumes away from your eyes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So comb and comb your hair again to evenly distribute the product after you&#x27;ve completely applied it prior to covering with a cap.</li>
            <li> If you have never had a keratin treatment I would suggest that you have professional do it the first few times</li>
            <li> Then as you let each section down to dry, you can incorporate the already flat ironed hair with the hair you just dried, and it becomes an easy process, that is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hair is left soft (not super straight, but natural looking).</li>
            <li> I have short hair, which may have helped, but I just followed the instructions and made sure I had a flat iron that gets to at least 450 degrees.  </li>
            <li> whatever ones you like to hold each section), and you need a professional flat iron that heats up to 450 degrees.  </li>
            <li> My hair kept this smell until I washed it off in a couple of days, but even after this first double wash, I couldn&#x27;t completely get rid of it for a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just blow dry the new growth in the front</li>
            <li> If this only lasts a few weeks it is well worth the money</li>
            <li> I made sure to comb out any extra after applying it, prior to placing the cap on my head, as I can see where some complain that if you leave too much product on, it&#x27;s too heavy and doesn&#x27;t dry well &amp; can feel heavy, sticky or feel like it&#x27;s still damp.</li>
            <li> This is not a professional keratin hair treatment, so if you have very curly and thick hair and are expecting to get straight non frizzy hair, go to a professional beauty salon and pay whatever the fee isfot the keratin treatment</li>
            <li> Remember comb straight down.</li>
            <li> Let it hang straight down.</li>
            <li> Worked really well for a lot less than I&#x27;ve paid in the salon.</li>
            <li> Application was fairly easy except I noticed caustic fumes that irritated my throat and eyes.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the mixed reviews but it came next day, very easy to use with labeled bottles and step by step directions.</li>
            <li> And I HAVE NOT FLAT IRONED MY HAIR</li>
            <li> I have left my hair to dry naturally</li>
            <li> Run the flat iron straight down your hair and keep doing it until that strand is dry completely.</li>
            <li> This product definitely worked, just not long enough.  </li>
            <li> did it again, but didnt use the same flat iron and only used a heat of 410, it didnt last as well.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Your eyes will definitely water and burn during the treatment, especially when you are blow drying it and flat ironing it.</li>
            <li> my wife was expecting a different size botles, I think she misread the instructions , made the price a little high.    </li>
            <li> After I flat ironed it I left it in for three days like it said.</li>
            <li> Now You flat iron your hair in sections the same way you sectioned your hair at the beginning.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;re done flat ironing; do not wash until 48-72 hours later.</li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t greasy at all, I left it for 5 days rather than 3 and my curls were less tight more like deep waves when wet and drying was cut in half.</li>
            <li> and actually how long it stays in later.</li>
            <li> I then blew dry my hair using a large round brush.  </li>
            <li> AT ALL AFTER THE INITIAL FLAT IRONING!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it will last</li>
            <li> Hours\\&quot; and I used it with chi flat iron as they recommend.</li>
            <li> have a 1 inch HSI flat iron that purchased for this.  </li>
            <li> If you get up and a portion is wavy from being slept on, then just go over it with the flat iron again until straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to use the flat iron.</li>
            <li> It was easier to flat iron though.</li>
            <li> I even have a flat iron that gets 450 degrees.</li>
            <li> After 30 minutes with a 375 degree flat iron start straightening out your hair.</li>
            <li> I bought my flat iron at Walmart for like $30.</li>
            <li> Find an extension cord or something to plug the flat iron.</li>
            <li> and I washed them today; I only dry them with the hair dryer</li>
            <li> The effect lasted less than a month, though my hair is not  that curly naturally.</li>
            <li> I actually let it dry over 50%, while I did things around the house.</li>
            <li> Each section she would part in smaller sections and would put some keratin on: enough to wet the hair.</li>
            <li> I was the queen of the immediate blow dry and flat iron.</li>
            <li> , it was the shiniest and softest it has been in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Please do not buy this product if you are not a professional.  </li>
            <li> I paid NOTHING compare with others who payed $300 and had no results and it took me long time to do my hair by my self \\&quot;4</li>
            <li> The next weeks,it started to be rough.</li>
            <li> it was money well spent because I&#x27;ll definitely buy and use this product again.</li>
            <li> I brushed my wet hair out, no blow dry, no touch ups.  </li>
            <li> I have also read that if your hair does get wet you need to re flat iron it.  </li>
            <li> They put a little card with the product saying they back it 100%, but obviously they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Also be careful how close the flat iron is to your scalp.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time on my clients because it doesn&#x27;t contain formaldehyde like other similar products do.</li>
            <li> This treatment allows me to put less product in my hair, dry in 10-12 minutes  and flat iron (2 to three passes of the wand, tops) in the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> Once wait time was over I blew dry the lotion in my hair which again stirred up the fumes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even blow dry it anymore.</li>
            <li> i recommend to cover mouth and nose while doing the blow dry and the ironing phase.</li>
            <li> I bought this because i didnt like the frizz on my hair when i let it dry naturallly.</li>
            <li> If I let it air dry</li>
            <li> I can literally get out of the shower, brush it and let it air dry</li>
            <li> I washed my hair 3x in the morning and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> Yes your hair will feel dry and like a broom b/c</li>
            <li> So after my hair was completely dry, (put on some gloves-</li>
            <li> It says not to use a brush to dry your hair after using the clarifying shampoo, but I did so</li>
            <li> And do know that steam comes off every single time until that strand is dry.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a need to use a flat iron, just my regular 3 ½&amp;#34; round brush (which I also used to dry my hair during the process).  </li>
            <li> It only lasted for about a week and half maybe two weeks tops though.</li>
            <li> The smell is crazy strong with applying the keratin and drying/straightening.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it will last</li>
            <li> u ve got to be careful, soma salons are doing it wearing masks</li>
            <li> but if I should get it wet by weather or workout it would just start frizzing and curling again.  </li>
            <li> And if you look at the ingredients, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO KERATIN IN THE TREATMENT.  </li>
            <li> I was careful but not exacting.  </li>
            <li> I spent about $8 at Sally&#x27;s for a tint brush &amp; bowl, gloves, hair clamps, &amp;  plastic caps</li>
            <li> Absolutely not.</li>
            <li> If you very thick or coarse hair I would have a second person to apply it and flat iron it.  </li>
            <li> I dried my hair and then used flat iron per directions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And flat iron your hair everyday during that waiting period.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to blow dry my hair or use the flat irons for ages as was my usual procedure on washing my hair.....</li>
            <li> On the other hand, having a job and a toddler, etc, this treatment reduces the time (not to mention hair product)</li>
            <li> I use ion or other salon color and developer.  </li>
            <li> Noting prepares your for it and I&#x27;ve read other posts</li>
            <li> I am on vacation in Florida; I am French, with curly hair that become frizzly if I don&#x27;t brush them; with the humidity here , sea and pool , I become crazy with my hair; I&#x27;ve bought this product , I was a little reluctant because of the price that seems to me very low; in France it&#x27;s a lot more expensive</li>
            <li> less chemicals added compared to other product</li>
            <li> This is the only complaint I ever placed on a amazon product and let me tell you I do not regret it.  </li>
            <li> I have weird Korean hair - mostly straight but curls up in spots in the heat.</li>
            <li> I have blonde thin long hair...</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t look weird but the rest of my hair still remains straight.</li>
            <li> I find that because I can now brush my hair that I&#x27;m not leaving lots of stray hairs around the house and down the backs of my shirts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read a review of another purchaser where she breaks down the process she used to put this product on.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no reason to spend 300.$ at salon!!</li>
            <li> I got a really bad burn from the first steam when the flat iron touched my hair.</li>
            <li> I spent highschool and college hours and hours trying to tame it.</li>
            <li> And even though I actually ended up doing most of the procedure outside, on my fire escape, I thought I would die of this smell, my eyes were tearing up like crazy and it was painful even to breath.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every day and also swim, so I think you could prolong the results by washing your hair less often.  </li>
            <li> This was much less.  </li>
            <li> After I washed my hair it was less curly and frizzy, but not shiny like others said.</li>
            <li> Not worthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been less than 2 weeks since I applied this product</li>
            <li> It lasted for 4 and a half months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Caucasian and I would describe my hair as extremely frizzy, moderately curly and very thick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;dont mess with this product</li>
            <li> I have never been in the position to DECIDE if I wanted to mess with my hair</li>
            <li> Humidity makes it a mess.  </li>
            <li> and this one made my hard earned and work over hair dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> Yes my eyes burned a little.  </li>
            <li> As with any keratin treatment, any color that is or has been on the hair will be lightened a little bit.</li>
            <li> This hair treatment, however, will help you to control your frizz and it might straigten your hair just a little bit.</li>
            <li> By Hour 72 my hair was looking at little lank, so I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it and see the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the end results surpass that little detail.</li>
            <li> I just put a little bit of conditioner/moisterizer after I wash my hair in the shower and after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> A little bit time consuming</li>
            <li> This sort of likely unhealthy beauty treatment is not something I would typically indulge in.</li>
            <li> I think I was a little heavy handed during the application.  </li>
            <li> but I have been told by people who pay tons at salons that you need to do it every few months and</li>
            <li> which I was have to leave it like this for a few days</li>
            <li> Then dried my hair (I have shoulder length).  </li>
            <li> After applying I waited 25 mins, and then dried them with the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair is NEVER smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> it was MANDATORY everyday.  </li>
            <li> I also do not wash my hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> Second,when I put the product in my hair and blow dried it, it didn&#x27;t burn my eyes or throat like some people said.</li>
            <li> I blow dried my hair</li>
            <li> i am a firm defender of keratin treatments and have argued with women who say it ruined their hair... if they tried this one, it definitley did..</li>
            <li> After leaving the keratin in my hair for the designated 40 minutes, I blow dried it, then straightened the life out of it as per the instructions.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t need to wash my hair everyday, as it looks as if I just washed it, even on day 3.</li>
            <li> and I get tired to do it on the flat iron every day...</li>
            <li> After all this, my hair is stiff and opaque.</li>
            <li> It is not easy to do yourself, just like hair coloring.</li>
            <li> The only warning I have is that it stinks when you blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I have waited for 72H ( and I went to Seaworld yesterday, not good to not have hair wet!)</li>
            <li> Its still straight but started to get frizzy when its muggy, but no where near as bad as before the treatment.</li>
            <li> My hair was still curly, but not as much as usually hence the 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I am NOT satisfied.</li>
            <li> When I e-mailed them they e-mailed me back saying that I must have done it wrong, but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Even after using a different shampoo I could still vaguely smell the keratin.</li>
            <li> It usually takes me 3 hours to to a blow out from start to finish.</li>
            <li> Drying was a bit hard as the hair don&#x27;t have any conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This was hard, and also the product was sticky.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really hard to do this yourself...</li>
            <li> I have thin, a little longer than shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> After contacting the manufacturer and placing a complaint because they have a 100% satisfaction guarantee policy they basically told me tht</li>
            <li> This stuff burns like crazy and has an entirely different smell to it.</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts at least 3 months.</li>
            <li> a portrayed in some of the reviews......if you have ever used facial bleach, this is nowhere near as bad!!</li>
            <li> but I have really thick and curly hair</li>
            <li> but it didnt mean a thing until I had to experience it</li>
            <li> seriously (my sis helped me).</li>
            <li> have tried several different straightening products and this one works similar to the rest of them, I probably wont buy it again though, based solely on the fact that I have to leave this product in my hair for 24 hours and to say it smells bad and makes your hair feel disgusting is the understatement of the YEAR!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think its a little on the expensive side though.</li>
            <li> Taking out the flat iron to use on my hair is nearly impossible.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little wavy and very thin.</li>
            <li> now its next morning and im feeling so sick</li>
            <li> that was unpleasant, however, it disappeared once my hair was completely dry.</li>
            <li> and i feel weak.</li>
            <li> After doing a ton of research, I found that the worst damage I could do, would be a really hot hair straigtening</li>
            <li> I have a lot of very thick curly hair, which is just a bit longer than shoulder length and color treated.</li>
            <li> Spent the weekend (takes 24 hours) with a feeling of a lot of product in my hair but washed it out Sunday and was shocked.</li>
            <li> I could get a thin tooth comb through my hair.</li>
            <li> : it was way less painful and lasted way longer.</li>
            <li> It was not too difficult to apply, but did burn my eyes a bit.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical from reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> If you dont mind a mediocre result</li>
            <li> i did something wrong, I just followed the instructions.</li>
            <li> yes like that it will be suffocating.</li>
            <li> No need for something expensive.</li>
            <li> and it was hard to breathe!!!</li>
            <li> it is dangerous  </li>
            <li> I  recommend this product if you are looking for an alternative for an expensive brazilian blowout!</li>
            <li> They run a bad business by trying to sell a bad product.</li>
            <li> It did irritate my eyes a bit, but not to bad.</li>
            <li> The smell of the product was not as bad</li>
            <li> My eyes and throat were burning so bad</li>
            <li> I think the bad reviews are people trying to this keratin treatment alone</li>
            <li> It also smelled bad!  </li>
            <li> She was very disappointed with her hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The heat fumes in this process are horrible.</li>
            <li> But I did not like my hair was horrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Worked great, as promised, def met my exoectations! Def reduced frizz!&lt;br /&gt;Will use again..... did burn eyes and throat so finished applying and processing outside for ventilation. Absolutely no reason to spend 300.$ at salon!!</li>
            <li> Fantastico. You have to follow the instructions carefully and work brilliantly. This is my fourth purchase and recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly curly hair and following the directions...my hair is now not as curly when I wash it, but still curly. I still have to spend an hour straightening it with an iron after I wash it, but it stays straight until it&#x27;s washed or I exercise.</li>
            <li> Girls please do not buy it it is dangerous  google it: u ve got to be careful, soma salons are doing it wearing masks</li>
            <li> I used this instead of paying $250 to get a salon Brazilian blowout, and I thought it worked really good.  I have short hair, which may have helped, but I just followed the instructions and made sure I had a flat iron that gets to at least 450 degrees.  I used it about 4 weeks ago, and my hair is just starting to get wavy again.  I wash my hair every day and also swim, so I think you could prolong the results by washing your hair less often.  All in all I thought it gave me a good result and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this and used it for about 4-treatments.  I am african american and for my hair it lasts about a month.  It doesn&#x27;t get as straight as when I went to the salon, but it was doable.  I don&#x27;t like the idea of using this every month and have purchased another product.  The first time I followed the instructions and washed my hair, then dryed and then applied.  It only lasted about 3 weeks.  The 2nd, 3rd &amp; 4th time, I did it like my salon and applied it after I rinsed out the shampoo and then dryed my hair.  These lasted longer, but I have ordered another product to see if it will last longer (3-months like the salon).</li>
            <li> Let me begin by telling you I have shoulder length naturally curly hair which frizzes out to a mop the minute it hits any humidity.  I spent highschool and college hours and hours trying to tame it. Most recently using a straightener daily but if I should get it wet by weather or workout it would just start frizzing and curling again.  And yes, I have tried leave in products that promise no frizz.  I was going to ask a friend to help me apply the mixture and straighten my hair with the straightener but no one was avaialble so I did it myself.  Here&#x27;s what happened:  Application was fairly easy except I noticed caustic fumes that irritated my throat and eyes.  Once I coated my whole head of hair I decided to spend the next 40 minutes of wait time outside as I felt very affected by the fumes.  Once wait time was over I blew dry the lotion in my hair which again stirred up the fumes.  I kept putting my face near an open window as my eyes and throat were extrememly affected.  I then partitioned my hair as directed and used my straightener at 450 degrees.  I made sure that I went over areas several times and tried very hard to make sure I got everything very straight.  During this procedure my hair did give off smoke and fumes and at times caused me to need to put a towel over my face.  Still....I was almost done.  I waited the full 72 hours before I washed my hair and conditioned with the included conditioner and then again with my own to make sure it got plenty of remoisturizing.   I brushed my wet hair out, no blow dry, no touch ups.  I woke up the next day and not only was my hair extrememly straight, it was the shiniest and softest it has been in a long time.  I went to work and even got comments.  I don&#x27;t know how long it will last but if it lasts 2 months I may suffer the process again.  I have had my hair straightened in the salon with the Japanese process and it took a year to overcome the damage and took $200 out of my pocket. This was much less.  I would recomend wearing a scarf or mask over your mouth and nose to avoid the fumes, though.</li>
            <li> Please do not buy this product if you are not a professional.  I followed the directions as was instructed by the manufacturer and it did not work.  After applying the product it ask you to blow out your hair you can not because it so sticky that you couldn&#x27;t possibly go out with your hair looking like that.  This is the only complaint I ever placed on a amazon product and let me tell you I do not regret it.  After contacting the manufacturer and placing a complaint because they have a 100% satisfaction guarantee policy they basically told me tht I am out of luck.</li>
            <li> My hair looks like a mushroom during the summer, spring and fall. It is frizzy and does not shine at all. I have to straighten my hair every day and it stills puffs up by the afternoon. I did this treatment 3 weeks ago and my hair looks great. It is shiny and looks healthy. I don&#x27;t even blow dry it anymore. It is amazing! I am so happy with the results! All my friends and my family are ordering this product. I am using conditioner with keratin and organic shampoo for hair treated with keratin. I left it on my hair for 30 hours.</li>
            <li> Several of my friends have done the Brazilian Blowout and I loved the look of their hair, but I was way to cheap to go and get it done.  My hair is not curly, but it does get frizzy and humiditiy really takes a toll on it.  I used this product like the directions said and my hair looks great.  It is not frizzy at all, and I will not even need to fix it.  I hope it lasts three months and I&#x27;m going to go out and buy the shampoo and conditioner to try to make it last longer.  This is definately worth a try.....I am loving it!</li>
            <li> I will say first and foremost, this product DOES work.....HOWEVER. I don&#x27;t care if you are in a well ventilated area or not, you are going to smell up everything annnnd when you&#x27;re blow drying your hair for the next couple days the product seems to still be in your hair and my goodness does it ever burn your eyes!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several different straightening products and this one works similar to the rest of them, I probably wont buy it again though, based solely on the fact that I have to leave this product in my hair for 24 hours and to say it smells bad and makes your hair feel disgusting is the understatement of the YEAR!&lt;br /&gt;I can get a product that I can put in much like hair dye and wash out in the same fashion....on the same day.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work!!! I followed the instructions to a t!  I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to straighten my hair either, I just wanted it to take the frizz away.  No such luck, it didn&#x27;t even last through one shampoo.  And if you look at the ingredients, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO KERATIN IN THE TREATMENT.  Just mineral oil, silicones and the like.  No wonder it didn&#x27;t work.  I want my money back.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this product. My hair was a icky wavy type and this stuff made my hair smooth and straight! Its not stick straight, but it looks nice, and if I want it to look nicer i just take the straightener up to it. There was no way I was going to pay $250 plus at a salon to get this done.    The only con is having to leave in in your hair for 3 days. I showered after 2 1/2 cause my hair looked gross so do it during a time where you wont see anyone. Also go but specialized shampoo/conditioner it makes it last longer. may i recommend ion sold at a sally&#x27;s beauty supply.</li>
            <li> This is my second attempt at an at-home keratin treatment. The first time I use the Organix one from the drug store. That one did remove some frizz but not enough to warrant using it again.&lt;br /&gt;This product, however, is like a miracle treatment for us frizzy, curly-headed folks. I&#x27;m Caucasian and I would describe my hair as extremely frizzy, moderately curly and very thick. It is long--to about my should blades currently. I applied this treatment about a month ago and the results are still going strong. I only wash my hair about once a week, unless I go swimming or am particularly sweaty, etc so this may effect the results of the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;My frizz is essentially gone, as are about 95% of my curls. I tried once to dry my hair curly and it just had some very mild waves on the ends. I&#x27;m totally fine with that. I find that because I can now brush my hair that I&#x27;m not leaving lots of stray hairs around the house and down the backs of my shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The con(s) are definitely the smell and any health issues that may result from this product. The smell is crazy strong with applying the keratin and drying/straightening. My eyes,nose and throat were burning and I kept taking breaks to get some relief with fresh air. This sort of likely unhealthy beauty treatment is not something I would typically indulge in. When people discuss the formaldehyde content in these treatments, they aren&#x27;t talking about the stinky, cloying smell that is reminiscent of dissecting frogs in high school biology classes. This stuff burns like crazy and has an entirely different smell to it. I wouldn&#x27;t do this treatment if I were pregnant or breastfeeding. On the other hand, having a job and a toddler, etc, this treatment reduces the time (not to mention hair product) I spend on my hair by probably 90%. It&#x27;s definitely a trade-off but I will likely do it again next summer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 month update:&lt;br /&gt;I still have reduced curls 3 months after treatment. I definitely am gettingto the end of the benefits, but it&#x27;s been right at three months since I did the treatment. Like I said previously, I only wash my hair about once a week. I forgot to mention that I also use the &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10&#x27; keratin leave-in treatment. That may also help to prolong results. I definitely plan to use this stuff again, although, I will likely try to plan to apply it outdoors to minimize the issues with the fumes/smell, etc.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time at the end of August. I actually saw a big difference in my hair, it was really shinny and soft. It reduced the frizziness of the hair and it doesn&#x27;t get as puffy as it did before. But the results only lasted about 3 weeks and the product says that the results could last up to 3 months. I did read that the more you use the product the longer the results are and the better the results get. So we&#x27;ll see how it goes. I  recommend this product if you are looking for an alternative for an expensive brazilian blowout!</li>
            <li> my wife was expecting a different size botles, I think she misread the instructions , made the price a little high.    thanks</li>
            <li> It is a good product and it lasts a few weeks, but there are better products out there.&lt;br /&gt;This one is good for its price.</li>
            <li> My post Chemo hair (one year out) is shiny and looks great. Not as straight as I would like, but I have been told by people who pay tons at salons that you need to do it every few months and it is cumulative and keeps getting straighter and lasting longer.</li>
            <li> I realy recommend this treatment for any one wants her hair more straighter or even softer , my hair was curly but frizzy in the same time .. and I get tired to do it on the flat iron every day... especially I have long hair , now I have wavy to straight hair .. I realy liked it .. and I just used 2oz bottel treatment and I bought it from another site of $25 and it have the shampoo and the conditioner also ...I paid NOTHING compare with others who payed $300 and had no results and it took me long time to do my hair by my self \\&quot;4 Hours\\&quot; and I used it with chi flat iron as they recommend.</li>
            <li> Magic Sleek is an amazing hair straightening treatment that does NOT contain formaldyhde. My hair looks smoother, shinier, and healthier. It does not burn your eyes and there is no harsh smell. Salons are located across the country.</li>
            <li> Originally received the wrong item but company called me and quickly shipped the correct item. Do not know how well the product works since the first shipment was not enough product to complete the process.</li>
            <li> i was excited when i got this product but now its one of my biggest regrets!!! as soon as i started to blow-dry and iron my hair after the keratin application my eyes started burning and it was hard to breathe!!! i even had a mask on!!! i spent the whole night up coughing and wheezing. now its next morning and im feeling so sick, i cant stop coughing and i feel weak. there is no danger or cation with this product!!!!! if i dont start to feel better i might have to go to the ER!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This totally reminds me of dissecting a frog in high school-same smell from formaldehyde!  I did this on my deck since the reviews talked about the fumes so I figured to do it outside. It didn&#x27;t matter- my eyes , nose and throat burned. My hair was still curly, but not as much as usually hence the 2 stars. Dont Buy this stuff-it&#x27;s definitely a HEALTH HAZARD!</li>
            <li> Result vanished within a month. I don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> I purchased this Keratin treatment and used it in a well ventilated area in my house, when I was drying my hair, the fumes were intolerable, my eyes were watery and I could barely breath. i recommend to cover mouth and nose while doing the blow dry and the ironing phase. After all this, my hair is stiff and opaque.</li>
            <li> When I first posted my review I was lovung this product because it was a short time after I applied it. But now, 6 weeks later, I can not say the same. It did&#x27;t last!! Even a month!! And dont tell me that \\&quot;I didnt do it right\\&quot; because I did. I did exactly as it says. And didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve been doing the Brazilian Keratin in my hair for years. I know exactly what i should expect. I am NOT satisfied. If you wanna have your hair smooth for a month...Buy it.</li>
            <li> literly rouind my hair. I used it with my hair dresser and the loiton became like dust on my hair which I was have to leave it like this for a few days&lt;br /&gt;as well as very bed odor that canot do this indoors&lt;br /&gt;after a few month i can see it really demaged my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dont mess with this product</li>
            <li> easy to use and effective. hair is left soft (not super straight, but natural looking). only needs to stay for 24 hours and it works just as well as the one I leave for 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;definitely buying again!</li>
            <li> I have already made ​​Keratin treatments on my hair and previous ones have performed better than this one, not bad but not the best on the market. really itchy on scalp!!!!</li>
            <li> very nice product....no fumes or vapor... very good result....high quality product....less chemicals added compared to other product....value for money....and give natural look.</li>
            <li> This is just ok. It didn&#x27;t work great, or last very long. Maybe 2-3 weeks and I used exactly as the directions said to.</li>
            <li> I applied it on Sunday.  I used as directed, with a couple of deviations.  I washed it 3 times with the clarifying shampoo.  Then dried my hair (I have shoulder length).  Drying was a bit hard as the hair don&#x27;t have any conditioner.  Then I applied the keratin treatment.  Yes my eyes burned a little.  I needed to open the windows. It didn&#x27;t bother my throat.  It also smelled bad!  After applying I waited 25 mins, and then dried them with the blow dryer. This was hard, and also the product was sticky.  Then I flat ironed at 410degF, as I have very fine hair and also I only used it for 5 times , instead of 7-10 times as recommended.  The hair became super straight, but  not shiny and not soft.  They felt sticky.  I waited 24 hours and washed them today.  Now my hair feels super soft, shiny and blow drying took half the time.  Since I have fine hair, I feel I lost volume, but I will have to see, how long this will last.  Except for the smell, fumes and sticky feeling, the product works.</li>
            <li> I purchased this produce based on both research and price.  I had had a keratin treatment done by my beautician, it smelled of chocolate.  She explained that I should not wash my hair for 24 hours and not to use a sulfate shampoo.  I waited the 24 hours and thought that my shampoo was non sulfate.  The results were mixed it did seem to improve my hair but not like the reviews that I read, it seemed only last only a couple of weeks. Overall, I felt it was a process that I could attempt at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still wanted to pursuit this process.  I researched and watched youtube videos and after reading amazon reviews purchased this system.  I did look at lumeire and may try that next based on this experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Hair type:  Fine color treated blond, over 50, curly in humidity. I am able to straighten with a flat iron with limited success depending on humidity.  It always seem to have fly aways or frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experience:  I regularly color my hair mostly DIY and sometimes salon.  I use ion or other salon color and developer.  Understand basic coloring and conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experience with product: I read the product instructions and instructions that I found on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair 3 times with a clarifying shampoo.  It gives you different number of washings based on your hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then blew dry my hair and true to my hair type it was fly away and poofy with snarls that took time to comb out to minimize damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then sectioned my hair and applied the product.  Since this was my first application I think I was a little heavy handed during the application.  I was careful but not exacting.  I am not a beautician so my style lacks a lot of finesse.  I also am not bothered much by fumes, I did notice the fumes both in my eyes and nose, and would definitely recommend a well ventilated area when doing this process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited the appropriate time and applied a plastic cap (glad makes covers for bowls that work great!).  I then blew dry my hair using a large round brush.  Remember I have very fine hair having completely straight hair is kinda scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a 1 inch HSI flat iron that purchased for this.  I had a 1.5 inch Sedu which is a much better iron, but again my hair is fine and I did not feel I could finesse the Sedu to complete the process.  (My step daughter is now the happy owner of my Sedu). I set the HSI to high 410 degrees.  I spent a great deal of time on this step and feel this is probably the most important step in the DIY process.  The product is heat activated.  I sectioned my hair and went over the smallest sections of hair that I could manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was done my hair was stick straight.  It felt like my hair had too much product.  I have since read that if you apply too much it will look greasy during those first 48-72 hours prior to your first wash, but it is working.  I applied this on a Thursday, my husband was going away the weekend and I was able to stay indoors for most of the 60 hours prior to my first wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:  My hair was straight, smooth and shiny.  Some of you may say.... soo what!  My hair is NEVER smooth and shiny.  It can be straightened, but it never had that beautiful healthy shine.  It has been over a month and I can not explain how wonderful it is to wake up and not have my hair with kinks in odd places and curls.  It would not matter how I styled my hair or how much product my morning hair was always a SURPRISE! I have never been in the position to DECIDE if I wanted to mess with my hair it was MANDATORY everyday.  I highly recommend the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations:  Read the product and watch videos it will alleviate some apprehension.  If you very thick or coarse hair I would have a second person to apply it and flat iron it.  As I said I do feel that the flat iron is the most important part.  I read a review that stated that when she went into the rainy day it seem to frizz even while she used an umbrella.  I have also read that if your hair does get wet you need to re flat iron it.  My gut tells me that she has very stubborn hair and that she would need to do that during that first 72 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also would recommend an excellent flat iron.  Again, the HSI had great reviews and I purchased it and it was adequate and good.  I feel that the Sedu is a better Iron due to heat settings and plate design.  If you have coarse hair you must consider that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps and enjoy great hair!!</li>
            <li> Never worked for me I have a wavy hair followed every instructions my hair didn&#x27;t look any better. I want a refund!</li>
            <li> It straightened my hair good without drying it out!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love! !! I have weird Korean hair - mostly straight but curls up in spots in the heat. I was the queen of the immediate blow dry and flat iron. Spent the weekend (takes 24 hours) with a feeling of a lot of product in my hair but washed it out Sunday and was shocked. My hair feels smooth and silky all the time, doesn&#x27;t get knotted,  and my hair is stick straight right out of the shower.  Not sure how long it will last but it&#x27;s been a week and I&#x27;ve cut at least an hour out of my day, maybe more. And my hair looks and feels healthier!  When the curls come back I&#x27;m buying again!  Now my daughters want it!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I ordered this.  I must say they were correct on the strong odor and your eyes watering.  BUT... I will order this one again.  I loved the way my hair feels.  I have very frizzy and natural curly hair.  It really worked for me.  I have thin, a little longer than shoulder length hair.  I did this process without any help.</li>
            <li> I used it and now I&#x27;m bald.</li>
            <li> The best treatment ever.</li>
            <li> My only compliant is that I didn&#x27;t feel like it lasted anywhere close to 3 months. I was able to get 6 weeks out of the treatment. I normally have natural wavy hair that gets frizzy and curly as soon as I walk out into the humid weather. Its still straight but started to get frizzy when its muggy, but no where near as bad as before the treatment. This product definitely worked, just not long enough.  The price was right that&#x27;s for sure. I certainly didn&#x27;t want to spend over $200 at a salon and I feel I got the same results as my friend. Your eyes will definitely water and burn during the treatment, especially when you are blow drying it and flat ironing it. I will be purchasing another bottle of just the treatment as I can still get one more use out of the shampoo, so that&#x27;s only like $30 to do another treatment!</li>
            <li> I bought this online after spending $350 at the salon for a Keratin treatment.  After doing a ton of research, I found that the worst damage I could do, would be a really hot hair straigtening so I decided to give it a shot.  This product worked fantastic!  It got my natural wavy hair straight, thicker, and fuller.  I don&#x27;t even have to blowdry it.  It takes a while, and is good for a Sunday afternoon.  It&#x27;s worth every penny for those extra hours of sleep from lack of having to do my hair.  It even holds the curl better when I want to make waves with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> This is the first time for me i tried this IQ Keratin.In the first week,my hair was very soft.The next weeks,it started to be rough.I will give it 5 out of 10.I think it is for a month only.</li>
            <li> I bought and used this on my 14-year-old daughter&#x27;s top of the shoulder length curly hair with GREAT results - she&#x27;s now flat iron free! I spent about $8 at Sally&#x27;s for a tint brush &amp; bowl, gloves, hair clamps, &amp;  plastic caps so I could apply, distribute, and use the product correctly - it was money well spent because I&#x27;ll definitely buy and use this product again. We had just enough of the actual keratin solution - you&#x27;ll need more if your hair is longer than my daughter&#x27;s. It takes several hours to do the whole process, but it&#x27;s worth it. As with any keratin treatment, any color that is or has been on the hair will be lightened a little bit.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair so beautiful. Ladies if you have any type of curl, use this. This product is a heaven sent. It not only knows of the curl, but leaves your hair healthier and shinier than before. Just follow the directions to perfection.</li>
            <li> excellent product high quality</li>
            <li> First if all, i dont have curly hair. My hair is a little wavy and very thin. I bought this because i didnt like the frizz on my hair when i let it dry naturallly. This is not a professional keratin hair treatment, so if you have very curly and thick hair and are expecting to get straight non frizzy hair, go to a professional beauty salon and pay whatever the fee isfot the keratin treatment This hair treatment, however, will help you to control your frizz and it might straigten your hair just a little bit. Thats why i gave it a 4 out if 5. I am definately buying it again, my hair is really soft and has no frizz!! I loved it!</li>
            <li> Worked really well for a lot less than I&#x27;ve paid in the salon. It was not too difficult to apply, but did burn my eyes a bit. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair sticky and oily looking. It has a very very strong smell.&#x27;they also mention an &amp;#34;application brush&amp;#34; that isn&#x27;t included in the package</li>
            <li> I am on vacation in Florida; I am French, with curly hair that become frizzly if I don&#x27;t brush them; with the humidity here , sea and pool , I become crazy with my hair; I&#x27;ve bought this product , I was a little reluctant because of the price that seems to me very low; in France it&#x27;s a lot more expensive and I got once keratin in a salon for 300 euros;&lt;br /&gt;BUT it works ! I have waited for 72H ( and I went to Seaworld yesterday, not good to not have hair wet!) and I washed them today; I only dry them with the hair dryer and I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes : my hair is soft, smooth, and straight ! I can&#x27;t stop touch them, it&#x27;s amazing !&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to order other kits to bring back to France , I&#x27;m very happy !</li>
            <li> I have used a few brazilian products and i have to say i really like this and it had the whole package instructions an all.</li>
            <li> product does not work my hair dresser done it for me and followed instructions did not work at all my hair is still the same as b4 very dissapointed!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Ive done this twice. The first time I followed the instructions to a tee and used a flat iron with a heat of 450. Worked awesome for about 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I did it again, but didnt use the same flat iron and only used a heat of 410, it didnt last as well.&lt;br /&gt;For the cash strapped, I would toally use this product. And yes, your hair will omit a fume and even &#x27;smoke&#x27;. However, my hair does that when I spend $150 at the salon.</li>
            <li> I have had several Keratin treatments in salons and loved them all except the first one.  I found that my second and third treatments reflected more of what I was expecting from a Keratin treatment.  So after watching the process I decided that this is something I can do myself and after reading several reviews purchased the IQ Keratin Treatment.  It is very important that you have a flat iron that gets to the required 450 degrees.  If you don&#x27;t then don&#x27;t be upset if it doesn&#x27;t turn out.  I suggest that if you are not use to using a flat iron that gets this hot then PRACTICE first.  You have to be able to handle the iron and your hair at the same time at really high tempatures.  Your hair will get hot and you should see some \\&quot;white\\&quot; smoke.  Don&#x27;t panic! It means the keratin treatment is processing.  Now it is a bit smelly and my eyes did water a bit so ventilation is key.  This part the process is very important so don&#x27;t rush or skip it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you apply the treatment, don&#x27;t over do it.  I used the brush to get the treatment on the hair sections.  I also used my fingers to help saturate hair section and then comb through several times. More is not better but you do need to make sure you the hair gets good coverage.  So take your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let the treatment sit for 40 minutes, it says 30-40 but I have really thick and curly hair so it sat for the full 40  minutes.  I dried my hair and then used flat iron per directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the treatment in for 72 hours.  It says 24-72 but 72 is best.  If you get up and a portion is wavy from being slept on, then just go over it with the flat iron again until straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair using shampoo made for keratin treatments and then used the conditioner that came with the kit.  I use shampoo and conditioner for hair that is treated with keratin.  This is important to get the best from your treatment.  I also do not wash my hair everyday.  It is true that the less you wash it the longer it will last.  I exercise 6 times per week and wash my hair 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to note that I am not a licensed hairdresser, I only do my own hair.  My comments are from my own experiences and also suggestions from professionals that have done my hair.  If you have never had a keratin treatment I would suggest that you have professional do it the first few times so you can learn the process and have conversations about the process.  I will use this product again and recommended it to a couple of friends.</li>
            <li> its not even enough for one person, not as described</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and my hair is straight.  The biggest problem with this product is the chemical burns.  My eyes watered the entire time.  I would recommend someone else apply the product.  It&#x27;s been 3 weeks now and I just hit it up with the blow dryer and it&#x27;s straight.  I had very short curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have super curly frizzy hair and so I was really hoping this would work. First off, the instructions called for gloves, but didn&#x27;t provide any. Even cheap hair dye products provide gloves. Second,when I put the product in my hair and blow dried it, it didn&#x27;t burn my eyes or throat like some people said. Maybe I got lucky. It was very sticky though. After I flat ironed it I left it in for three days like it said. After I washed my hair it was less curly and frizzy, but not shiny like others said. I blow dried my hair and it was still frizzy, so I had to use the flat iron. It was easier to flat iron though. It only lasted for about a week and half maybe two weeks tops though. When I e-mailed them they e-mailed me back saying that I must have done it wrong, but I didn&#x27;t. I followed the directions precisely. I even have a flat iron that gets 450 degrees. When I told them that they didn&#x27;t e-mail me back. Do I think I got ripped off? Yes. Would I ever buy it again? Absolutely not. They put a little card with the product saying they back it 100%, but obviously they don&#x27;t. They run a bad business by trying to sell a bad product.</li>
            <li> I have blonde thin long hair... If I let it air dry normally it is wavy and frizzy.  I have used many products and have gotten it professionally straightened and numerous keratin treatments.  This is by far the best one!  I can literally get out of the shower, brush it and let it air dry and it is perfect.  It looks so healthy and it is so soft.  It also helps because now Im not using a blow dryer and straightening iron every day damaging my hair!  This is something I will be using all of the time.  I didn&#x27;t even wait the full 72 hours to wash it out.  I waited about 36 hours and was so happy with the results...  The directions were very easy to follow and it was even fun!!!  It has been about a week now since I did the treatment and this week has been humid and rainy.  My hair has been fabulous.  I am very excited for this product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a liscened hair dresser and I know bout the procedure for doing this n I followed the directions n my client does not like it&lt;br /&gt; She was very disappointed with her hair. The hair in her nape and some on the sides is still wavy.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research prior to choosing the IQ Natural. I was a bit skeptical from reading the reviews. I received my product on a Thursday. I did it that night. It took me about 2 hours. It did irritate my eyes a bit, but not to bad. I waited the 72 hours to wash. I used sulfate free shampoo and conditioner. I was very happy with the results. I knew my hair would not be perfectly straight, but that was ok with me. It took about 10 min to do my hair vs 20. My hair is so soft. I will use this product again. I hope it lasts at least 3 months.</li>
            <li> Good for a few weeks. If you dont mind a mediocre result it&#x27;s OK. Ive had keratin tratments for several years and thought I would give this one a chance to do it myself based also in the attractive low cost. Not worthy. Will try something else.</li>
            <li> and this one made my hard earned and work over hair dry and brittle.  I do not recommend this product.  If youre looking for a good keratin treatment, search for encanto on ebay  or perhaps the keratin diamond on amazon.  this is not a plug in. i am a firm defender of keratin treatments and have argued with women who say it ruined their hair... if they tried this one, it definitley did..</li>
            <li> This works really well with my hair (I have afro hair) I love how straight it makes my hair, I cant be completely sure how long it lasts because I put in a partial weave after. I think its a little on the expensive side though.</li>
            <li> The effect lasted less than a month, though my hair is not  that curly naturally. And even though I actually ended up doing most of the procedure outside, on my fire escape, I thought I would die of this smell, my eyes were tearing up like crazy and it was painful even to breath. My hair kept this smell until I washed it off in a couple of days, but even after this first double wash, I couldn&#x27;t completely get rid of it for a few days. I don&#x27;t know it i did something wrong, I just followed the instructions. Probably won&#x27;t buy ever again. I did this procedure in the salon twice before and I am probably sticking to the salon in the future: it was way less painful and lasted way longer.</li>
            <li> I am caucasian with thick wavy/frizzy (not in a good way) hair.  Humidity makes it a mess.  Salon keratin treatments I&#x27;ve had in the past got rid of the frizz but not the volume, which I liked.  This product took out a lot of volume as well as frizz.  After 2 washings my hair feels extremely soft, frizz and curl-free, but flatter than I&#x27;m used to.  I&#x27;m inspired to write this to let people know that it will take away curl and frizz, but you if you have volume that you like it might take it away too.  As for the strength of the chemicals, the fact that my hair is flat now attests to that - I experienced more burning in my eyes and throat while applying the treatment than blowdrying and flat-ironing and I did it outside.  I would not recommend using this product indoors if at all possible and use the gloves during the whole process.  If I use it again I will only leave it in for 24-36 hours rather than the 72 hours recommended and hopefully not lose so much volume.  Additionally, when I weighed out 2 oz from the bottle of keratin treatment, I found out that there was really only 3 oz total in it.  2 oz was enough for my bob-length hair.</li>
            <li> great product to use in the summer months as it makes your hair manageable and its stays soft even after lots of sun and water play</li>
            <li> works great - love the product</li>
            <li> I was at the end of the road with my hair......over processed over coloured dyed straightened....hadn&#x27;t helped recently by going through that time of life when all the moisture seemed to be sucked out of my body.I decided it was one last chance at something to save it or have it all cut off. I came across this product purely by chance on the internet and decided...what the hell.....I have tried every straightening product on the market to date and thrown a lot of money at it over the years. Let&#x27;s see if this is any different. The package took about a week to arrive after ordering....I followed the instructions to the letter. It was quite a trial applying the keratin treatment to the back of my hair but a mirror front and back did help.The smell of the product was not as bad a portrayed in some of the reviews......if you have ever used facial bleach, this is nowhere near as bad!! After leaving the keratin in my hair for the designated 40 minutes, I blow dried it, then straightened the life out of it as per the instructions.Immediately my hair looked so much healthier, and was noticed by my colleagues at work the next day. By Hour 72 my hair was looking at little lank, so I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it and see the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here I am after the first wash....I am AMAZED!! I didn&#x27;t have to blow dry my hair or use the flat irons for ages as was my usual procedure on washing my hair.....I have left my hair to dry naturally and it feel so soft and looks so healthy.It is not poker straight but I really don&#x27;t care because it is no longer frizzy or breaking off.If this only lasts a few weeks it is well worth the money and I certainly will be buying / using it regularly</li>
            <li> I had Brazilian straightening many times before mostly have done my own, but the fumes of this product are unbearable. My eyes and throat were burning so bad ( I had a mask and glasses on) I had to run out to my back yard and continue the process outdoors.Will not use this product again.</li>
            <li> Ok... first off 5 stars does not give this justice. It deserves more. I absolutely love, love, love this product. It has done miracles with my hair. I read a review of another purchaser where she breaks down the process she used to put this product on. And I thank her so much for it b/c the packaging doesn&#x27;t give you that info. But I wouldn&#x27;t take stars off b/c the end results surpass that little detail. You can always Google on how to put it on and you can see videos on youtube. What I did: definitely get someone else to help you b/c it&#x27;s really hard to do this yourself...seriously (my sis helped me). I washed my hair 3x in the morning and let it air dry. Yes your hair will feel dry and like a broom b/c you can&#x27;t put on conditioner or any other kind of product b4 you put the keratin on. Others have said it has a strong smell and yes it does but only when you have your hair close to your face. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s better to have someone else do it b/c if you do it yourself you have your hair on your face most of the time and yes like that it will be suffocating. Otherwise it has no smell If you keep your hair out of the way. And the peron doing it also doesnt smell it b/c its not on their face either. But to be cautious seek a well ventilated area. We used her porch. ok. So after my hair was completely dry, (put on some gloves- we used the nitrile medical gloves but any good fitting latex gloves will work) my sis parted my hair in 6 sections- 2 in the fron, 2 in the middle, 2 in the back.. My hair is waist length. We started from the back. Each section she would part in smaller sections and would put some keratin on: enough to wet the hair. Then with a fine tooth comb she would comb it down straight to evenly distribute the keratin. Remember comb straight down. Do this until all the hair is done. Don&#x27;t pin it up or anything. Let it hang straight down. But just stay outside for this just in case you are sensitive to the smell b/c you have to leave it on for a while. I left it on for 30 min. Don&#x27;t over do this part. And don&#x27;t wash it off! That&#x27;s important. After 30 minutes with a 375 degree flat iron start straightening out your hair. I bought my flat iron at Walmart for like $30. It had the degrees I was looking for and did the job. No need for something expensive. For this part I cannot stress enough to do it outside. Find an extension cord or something to plug the flat iron. The heat fumes in this process are horrible. Use a face mask if need be. Trust me. Now You flat iron your hair in sections the same way you sectioned your hair at the beginning. Run the flat iron straight down your hair and keep doing it until that strand is dry completely. Becareful.... your hair is hot it will burn your fingers. Also be careful how close the flat iron is to your scalp. The heat steam is hotter than I thought. I got a really bad burn from the first steam when the flat iron touched my hair. You may wanna start off quick and an inch from your scalp until you get a good rythem where you feel comfortable that you won&#x27;t burn your scalp. Cuz steam burn hurts. And do know that steam comes off every single time until that strand is dry. Then it doesn&#x27;t steam anymore. Once you&#x27;re done flat ironing; do not wash until 48-72 hours later. This helps the keratin penetrate into your hair. And flat iron your hair everyday during that waiting period. Keep in mind that your hair will stink, not smell but stink. I really tried to wait 3 days but I couldn&#x27;t handle the smell anymore. I washed my hair after 2 days. Use the shampoo and conditioner in the kit. I washed my hair maybe once or twice a week using the shampoo and conditioner in the kit. Beware** your hair will have a funky smell for a couple of days depending on how often you wash. I had that smell for about 2 weeks. Once I finished the shampoo and conditioner in the kit; I used the herbal essences smooth shampoo and conditioner b/c it gives it that smooth feel and b/c it smelled good too. Even after using a different shampoo I could still vaguely smell the keratin. But soon after it went away. I still only wash once or twice a week. And I LOVE THE RESULTS. My hair is frizzy, curly and unruly. With this keratin my hair is straight! I&#x27;ve never been happier to not be able to put on a scrunchie and it not keep my hair up for too long. And this is how good this product is.... my hair is straight since I put it on the last weekend of February 2015 and I&#x27;m doing this review on May 5th 2015. And I HAVE NOT FLAT IRONED MY HAIR AT ALL AFTER THE INITIAL FLAT IRONING!!! I don&#x27;t do it cuz I have a busy life with 3 kids,a job and a household. Taking out the flat iron to use on my hair is nearly impossible. You can if you want to and have the time. I don&#x27;t but my hair doesn&#x27;t need it. I just put a little bit of conditioner/moisterizer after I wash my hair in the shower and after I get out of the shower. It keeps it smooth. The only thing I must let you know is that once your hair starts growing out you&#x27;ll know cuz you get your new curly hair come out from the forehead area. If I have somewhere to go I&#x27;ll just blow dry the new growth in the front so it doesn&#x27;t look weird but the rest of my hair still remains straight. But new growth is normal. I could do the keratin treatment to touch up the new growth but I&#x27;ll wait until it grows out a little bit more. I really hope this helps you out. I know I&#x27;m happy with it. I think the bad reviews are people trying to this keratin treatment alone and it really is a 2 person task. Hope you get great results as I have :) The extra work is so worth it and it totally beats paying hundreds at a salon. A little bit time consuming but I would and will go thru it again b/c i love my straight hair !! :)</li>
            <li> This product simply helps your hair retain moisture. It leaves it full and glossy. The less you wash your hair the better and longer it lasts. It does wreck your ends, so get a trim a couple of weeks after using it. WARNING- this product does irritate the upper airway and eyes. If you use it, choose a very open room, not the bathroom. I would use it again taking extra precaution to protect myself from breathing the fumes.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my straight hair.  I took my time to follow the directions.  I will say that the product definitely needs to be put on in a ventilated area.  It really burned my eyes.  I did not have anyone help me, so when I used the straightener following the directions.  I waited 3 days before I washed it out.  My hair is so easy now to get ready for work in morning.  It has only been a week, but I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> My hair looked really good when I used this</li>
            <li> I used this around 3 months ago and it was excellent , I went on holiday swimming every day beach and pool and was impressed . It lasted around two months but considering how much O was swimming over the four week holiday I&#x27;m happy . Interesting I just tried Kerapremium because of the great reviews , I washed my hair yesterday and can say its not nearly as good as the IQ Keratin . I have a huge bottle of Kerapremium but will go back to IQ because the difference so big . Kerapremium has helped with the frizz but IQ left my hair straighter and much much softer .</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the mixed reviews but it came next day, very easy to use with labeled bottles and step by step directions. My hair wasn&#x27;t greasy at all, I left it for 5 days rather than 3 and my curls were less tight more like deep waves when wet and drying was cut in half. My hair is sooooo unbelievably soft and shinier! I loved this treatment, it was even better than the Coppola that my friend did on me. Not sure if it&#x27;s because I left it in longer but felt wayy better!</li>
            <li> It is a good hair treatment, but it doesn&#x27;t make the hair straight if you have a thick and frizzy hair. It make it manageable. You will get rid of the fuzziness and you will have a great natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> This product is quite good and an excellent price range if you have not-so-thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;It was my first time using the product and also first time using a Keratin treatment but I&#x27;d definitely try it again because the results were worth it - shiny hair that&#x27;s easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;One set back is the smell. Noting prepares your for it and I&#x27;ve read other posts but it didnt mean a thing until I had to experience it personally.&lt;br /&gt;So just have a well ventilated area (create a cross breeze by opening two windows and have a fan nearby - run it directly in front to draw the fumes away from your eyes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are worth it though because this is a great product for anyone with 4c, african, afro-caribbean or mixed hair who want to &amp;#34;relax&amp;#34; the curl or kink of their hair without using a permanent solution. You can still rock a natural twist out on the days that you want but you can switch it up with ease if you want a sleek look for a night out or just want to change your look.  It usually takes me 3 hours to to a blow out from start to finish. This treatment allows me to put less product in my hair, dry in 10-12 minutes  and flat iron (2 to three passes of the wand, tops) in the same amount of time. I&#x27;m out of the bathroom in about 30-40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the treatment in for two weeks so more on how it react with new growth and actually how long it stays in later. Definitely worth the money, though and a solid intro into keratin treatments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been less than 2 weeks since I applied this product and I feel that my hair is the same as it was before.  My hair felt really soft and was drying mostly straight after the first wash.  By the second time I washed it (2-3 days later) I could already tell that it wasn&#x27;t the same.  My hair is as curly as it was before (which is really curly) and the amount of frizz is about the same too.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like this product is in my hair anymore, like it just washed out.  I follwed the directions exactly, but it didn&#x27;t last. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Brazileira and used this product. But I did not like my hair was horrible I recommend products Inoar is more expensive but better.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  The only warning I have is that it stinks when you blow dry.  It also leaves your hairy somewhat greasy the first 72 hours.  But afterwards, your hair is much softer and easier to manage.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone. My hair looked even better that when I went to a professional and it cost me only one forth of what it will cost at a hair salon. It lasted for 4 and a half months. It is the real thing.</li>
            <li> I am a professional hairstylist. I use this product all the time on my clients because it doesn&#x27;t contain formaldehyde like other similar products do. IQ Natural does exactly what it says. If it didn&#x27;t work for you that means you should have had a professional or at least a friend who&#x27;s good with hair, do it for you. It is not easy to do yourself, just like hair coloring. If you don&#x27;t do exactly as the instructions say you can&#x27;t expect to have perfect results like I do every time.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and so do my clients!</li>
            <li> Works great and very easy to use if you follow the directions.  I have a lot of very thick curly hair, which is just a bit longer than shoulder length and color treated. A couple of notes, as it is for professional use, it doesn&#x27;t come with gloves, an applicator brush, bowl, shower cap, alligator clips (or whatever ones you like to hold each section), and you need a professional flat iron that heats up to 450 degrees.  If you are great with color application, you should have no difficulty using this product.  There is a very strong odor with the treatment, so as directed, use in a well ventilated area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some hints, wash your hair with the clarifying shampoo 3 times to make sure it&#x27;s totally clean of any residue from styling products and hairspray.  It says not to use a brush to dry your hair after using the clarifying shampoo, but I did so I could get a thin tooth comb through my hair. Apply the treatment by sectioning your hair and applying with an applicator brush from roots to ends. I found that combing with a fine tooth comb moved the products easily, and I then applied more with my gloves to saturate the area, and then combed out the extra. It took 1 bottle of treatment to cover my entire head. I made sure to comb out any extra after applying it, prior to placing the cap on my head, as I can see where some complain that if you leave too much product on, it&#x27;s too heavy and doesn&#x27;t dry well &amp; can feel heavy, sticky or feel like it&#x27;s still damp. So comb and comb your hair again to evenly distribute the product after you&#x27;ve completely applied it prior to covering with a cap. After 25 minutes, I sectioned my hair again, and began drying it from the back, at the nape of my neck, letting only as much as could fit into my hair straightener, because I found that if you dry a section, then flat iron it immediately after, making sure to go over the area 7-10 times to make sure the product is sealed and set in, it&#x27;s much easier, as you end up covering your entirehead section by section, and not missing an area with your flat iron if you go back and try to section it after drying completely. It takes a while, but it&#x27;s worth it!  Then as you let each section down to dry, you can incorporate the already flat ironed hair with the hair you just dried, and it becomes an easy process, that is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you have the correct tools, time, and a ventilated area, and you will save yourself a ton in the long run. I left the product on for 3 days prior to washing my hair, as it looked absolutely beautiful, and didn&#x27;t need a touch up, although, I did run my flat iron through it daily at 350 degrees just to make sure it was set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finally washed my hair, I was pleasantly surprised that my hair was pin straight!  It felt healthy, soft, manageable, and I didn&#x27;t need to blow dry my hair immediately, as I use to, or it would curl up. I actually let it dry over 50%, while I did things around the house. When I dried it, it was perfect. One side note, there was a smell when I washed my hair that was unpleasant, however, it disappeared once my hair was completely dry. I didn&#x27;t have a need to use a flat iron, just my regular 3 ½&amp;#34; round brush (which I also used to dry my hair during the process).  I also don&#x27;t need to wash my hair everyday, as it looks as if I just washed it, even on day 3. My hair is also wiry, so if I put it in a braid or pony tail, it would leave bend marks. Well, those are gone too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good. I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product, and I&#x27;ll only need to purchase the treatment in the future, as I have a lot of shampoo &amp; conditioner left.  Definitely worth the time and money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, take your time, and you&#x27;ll have great results!</li>
