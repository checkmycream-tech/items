            <li>always loved it ...</li>
            <li>Fair price.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the good reviews on acne skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for everything, bug bites, kitty scratches, skin irritations.  </li>
            <li>I would have loved to discover this product about 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>Ointment through night and seems good.</li>
            <li>results were great and she really liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>Between my own acne, and my son&#x27;s mosquito bites this product is great to have stashed everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I used this product on my face and although it was good for ridding pimples, it did burn my skin which also turned to a flaky rash.</li>
            <li>I use it all the time on blemishes and it works good.</li>
            <li>This is a good supplement to the Desert Essence tea tree face wash for fighting acne.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin with freckles across my nose for those that wonder about skin type.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good for me when travelling</li>
            <li>so handy and effective!</li>
            <li>This works the best for spot treatment and quick removal of a blemish.</li>
            <li>Try it for yourself, I&#x27;m sure you or someone you love will be very happy</li>
            <li>Love the spill proof bottle, very handy.</li>
            <li>For about a minute it makes it feel more itchy, but then the itch goes away!  </li>

            <li>I love this!</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this stick!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Despite being a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product, this stuff works amazingly well, and I have bought it over and over.</li>
            <li>Truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>Nothing worked as effectively as this does.</li>
            <li>Thrilled to find it here.</li>
            <li>This anti-blemish stick is ok but not as good as putting diluted tea tree onto a cotton and cleaning your face with it.</li>
            <li>It feels great when I apply it on my skin and most importantly it does</li>
            <li>A good quality, all-natural product safe for most people.</li>
            <li>Great for quick spot treatment.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t repulsive and I will continue to buy this product for many more years!</li>
            <li>Best natural blemish product around!</li>
            <li>Best natural product for pimples, it clears them up in a day or two.</li>
            <li>We have tried it all, and so far this is the best.  </li>
            <li>Works amazingly well for many types of skin irritations.</li>
            <li>Nice effective formulation in an easy to use applicator</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li>The tea tree in this product is refreshing and does a good job of quickly drying out blemishes.</li>
            <li>I think it works best if you catch your pimples very early and treat them frequently, otherwise its effectiveness is greatly diminished.</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE fan of this product!</li>
            <li>This product is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I find it works better than the OTC products with salicylic acid, (Clearasil, Oxy...).  </li>
            <li>It has the tea tree scent, which I love.</li>
            <li>, Desert Essence is going to be losing one more customer based on how I was treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the way it smells and feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Appears to work for most blemishes.</li>
            <li>I have tried many number of products in order to get rid of my marks and blemishes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and have gotten many friends hooked on it.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I wil b y more wh en</li>
            <li>But should always be diluted or for many it will irritate skin</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!!  </li>
            <li>With zits there is nothing better.  </li>
            <li>If I were marooned on a desert island, I hope I would have been able to grab this product before jumping ship.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I just remember having somewhat better luck with the Burt&#x27;s Bees one.</li>
            <li>Used to buy it at my favorite &amp;#34;alternate&amp;#34; supermarket chain</li>
            <li>Discovered it about a year ago after many, many years of using products that either did nothing and/or irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the desert essence brand.</li>
            <li>This tea tree oil blemish stick works magic.</li>
            <li>I love this blemish stick.  </li>
            <li>If you get a zit there is nothing better....</li>
            <li>perhaps it&#x27;s not geared to those with more pigmented skin tones...</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m guessing it was because I have tried SO MANY products to help my skin.</li>
            <li>Toothpaste did more than this product.</li>
            <li>love this stuff..</li>
            <li>This is pretty much the best things I&#x27;ve ever bought!</li>
            <li>This stuff seems to work pretty good.</li>
            <li>I need more time to determine for sure, but so far Im pretty impressed by it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, comes in a jar with a metal roller top</li>
            <li>this stuff works great for my adult acne</li>
            <li>a great natural way to treat blemishes  </li>
            <li>Good product that really works.</li>
            <li>The old formula was the best but the new formula still works you just need to apply it more often.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use and take with you.</li>
            <li>The fact that is it &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and has a lovely, clean smell is just a bonus.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just to strong for my skin type.</li>
            <li>Yes it does have a strong odor</li>
            <li>I have to admit it has a strong smell from all the extracts it contains</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that strong</li>
            <li>IT works fine</li>
            <li>Love these for when you have blemishes that you want gone quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, but effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While she apologized, I said, \\&quot;it doesn&#x27;t sound like you are sorry.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The stick is fantastic for relieving itchy bug bites, although I gave just 4 stars because it can sting for some people.</li>
            <li>I just enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product...</li>
            <li>Irritated my skin tho to the point that I can&#x27;t apply makeup comfortably.</li>
            <li>Indispensable.</li>
            <li>It feels and smells good and natural to use.</li>
            <li>It works quickly and is easy to use, just dab it on your zit, and away it goes.</li>
            <li>The product has new packaging, and arrives as a glass container with a rollerball at the top, so no need to touch your face!</li>
            <li>This is the best treatment I&#x27;ve found for small breakouts.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t so great, but the payoff of a clearer complexion outweighs the minor stench.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall Grade B (original formulary); or 4-Stars./&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Grade B (original formulary); or 4-Stars.</li>
            <li>I originally found this at Trader Joes but they no longer carry it.  </li>
            <li>and we&#x27;ve noticed a significant improvement in his complexion.  </li>
            <li>great price and a definite must have for first aid kit, purse, car!</li>
            <li>Thoroughly Clean Face Wash.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it feel clean when i put it on.</li>
            <li>Fair warning however, tea tree can really sting your face, which I don&#x27;t really mind.</li>
            <li>in the rare chance that I do get bitten... I dab some of this on and it helps with the itchiness and gets my skin healing quick!</li>
            <li>so finding a product that don&#x27;t change your skin time is hard, but this one is one of the best</li>
            <li>This takes the place of those acne products that are full of things you can&#x27;t pronounce, and wouldn&#x27;t put on your face if you knew what it was.</li>
            <li>It is a nice, natural solution for drying up pimples.  </li>
            <li>this is good for daily prevention.</li>
            <li>When it did happen the seller immediately sent another one that was full.</li>
            <li>They are great for after the gym, during the summer and for any other time you want to feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>This does seem to help with my daughter&#x27;s mild acne.</li>
            <li>It does sting when you put it on, but that goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>Its not messy and very easy to travel with and to apply on my face.</li>
            <li>Now sometimes a pimple just has to run its course, but most new bumps, if we catch them in time, will disappear overnight with one application of Desert Essence.</li>
            <li>Not really sure if it&#x27;s helping the acne or blemishes, but it sure feels and smell good.</li>
            <li>easy to apply and works very well on pimples</li>
            <li>Where has the Desert Essence Blemish Touch Stick been my whole life??!!</li>
            <li>I use this religiously whenever I feel a zit coming on--it&#x27;s magic for those lurkers that never seem to go away!</li>
            <li>Caution it burns at first be prepared!</li>
            <li>I love using this on blemishes; it helps clear them up so quickly.</li>
            <li>If you recycle (and would like to save a little $$$) Save your applicator bottle and buy your own tea Tree Oil and MAKE YOUR OWN anti-acne formula; using about 2tbsp of The Homestead Company pure 100% Witch Hazel (alcohol-free) and</li>
            <li>most toners leave residue or some kind of odd feeling layer on top of my skin, whereas this simply feels clean.</li>
            <li>The chemicals can irritate the skin even more AND they strip your face of natural oils that can help keep your acne \\&quot;at bay\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and this powerful antiseptic does</li>
            <li>Sixty seconds of itch is worth the relief it gives.</li>
            <li>He says he just leaves it at home, puts it on the shelf in an upright position (this is USEFUL info) and uses it in the morning and when he gets home and before he goes to bed</li>
            <li>For one or two zits you need to get rid of soon, this might be worth it.</li>
            <li>I also like that it is much more natural.</li>
            <li>Obviously, this was my own fault.</li>
            <li>I use it on a variety skin problems with much success.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But, as a back-up, the original formula of this blemish stick is/was really great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I apply when I wake up, once in the afternoon, and right before bed.</li>
            <li>right after i wash my face.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I got compliments on how much more clear my face looked.</li>
            <li>BUT, I have found that most everything that i have used from DESERT ESSENCE has changed - offering less beneficial impact but more expense.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to have a portable little stick for a quick touch up!</li>
            <li>This is the first time since I was in high school that I feel comfortable without putting on make up, because my face is so clear and clean!</li>
            <li>About a year ago, I decided to go more natural, and bought Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean Face Wash, and wow!</li>
            <li>This was fantastic, it did its job, but it runs out too fast (or maybe I&#x27;m using too much).</li>
            <li>It works super fast too.</li>
            <li>Thank you Dessert Essence for making such great products that actually work and are all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;take carer /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is Fantastic  and Natural!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so puzzled about WHY a great product is changed to different ingredients ~ which no longer offer the same positive results?  </li>
            <li>For years I only used products that were FILLED with chemicals, at one point even taking antibiotics!</li>
            <li>Quite the contrary, this product works very well!</li>
            <li>I almost didn&#x27;t believe the reviews at first</li>
            <li>I forget and don&#x27;t reorder when the first one runs out.</li>
            <li>I have the Desert Essence 20% Australian Tea Tree Oil and it works better than the Blemish Touch stick.</li>
            <li>but it goes fast!</li>
            <li>One of my first reviews for a beauty product.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I kept reapplying it throughout the day and it eventually burned my skin.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I finally did.  </li>
            <li>but the best ratio is about 2-3 drops tea tree oil for every 1-2ounces of alcohol-free witch hazel used--you can use the dropper to transfer your solution if you don&#x27;t have a small enough stainless steel funnel)- )</li>
            <li>I have used other topical treatments for blemishes/spots that have been moderately successful but are very drying and full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face clean and clear.</li>
            <li>At the pricey natural-foods market where I usually get it, apparently, it is super popular as well.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best prices for something that&#x27;s hard to find in stores (health stores seem to stock tea tree oil itself, but the roller makes it so much easier to use), and the strength is terrific.</li>
            <li>I think it is because when I first started using the product I would really roll a lot on my blemishes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for smaller blemishes that pop up on the sides of the nose where your glasses sit (pores clogged from the pressure and contact of the glasses), and other surface irritations.</li>
            <li>, A few people have complained about changes in the ingredient ratios, but it does state that there are still NO synthetic ingredients, so I am hoping that it is still a great option if you don&#x27;t have a lot of time to make your own astringent concoctions at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, not a bad product, though!</li>
            <li>So far all of the pimples/blemishes that I apply it to are gone quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries out the skin, yeah, but it works incredibly quickly if you use it frequently.</li>
            <li>tea tree oil cost less and can be diluted unlike this rolling ball applicator, and is somewhat effective.</li>
            <li>Not so much for issues with spots, but for refreshing and handling minor bites or cuts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, not bad, just not as strong and fast as the other one.</li>
            <li>Not very much difference I saw but didn&#x27;t really use it for more than two weeks because I couldnt stand the smell.</li>
            <li>This little touch stick is amazing.</li>
            <li>The directions say 5 to 6 times a day, but that is way too much.</li>
            <li>Very noticeable, visible difference overnight.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>but it really works.</li>
            <li>And as a guy, it really lingered on my skin</li>
            <li>and I find it useful for all manner of skin problems -- from adult pimples to disinfecting.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well on blackheads (in my experience) but it works really well on whiteheads and zits.</li>
            <li>it really works.</li>
            <li>, this feels just like straight tea tree oil did.</li>
            <li>It truly helps him get through the summer months when the mosquitos are really out.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice that this helped much with the blemish I have.</li>
            <li>I tried for impetigo on my daughter, it seemed to helped, but she screemed how much it was hurting her.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughters and they really like it.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel as though it helped much..</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It really works....almost overnight.</li>
            <li>When it gets really oily (towards the end of the day)</li>
            <li>my forehead gets really itchy and I always break out in cysts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only downside I have seen is that I am going through the bottle pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Not sure about the blemish claim as I have been most lucky in the skin department.  </li>
            <li>The smell can nearly knock you down at first, its very strong.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong minty type scent and even stings a little</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t work with the first application, it most likely will with the second.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, this review is for the ORIGINAL formula only...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent size, and it doesn&#x27;t take much at all.</li>
            <li>Works great for healing small cuts especially cat scratches.</li>
            <li>It really helps to dry up blemishes quickly!</li>
            <li>I love these tea tree sticks, and the entire desert essence line in general.</li>
            <li>I use this at least 2+ times per day (more often if I have an emerging blemish) in combination with the Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean Face Wash (highly recommended also).</li>
            <li>After cleaning my face with a natural face cleaner, I roll this over my blemishes and it truly makes them dry up more expediently.  </li>
            <li>breakout frequently and have found that this really helps!</li>
            <li>My face is pink in spots I applied it to, hurts to wash with very mild cleanser and cant apply calming moisturizer without it burning.  </li>
            <li>For deeper blemishes, this  will help, but more serious zits won&#x27;t be wiped out quite so quickly with this.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t help with blemishes it dried out my skin and made any spot bright red.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product with Desert Essence</li>
            <li>I developed a large pimple - of course - and used this product, expecting it to work like my home remedy.  </li>
            <li>and I was surprised at how fast I got a result.</li>
            <li>This stick is full of natural ingredients and essential oils.</li>
            <li>If you have one -- no matter how big or small -- it will work like magic making the redness disappear sometimes as quickly as overnight.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause the surrounding skin to become dry and flaky like other spot treatments, and the rolling ball allows for a quick and easy application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years since my coworker told me about it, it get rids dark marks, pimples and if you dint mind the strong teactree smell the.</li>
            <li>In addition to being in love with this blemish stick, I&#x27;m becoming obsessed with the Desert Essence line of products because of their natural ingredients and lack of animal testing.</li>
            <li>&amp; they sent me new ones to Miami &amp; it got shipped to where I am now.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it...</li>
            <li>It rolls on easily and leaves a slight liquid on your skin.</li>
            <li>My spots would go away quickly without leaving any dry skin.</li>
            <li>It does NOT overly dry out my skin, but it does quickly reduce the size/appearance of blemishes (within 1 day, 2 days for bigger/deeper/older blemishes).</li>
            <li>I first bought this product a number of years ago, for a young relative who was having pubescent/hormonal breakouts and at the time the main ingredient was tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s helped clear up pimples within a couple of days!</li>
            <li>I have suffered from acne ever since I was a teen (thanks, Dad!)</li>
            <li>This stick works on years old blemishes!</li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time several years ago for an itchy spot on my nose that had been bothering me for a decade.</li>
            <li>I love this product - works especially well on keeping white heads from further infection.  </li>
            <li>throw it on at the first sight of a zit and will definitely help the healing process.</li>
            <li>Totally clears up blemishes fast!</li>
            <li>Be aware, though, that tea tree oil has a distinctive smell, especially when applied this close to your nose!</li>
            <li>Thoroughly clean face wash, apply Dessert Essence Daily Essential</li>
            <li>stain or show as it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li>It is clear so you can apply through out the day and not worry about it being noticable.  </li>
            <li>It keeps their blemishes under control and seems to really clear them up over night.</li>
            <li>And, being an essential oil lover, this is something I really like.</li>
            <li>Got this for my young daughter who is already experiencing acne.</li>
            <li>The box says not to use on children, but so far, we&#x27;ve had no adverse effects.</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>So far it always has disappeared within 2 -3 days.</li>
            <li>The only problem is sometimes the stick releases too much of the liquid.</li>
            <li>It does have a plant like scent but that&#x27;s what you get with an all natural product</li>
            <li>i was surprised.</li>
            <li>I apply it directly to the area needed.  </li>
            <li>I dont think this will cure acne or treat pimples that have freshly developed</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil is naturally antibacterial which can eliminate acne by controlling the bacteria that causes it.</li>
            <li>I like natural items, so was drawn to this product,</li>
            <li>The product&#x27;s smell is loud</li>
            <li>This one definitely works - breakouts shrink really fast when you apply this.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I needed something natural that would soothe and heal my skin, kill the bacteria and  minimize oil production.  </li>
            <li>ordered some more blemish touch sticks from the site I normally order from &amp; again a few months later same problem, so I called Desert</li>
            <li>It seriously works like magic - yes</li>
            <li>I will roll this on a pimple or if I am starting to see a breakout and literally it will be significantly better within a few HOURS!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for acne suffers because it not only fights breakouts but it nourishes and heals the skin NATURALLY</li>
            <li>It heals red spots, browns spots, prevents new cysts and pustules from forming and reduces oil.  </li>
            <li>This one, on the other hand, has left dry marks wherever I&#x27;ve applied it and hasn&#x27;t made a huge difference at all.</li>
            <li>It is small enough to fit in a pocket and take with you anywhere for anytime, and it is my go-to when I feel a blemish creeping up.</li>
            <li>I have used tree oil mixed with witch hazel to clear up blemishes for for years.  </li>
            <li>Seems to dry up the area decently.</li>
            <li>But I couldn&#x27;t bare the smell of the oil.</li>
            <li>Not only is it natural</li>
            <li>It contains Witch Hazel and natural grain alcohol along with the essential oils</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m about 80% sure it made breakouts worse.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works for some people, and I really wanted this to work because I like a lot of the other products from this company, but it just isn&#x27;t working for my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like giving bad reviews, but I just have to be honest and say that this isn&#x27;t really working for me.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this has just enough strength to get rid of blemishes without drying out my skin or turning it red.</li>
            <li>This is now what I am doing with the item, but honestly, much like almost all other topical acne products, this maybe only works on some people, and I may just be one of those others who are not in that \\&quot;some people\\&quot; category.</li>
            <li>I can see an instant healing within a few hours of my first application.  </li>
            <li>It is also tight and flaky causing It to feel very aggitated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;TIP: If you also need to use a &#x27;sanitizing&#x27; agent on the skin due to acne, psoriasis, eczema or other sensitive skin issues; then cleanse skin with Natural-Cosmetics&#x27; Raw Handmade African Black Soap from Ghana (only 4-5 total ingredients)--, and then &#x27;sanitize&#x27; the skin with 90% medical-grade rubbing alcohol, before toning with alcohol-free witch hazel-- and then apply layer of pure Aloe Vera Gel under light layer of coconut oil and then spot treat with your homemade witch hazel-tea-tree oil anti-acne</li>
            <li>Great for blemishes but also for any cut, little nick or abrasion, including cold sores.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s good for everything, bug bites, kitty scratches, skin irritations.  </li>

            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Despite being a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product, this stuff works amazingly well, and I have bought it over and over.</li>
            <li> Truly amazing.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked as effectively as this does.</li>
            <li> Thrilled to find it here.</li>
            <li> This anti-blemish stick is ok but not as good as putting diluted tea tree onto a cotton and cleaning your face with it.</li>
            <li> It feels great when I apply it on my skin and most importantly it does</li>
            <li> A good quality, all-natural product safe for most people.</li>

            <li> Works amazingly well for many types of skin irritations.</li>
            <li> Nice effective formulation in an easy to use applicator</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> The tea tree in this product is refreshing and does a good job of quickly drying out blemishes.</li>
            <li> I think it works best if you catch your pimples very early and treat them frequently, otherwise its effectiveness is greatly diminished.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of this product!</li>
            <li> This product is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I find it works better than the OTC products with salicylic acid, (Clearasil, Oxy...).  </li>
            <li> It has the tea tree scent, which I love.</li>
            <li> , Desert Essence is going to be losing one more customer based on how I was treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells and feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Appears to work for most blemishes.</li>
            <li> I have tried many number of products in order to get rid of my marks and blemishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and have gotten many friends hooked on it.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I wil b y more wh en</li>
            <li> But should always be diluted or for many it will irritate skin</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!!  </li>
            <li> With zits there is nothing better.  </li>
            <li> If I were marooned on a desert island, I hope I would have been able to grab this product before jumping ship.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I just remember having somewhat better luck with the Burt&#x27;s Bees one.</li>
            <li> Used to buy it at my favorite &amp;#34;alternate&amp;#34; supermarket chain</li>
            <li> Discovered it about a year ago after many, many years of using products that either did nothing and/or irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the desert essence brand.</li>
            <li> This tea tree oil blemish stick works magic.</li>
            <li> I love this blemish stick.  </li>
            <li> If you get a zit there is nothing better....</li>
            <li> perhaps it&#x27;s not geared to those with more pigmented skin tones...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m guessing it was because I have tried SO MANY products to help my skin.</li>
            <li> Toothpaste did more than this product.</li>
            <li> love this stuff..</li>
            <li> This is pretty much the best things I&#x27;ve ever bought!</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to work pretty good.</li>
            <li> I need more time to determine for sure, but so far Im pretty impressed by it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, comes in a jar with a metal roller top</li>
            <li> this stuff works great for my adult acne</li>
            <li> a great natural way to treat blemishes  </li>
            <li> Good product that really works.</li>
            <li> The old formula was the best but the new formula still works you just need to apply it more often.  </li>
            <li> So easy to use and take with you.</li>
            <li> The fact that is it &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and has a lovely, clean smell is just a bonus.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just to strong for my skin type.</li>
            <li> Yes it does have a strong odor</li>
            <li> I have to admit it has a strong smell from all the extracts it contains</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that strong</li>
            <li> IT works fine</li>
            <li> Love these for when you have blemishes that you want gone quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, but effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While she apologized, I said, \\&quot;it doesn&#x27;t sound like you are sorry.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The stick is fantastic for relieving itchy bug bites, although I gave just 4 stars because it can sting for some people.</li>
            <li> I just enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product...</li>
            <li> Irritated my skin tho to the point that I can&#x27;t apply makeup comfortably.</li>
            <li> Indispensable.</li>
            <li> It feels and smells good and natural to use.</li>
            <li> It works quickly and is easy to use, just dab it on your zit, and away it goes.</li>
            <li> The product has new packaging, and arrives as a glass container with a rollerball at the top, so no need to touch your face!</li>
            <li> This is the best treatment I&#x27;ve found for small breakouts.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t so great, but the payoff of a clearer complexion outweighs the minor stench.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall Grade B (original formulary); or 4-Stars./&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Grade B (original formulary); or 4-Stars.</li>
            <li> I originally found this at Trader Joes but they no longer carry it.  </li>
            <li> and we&#x27;ve noticed a significant improvement in his complexion.  </li>
            <li> great price and a definite must have for first aid kit, purse, car!</li>
            <li> Thoroughly Clean Face Wash.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it feel clean when i put it on.</li>
            <li> Fair warning however, tea tree can really sting your face, which I don&#x27;t really mind.</li>
            <li> in the rare chance that I do get bitten... I dab some of this on and it helps with the itchiness and gets my skin healing quick!</li>
            <li> so finding a product that don&#x27;t change your skin time is hard, but this one is one of the best</li>
            <li> This takes the place of those acne products that are full of things you can&#x27;t pronounce, and wouldn&#x27;t put on your face if you knew what it was.</li>
            <li> It is a nice, natural solution for drying up pimples.  </li>
            <li> this is good for daily prevention.</li>
            <li> When it did happen the seller immediately sent another one that was full.</li>
            <li> They are great for after the gym, during the summer and for any other time you want to feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This does seem to help with my daughter&#x27;s mild acne.</li>
            <li> It does sting when you put it on, but that goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> Its not messy and very easy to travel with and to apply on my face.</li>
            <li> Now sometimes a pimple just has to run its course, but most new bumps, if we catch them in time, will disappear overnight with one application of Desert Essence.</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it&#x27;s helping the acne or blemishes, but it sure feels and smell good.</li>
            <li> easy to apply and works very well on pimples</li>
            <li> Where has the Desert Essence Blemish Touch Stick been my whole life??!!</li>
            <li> I use this religiously whenever I feel a zit coming on--it&#x27;s magic for those lurkers that never seem to go away!</li>
            <li> Caution it burns at first be prepared!</li>
            <li> I love using this on blemishes; it helps clear them up so quickly.</li>
            <li> If you recycle (and would like to save a little $$$) Save your applicator bottle and buy your own tea Tree Oil and MAKE YOUR OWN anti-acne formula; using about 2tbsp of The Homestead Company pure 100% Witch Hazel (alcohol-free) and</li>
            <li> most toners leave residue or some kind of odd feeling layer on top of my skin, whereas this simply feels clean.</li>
            <li> The chemicals can irritate the skin even more AND they strip your face of natural oils that can help keep your acne \\&quot;at bay\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> and this powerful antiseptic does</li>
            <li> Sixty seconds of itch is worth the relief it gives.</li>
            <li> He says he just leaves it at home, puts it on the shelf in an upright position (this is USEFUL info) and uses it in the morning and when he gets home and before he goes to bed</li>
            <li> For one or two zits you need to get rid of soon, this might be worth it.</li>
            <li> I also like that it is much more natural.</li>
            <li> Obviously, this was my own fault.</li>
            <li> I use it on a variety skin problems with much success.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But, as a back-up, the original formula of this blemish stick is/was really great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply when I wake up, once in the afternoon, and right before bed.</li>
            <li> right after i wash my face.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I got compliments on how much more clear my face looked.</li>
            <li> BUT, I have found that most everything that i have used from DESERT ESSENCE has changed - offering less beneficial impact but more expense.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to have a portable little stick for a quick touch up!</li>
            <li> This is the first time since I was in high school that I feel comfortable without putting on make up, because my face is so clear and clean!</li>
            <li> About a year ago, I decided to go more natural, and bought Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean Face Wash, and wow!</li>
            <li> This was fantastic, it did its job, but it runs out too fast (or maybe I&#x27;m using too much).</li>
            <li> It works super fast too.</li>
            <li> Thank you Dessert Essence for making such great products that actually work and are all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;take carer /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is Fantastic  and Natural!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so puzzled about WHY a great product is changed to different ingredients ~ which no longer offer the same positive results?  </li>
            <li> For years I only used products that were FILLED with chemicals, at one point even taking antibiotics!</li>
            <li> Quite the contrary, this product works very well!</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t believe the reviews at first</li>
            <li> I forget and don&#x27;t reorder when the first one runs out.</li>
            <li> I have the Desert Essence 20% Australian Tea Tree Oil and it works better than the Blemish Touch stick.</li>
            <li> but it goes fast!</li>
            <li> One of my first reviews for a beauty product.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I kept reapplying it throughout the day and it eventually burned my skin.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I finally did.  </li>
            <li> but the best ratio is about 2-3 drops tea tree oil for every 1-2ounces of alcohol-free witch hazel used--you can use the dropper to transfer your solution if you don&#x27;t have a small enough stainless steel funnel)- )</li>
            <li> I have used other topical treatments for blemishes/spots that have been moderately successful but are very drying and full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face clean and clear.</li>
            <li> At the pricey natural-foods market where I usually get it, apparently, it is super popular as well.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best prices for something that&#x27;s hard to find in stores (health stores seem to stock tea tree oil itself, but the roller makes it so much easier to use), and the strength is terrific.</li>
            <li> I think it is because when I first started using the product I would really roll a lot on my blemishes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for smaller blemishes that pop up on the sides of the nose where your glasses sit (pores clogged from the pressure and contact of the glasses), and other surface irritations.</li>
            <li> , A few people have complained about changes in the ingredient ratios, but it does state that there are still NO synthetic ingredients, so I am hoping that it is still a great option if you don&#x27;t have a lot of time to make your own astringent concoctions at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, not a bad product, though!</li>
            <li> So far all of the pimples/blemishes that I apply it to are gone quickly.</li>
            <li> It dries out the skin, yeah, but it works incredibly quickly if you use it frequently.</li>
            <li> tea tree oil cost less and can be diluted unlike this rolling ball applicator, and is somewhat effective.</li>
            <li> Not so much for issues with spots, but for refreshing and handling minor bites or cuts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, not bad, just not as strong and fast as the other one.</li>
            <li> Not very much difference I saw but didn&#x27;t really use it for more than two weeks because I couldnt stand the smell.</li>
            <li> This little touch stick is amazing.</li>
            <li> The directions say 5 to 6 times a day, but that is way too much.</li>
            <li> Very noticeable, visible difference overnight.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> but it really works.</li>
            <li> And as a guy, it really lingered on my skin</li>
            <li> and I find it useful for all manner of skin problems -- from adult pimples to disinfecting.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well on blackheads (in my experience) but it works really well on whiteheads and zits.</li>
            <li> it really works.</li>
            <li> , this feels just like straight tea tree oil did.</li>
            <li> It truly helps him get through the summer months when the mosquitos are really out.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice that this helped much with the blemish I have.</li>
            <li> I tried for impetigo on my daughter, it seemed to helped, but she screemed how much it was hurting her.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters and they really like it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel as though it helped much..</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> It really works....almost overnight.</li>
            <li> When it gets really oily (towards the end of the day)</li>
            <li> my forehead gets really itchy and I always break out in cysts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only downside I have seen is that I am going through the bottle pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the blemish claim as I have been most lucky in the skin department.  </li>
            <li> The smell can nearly knock you down at first, its very strong.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong minty type scent and even stings a little</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t work with the first application, it most likely will with the second.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, this review is for the ORIGINAL formula only...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent size, and it doesn&#x27;t take much at all.</li>
            <li> Works great for healing small cuts especially cat scratches.</li>
            <li> It really helps to dry up blemishes quickly!</li>
            <li> I love these tea tree sticks, and the entire desert essence line in general.</li>
            <li> I use this at least 2+ times per day (more often if I have an emerging blemish) in combination with the Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean Face Wash (highly recommended also).</li>
            <li> After cleaning my face with a natural face cleaner, I roll this over my blemishes and it truly makes them dry up more expediently.  </li>
            <li> breakout frequently and have found that this really helps!</li>
            <li> My face is pink in spots I applied it to, hurts to wash with very mild cleanser and cant apply calming moisturizer without it burning.  </li>
            <li> For deeper blemishes, this  will help, but more serious zits won&#x27;t be wiped out quite so quickly with this.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help with blemishes it dried out my skin and made any spot bright red.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product with Desert Essence</li>
            <li> I developed a large pimple - of course - and used this product, expecting it to work like my home remedy.  </li>
            <li> and I was surprised at how fast I got a result.</li>
            <li> This stick is full of natural ingredients and essential oils.</li>
            <li> If you have one -- no matter how big or small -- it will work like magic making the redness disappear sometimes as quickly as overnight.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause the surrounding skin to become dry and flaky like other spot treatments, and the rolling ball allows for a quick and easy application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years since my coworker told me about it, it get rids dark marks, pimples and if you dint mind the strong teactree smell the.</li>
            <li> In addition to being in love with this blemish stick, I&#x27;m becoming obsessed with the Desert Essence line of products because of their natural ingredients and lack of animal testing.</li>
            <li> &amp; they sent me new ones to Miami &amp; it got shipped to where I am now.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it...</li>
            <li> It rolls on easily and leaves a slight liquid on your skin.</li>
            <li> My spots would go away quickly without leaving any dry skin.</li>
            <li> It does NOT overly dry out my skin, but it does quickly reduce the size/appearance of blemishes (within 1 day, 2 days for bigger/deeper/older blemishes).</li>
            <li> I first bought this product a number of years ago, for a young relative who was having pubescent/hormonal breakouts and at the time the main ingredient was tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s helped clear up pimples within a couple of days!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne ever since I was a teen (thanks, Dad!)</li>
            <li> This stick works on years old blemishes!</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time several years ago for an itchy spot on my nose that had been bothering me for a decade.</li>
            <li> I love this product - works especially well on keeping white heads from further infection.  </li>
            <li> throw it on at the first sight of a zit and will definitely help the healing process.</li>
            <li> Totally clears up blemishes fast!</li>
            <li> Be aware, though, that tea tree oil has a distinctive smell, especially when applied this close to your nose!</li>
            <li> Thoroughly clean face wash, apply Dessert Essence Daily Essential</li>
            <li> stain or show as it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li> It is clear so you can apply through out the day and not worry about it being noticable.  </li>
            <li> It keeps their blemishes under control and seems to really clear them up over night.</li>
            <li> And, being an essential oil lover, this is something I really like.</li>
            <li> Got this for my young daughter who is already experiencing acne.</li>
            <li> The box says not to use on children, but so far, we&#x27;ve had no adverse effects.</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> So far it always has disappeared within 2 -3 days.</li>
            <li> The only problem is sometimes the stick releases too much of the liquid.</li>
            <li> It does have a plant like scent but that&#x27;s what you get with an all natural product</li>
            <li> i was surprised.</li>
            <li> I apply it directly to the area needed.  </li>
            <li> I dont think this will cure acne or treat pimples that have freshly developed</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is naturally antibacterial which can eliminate acne by controlling the bacteria that causes it.</li>
            <li> I like natural items, so was drawn to this product,</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s smell is loud</li>
            <li> This one definitely works - breakouts shrink really fast when you apply this.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I needed something natural that would soothe and heal my skin, kill the bacteria and  minimize oil production.  </li>
            <li> ordered some more blemish touch sticks from the site I normally order from &amp; again a few months later same problem, so I called Desert</li>
            <li> It seriously works like magic - yes</li>
            <li> I will roll this on a pimple or if I am starting to see a breakout and literally it will be significantly better within a few HOURS!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for acne suffers because it not only fights breakouts but it nourishes and heals the skin NATURALLY</li>
            <li> It heals red spots, browns spots, prevents new cysts and pustules from forming and reduces oil.  </li>
            <li> This one, on the other hand, has left dry marks wherever I&#x27;ve applied it and hasn&#x27;t made a huge difference at all.</li>
            <li> It is small enough to fit in a pocket and take with you anywhere for anytime, and it is my go-to when I feel a blemish creeping up.</li>
            <li> I have used tree oil mixed with witch hazel to clear up blemishes for for years.  </li>
            <li> Seems to dry up the area decently.</li>
            <li> But I couldn&#x27;t bare the smell of the oil.</li>
            <li> Not only is it natural</li>
            <li> It contains Witch Hazel and natural grain alcohol along with the essential oils</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m about 80% sure it made breakouts worse.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works for some people, and I really wanted this to work because I like a lot of the other products from this company, but it just isn&#x27;t working for my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like giving bad reviews, but I just have to be honest and say that this isn&#x27;t really working for me.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this has just enough strength to get rid of blemishes without drying out my skin or turning it red.</li>
            <li> This is now what I am doing with the item, but honestly, much like almost all other topical acne products, this maybe only works on some people, and I may just be one of those others who are not in that \\&quot;some people\\&quot; category.</li>
            <li> I can see an instant healing within a few hours of my first application.  </li>
            <li> It is also tight and flaky causing It to feel very aggitated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;TIP: If you also need to use a &#x27;sanitizing&#x27; agent on the skin due to acne, psoriasis, eczema or other sensitive skin issues; then cleanse skin with Natural-Cosmetics&#x27; Raw Handmade African Black Soap from Ghana (only 4-5 total ingredients)--, and then &#x27;sanitize&#x27; the skin with 90% medical-grade rubbing alcohol, before toning with alcohol-free witch hazel-- and then apply layer of pure Aloe Vera Gel under light layer of coconut oil and then spot treat with your homemade witch hazel-tea-tree oil anti-acne</li>
            <li> Great for blemishes but also for any cut, little nick or abrasion, including cold sores.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for years but have to keep chasing down new sources to buy it, for some reason.  </li>
            <li> I received it in the new green packaging instead of the white shown in the picture but nothing to be concerned about since they are the same thing.</li>
            <li> I used it on everything from old acne blemishes, on bug bites,  and even my dark underarms...</li>
            <li> This really helps with the small bumps that I get on my face sometimes.</li>
            <li> It seems like it would last a long time.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it has a very strong scent but it is not an unpleasant one</li>
            <li> I wanted so badly for this stick to be effective.  </li>
            <li> I have even used it on emerging cold sores and have been able to get rid of the sore before it became a problem.</li>
            <li> I think it has helped healing time by a few days (sometimes my acne takes 2 weeks to clear up) - one breakout was gone in 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 39 year old gal who still gets pimples during \\&quot;that time of the month.\\&quot;  This product has rid of these pimples with just a few applications a day.  </li>
            <li> Dabbing it on every few hours makes nearly every problem disappear in a day or so.  </li>
            <li> My blemishes almost instantly became less noticeable, they weren&#x27;t red at all!</li>
            <li> /&gt;**Now, even if you can only budget for the Natural Cosmetics&#x27; Black Soap and Aloe plus Coconut Oil to treat your condition, I promise you will see a difference in your skin in LESS than 1-month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep buying other products from Desert Essence, but I&#x27;ll have to pass on this one next time.</li>
            <li> They say it burns a bit if the skin is open but other than that they like it.</li>
            <li> It took about a week and one lump is GONE and the other can no longer be seen and you can feel that its much smaller however it&#x27;s still there.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t linger for very long.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or make me itch.  </li>
            <li> This Blemish stick&#x27;s uses aren&#x27;t limited to blemishes though.  </li>
            <li> Some of the places on my face get cystic with hard knots under the skin, they get soooooo red and irritated and when they finally start to go down they leave a big scar.</li>
            <li> Using that, I would still get TINY little pimples.</li>
            <li> So now I have tried to just put a little bit on and I am still getting the same results.</li>
            <li> I just roll on a little on my lower legs, upper arms and nape of my neck...</li>
            <li> Actually, this in combination with the face wash dried out my skin</li>
            <li> my b o t t l e is empty.</li>
            <li> but I wasted ten bucks.</li>
            <li> I will always recommend this brand, but I would would be careful of the seller you buy from online.</li>
            <li> so when it comes out there&#x27;s absolutely no oily residue.  </li>
            <li> BUT what it fails to take into account or mention is that any position other than 100% UPRIGHT causes this Blemish Stick container to slowly but surely leak out.</li>
            <li> It is just a dark spot on my face but the great thing about this stick as opposed to some of the other tea tree products I&#x27;ve tried is It doesn&#x27;t smell horrible.</li>
            <li> It kills whatever you may have WITHOUT drying it out like other products do.</li>
            <li> Takes care of bug bites, zits and other skin issues.</li>
            <li> , I know it is essential oil based, not magic.</li>
            <li> If I have a pimple or other condition</li>
            <li> I will probably continue using the other option instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like some of their other products</li>
            <li> It is small enough to keep in your glove compartment, hand bag or inside pocket in a sport-coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only problem I have had ordering this online in the past is that some times it evaporates during shipping.</li>
            <li> My friend on the other hand once used this stick and was put off by the pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years as a bug repellent... especially when traveling to exotic places around the world.</li>
            <li> Once or twice I have gotten these products off amazon when half of the stick was already empty.</li>
            <li> The only problem with buying these online is that quality control is hard to manage.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on my third blemish touch stick, and in the beginning, I had to learn moderation the hard way.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but my young daughter is a little wary of the brief stinging sensation -- although she stops scratching her bites within one minute!</li>
            <li> It briefly smells a little bad, but who cares as long as it goes away fast and clears up your skin.</li>
            <li> Even though the roll on is small this product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I tried keeping it in my pocket for the first few days, and unfortunately, the glass stick&#x27;s contents went from 2/3 (which is how \\&quot;full\\&quot; it was when it arrived) to less than 1/3 (also, my fingers and pocket smelled like tea tree oil).</li>
            <li> Heck I&#x27;d buy a whole bunch of these if it was less expensive</li>
            <li> When I first apply it, my blemishes briefly gets redder for a few minutes as the liquid gets into where it needs to go and starts to kill the bad stuff.</li>
            <li> Less breakouts now</li>
            <li> I develop welts not the typical little bites).  </li>
            <li> both times I have ensured that the cap was as tightly wound as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suggest using just a little before applying all over skin</li>
            <li> It does burn a little bit, but then it&#x27;s soothing.</li>
            <li> I was a little reluctant when I purchased this.</li>
            <li> Been using for few years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks, I haven&#x27;t seen a change in my blemishes.</li>
            <li> Within a few hours you can see results.</li>
            <li> It stings but the stinging also goes away after few seconds.</li>
            <li> Use it on the first sign of a blemish and it&#x27;s very unlikely that blemish will be there tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Burns your skin and left me with worse scars</li>
            <li> Ive broken out twice recently and used this product on the pimples.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s bearable and eventually fades after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I wait a few minutes</li>
            <li> I Just roll a thin layer covering my entire forehead and nose.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I no longer buy their lip balm &amp; I never liked any of their other products like their toothpaste, shampoo, etc.</li>
            <li> Not only is it convenient to carry around at all times, whether I&#x27;m at work, school, etc., but it actually works without any unpleasant side effects.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was pretty frustrated by that until I talked to my friend who had told me to get it.</li>
            <li> It tingles a little when you put it on-some may not like that!</li>
            <li> It prevents breakouts, and if I lax on use, it catches the acne before it becomes large and painful.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find anything else that works as well as this does for easing the pain or itch from a mosquito bite, hives, blemishes, hangnails, small rashes, etc.</li>
            <li> It works as well as salicylic acid spot treatments that I&#x27;ve used in the past, plus it&#x27;s cooling when it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I was so reluctant</li>
            <li> I never feel bad using it on my son  (who has extremely sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It seemed to help some, at least I think so.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but ended up buying this for me and two other friends</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, but I would still get random blemishes and had tried every product under the sun!  </li>
            <li> I recently had two of them on my forehead that were very very painful, red and as gross as this is to admit they leaked ( horrifying )  </li>
            <li> I started to use a moisturizer, it made my face worse.</li>
            <li> but Ill keep using it because it at least keeps the breakouts manageable.</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> I tried using other \\&quot;similar\\&quot; products (since this one is impossible to find in stores), but they were all useless.  </li>
            <li> One day, I did some research and learned that all the chemicals I was using could be making my acne worse!</li>
            <li> When reaching into the medicine cabinet and choosing between this and a drugstore OTC zit cream (with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid), this would be my choice, every time, on mere efficacy alone.</li>
            <li> I thought it would add oil to my already oily skin, boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> You just roll it over WHATEVER blemish you have on your face (pimples, cold sores, blackheads, etc.)</li>
            <li> It works against pimples, cold sores, mosquito bites, you name it.  </li>
            <li> if it stinks to me... must stink to those around me...</li>
            <li> like cold water.</li>
            <li> BAD ODOR.  </li>
            <li> it helped zap the pimples but the smell was hurrendous and it hurt and burned so bad i couldnt take it</li>
            <li> I was shocked that they weren&#x27;t arguing with me, but of course welcomed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> YOu have to order it online :(  </li>
            <li> this product is a god send for us, please give it a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but I hate the smell.</li>
            <li> The minute you obsessively apply this product to your spots will be the day you hate it and never use it again, and trust me,</li>
            <li> you do NOT want to hate this</li>
            <li> Cant &#x27;t use on face because of terrible odor...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the spill proof bottle, very handy. Goes on very effectively but still I see no improvement in blemishes.  I suppose this product is meant to use forever.</li>
            <li> Got it for my daughter who has tried everything else.  This product is outstanding.</li>
            <li> Works well, in my opinion. It&#x27;s gentle, but effective. I definitely would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  It seems very effective.</li>
            <li> I cannot express how GREAT this product is!! I have suffered from acne ever since I was a teen (thanks, Dad!) just like my father did, and we both still do. For years I only used products that were FILLED with chemicals, at one point even taking antibiotics! Nothing worked. One day, I did some research and learned that all the chemicals I was using could be making my acne worse! The chemicals can irritate the skin even more AND they strip your face of natural oils that can help keep your acne \\&quot;at bay\\&quot;. About a year ago, I decided to go more natural, and bought Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean Face Wash, and wow! Using that, I would still get TINY little pimples. I started to use a moisturizer, it made my face worse. I HIGHLY recommend this product with Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean Face Wash. I use the Wash once a day, and use this stick 3 times a day. The directions say 5 to 6 times a day, but that is way too much. The product has new packaging, and arrives as a glass container with a rollerball at the top, so no need to touch your face! You just roll it over WHATEVER blemish you have on your face (pimples, cold sores, blackheads, etc.) or anywhere on your body you may have something (bug bites, cuts, etc.) and this powerful antiseptic does it&#x27;s job. When I first apply it, my blemishes briefly gets redder for a few minutes as the liquid gets into where it needs to go and starts to kill the bad stuff. I apply when I wake up, once in the afternoon, and right before bed. It kills whatever you may have WITHOUT drying it out like other products do. It briefly smells a little bad, but who cares as long as it goes away fast and clears up your skin. Use this!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;m a 39 year old gal who still gets pimples during \\&quot;that time of the month.\\&quot;  This product has rid of these pimples with just a few applications a day.  I can see an instant healing within a few hours of my first application.  I use it about three times a day until the pimples are gone, (in two days).  I find it works better than the OTC products with salicylic acid, (Clearasil, Oxy...).  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or make me itch.  The pimple simply shrinks away.  My kids also use it for bug bites!  When we get a mosquito bite, we put it on.  For about a minute it makes it feel more itchy, but then the itch goes away!  Sixty seconds of itch is worth the relief it gives.</li>
            <li> The packaging on this product tells you to use the Blemish Stick 5-6 times a day on your blemishes, bites, etc. BUT what it fails to take into account or mention is that any position other than 100% UPRIGHT causes this Blemish Stick container to slowly but surely leak out. I tried keeping it in my pocket for the first few days, and unfortunately, the glass stick&#x27;s contents went from 2/3 (which is how \\&quot;full\\&quot; it was when it arrived) to less than 1/3 (also, my fingers and pocket smelled like tea tree oil). Please note that I have now gone through 2 bottles and both times I have ensured that the cap was as tightly wound as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty frustrated by that until I talked to my friend who had told me to get it. He says he just leaves it at home, puts it on the shelf in an upright position (this is USEFUL info) and uses it in the morning and when he gets home and before he goes to bed (so around 2-3 times a day only). This is now what I am doing with the item, but honestly, much like almost all other topical acne products, this maybe only works on some people, and I may just be one of those others who are not in that \\&quot;some people\\&quot; category.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product on Amazon.  It works great!  Takes care of bug bites, zits and other skin issues. So easy to use and take with you.</li>
            <li> when my local organic store stopped carrying this product, I had to find it and got it from the source.  Remember the movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding and how the father used Windex for everything?  That&#x27;s how I feel about the blemish stick.  It works against pimples, cold sores, mosquito bites, you name it.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This does seem to help with my daughter&#x27;s mild acne.</li>
            <li> I love using this on blemishes; it helps clear them up so quickly. I think it even reduces the redness. Husband says I smell like pine after using it. Great size for keeping in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, but I would still get random blemishes and had tried every product under the sun!  When I finally used some of this at a friend&#x27;s house my blemish was gone the next day.  I thought it was a coincidence, but when I bought some for myself, it kept working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When mine ran out, I tried using other \\&quot;similar\\&quot; products (since this one is impossible to find in stores), but they were all useless.  I have no idea why it works, but when I see a blemish starting up, this fixes it overnight!</li>
            <li> Arrived on great condition and got what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This blemish stick gets rid of blemishes within 2 days. It seriously works like magic - yes, I know it is essential oil based, not magic. And, being an essential oil lover, this is something I really like. It rolls on easily and leaves a slight liquid on your skin. It has the tea tree scent, which I love.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It clears up blackheads and whiteheads. It also promotes healing of blemishes.</li>
            <li> This was fantastic, it did its job, but it runs out too fast (or maybe I&#x27;m using too much). For one or two zits you need to get rid of soon, this might be worth it. Heck I&#x27;d buy a whole bunch of these if it was less expensive</li>
            <li> I feel like the ingredients have changed somehow.. I used one before and the results were heavenly. My spots would go away quickly without leaving any dry skin. This one, on the other hand, has left dry marks wherever I&#x27;ve applied it and hasn&#x27;t made a huge difference at all. I guess I won&#x27;t be using this product anymore.</li>
            <li> Desert Essence has never been one for great customer service. I remember when their attitude was condescending, but since I&#x27;ve been a customer of theirs for the last 15+ years, I ignored the disrespect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then last year after moving out of the country I started to have problems with their Blemish Touch Stick where the liquid was evaporating. I called them &amp; they acknowledged there was a problem with the packaging &amp; they sent me new ones to Miami &amp; it got shipped to where I am now. I was shocked that they weren&#x27;t arguing with me, but of course welcomed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered some more blemish touch sticks from the site I normally order from &amp; again a few months later same problem, so I called Desert Essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time they wanted to send me packaging to return the items &amp; I told them I can&#x27;t, remember, I&#x27;m out of the country &amp; I&#x27;m not spending $60 to return them to the US. That&#x27;s when things went downhill. Cindy They refused to replace the blemish sticks &amp; told me I have to go back to the place where I purchased them from which means if that company refuses to give me a refund, I just lost money. I asked to speak to a manager &amp; she claimed she&#x27;s a supervisor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy these from a health food store that I know for a fact would never issue me a refund months after purchase, as they treat their customers like garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While she apologized, I said, \\&quot;it doesn&#x27;t sound like you are sorry.\\&quot; And it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told Cindy that if the site won&#x27;t give me a credit, I&#x27;m not going to be happy. I&#x27;ve been a customer for 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next thing I know, Cindy hung up on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I no longer buy their lip balm &amp; I never liked any of their other products like their toothpaste, shampoo, etc., Desert Essence is going to be losing one more customer based on how I was treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course it&#x27;s obvious by being hung up on, that Desert Essence doesn&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> Have used this stick for years ....always loved it ...did not know where to by it as our co-op no longer carries it. May buy the cleaning pads soon.</li>
            <li> LOVE this! Been using for few years. Great for any skin irritation. Recommend to all my friends!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it&#x27;s a great alternative to alcohol-based blemish sticks.  I have sensitive skin and this has just enough strength to get rid of blemishes without drying out my skin or turning it red.</li>
            <li> Got this for my young daughter who is already experiencing acne. The box says not to use on children, but so far, we&#x27;ve had no adverse effects. Quite the contrary, this product works very well! Very noticeable, visible difference overnight. Now sometimes a pimple just has to run its course, but most new bumps, if we catch them in time, will disappear overnight with one application of Desert Essence. I would recommend to a friend, and we&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again. I use it, too!</li>
            <li> This is the best treatment I&#x27;ve found for small breakouts.  It really works. Fair price. Natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t stain or show as it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I use it for bug bites and pimples and it dries everything up in a couple of days. Even though the roll on is small this product lasts a long time. I will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. If I have a pimple or other condition I simply wash the area and then apply the stick. So far it always has disappeared within 2 -3 days. I even ordered one this time to send to my niece in Germany, since she is suffering from  a breakout on her face.</li>
            <li> I will roll this on a pimple or if I am starting to see a breakout and literally it will be significantly better within a few HOURS! I almost didn&#x27;t believe the reviews at first but it really works. The only downside I have seen is that I am going through the bottle pretty quickly. I think it is because when I first started using the product I would really roll a lot on my blemishes. So now I have tried to just put a little bit on and I am still getting the same results. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted a roll-on essential oil formula for travel, and the ingredients in this looked like what I needed. Not so much for issues with spots, but for refreshing and handling minor bites or cuts. The stick is fantastic for relieving itchy bug bites, although I gave just 4 stars because it can sting for some people. It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but my young daughter is a little wary of the brief stinging sensation -- although she stops scratching her bites within one minute! Also a couple of times have used it for spots and it removed the redness and swelling within hours. A good quality, all-natural product safe for most people.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good reviews on acne skin.&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to help some, at least I think so. Not very much difference I saw but didn&#x27;t really use it for more than two weeks because I couldnt stand the smell. The smell can nearly knock you down at first, its very strong. And as a guy, it really lingered on my skin and I just stopped taking it because of the smell alone. Maybe some girls can handle it but I don&#x27;t think guys can.</li>
            <li> This stuff works for everything - I just replaced my windex for cuts, blemishes, bites, etc......&lt;br /&gt;--Jerry</li>
            <li> This is pretty much the best things I&#x27;ve ever bought! My blemishes almost instantly became less noticeable, they weren&#x27;t red at all! It seems like it would last a long time. It&#x27;s a decent size, and it doesn&#x27;t take much at all. The first time I used it, I got compliments on how much more clear my face looked. I will buy this again, no doubt.</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it&#x27;s helping the acne or blemishes, but it sure feels and smell good. The only problem is sometimes the stick releases too much of the liquid.</li>
            <li> The tea tree in this product is refreshing and does a good job of quickly drying out blemishes. It is nice to have a portable little stick for a quick touch up!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found another product that helps get rid of breakouts quicker, without leaving a chemical burn on my skin in the process.</li>
            <li> easy to apply and works very well on pimples&lt;br /&gt;it has a very strong scent but it is not an unpleasant one</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this works 100%, but it does seem to help with the smaller breakouts I used to get along my jaw line.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells and feels on my skin.  It is small enough to fit in a pocket and take with you anywhere for anytime, and it is my go-to when I feel a blemish creeping up.</li>
            <li> I get blemishes quite a bit. Less breakouts now that I use the oil cleanse method. This works the best for spot treatment and quick removal of a blemish.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful product! I recommend it to all my friends and family to keep around the house for all blemishes--bites, stings, cuts, scrapes, zit, boil. It does have a plant like scent but that&#x27;s what you get with an all natural product and it doesn&#x27;t linger for very long. It isn&#x27;t repulsive and I will continue to buy this product for many more years!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and would never be without this stuff. It&#x27;s good for everything, bug bites, kitty scratches, skin irritations.  They used to sell it at Trader Joe&#x27;s and I got hooked on it then.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks, I haven&#x27;t seen a change in my blemishes. It tingles a little when you put it on-some may not like that! I am still using it but I haven&#x27;t seen a difference.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best items I have ever found for your face. It does sting when you put it on, but that goes away quickly. This takes the place of those acne products that are full of things you can&#x27;t pronounce, and wouldn&#x27;t put on your face if you knew what it was. I try to keep two on hand just in case I forget and don&#x27;t reorder when the first one runs out.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves them</li>
            <li> I have the Desert Essence 20% Australian Tea Tree Oil and it works better than the Blemish Touch stick. I will probably continue using the other option instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, not bad, just not as strong and fast as the other one.</li>
            <li> Where has the Desert Essence Blemish Touch Stick been my whole life??!! Seriously! I would have loved to discover this product about 10 years ago. I have used other topical treatments for blemishes/spots that have been moderately successful but are very drying and full of chemicals. This stick is full of natural ingredients and essential oils. It does NOT overly dry out my skin, but it does quickly reduce the size/appearance of blemishes (within 1 day, 2 days for bigger/deeper/older blemishes). It feels and smells good and natural to use. I have even used it on emerging cold sores and have been able to get rid of the sore before it became a problem. It is truly a miracle stick. I use this at least 2+ times per day (more often if I have an emerging blemish) in combination with the Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean Face Wash (highly recommended also). In addition to being in love with this blemish stick, I&#x27;m becoming obsessed with the Desert Essence line of products because of their natural ingredients and lack of animal testing. If you are looking for a few face regimen, I highly recommend giving this and their face wash a try! This is the first time since I was in high school that I feel comfortable without putting on make up, because my face is so clear and clean!</li>
            <li> Seems to dry up the area decently. Have gotten to like Dessert Essence items. Use the wash. Blemish stick throughout day if had breakout. Ointment through night and seems good. Now for a blackhead mask.</li>
            <li> Despite being a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product, this stuff works amazingly well, and I have bought it over and over. At the pricey natural-foods market where I usually get it, apparently, it is super popular as well. Use this to prevent blackheads, and to treat smaller, surface pimples - smaller breakouts will disappear literally within a matter of hours. For deeper blemishes, this  will help, but more serious zits won&#x27;t be wiped out quite so quickly with this. It&#x27;s great for smaller blemishes that pop up on the sides of the nose where your glasses sit (pores clogged from the pressure and contact of the glasses), and other surface irritations. When reaching into the medicine cabinet and choosing between this and a drugstore OTC zit cream (with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid), this would be my choice, every time, on mere efficacy alone. The fact that is it &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and has a lovely, clean smell is just a bonus.</li>
            <li> Smells nice. I received it in the new green packaging instead of the white shown in the picture but nothing to be concerned about since they are the same thing. Appears to work for most blemishes.</li>
            <li> I love this! It is clear so you can apply through out the day and not worry about it being noticable.  I am reordering 3.... one for home, one for my purse, and one for my desk at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I breakout frequently and have found that this really helps!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product. It didn&#x27;t help with blemishes it dried out my skin and made any spot bright red. I like some of their other products, this one just isn&#x27;t very good for me. Maybe it&#x27;s just to strong for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find anything else that works as well as this does for easing the pain or itch from a mosquito bite, hives, blemishes, hangnails, small rashes, etc. If it doesn&#x27;t work with the first application, it most likely will with the second.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  Great for quick spot treatment.</li>
            <li> Works great for healing small cuts especially cat scratches.</li>
            <li> Best natural product for pimples, it clears them up in a day or two. I can&#x27;t ever be without it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have suffered from cystic acne for quite some time. It prevents breakouts, and if I lax on use, it catches the acne before it becomes large and painful.</li>
            <li> Excellent blemish stick that works!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like giving bad reviews, but I just have to be honest and say that this isn&#x27;t really working for me. Maybe it works for some people, and I really wanted this to work because I like a lot of the other products from this company, but it just isn&#x27;t working for my skin. I&#x27;ll keep buying other products from Desert Essence, but I&#x27;ll have to pass on this one next time.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my friend. She swore on it and said it worked on everything like pimples, insect bites. I was skeptical but ended up buying this for me and two other friends and it works great! My friends love it too and they were out of it within a week! It works super fast too. Within a few hours you can see results.</li>
            <li> Nice effective formulation in an easy to use applicator</li>
            <li> This is one of the best prices for something that&#x27;s hard to find in stores (health stores seem to stock tea tree oil itself, but the roller makes it so much easier to use), and the strength is terrific. My teenaged kids use it for acne and I find it useful for all manner of skin problems -- from adult pimples to disinfecting.</li>
            <li> I have tried many number of products in order to get rid of my marks and blemishes. Nothing worked as effectively as this does. This product is Fantastic  and Natural!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many years and love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Seems to work well enough.. but it goes fast!</li>
            <li> This stick works on years old blemishes! I used it on everything from old acne blemishes, on bug bites,  and even my dark underarms...I swear it worked on all! I&#x27;ve been using for 2 weeks now and I have seen a total difference. The smell isn&#x27;t so great, but the payoff of a clearer complexion outweighs the minor stench.</li>
            <li> Cant &#x27;t use on face because of terrible odor... if it stinks to me... must stink to those around me...</li>
            <li> Works great for break outs! Yes, it does work!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so puzzled about WHY a great product is changed to different ingredients ~ which no longer offer the same positive results?  This is one of those puzzling products.  BUT, I have found that most everything that i have used from DESERT ESSENCE has changed - offering less beneficial impact but more expense.  Time for me to CHANGE my buying habits!</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to work pretty good. So far all of the pimples/blemishes that I apply it to are gone quickly. I need more time to determine for sure, but so far Im pretty impressed by it.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  I began to use this after it was recommended by my sister!  Now I don&#x27;t leave home without it.  It really helps to dry up blemishes quickly!</li>
            <li> BAD ODOR.  I wanted so badly for this stick to be effective.  But I couldn&#x27;t bare the smell of the oil.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Best natural blemish product around!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and have gotten many friends hooked on it.  It is a nice, natural solution for drying up pimples.  It works quickly and is easy to use, just dab it on your zit, and away it goes.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product a number of years ago, for a young relative who was having pubescent/hormonal breakouts and at the time the main ingredient was tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this review is for the ORIGINAL formula only...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were great and she really liked it a lot. It is small enough to keep in your glove compartment, hand bag or inside pocket in a sport-coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: If you recycle (and would like to save a little $$$) Save your applicator bottle and buy your own tea Tree Oil and MAKE YOUR OWN anti-acne formula; using about 2tbsp of The Homestead Company pure 100% Witch Hazel (alcohol-free) and about 2drops Tea Tree but the best ratio is about 2-3 drops tea tree oil for every 1-2ounces of alcohol-free witch hazel used--you can use the dropper to transfer your solution if you don&#x27;t have a small enough stainless steel funnel)- )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, A few people have complained about changes in the ingredient ratios, but it does state that there are still NO synthetic ingredients, so I am hoping that it is still a great option if you don&#x27;t have a lot of time to make your own astringent concoctions at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: If you also need to use a &#x27;sanitizing&#x27; agent on the skin due to acne, psoriasis, eczema or other sensitive skin issues; then cleanse skin with Natural-Cosmetics&#x27; Raw Handmade African Black Soap from Ghana (only 4-5 total ingredients)--, and then &#x27;sanitize&#x27; the skin with 90% medical-grade rubbing alcohol, before toning with alcohol-free witch hazel-- and then apply layer of pure Aloe Vera Gel under light layer of coconut oil and then spot treat with your homemade witch hazel-tea-tree oil anti-acne formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Now, even if you can only budget for the Natural Cosmetics&#x27; Black Soap and Aloe plus Coconut Oil to treat your condition, I promise you will see a difference in your skin in LESS than 1-month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, as a back-up, the original formula of this blemish stick is/was really great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Grade B (original formulary); or 4-Stars./&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Grade B (original formulary); or 4-Stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years as a bug repellent... especially when traveling to exotic places around the world. I just roll on a little on my lower legs, upper arms and nape of my neck... and BAM... no mosquito bites!! in the rare chance that I do get bitten... I dab some of this on and it helps with the itchiness and gets my skin healing quick!</li>
            <li> Smells awesome but did nothing for me. Actually, this in combination with the face wash dried out my skin and I&#x27;m about 80% sure it made breakouts worse.</li>
            <li> I use this religiously whenever I feel a zit coming on--it&#x27;s magic for those lurkers that never seem to go away! It dries out the skin, yeah, but it works incredibly quickly if you use it frequently. It doesn&#x27;t work very well on blackheads (in my experience) but it works really well on whiteheads and zits.</li>
            <li> We have tried it all, and so far this is the best.  Try it for yourself, I&#x27;m sure you or someone you love will be very happy</li>
            <li> I received a totally different packaged product... i was surprised. I didn&#x27;t return it and started using what i received. IT works fine but I hate the smell. Tea tree does not smell good, but it gives awesome results. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this product.  Easy to use, comes in a jar with a metal roller top so there is no squeezing and you don&#x27;t have to touch it or rub it in.  I apply it directly to the area needed.  With that said, the only thing I would consider is making this for your use only (ie don&#x27;t share with any family members, etc).  It&#x27;s not overbearing or drying</li>
            <li> Good product that really works. I wil b y more wh en my b o t t l e is empty.</li>
            <li> this is good for daily prevention. I dont think this will cure acne or treat pimples that have freshly developed but i find that this helps heal my acne and keeps it from returning. I use this every morning right after i wash my face. I only use this on my problem areas not my entire face. i often get pimples that are deep under the skin and can&#x27;t be squeezed out. so I end up with a lot of purple scarring for months. I like this product because it feel clean when i put it on. Its not messy and very easy to travel with and to apply on my face. a lot of people compare this to witch hazel or a toner but I dont get that feeling. most toners leave residue or some kind of odd feeling layer on top of my skin, whereas this simply feels clean. like cold water. I just enjoy it.</li>
            <li> this stuff works great for my adult acne</li>
            <li> I originally found this at Trader Joes but they no longer carry it.  YOu have to order it online :(  The old formula was the best but the new formula still works you just need to apply it more often.  I think it&#x27;s watered down.&lt;br /&gt;use it on&lt;br /&gt;Bug bits&lt;br /&gt;rashes&lt;br /&gt;eczema&lt;br /&gt;pimples</li>
            <li> One of my first reviews for a beauty product. It works - I have used it on my pimples and blemishes. You have to apply it a couple of times.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product...it really works.</li>
            <li> My aunt had this at her house and I tried it and it worked great. The only problem I have had ordering this online in the past is that some times it evaporates during shipping. When it did happen the seller immediately sent another one that was full.</li>
            <li> Product did not rid blemishes and it broke me out. I suggest using just a little before applying all over skin</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is naturally antibacterial which can eliminate acne by controlling the bacteria that causes it. But should always be diluted or for many it will irritate skin, this feels just like straight tea tree oil did. This product stung when I applied it, so I only applied to bigger zits, after 4 days I noticed no improvement whatsoever. Did not decrease acne. Irritated my skin tho to the point that I can&#x27;t apply makeup comfortably. My face is pink in spots I applied it to, hurts to wash with very mild cleanser and cant apply calming moisturizer without it burning.  It is also tight and flaky causing It to feel very aggitated. Regret buying this a lot. My face will heal in a week but I wasted ten bucks. I like natural items, so was drawn to this product, tea tree oil cost less and can be diluted unlike this rolling ball applicator, and is somewhat effective. I recommend any store brand zit zapper over this product.</li>
            <li> This really helps with the small bumps that I get on my face sometimes. Keeps my face clean and clear. Yes it does have a strong odor but it disappears after a while. I use it at night before bed. It stings but the stinging also goes away after few seconds.</li>
            <li> I am trying to get away from peroxide acne treatments, or topical antibiotic treatments.  I have just started using this, but I am very impressed with it!  I also like that it is much more natural.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for stopping the itch of bug bites, and works well for taking care of blemishes too!</li>
            <li> Worked great on my posion ivy!!!!</li>
            <li> Between my own acne, and my son&#x27;s mosquito bites this product is great to have stashed everywhere.  In my purse, around the house.  I never feel bad using it on my son  (who has extremely sensitive skin).  It truly helps him get through the summer months when the mosquitos are really out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!!  This Blemish stick&#x27;s uses aren&#x27;t limited to blemishes though.  I use it on mosquito bites and it immediately relieves the pain and itching (being allergic to them I develop welts not the typical little bites).  With zits there is nothing better.  If you happen to put it on one that feels like it&#x27;s starting -- it will not fully develop.  If you have one -- no matter how big or small -- it will work like magic making the redness disappear sometimes as quickly as overnight.  Within 2-3 days all signs of the zit are gone.  This works well on my 40ish skin as well as my teenage niece&#x27;s skin.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> Love this product! so handy and effective! great for families with kids, all those summer bug bites! I also bought one for my teenage sister and we noticed an improvement on her blemishes from the start. great price and a definite must have for first aid kit, purse, car!</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time several years ago for an itchy spot on my nose that had been bothering me for a decade. After 2-3 applications the itching disappeared and returned after a month or so. Ever since then, I have repeated the cycle, re-applying every time the itch returns. I have no idea how it works, but it works. If I were marooned on a desert island, I hope I would have been able to grab this product before jumping ship. Indispensable.</li>
            <li> Love these for when you have blemishes that you want gone quickly.  It also prevents them, which is great when you feel the tingle of one coming on.</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s smell is loud I liken it to a man that smells as though he took a bath in cologne.</li>
            <li> a great natural way to treat blemishes  It has worked well for me and my family.  It does burn a little bit, but then it&#x27;s soothing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  Not only is it natural it works awesome!  I&#x27;ll never go back to chemical based blemish sticks!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use the Burts Bees blemish stick before, as well, and I think I prefer that one. This one definitely works - breakouts shrink really fast when you apply this. It&#x27;s smelly but I have never found one that isn&#x27;t. I just remember having somewhat better luck with the Burt&#x27;s Bees one. Overall, not a bad product, though!</li>
            <li> I love this product - works especially well on keeping white heads from further infection.  Used to buy it at my favorite &amp;#34;alternate&amp;#34; supermarket chain but they quit carrying it.  Thrilled to find it here.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years but have to keep chasing down new sources to buy it, for some reason.  I buy several at a time because I always find that when my family is home, they inevitably ask if I have an extra one they could have!  Great for blemishes but also for any cut, little nick or abrasion, including cold sores.  Dabbing it on every few hours makes nearly every problem disappear in a day or so.  I am a HUGE fan of this product!</li>
            <li> If I feel a blemish coming out, I use the stick after I wash (morning and night).  It usually only takes until the next day for me.  My son waits until a blemish appears and then it seems to take 2-3 days.  Discovered it about a year ago after many, many years of using products that either did nothing and/or irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the Blemish Touch Stick! It works great on acne and it&#x27;s helped clear up pimples within a couple of days!</li>
            <li> it helped zap the pimples but the smell was hurrendous and it hurt and burned so bad i couldnt take it</li>
            <li> I love these tea tree sticks, and the entire desert essence line in general. They are great for after the gym, during the summer and for any other time you want to feel clean and refreshed. Fair warning however, tea tree can really sting your face, which I don&#x27;t really mind. My friend on the other hand once used this stick and was put off by the pain. The only problem with buying these online is that quality control is hard to manage. Once or twice I have gotten these products off amazon when half of the stick was already empty. I will always recommend this brand, but I would would be careful of the seller you buy from online.</li>
            <li> This little touch stick is amazing. Use it on the first sign of a blemish and it&#x27;s very unlikely that blemish will be there tomorrow. I wouldn&#x27;t be without one.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice that this helped much with the blemish I have. It is just a dark spot on my face but the great thing about this stick as opposed to some of the other tea tree products I&#x27;ve tried is It doesn&#x27;t smell horrible.</li>
            <li> I love the desert essence brand. This tea tree oil blemish stick works magic. throw it on at the first sight of a zit and will definitely help the healing process.</li>
            <li> Totally clears up blemishes fast! I love it! Great product!</li>
            <li> I used this product on my face and although it was good for ridding pimples, it did burn my skin which also turned to a flaky rash. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It works as well as salicylic acid spot treatments that I&#x27;ve used in the past, plus it&#x27;s cooling when it&#x27;s applied. The alcohol is not over-drying. Be aware, though, that tea tree oil has a distinctive smell, especially when applied this close to your nose!</li>
            <li> Burns your skin and left me with worse scars</li>
            <li> Great for blemishes. I tried for impetigo on my daughter, it seemed to helped, but she screemed how much it was hurting her. If there is an open sore or scratch, it burnes. I use it all the time on blemishes and it works good.</li>
            <li> worked great for my daughter</li>
            <li> WARNING: The minute you obsessively apply this product to your spots will be the day you hate it and never use it again, and trust me, you do NOT want to hate this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on my third blemish touch stick, and in the beginning, I had to learn moderation the hard way. The first time I used it, I kept reapplying it throughout the day and it eventually burned my skin. Obviously, this was my own fault. Now that I know how to properly use it (I rub it on any spots about 4-5 times a day), it has become my holy grail of acne spot treatments. Not only is it convenient to carry around at all times, whether I&#x27;m at work, school, etc., but it actually works without any unpleasant side effects. It doesn&#x27;t cause the surrounding skin to become dry and flaky like other spot treatments, and the rolling ball allows for a quick and easy application. The blemish stick is a part of my daily routine, and a crucial part at that; I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it!</li>
            <li> Ive broken out twice recently and used this product on the pimples. I think it has helped healing time by a few days (sometimes my acne takes 2 weeks to clear up) - one breakout was gone in 3-4 days. It has a very strong minty type scent and even stings a little but it makes me feel like its working. Its no miracle product but Ill keep using it because it at least keeps the breakouts manageable.</li>
            <li> Truly amazing.  Not sure about the blemish claim as I have been most lucky in the skin department.  But..when those bites happen, one roll of this on it and the itch is gone.  Also.... I used it on a patch of skin that always is itchy in colder months and it&#x27;s gone in no time.  Love this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this blemish stick.  I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and still have issues with blemishes.  After cleaning my face with a natural face cleaner, I roll this over my blemishes and it truly makes them dry up more expediently.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> If you get a zit there is nothing better....4-5 times a day for 2 or 3 days and that baby is history! Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters and they really like it. It keeps their blemishes under control and seems to really clear them up over night. They say it burns a bit if the skin is open but other than that they like it.</li>
            <li> This is a good supplement to the Desert Essence tea tree face wash for fighting acne.  My teenage son has been using both for two months and we&#x27;ve noticed a significant improvement in his complexion.  It&#x27;s easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> Love this stick! Works great!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product but I don&#x27;t feel as though it helped much.. perhaps it&#x27;s not geared to those with more pigmented skin tones...</li>
            <li> This works great on blemishes.  Just apply to a pimple 2 - 3 times a day and it goes away within a day or two.</li>
            <li> I was a little reluctant when I purchased this. I&#x27;m not sure why I was so reluctant but I&#x27;m guessing it was because I have tried SO MANY products to help my skin. I have never in my life had acne, but at 33 it started and oh my it hurts. I have fair skin with freckles across my nose for those that wonder about skin type. Some of the places on my face get cystic with hard knots under the skin, they get soooooo red and irritated and when they finally start to go down they leave a big scar. I recently had two of them on my forehead that were very very painful, red and as gross as this is to admit they leaked ( horrifying )  so I couldn&#x27;t hide any of it with make up. So I tried this and I while I will admit that I have a lot of products that I try I truly believe this is what helped. It took about a week and one lump is GONE and the other can no longer be seen and you can feel that its much smaller however it&#x27;s still there. I didn&#x27;t want to write a review until I knew if this product worked or not and I was surprised at how fast I got a result. I was so happy with the results on my forehead after just a week, that I decided to go ahead and write this. Not everything will work the same for everyone But this worked for me and has a great smell that&#x27;s rather relaxing. Caution it burns at first be prepared!</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it on a variety skin problems with much success.</li>
            <li> Husband swears by this stuff and he likes the convenience of the stick.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!! Worked wonders for clearing up my daughter&#x27;s acne!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It really works....almost overnight.</li>
            <li> I have used tree oil mixed with witch hazel to clear up blemishes for for years.  Put the mix on a cotton pad and miracles follow.  I&#x27;m travelling, so I decided to buy this product, rather than bring liquids with me.  I developed a large pimple - of course - and used this product, expecting it to work like my home remedy.  It did nothing.  Toothpaste did more than this product.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts when I bought this product.  I have had severe acne throughout my teen years up to my 20s.  After two courses of Accutane my skin has finally become manageable.  I still suffer from the occasional cyst here and there especially on my forehead.  My forehead is an oil rig, it never stops pumping oil.  When it gets really oily (towards the end of the day) my forehead gets really itchy and I always break out in cysts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I needed something natural that would soothe and heal my skin, kill the bacteria and  minimize oil production.  I had my doubts when I came across this product because it contained essential oils.  I thought it would add oil to my already oily skin, boy was I wrong.  It contains Witch Hazel and natural grain alcohol along with the essential oils so when it comes out there&#x27;s absolutely no oily residue.  I have to admit it has a strong smell from all the extracts it contains but it&#x27;s bearable and eventually fades after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My skin care routine is as follows, I was my face with Dessert Essence Thoroughly clean face wash, apply Dessert Essence Daily Essential face moisturizer with jojoba, I wait a few minutes and then I apply the Blemish touch stick to my oily areas (my forehead, nose) and that&#x27;s it.  I Just roll a thin layer covering my entire forehead and nose.  It feels great when I apply it on my skin and most importantly it does it&#x27;s job.  It heals red spots, browns spots, prevents new cysts and pustules from forming and reduces oil.  I wish I found this product sooner but I&#x27;m glad I finally did.  It&#x27;s great for acne suffers because it not only fights breakouts but it nourishes and heals the skin NATURALLY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have severe oil production like me this product is a god send for us, please give it a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  This is coming from a guy who suffered through hell with his skin.  Thank you Dessert Essence for making such great products that actually work and are all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;take carer /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;take care</li>
            <li> This anti-blemish stick is ok but not as good as putting diluted tea tree onto a cotton and cleaning your face with it. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that strong but it&#x27;s good for me when travelling and I can&#x27;t carry the tea tree and cotton. I think it works best if you catch your pimples very early and treat them frequently, otherwise its effectiveness is greatly diminished.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years since my coworker told me about it, it get rids dark marks, pimples and if you dint mind the strong teactree smell the. This product is for you...I can&#x27;t live without it...love this stuff.. I&#x27;m African American so finding a product that don&#x27;t change your skin time is hard, but this one is one of the best</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well for many types of skin irritations.</li>
    </ol>
