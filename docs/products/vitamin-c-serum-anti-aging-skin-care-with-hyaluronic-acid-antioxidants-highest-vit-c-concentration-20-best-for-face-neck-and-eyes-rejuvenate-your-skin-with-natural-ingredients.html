            <li>Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>I have a much more youthful appearance and my skin drinks this serum in!!</li>
            <li>The seller contacted me because I had a concern and was very kind and helpful.</li>
            <li>Of course I was very enthusiastic when I was asked to review OUI skincare</li>
            <li>I have experienced amazing customer service as well!</li>
            <li>It has very nice packaging and a pleasant citrus smell.  </li>
            <li>The difference in skin is remarkable.</li>
            <li>And the company is really awesome to their customers :-)</li>
            <li>Love it,best of the best for your face.</li>
            <li>So, I can honestly say this one works!    </li>
            <li>I am totally loving it!  </li>
            <li>It honestly feels like I&#x27;m getting a $250 serum at a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Vitamin C serum for years and this is a good one at a great price.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to death with the Vitamin C Serum!</li>
            <li>I am Loving Coui!</li>
            <li>Excellent service, fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the quality of this vitamin C serum and also the fact that it is offered at a great price.  </li>
            <li>This product is good for erasing brown spots.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so it is noticable if I don&#x27;t use a good C serum.  </li>
            <li>But surprisingly, coui serum even prevents cystic acne that I always had.</li>
            <li>Good for face</li>
            <li>Oui feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>you will need to shake as it says, the smell to me is a wonderful light citrus.</li>
            <li>I found this product and loved the introduction price, and said I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>The package looks nice, and there is great customer service.</li>
            <li>so you are welcome to your own conclusions.  </li>
            <li>and then I follow with a good moisturizer with sunscreen.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to give it a fair shot.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good Vitamin C Serum at a fair price</li>
            <li>Firstly I really loved the fact that this serum came in a box.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>When I heard on Dr. Oz show how Vitamin C serum can be good for the skin</li>
            <li>so it feels good once I apply it.</li>
            <li>Everyone comments on how good my face looks.</li>
            <li>Feels good on your skin and refines its texture.</li>
            <li>Good price for vitamin c serum.  </li>
            <li>and I was delighted to find that it also replaces all the moisturizers I used to use on my skin.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t nearly as good.</li>
            <li>something (I have fair skin), like porcelain.  </li>
            <li>I loved the ingredients and consistency of this product.</li>
            <li>I have really good results with it.</li>
            <li>It feels good</li>
            <li>Keep up with the good work and products.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>I am reordering month 2 in anticipation of continued good results.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t believe something that does not absorb and coats your face in a sticky wax like substance would really do much good anyways.</li>
            <li>I feel Vitamin C is good for my skin, but I don&#x27;t think I can put up with this.</li>
            <li>This stuff is REALLY GOOD.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good serum after I applied on my face .</li>
            <li>Because of my results, I wanted to share a good thing with my cousin and a dear friend.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist even asked me what I was using on my face to have it looking so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see how awesome my skin is going to look after long-term use.</li>
            <li>I also love how it smells and it goes on beautifully, soaking into my skin almost immediately.</li>
            <li>Amazing, remarkable, miracle stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very happy with how quickly I received my product and the quality of the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and now I am using the Super C also rotating it with this product and am seeing excellent results with it also.  </li>
            <li>I am super happy withthis company and their products, no kidding!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super happy with this serum and plan on buying it again!</li>
            <li>Many compliments since using the products that my skin looks great. .</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve always used C serum, and was using a different brand of C serum that I thought was working well, but I switched to this one because of the launch price, which is awesome BTW, but upon receiving it I found this one to have much better ingredients than the product I was using before, and upon using it I was very impressed with the way it felt on my skin and how my skin reacted to it.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, Love it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly what it&#x27;s doing, as I use really good products and take great care of my skin, but I feel good about it as an addition to my routine.</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT PRODUCT&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;different than the Super C, thinner consistency, and for me, it seems to hydrate my skin better...</li>
            <li>Smells great, absorbs quickly, skin looks Dewey,radiant,more even toned and,I loved the price.</li>
            <li>Best of all,my large sunspot is getting lighter.</li>

            <li>A product must be accepted by the skin to be effective.  </li>
            <li>While I knew this information, it showed me that they really care about giving their clients the best</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because I can&#x27;t comment honestly about whether or not it does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>but i didn&#x27;t use it, they were nice to deal with.</li>
            <li>I liked this vitamin C product.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot for the great product!</li>
            <li>and I have been thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great customer service too!!</li>
            <li>I think the quality is very good, just not the right product for me.</li>
            <li>It even has a pleasant light citrus smell.  </li>
            <li>So I was looking for a good vitamin c serum that was easily absorbable and would help with my acne scars.</li>
            <li>The Super C one works great on wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and.......</li>
            <li>Love, love this product!  </li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks great and was told, for the first time in years, that my skin looked like it was glowing!</li>
            <li>So far the best vitamin c serum I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li>Gives skin a nice healthy glow</li>
            <li>This one is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>i have tried alot of vitamin C serums and this one is by far the best!!  </li>
            <li>It is light and feels good on the skin but showed no improvement for me.  </li>
            <li>Most effective toner I have ever used..</li>
            <li>So far, the best serum I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li>It is the best professional Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and she&#x27;s been using it for about two weeks, she really enjoys it, was surprised at the great price given the quality of the product and is trying to get me to buy her more before the price goes up!  :D</li>
            <li>A couple of very fine lines are no longer there.  </li>
            <li>Having done more research, I discovered that the form of Vitamin C in this product is not the kind that is the most beneficial for skin.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many vitamin C products and by far this is the best.  </li>
            <li>Love the feel, love the way my skin looks, love the product, love the price!  </li>
            <li>this product has been pretty great</li>
            <li>and it feels so good going on cool.</li>
            <li>It has made an amazing difference in my skin tone and lessened my fine lines.  </li>
            <li>but I was kind of hoping for some improvement to sun damage and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>great product..will certainly buy again,,also recommended to all my friends, DMH</li>
            <li>It has very nice, tingling feeling when applied and is absorbed very quickly.</li>
            <li>It has already made a huge difference in my blackheads!  </li>
            <li>and I can tell a huge difference in my skin!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product and will order it now for the 3rd time.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks superb and the wrinkle lines on my neck are finally diminishing.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again for great products.</li>
            <li>i LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks better every day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several C serums and this one is the best for results.  </li>
            <li>The price makes it affordable to use when so many anti-aging products are out of my price range.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing and feeling the results and am so pleased with  this product.</li>
            <li>According to research (as of this date) the better forms of vitamin c for the skin are Tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate or Sodium ascorbyl phosphate.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Then its just a matter of finding reputable products.</li>
            <li>I will probably continue my search for a better product.  </li>
            <li>For now I will continue my search for better results.</li>
            <li>This serum is such an awesome product!</li>
            <li>Another thing that bothered me was that most had the consistency of water and even looked like water that is until  I received OUI skincare’s Vitamin C serum as a gift.</li>
            <li>My skin also feels more elasticized.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have suggested  it to many of my friends and my daughter.</li>
            <li>and I can assure you , if you try this you will love it.</li>
            <li>Love you Coui.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I used to make my own Vitamin C serum (all of the ingredients are on Amazon) to maximize efficacy of the product--concentration, and more importantly</li>
            <li>Although most of the products I tried felt luxurious on the skin, I didn&#x27;t see long-term results.  </li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it is packaged in a brown glass bottle (not plastic) which will prolong the potency of the Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found that my skin responds better to the OUI Serum.  </li>
            <li>and I am very impressed with the way it left my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li>Love the back-up received.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t regret buying it :)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to use it more weeks to see if the lines around my mouth disappears.</li>
            <li>I am 59 and have used many C&amp; E over the years.</li>
            <li>I love this product and give it a 5 star.</li>
            <li>Magic is all I can say.  </li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x60;m saving money because it works SO well that I don&#x60;t have to buy several of the products I bought BEFORE I found your wonderful serum!</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of it.</li>
            <li>i think my face looks plumper, more luminous.healthy</li>

            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>I am really thrilled with this product and am so excited that it works so well.</li>
            <li>I was using Ole Henriksen&#x27;s Truth Serum and was getting pretty good results, but I noticed that by the end of the day, the effects of the serum were mostly gone.</li>
            <li>and it seems to be working pretty good on me.</li>
            <li>I thought it was pretty good.</li>
            <li>The age spots are not as prominent, the fine lines look smoother and the over all appearance has a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the money!!  </li>

            <li>A friend sent me what she claimed was the \\&quot;latest, most advanced, vitamin C 20% serum.</li>
            <li>I think is a good product, I can see good results next day when I wake up</li>
            <li>This is a great Vit C serum, it appears to help faden dark spots and make complexion more all over bright and even skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Ok I got this one with the super C!</li>
            <li>I have used other Vitamin C products purchased from my dermatologist, for much more money, and this product has shown the best results on my skin!</li>

            <li>I did have a problem with my second order but seller was able to compensate and make sure I am happy within a day.</li>
            <li>And unlike many products the instructions are detailed.</li>
            <li>I apply it directly to my face, it feels great.</li>
            <li>even think that my sunspots are becoming lighter .&lt;br /&gt;I am now applying it generously on my neck and am looking forward to the results.</li>
            <li>They have never felt so soft and my skin looks great</li>
            <li>So far, I am happy with the OUI Skincare Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>Also I was very pleased that the company contacted me and sent me an email on exactly how to use the serum and things to watch out for.  </li>
            <li>A lot of sellers on amazon.com do that for asking good review, but I could feel coui company really care about their customers.</li>
            <li>After only 3 days I am seeing good results!  </li>
            <li>I live for great products and I have been using this for 3 weeks and see a significant change in my skin.</li>

            <li>Product is easy to use and goes on smoothly.</li>

            <li>In the 4 months I have been using this product, my skin is brighter, age spots have diminished and fine lines are not as noticeable.</li>
            <li>My skin looks brighter and fine lines have shown some improvement.</li>
            <li>Ok I  love experiments, so the first thing I did when I got this serum as a gift from my sister was smell and taste</li>
            <li>/&gt;It soaks into my skin very quickly and leaves my skin feeling like there is a protective barrier between my skin and the sun and any free radicals that may try to enter.</li>

            <li>It arrived in a beautiful, clean looking and super professional packaging.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much and recommend it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy w this product, and I intend to continue using it, especially because it&#x27;s not ridiculously overpriced!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s making a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>but I will post another review when I notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li>At 27, I simply want my skin to breathe, to be free from makeup and still look great.</li>
            <li>My pores were huge and I was getting blackheads</li>
            <li>nothing huge</li>
            <li>in my book this is HUGE.</li>
            <li>yet no one has accurately described it .</li>
            <li>despite being a huge sunscreen user.  </li>
            <li>A huge plus - this serum is clearing up the my blemish breakouts and my pores have lessened.</li>
            <li>If you make sure to apply as directed it brings a fresh looking skin.</li>
            <li>I have only used it a couple of days and my pores and complexion have greatly improved.</li>
            <li>serum is great and I am already ordering my next bottle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using OUI&#x27;s vitamin C serum for two weeks now and my boyfriend has already remarked at how smooth and supple my skin</li>
            <li>Adding this product to my facial regime was a great choice.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with the results and must tell you, this is painless and I look years younger.</li>
            <li>I would like to continue using Oui to keep that smooth look</li>
            <li>My skin is looking fresh and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I was paying $75 for a &amp;#34;big name&amp;#34; serum and this performs so much better, keeps your skin fresh and youthful.</li>
            <li>- it is thicker and goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>This serum lightly exfoliates also.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Exfoliation is important in order for skin renewal to take place.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth after about three weeks of the product.</li>
            <li>Vit C degrades with exposure to air, heat, light.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of making my skin look smoother, healthier, and younger.</li>
            <li>Smooth as a whistle.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry</li>
            <li>improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it is so cheap because it is sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I have light skin.</li>
            <li>My skin has become so smooth and even in color that I never wear makeup anymore.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a light citrus scent.</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>The vitamin C is actually L-ascorbic acid (the effective kind)  according to your site, and that is what compelled me to order &amp;#34;Oui&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>Good so far.</li>
            <li>So far, I used it for three days, so I can&#x27;t verify if it&#x27;s doing any good to my skin, which is why I am giving a 4 star instead of 5 star.</li>
            <li>So  far so good.  </li>
            <li>I have to say OUI is far superior and</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good product, but my sensitive skin broke out.</li>
            <li>I still have my suspicions about the price, yet so far so good.</li>
            <li>I just had to write a review because I feel so comfortable while using this amazing product, I just really recommend this to anyone at all and</li>
            <li>smell is great, like fresh  orange, but not much a little bit, it is light  </li>
            <li>I have tried many Vitamin C serums looking for the right one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to apply and works well under my moisturizer and sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It deeply hydrates and makes your skin feel fresh and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Obviously many users are very pleased with it, and I am also - but only at night.</li>
            <li>no oil, obsorbes very fast, I love it .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it had any effect on wrinkles, but for the even skin tone alone, it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li>This product has made a significant difference in the clarity, feel and over all look to my skin..</li>
            <li>This is certainly worth giving as a gift to your mom/sister/friend/anyone!</li>
            <li>I just received this product so I do not know the long term benefits, but it feels great on my skin</li>
            <li>Keeps me fresh!</li>
            <li>but I did not notice any signicant or even nearly significant changes.</li>
            <li>At first I was nervous but now am really pleased.  </li>
            <li>So worth it!</li>
            <li>I have been using the product every morning and evening I immediately saw difference in my skin, I am very pleased with the results so far and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>Worth a try!</li>
            <li>It all looked very aesthetic and clean and most importantly tamper free.</li>
            <li>I keep it in the refrigerator and use on a clean skin.</li>
            <li>I use the serum every night on a clean face and wait 10 to 15 minutes for it to penetrate.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a nice dropper to make sure that the product is used properly and helps prevent over pouring or spilling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li>so i showered that night and applied on clean skin and went to bed.  </li>
            <li>all those wonderful natural nutrients penetrating my cells and healing me of all of the daily toxins I encounter everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the stickiness - it is mildly sticky, rather than smooth, to apply.</li>
            <li>I alternate it with their super c serum which is also amazing!</li>
            <li>I also feel my skin seems brighter and have used less make-up because I feel more confident in my own skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are other good products out there, but I think you have to find the product that works for YOU.</li>
            <li>It is not thick so this is very easy.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure how many stars to give this, because for someone younger than me it will probably be just fine.  </li>
            <li>Just started on the Super Serum to use along with the original.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this, but I don&#x27;t feel it does much for my skin.  </li>
            <li>But the last two bottles I&#x27;ve received haven&#x27;t seemed to be as good of a product as before.</li>
            <li>Overall, REALLY REALLY good vitamin C serum in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This serum is in the sweet spot--</li>
            <li>A good topical Vit C is one of my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; products.  </li>
            <li>product is also very concentrated and potent.  </li>
            <li>product is also very concentrated and potent.  </li>
            <li>I also purchased a bottle for my mom, and she is in absolute love w/</li>
            <li>She always email me back ASAP her reply and gave me all the good info I needed.</li>
            <li>Full Disclosure</li>
            <li>I love tanning and have been doing so my whole life, as a result my skin suffered.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on some of the reviews I read, and because it was such a good price.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend it more highly!</li>
            <li>I am in my 60’s and have been using OUI Vitamin C serum for 3 months and must say I am very pleased with the results, I love being outside and because of this have brown spots on my face, this serum is amazing, the spots are fading with most gone altogether, I can see improvement in my skin tone and texture, the lines around my eyes and mouth are noticeably softer, my skin appearance is healthier and I am using a lot less makeup.  </li>
            <li>For years, I have tried many &amp;#34;dermatologist only&amp;#34; products and serums and have had very few results - OUI is outstanding!!  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m so happy to found coui company and going to try other products as well.</li>
            <li>My experience is that it burns going on and requires application of a moisturizer really quickly after applying it.  </li>
            <li>All dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and soft and looks more youthful.  </li>
            <li>This one and the super C was $50 dollars</li>
            <li>I use the serum once a day, along with the Super C serum (though I use the Super C serum twice a day).  </li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and in mint condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and makes your skin glow.  </li>
            <li>My skin seems smoother and softer, but don&#x27;t see any tremendous change yet in lines.  </li>
            <li>I use this product in the evening, and the Super C in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly</li>
            <li>I began using it before the Super C Serum was released</li>
            <li>so when I began using the Super C Serum</li>
            <li>am so looking forward to continuing to reap the benefits of this super serum.</li>
            <li>My skin is hydrated and plump, and my skin tone is evening out quickly.</li>
            <li>I just ordered their super c to try out this time.</li>
            <li>It has improved my skins appearance and given it a vibrant, healthy glow.</li>
            <li>reading a million reviews, I bought the COUI Super C Serum and the COUI Vitamin C Serum 20%.</li>
            <li>use the Super C 2x a day - morning and night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear and light and feels refreshing.</li>
            <li>I have used several Vit C 20% serums and I am most pleased with the results of the COUI serum.</li>
            <li>I also use the COUI Super C Serum with this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried the more expensive C serums and have found Coui the best of all of them.  </li>
            <li>I am now using Vitamin C super serum</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this potent skin care.</li>
            <li>There are other lipid forms of Vitamin C that are more stable than LAA, but they aren&#x27;t as effective (NIH, Vitamin C in dermatology).  </li>
            <li>In other words very, very, happy with the results I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li>stronger the taste and smell normally the better the effect.</li>
            <li>the great part about this product is that if it is not for your skin than there is 30 Day gaurentee back and thats the reason I actually make sure before buying any product.</li>
            <li>I alternate this product with the Super C Serum which also helps with my wrinkles, I love it as well!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation, just a slight tingling</li>
            <li>Smells fresh like citrus/orange, the scents fades away quickly.</li>
            <li>The first product I used had a light, fresh orange scent.</li>
            <li>This Product really works, You can see results very quickly.</li>
            <li>Recently added this to my usual regimen and really glad I did, I can see improvement in two weeks, and thats great!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>More even skin tone and less fine lines for sure.</li>
            <li>I noticed a significant difference within the first week.</li>
            <li>I am one of those that if it doesn&#x27;t help with that first one, I don&#x27;t buy it again!  </li>
            <li>Applied sparingly and let dry, it works synergistically  with my favorite moisturizer to make my skin feel tighter, yet  more supple and softer to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it just works differently; this seems to be a sit on top of your skin, where the Perricone absorbs very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love both the Super C and the Natural Vitamin C</li>
            <li>She swears by this product.&lt;br /&gt;The package looks great and the overall impression is very professional.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually gone out without foundation -- just a bit of concealer under my eyes and a swipe of mineral veil on top of my COUI sunscreen -- and looked perfectly fine.  </li>
            <li>I like the packaging too, specially the dark bottle and good service</li>
            <li>the results I am seeing in my skin in a short period of time (yes, two days) are truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have been a proud fan and user of the Ole Henrikson Vitamin C serum for about a year now but at  $30 for only a tiny bottle of 0.5oz it eventually seems to take out a huge chunk from my beauty budget.</li>
            <li>We have also added more quality anti-oxidants such as Ferulic Acid, vitamin E and others, in generous amounts, in order to create a powerful anti-oxidant serum that fights the free radicals that your skin encounters daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A fantastic price for a product that really works.</li>
            <li>I am 75 years old and have tried, unsuccessfully, many anti-aging products....</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll get back as to how she liked it.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Noticed one of the manufacturer&#x27;s response implied there was no need to include paraben..  since they made the product fresh with a recommended shelf-life of 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I rated this five stars because the product has ingredients known to work and the product is fresh.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just worth the hassle to me.</li>
            <li>So far, I am quite satisfied with these product.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I immediately bought a second bottle!  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t need to look any further, I found a product I liked and addressed my issues.  </li>
            <li>I have faith that the product is fresh</li>
            <li>I liked the product and reordered it, but the second bottle arrived with a defective seal and the product had leaked.</li>
            <li>My face feels fresh.</li>
            <li>I keep this in the refrigerator to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li>Face is back to clear and feels great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed Natural Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li>Worth the cost</li>
            <li>There are three words to describe this product: COUI Natural Vitamin C Serum 20%, “I LOVE IT”.  </li>
            <li>I looked into it and found articles suggesting that a strong C serum might be too much to start off with for some first time users.</li>
            <li>I did feel a tingle when I first tried but that went away fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Well it&#x27;s been a little over 7 months since I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently, and all I can say, it&#x27;s been one of the best products that I have ever used so far.</li>
            <li>I had purchased the Perricone MD Vitamin C Serum cream (in a tube) on a whim, and was impressed with it after a short time, but the price was so high (per unit volume) that I shopped for some potential lower priced alternatives.  </li>
            <li>My friend was right.</li>
            <li>It’s like, it feels right to use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got an email right away to ensure that I&#x27;ve received the product along with some skincare tips.</li>
            <li>I have to say that my skin has a beautiful clear heathy glow and at age 55 have minimal wrinkling.</li>
            <li>What I really like about this serum is it leaves your skin feeling fresh and full of moisture.  </li>
            <li>and I will only state a review which is thoroughly true and authentic.  </li>
            <li>This serum actually does contain a true 20% Vitamin C concentration, which many others do not have.  </li>
            <li>It reduced wrinkles, made my complexion clearer, and most important, reduced the large scar from a facial melanoma surgery.  </li>
            <li>The serum feels great on the skin, not the least bit oily, absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is loaded with great ingredients and after applying for few days, I felt a positive effect.</li>
            <li>You can really smell the vitamin C in it and once you put it on it absorbs quickly into the skin which allows you to start your make up or beauty routine right away.</li>
            <li>I just ordered my second bottle and can easily see this product becoming my staple (as long as the price remains a good bargain like it has been thus far).</li>
            <li>I have used QUI Vitamin C Serum for two weeks and am stunned that two large brown spots on the side of my face are gone!</li>
            <li>The delivery is super fast.</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t review many products, but this product does it exactly what it claims to do.  </li>
            <li>It is a real serum loaded with maximum possible active ingredients to provide you with the best anti-oxidant and anti-aging effects.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>My new fav!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product long enough to be able to say I believe it makes a nice difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>The first was a different organic kind that I also rated 5 stars as it deserved it and worked very well, but that was before I tried this.</li>
            <li>So, I like it, my skyn has recovering very fast</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly and readily into the skin making my skin feel really hydrated.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m allowed to continue, I&#x27;ve decided to try the Super C next since it appears to be more suited for sensitive skin and more mature skin.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have noticed an improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>The serum is extremely light and has made a marked improvement on my skin -- brighter, healthier looking --</li>
            <li>The point of Vitamin C is to  prevent future damage more than to correct current damage, so I wasn&#x27;t looking for a big change in pigmentation, but am very happy with the overall results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was the first product that I have used in this skin line</li>
            <li>Makes you feel the company are genuinely interested in your skin.</li>
            <li>My skin seems brighter and is incredibly soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>my skin gotten so much clearer!</li>
            <li>I will most definitely be getting this product again!!!</li>
            <li>I am definitely SEEING some improvement, but my skin FEELS better.</li>
            <li>I have even tried it on my crocodile hands and they are so soft and smooth now.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased thousands of products on Amazon and this is the first review I have written --</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be extra sure  about the feedback I continued to use it for another two weeks before commenting.</li>
            <li>After about 2 weeks I noticed significant improvement in my skin tone and condition, my old acne spots started to face and my skin tone become brighter too!</li>
            <li>, I know it was because of the consistent use.</li>
            <li>I started to notice a change within the first 3-4 days but after 3 weeks the results were drastic.</li>
            <li>The first one I purchased was priced at ~$25.</li>
            <li>but my laugh lines are looking much smoother.</li>
            <li>However, with that said everyone&#x27;s skin is different and I would recommend this brand because for someone else it might absorb better than it does for me.  </li>
            <li>my skin not only looks radiant but it also feels more</li>
            <li>Overall the product was okay</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle and love this product.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this and will be returning for more.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many comments and questions on what I am doing differently to my skin.   </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I like so much about it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician and avid researcher.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time that I used this brand of Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>My skin is finally where I want it to be :)</li>
            <li>and I still recommend it whole heartedly!  </li>
            <li>Really helps with texture, pores, and clarity!  </li>
            <li>Thanks COUI!  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and this product has made me look fabulous.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for making such a nice product.</li>
            <li>My skin if definitely smoother, brighter and I have so much more radiance.</li>
            <li>Really love this serum and can’t wait to get my next bottle .</li>
            <li>but those remarks struck me funny.</li>
            <li>I have more sunspots on my left side</li>
            <li>I have also appreciated all the tips and advice given by the company!</li>
            <li>Thanks OUI!</li>
            <li>when i first received it in the mail i decided to put in on immediately.</li>
            <li>It is also feels very sticky on my skin even after it has supposedly been absorbed.</li>
            <li>My skin is definitely brighter and it feels like my moisture lotion absorbs better.</li>
            <li>, this is my first experience with this ingredient).</li>
            <li>Instead, I got hot dog in a bottle.</li>
            <li>When I first began derma rolling, Vitamin C Serum was recommended by the company who sold the roller.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many different C-serums over the years.  </li>
            <li>other place that I have noticed this serum having an amazing effect is on my hands.</li>
            <li>The product arrive before expected, it was a small envelope, great conditions and love the fact it fitted into my mail box.</li>
            <li>The first week I got this it was ok, but the second week I started using it to much.</li>
            <li>, dark spots disappear, and my skin looks much more youthful!  </li>
            <li>other aspects/ingredients that I liked...</li>
            <li>As a skincare professional,  I really appreciated that COUI emailed me detailed instructions on how to use and store this product.  </li>
            <li>The fine lines on  my face have diminished and my skin looks healthier in general.</li>
            <li>be honest a bit of a skeptic when it comes to anti-aging products, however I was pleasantly surprised after only two weeks of using this product I started to see a noticeable  difference in my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>As a former sun-bather, I have been very pro-active about trying to fade sun spots and appreciate the launch price that I was able to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much better, around my eyes is much smoother and the sagging look on mid face has diminished.  </li>
            <li>did a fair bit of research about the active ingredients in this serum and was excited to try something that could be kind to my 46-year old skin while softening the beginnings of wrinkles in the usual places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have seen my age spot lighten significantly and just overall general appearance of skin looks more youthful.</li>
            <li>and I already see positive changes.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much for sharing this!</li>
            <li>However, at my age I am so aware of how much my skin is changing, and I didn&#x27;t feel I had a choice but to try it.</li>
            <li>This serum reduced my wrinkles and lines that were just so irritating because I still want to be beautiful.</li>
            <li>Only LAA is biologically active is therefore favored in dermatology.  </li>
            <li>They list all the ingredients and there is not a single ingredient that I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable about being soaked into my skin.  </li>
            <li>They list all the ingredients and there is not a single ingredient that I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable about being soaked into my skin.  </li>
            <li>dermatologist thinks my skin is easily 15 years younger looking than my would suggest by my age.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one lists L-ascorbic acid (which is pure vitamin c) and this is known to be unstable and drying for the skin.  </li>
            <li>Women of a certain age (senior +)</li>
            <li>and this product is pure</li>
            <li>Well, it is literally a certain glow because my face has become brighter.</li>
            <li>My face has become clearer and there is certain radiance to it.</li>
            <li>I am certain with prolonged use</li>
            <li>and certainly doesn&#x27;t absorb.</li>
            <li>Anyone who is following to any extent news and updates on what is new in skin care surely has heard about benefits of Vitamin C Serums.  </li>
            <li>The fine lines on my upper cheeks are gone.</li>
            <li>It does make a difference on fine lines especially around chin area.</li>
            <li>Even the fine lines are starting to fade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, we do promise results, with constant use wrinkles and fine lines will fade and your skin will become and look healthier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The line had better results, felt good on the skin and less expensive than most lines I have tried, even those from the professionals.</li>
            <li>On the other days I use the Super C and the combination of both is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It shows gradual positive results and other people notice more than you will.</li>
            <li>This is the real thing - REAL Vitamin C Serum and at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars for now, but I&#x27;ll re-review it when i notice a  huge difference later.</li>
            <li>Fast service, but not packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>My use of these products is also part of a healthy life style- no smoking, rare alcohol, regular exercise and enough rest.</li>
            <li>Wrinkles...not so much.</li>
            <li>My skin thanks me for both,</li>
            <li>Is this really just Vitamin C serum ?</li>
            <li>Thanks for asking, Mrs. Winnie Montes</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t seen a whole lot of change in some of the darkness yet, I&#x27;m hoping with continued use my skin spots will begin to lighten.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best...\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>It is not irritating or drying, nor does it have an oily feel.</li>
            <li>I like the vitamin C serum so much.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It is on the liquid side and absorbs very well into my skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very watery, so</li>
            <li>just keep the price reasonable.</li>
            <li>I was using another Vitamin C product that costs three times as much.</li>
            <li>It really promotes an even skin tone, and controls brown spots.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it all that much compared to Obaji, but I like the price point and that the folks distributing it were concerned with my satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Going on three weeks now, I really think I am seeing a difference.  </li>
            <li>I really feel like my skin is getting rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>skin is really looking healthier.</li>
            <li>I don’t really have wrinkles</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>, I was really dying to try it myself.</li>
            <li>I really like this Vitamin C Serum -</li>
            <li>I really like this serum</li>
            <li>This was so embarrassing and affected my performance as a real estate professionals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for 3 months now, and can really see the difference.  </li>
            <li>guess that means that it really works.</li>
            <li>It comes out very watery and a cloudy almost transparent color.  </li>
            <li>Thanks OUI...</li>
            <li>/&gt;i&#x27;ll absolutely get it again</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>chose this form of Vitamin C for our serum because of its acidity so that you can benefit from its gentle exfoliation properties.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li>It really does what it is advertised to do.</li>
            <li>I really noticed the improvement on my chest.  </li>
            <li>did absolutely nothing but burn my skin</li>
            <li>Two important aspects of a topical vitamin C formulation I consider are bioavailability and stability.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I use two times day, morning and night , I see my skin  gloing very</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be ordering another bottle.</li>
            <li>Gentle exfoliation</li>
            <li>My skin tone has definitely evened out after 2 bottles and my face is smooth.  </li>
            <li>I really think it works and does what it is supposed to do for the skin based on what they say about the benefits of Vitamin C Serums.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very prone to break outs.</li>
            <li>I absolutely will be repurchasing this serum and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>i really don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li>I guess it works very well with my SPF.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I guess the vitamin C here is really the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>My skin feels much smoother and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I think the serum is really working as it should be.</li>
            <li>Also; the seller, Ms Alessandra Poletti was very helpful and patient too.</li>
            <li>this stuff is really sticky.</li>
            <li>I apply it every morning and include my neck and chest which also looks much smoother.</li>
            <li>that really</li>
            <li>This vitamin C serum has really improved my complexion.</li>
            <li>It is also very watery.</li>
            <li>As prescription Fast delivery</li>
            <li>I will continue to use Coui products and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I was given this product to try and I can only say that I am amazed and thrilled at the results after only 7 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was given this product to try and I can only say that I am amazed and thrilled at the results after only 7 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A few highlights of what I liked about Coui vit C:  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I saw results within a few days.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t expected such good results.  </li>
            <li>Made my face slightly firmer the first week of use, and then I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could see a difference after that.</li>
            <li>I used both of the serums in combination, applying the Vitamin C Serum first which has the exfoliating factor (letting it fully absorb into my skin) and following it up with the Super C Serum.  </li>
            <li>I also apply it directly when I see a blemish or breakout cropping it up because it takes down the inflammation and helps it to heal more quickly.</li>
            <li>I found it to be a little sticky on my face at first, but wow the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>So far I notice no difference between the more expensive product and Oui, therefore, I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>the other hand, this serum from OUI feels very rich without much stinging.</li>
            <li>I love the price compared with other comparable products and will continue to repurchase.  </li>
            <li>Overall, my skin tone is better, almost no more pimples and blackheads and my skin is definitely better hydrated...  </li>
            <li>The elasticity of my skin especially around my mouth is significant.</li>
            <li>For that reason I use it every other day, at night.o absolutely love about this product and this brand of Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li>Although it says in the direction to apply every other day, I do it every night and top it with a night moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but this seems to help more than the other ones that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>the smell - it&#x27;s not a bad smell, but not exactly nice and refreshing either.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this serum to anyone who wants to add a Vitamin C serum to their skincare regimen.</li>
            <li>I have used Peter Thomas Roth in the past but the results are as good if not better at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>company is quite special, as they send you personal thank</li>
            <li>I am 71 years old and have good skin, almost no wrinkles, but I had acne in high school in small patches on my chin and forehead.  </li>
            <li>After a month she notices that there is something new about me, a ‘certain glow’.</li>
            <li>a woman who has very fair skin with freckles, I have also been very sensitive to a wide array of skin products in the past.</li>
            <li>Being over 50 yrs old doesn&#x27;t help the matter too, especially with age spots, fine lines, dryness and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products that did absolutely nothing for me, and I&#x27;ve tried products that seemed to have helped a little bit - but nothing to write home about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>My co-workers think I am using new make-up that &amp;#34;looks great&amp;#34; and my husband commented that I looked 16!  </li>
            <li>but I live in Florida at this time and the sun really affected my skin and damaged it.</li>
            <li>I use this Vit C twice a week and the super C daily as per the e-mailed instructions.</li>
            <li>I now use this serum, the Super C and their UV Facial SPF 30.</li>
            <li>I have been  using Coui vitamin C super serum and the regular  C serum for&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I thought I would just buy the main ingredients and give it a try.</li>
            <li>I needed something to help with aging skin, particularly sagging skin, some plumping here and there to make my face seem fuller</li>
            <li>and I will always use it along with my Retin A. I tanned in my younger, more ignorant days, and now my goal is to undo the damage I caused back then.</li>
            <li>but it just doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as I like, so for that reason I&#x27;m only using it at night</li>
            <li>because my face is more hydrated, the few wrinkles I do have don&#x27;t crease as much because of the hydration, so it does give a diminished look to them...</li>
            <li>The smell is the main reason it&#x27;s not getting 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>They also talk about the particular benefits for aging skin and skin that has been exposed to the sun etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I alternate it with the Super C Serum (also by COUI)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is my main issue.</li>
            <li>One in particular was over $80.  </li>
            <li>I feel that I have seen more results using this serum than with the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but the price is so high</li>
            <li>Highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li>After all that I would highly recommend this serum to a friend.</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It did moisturize very well and I am sure it could be used to boost a regular moisturizer in the dry winter season.  </li>
            <li>It has a bit of a different (not bad, just not ordinary) sent and</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to everyone who wants to give their skin a swift kick in the A$$!!</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the thickness of the product, as I am accustomed to very liquidy competitors.  </li>
            <li>So far, and it&#x27;s been two weeks, I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I have old skin, I am 59, this product has helped my skin so much in just a week.  </li>
            <li>Will post more after a few weeks of using this.</li>
            <li>I normally put this serum on at night as that is when I have the time to indulge myself.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I personally struggle with the smell and at first used too much</li>
            <li>It is essential to collagen production and a powerful antioxidant.</li>
            <li>My skin seems more firm, and some splotchiness I have had has evened out.  </li>
            <li>Not having changed my skin care routine except for using OUI moring and evening, I&#x27;ve noted my deepest lines--the 11&#x27;s, naso-labial lines, as well as those smile lines around the eyes, have diminished in only 30 days of use.  </li>
            <li>I can feel my skin drinking it in just like when I drink a big glass of freshly juiced fruits and vegetables,</li>
            <li>This and The Super C Serum are the only two C-Products I found that I would dare put on my sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>The price was right for such a power-packed serum.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was watching Dr. Oz show one day and they&#x27;re talking about the right ingredients in a facial care to look up to when buying.</li>
            <li>It felt so moisturized after only 2 days of use and now after two weeks I can actually see how the fine lines around my lips are fading.</li>
            <li>The instructions suggest to discard after 6 months due to chemicals losing effectiveness - no idea how accurate</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I thought my skin would adjust to the new product</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see new ones developing.</li>
            <li>I did not expect miracles and it did not get rid of 65 years of abuse, but I notice a glow and new softness to my skin.  </li>
            <li>The biggest difference I&#x27;ve noticed was when I put my makeup on my fine lines/ dark spots are gone.  </li>
            <li>This product made a huge difference in not only the depth and length of the wrinkles around my eyes but also over all my skin looks younger, tighter and healthier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and spent most of my years in the sun &amp; this product has truly helped in improving the overall look of my skin.</li>
            <li>which I think makes people look younger and something to help smooth over facial lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone who has sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend anybody who has sensitive and acne prone</li>
            <li>but I highly recommend not to use around the sensitive eye.  </li>
            <li>Some reviews mention the fact that this product is a little liquid, yet it is that light consistency that allows for the product to be absorbed deep into the skin.</li>
            <li>It tightens my jawline, it evens out my complexion, and it makes the fine lines around my eyes less noticeable.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li>So far nothing!</li>
            <li>This is by far a keeper!</li>
            <li>Frequently get compliments on my completion !</li>
            <li>and I feel like it benefits my skin, but again if I&#x27;m not careful about how much of it I apply at one time it does remain sticky for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>I can say is WOW !</li>
            <li>It is really, really soft and supple!  </li>
            <li>Oz I think mentioned vit.C and Hyaluronic being important once; he can be a little overwhelming, with his vast knowledge of do&#x27;s, tries and haves.</li>
            <li>Before, my face would feel dry most of the day, even with moisturizer ( I have dry skin).</li>
            <li>I am far from young so this is high praise indeed.</li>
            <li>The ingredients look very promising - a lot of good stuff with large quantities and none of the bad ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have tried several Vitamin C serums in the past but this one is amazing.</li>
            <li>It has lifted and removed old scarring and imperfections with no reddening or peeling (and I have very sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>and I have searched the world high and low for something to help with my crow&#x27;s feet, smile lines, and overall skin dullness.</li>
            <li>They said, it&#x27;s Vit C and hyaluronic acid, so I went to my Amazon account and research for products that will have those ingredients and found this OUI with several positive feedbacks; hence, I ordered it.</li>
            <li>Manufacturers know consumers are aware of phalates/parabens/SLS and are shifting to substitutes that are often toxic but less &#x27;recognizable&#x27; by consumers, like phenoxethanol.</li>
            <li>My skin feels tight and smooth.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s thick, goes on very light.</li>
            <li>a slight tingling or refreshing feeling) and you will definitely see it in the results.&lt;br /&gt;Please note that our serum is not transparent or clear.</li>
            <li>After a few days, I noticed my skin had plumped up and fine lines were reduced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple weeks, but it has helped with some dry spots, and I have felt that my skin feels younger and more &#x27;plump&#x27; since.</li>
            <li>I now just drizzle a little and smooth it out.  </li>
            <li>and when I went into the liquor store the other day and the cashier asked for my ID when he saw how old I was his eyes bugged out and he told me that I looked like I was right out of high school.</li>
            <li>After less than a week of staying faithful to using this every am, I noticed a significant difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I intend to use vitamin c serum to clear my acne scars.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried are clear and not sticky.</li>
            <li>I am 48 yrs old and my skin is looking younger thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>I have used COUI&#x27;s Natural Vitamin C Serium for over a year.  </li>
            <li>and I think my skin is too sensitive at my age.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to give it to my 43 year old daughter</li>
            <li>I have tried others but like the consistency, lack of stickiness, and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Like so far.</li>
            <li>I have mature skin</li>
            <li>I have been using OUI Natural Vitamin C Serum, for some time now.</li>
            <li>and I think the serum is really working as it should be after only using it for one week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks, but so far, am really enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I started getting all these breakouts on my 55 year old face after I started using this as directed.</li>
            <li>Natural</li>
            <li>The product has met all her expectations so far.</li>
            <li>I am an almost 70 year old woman.  </li>
            <li>My 27 year old daughter tried and&lt;br /&gt;liked</li>
            <li>But what I&#x27;ve notice so far, is that my skin texture, dryness and age spots are dramatically and continually diminishing.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve also started using it on the more delicate chest area.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels immensely soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>I am 29yrs old.</li>
            <li>Did not work well for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and when I applied this serum it tingled a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far the serum is working well.  </li>
            <li>I really can see the different in my skin</li>
            <li>One had a very chemical smell and stained my palm yellow, some didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference at all.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m 30 years old</li>
            <li>/&gt;Depending on your individual skin type and condition, you should expect to see an improvement very soon.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>It really does its job by fading the red marks on my face.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at the improvement in my skin after a week of using Natural Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li>is that it is all natural.  </li>
            <li>is that it is all natural.  </li>
            <li>and my sunspots are nearly gone.  </li>
            <li>and shall we say, very vain with how I look, and choose my facial products with utmost care.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 40 years old</li>
            <li>I think you are going to be pleasantly surprised, I was...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 37 years old</li>
            <li>I have never had a company do that and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It has a glow about it that I was pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 40s with combination skin.</li>
            <li>I deal with adult acne, and this has also helped with that.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t eliminated my acne completely, but my breakouts are diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My co-worker actually thought that I had a laser treatment done because my skin tone improved so much.  </li>
            <li>This Vitamin C serum makes my skin so soft and looking brighter.  </li>
            <li>I give “TWO THUMBS UP” for COUI Natural Vitamin C Serum 20%.</li>
            <li>It is listed as professional because that&#x27;s what it is.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So, after a few months of use I can say I keep getting younger :)  </li>
            <li>It is too early to see significant results after such a short while, but there is definitely an</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to put on, I use very little each day (think 1/4 tsp) and</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve used a ton of other products paying a lot more for a whole lot less results!  </li>
            <li>At less no bad reaction</li>
            <li>-not tight.  </li>
            <li>My skin is softer, more toned, more even toned, less plagued with stubborn wrinkles and looks at least ten years younger.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;s and complete information on and about the products and their use.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased to share this information, as I have passed it along to my friends who are serious about their skin care regimine.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I have used a wide range of very expensive products but this serum is bar far the best investment I have made.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much, but  I recently had some treatments to my face and using both the creams I was given to use and the vitamin c serum together created a lot of peeling, so for now I have to back off.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s more improvement to come over the next few months!</li>
            <li>Love the way this makes my skin feel, and a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li>No more trying out different serums, this is the one for me :-)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like very creamy substances and can&#x27;t bare tons of make-up on my face for that same reason.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal, but something to be aware of depending on your personal expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>MAIN concern is my crow&#x27;s feet, and this is the ONLY product I&#x27;ve found that has softened them.</li>
            <li>i think my skin  does look a little better even though it has not been a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I use this product only twice a week because it is a little strong.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and will be back again to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are less!!  </li>
            <li>However, any topical vitamin C must have a pH level of 3.5 or less to penetrate the stratum corneum, which is the primary obstacle.  </li>
            <li>I ALWAYS use a moisturizing sunscreen everyday but since I&#x27;ve been using this product my skin has been more vibrant and brighter looking, I&#x27;ve also noticed that my blemishes heal faster than they used to as well as having less of them.</li>
            <li>I could really see a difference in my skin tone, decreased redness and it reduced the appearance of fine lines.  </li>
            <li>it absorbes quite quickly into your skin, with use with my other topical products</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate and using this every morning gently exfoliates my skin enough so that I have basically eliminated blemishes!</li>
            <li>I was offered OUI as part of their validation process in order to give some feedback and thought it worth a try, given that it was half the price of the Ole Henrikson.</li>
            <li>/&gt;With only 7 applications so far, my skin is markedly improved.</li>
            <li>Later I&#x27;ve got another email with further advices, for which I&#x27;m very thankful</li>
            <li>The Clinical C&#x27;s exfoliating effects are extremely gentle compared to my regular routine and my skin likes the extra Vitamin C for scarring.</li>
            <li>It is difficult for manufacturers to keep the vitamin c available to be absorbed by the skin.  </li>
            <li>I am now on my second bottle of this product and unfortunately I don&#x27;t think it is doing my skin any good.  </li>
            <li>I did not immediately start using product when I received it as I wanted to finish other products I had first.  </li>
            <li>why, but absolutely no other product I&#x27;ve tried has helped my crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li>It does not dry stiff or sticky absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t experienced any unwanted reactions on my skin, nor any burning or anything bad.</li>
            <li>I am regularly told I appear to be in my early 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a couple weeks, but so far has been</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so I only use it once a day, in the morning.</li>
            <li>The following morning i noticed my face was brighter and soft.</li>
            <li>i used to use skinceuticals C serum , oui looks, smells, feels the same and no where near the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very interested in trying the other products on next order- especially the Super-C serum.</li>
            <li>I had had a red spot on my cheek for months and this serum, used with the derma roller, has made it almost completely disappear.  </li>
            <li>have tried buying and using Vitamin C Serum several times, over the course of some years and several different brands, some of which were very pricy.  </li>
            <li>So far there&#x27;s is no different in wrinkle yet.  </li>
            <li>I was initially concerned because I have an intolerance to Vitamin C (digesting it) and I have extremely sensitive skin to boot.</li>
            <li>By applying OUI, I can barely see it.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this Serum, I have bought plenty of anti aging products throughout my life and this Vitamin C Serum brings me back to at least three years younger!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s apparent that they care about what they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend it as a normal face serum (not only for after dema-rolling sessions) for daily use.</li>
            <li>It is thick, and goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>This product has helped make my face feel fresh and firm</li>
            <li>Skincare Vitamin 20% is one of the few serums on the market that actually does contain a true 20% Vitamin C concentration (not an “equivalent to”, “like” etc.).</li>
            <li>All of the ingredients are powerful antioxidants and this formula is moisturizing without being too heavy or oily</li>
            <li>I personally tried our newly formulated serum for the first time I felt a slight tingling feeling and a few minutes later a very “plumping” feeling as the high concentration of Vitamin C entered my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only recommendation to pass onto supplier is possibly either place shrink wrap around bottle cap or a sticker on box lid to show it is new unopened product.  </li>
            <li>She has dry, sensitive, and mature skin.</li>
            <li>I feel a slight tingling when I apply in to my freshly washed face, let it soak in for 5 minutes as directed, then follow it up with my daily moisture/ sunscreen combo.</li>
            <li>Truly I noticed a slight difference, I also noticed a few more breakouts..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands such as philosophy&#x27;s powder type one, ole henriksen, murad, tarte, mario badescu, jason, avalon, the body shop, and few other brands by amazon sellers.</li>
            <li>I saw only minimal improvement in dark spots and fine lines, and will keep looking...</li>
            <li>I noticed a slight difference after the first couple of applications.  </li>
            <li>It dries fairly quickly, so I can then apply my usual moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This one is much stickier on the skin than other brands</li>
            <li>I have used other Vitamin C Serums with Hyaluronic Acid and have not broken out ---I</li>
            <li>They both really compliment  each other.</li>
            <li>I’ve used other brands of vitamin C serums before, but COUI really makes a noticeable difference on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is what it has done for me thus far (I&#x27;ve used it for one month); I significantly get less black heads and pimples on my face</li>
            <li>It does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li>however goes away after a few minutes and after I apply my night cream my skin feels juicier.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a few weeks and already my skin feels more elastic</li>
            <li>I got a bit confused and didn&#x27;t know where to start, so many options and different products.</li>
            <li>At first when you put out on you do feel a little tingle but its just the process of exfoliation.</li>
            <li>Over the past few years, I have used many different products, but none have given nearly the results as the COUI serums.</li>
            <li>But the last year or two I have noticed increased sunspots and a general unevenness in my skin.</li>
            <li>to expect in the first few weeks:&lt;br /&gt;Years of exposure to Sun and to Free-Radicals won’t go away overnight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She had been using this consistently at night time (mix a few drops with her moisturizer).  </li>
            <li>I have mature dry skin</li>
            <li>Just put a small drop and use you 4th finger to tap and smooth, then repeat other areas on your face.</li>
            <li>A decent serum, but not worth buying again.</li>
            <li>It also burned a little, I think it&#x27;s because I had so much slathered on.  </li>
            <li>It is a little sticky if you use too much.</li>
            <li>No matter how much or how little I put on it gave me the same sticky feeling</li>
            <li>I live in the dry SoCal climate and I have dry skin.</li>

            <li> Love it,best of the best for your face.</li>
            <li> So, I can honestly say this one works!    </li>
            <li> I am totally loving it!  </li>
            <li> It honestly feels like I&#x27;m getting a $250 serum at a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vitamin C serum for years and this is a good one at a great price.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to death with the Vitamin C Serum!</li>
            <li> I am Loving Coui!</li>
            <li> Excellent service, fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the quality of this vitamin C serum and also the fact that it is offered at a great price.  </li>
            <li> This product is good for erasing brown spots.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so it is noticable if I don&#x27;t use a good C serum.  </li>
            <li> But surprisingly, coui serum even prevents cystic acne that I always had.</li>
            <li> Good for face</li>
            <li> Oui feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> you will need to shake as it says, the smell to me is a wonderful light citrus.</li>
            <li> I found this product and loved the introduction price, and said I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> The package looks nice, and there is great customer service.</li>
            <li> so you are welcome to your own conclusions.  </li>
            <li> and then I follow with a good moisturizer with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> but I wanted to give it a fair shot.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good Vitamin C Serum at a fair price</li>
            <li> Firstly I really loved the fact that this serum came in a box.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> When I heard on Dr. Oz show how Vitamin C serum can be good for the skin</li>
            <li> so it feels good once I apply it.</li>
            <li> Everyone comments on how good my face looks.</li>
            <li> Feels good on your skin and refines its texture.</li>
            <li> Good price for vitamin c serum.  </li>
            <li> and I was delighted to find that it also replaces all the moisturizers I used to use on my skin.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t nearly as good.</li>
            <li> something (I have fair skin), like porcelain.  </li>
            <li> I loved the ingredients and consistency of this product.</li>
            <li> I have really good results with it.</li>
            <li> It feels good</li>
            <li> Keep up with the good work and products.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> I am reordering month 2 in anticipation of continued good results.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t believe something that does not absorb and coats your face in a sticky wax like substance would really do much good anyways.</li>
            <li> I feel Vitamin C is good for my skin, but I don&#x27;t think I can put up with this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is REALLY GOOD.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good serum after I applied on my face .</li>
            <li> Because of my results, I wanted to share a good thing with my cousin and a dear friend.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist even asked me what I was using on my face to have it looking so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see how awesome my skin is going to look after long-term use.</li>
            <li> I also love how it smells and it goes on beautifully, soaking into my skin almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Amazing, remarkable, miracle stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very happy with how quickly I received my product and the quality of the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and now I am using the Super C also rotating it with this product and am seeing excellent results with it also.  </li>
            <li> I am super happy withthis company and their products, no kidding!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super happy with this serum and plan on buying it again!</li>

            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I love this product !</li>
            <li> It would alleviated my wife&#x27;s concern that the product may have been a return/used product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I look in the mirror and my complexion seems clearer and more even-toned!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>

            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I love this serum!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used C serum, and was using a different brand of C serum that I thought was working well, but I switched to this one because of the launch price, which is awesome BTW, but upon receiving it I found this one to have much better ingredients than the product I was using before, and upon using it I was very impressed with the way it felt on my skin and how my skin reacted to it.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, Love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly what it&#x27;s doing, as I use really good products and take great care of my skin, but I feel good about it as an addition to my routine.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;different than the Super C, thinner consistency, and for me, it seems to hydrate my skin better...</li>
            <li> Smells great, absorbs quickly, skin looks Dewey,radiant,more even toned and,I loved the price.</li>
            <li> Best of all,my large sunspot is getting lighter.</li>
            <li> And, on top of a fabulous product, the company has very good customer service as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced a huge difference on my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>

            <li> My skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> The customer service from this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> My husband even remarked how nice my skin looked, and believe me that&#x27;s amazing in itself.</li>
            <li> skin is also feels amazingly moisturised and supple.</li>
            <li> This product is really amazing.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looking more even toned and bright.</li>
            <li> THANKS FOR A GREAT PRODUCT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Makes skin brighter and nice glow.</li>
            <li> : now I use coconut oil and rose water</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to have one serum for all three.</li>
            <li> You can read the reviews and make your own decision.  </li>
            <li> Now I can give an honest feedback.</li>
            <li> and I am hoping it will be as effective as others have found it to be.</li>
            <li> I have always loved make up and  find it amazing magic</li>
            <li> Excellent service, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Wife uses this product and is loving her skin.</li>
            <li> I keep it in the refrigerator as recommended and I am loving the results.</li>
            <li> and I am really happy that I have such great results!</li>
            <li> A product must be accepted by the skin to be effective.  </li>
            <li> While I knew this information, it showed me that they really care about giving their clients the best</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because I can&#x27;t comment honestly about whether or not it does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> but i didn&#x27;t use it, they were nice to deal with.</li>
            <li> I liked this vitamin C product.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot for the great product!</li>
            <li> and I have been thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great customer service too!!</li>
            <li> I think the quality is very good, just not the right product for me.</li>
            <li> It even has a pleasant light citrus smell.  </li>
            <li> So I was looking for a good vitamin c serum that was easily absorbable and would help with my acne scars.</li>
            <li> The Super C one works great on wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and.......</li>
            <li> Love, love this product!  </li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks great and was told, for the first time in years, that my skin looked like it was glowing!</li>
            <li> So far the best vitamin c serum I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> Gives skin a nice healthy glow</li>
            <li> This one is the best so far.  </li>
            <li> i have tried alot of vitamin C serums and this one is by far the best!!  </li>
            <li> It is light and feels good on the skin but showed no improvement for me.  </li>
            <li> Most effective toner I have ever used..</li>
            <li> So far, the best serum I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li> It is the best professional Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she&#x27;s been using it for about two weeks, she really enjoys it, was surprised at the great price given the quality of the product and is trying to get me to buy her more before the price goes up!  :D</li>
            <li> A couple of very fine lines are no longer there.  </li>
            <li> Having done more research, I discovered that the form of Vitamin C in this product is not the kind that is the most beneficial for skin.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many vitamin C products and by far this is the best.  </li>
            <li> Love the feel, love the way my skin looks, love the product, love the price!  </li>
            <li> this product has been pretty great</li>
            <li> and it feels so good going on cool.</li>
            <li> It has made an amazing difference in my skin tone and lessened my fine lines.  </li>
            <li> but I was kind of hoping for some improvement to sun damage and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> great product..will certainly buy again,,also recommended to all my friends, DMH</li>
            <li> It has very nice, tingling feeling when applied and is absorbed very quickly.</li>
            <li> It has already made a huge difference in my blackheads!  </li>
            <li> and I can tell a huge difference in my skin!  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and will order it now for the 3rd time.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks superb and the wrinkle lines on my neck are finally diminishing.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again for great products.</li>
            <li> i LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks better every day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several C serums and this one is the best for results.  </li>
            <li> The price makes it affordable to use when so many anti-aging products are out of my price range.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing and feeling the results and am so pleased with  this product.</li>
            <li> According to research (as of this date) the better forms of vitamin c for the skin are Tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate or Sodium ascorbyl phosphate.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Then its just a matter of finding reputable products.</li>
            <li> I will probably continue my search for a better product.  </li>
            <li> For now I will continue my search for better results.</li>
            <li> This serum is such an awesome product!</li>
            <li> Another thing that bothered me was that most had the consistency of water and even looked like water that is until  I received OUI skincare’s Vitamin C serum as a gift.</li>
            <li> My skin also feels more elasticized.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> I have suggested  it to many of my friends and my daughter.</li>
            <li> and I can assure you , if you try this you will love it.</li>
            <li> Love you Coui.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I used to make my own Vitamin C serum (all of the ingredients are on Amazon) to maximize efficacy of the product--concentration, and more importantly</li>
            <li> Although most of the products I tried felt luxurious on the skin, I didn&#x27;t see long-term results.  </li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it is packaged in a brown glass bottle (not plastic) which will prolong the potency of the Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found that my skin responds better to the OUI Serum.  </li>
            <li> and I am very impressed with the way it left my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li> Love the back-up received.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regret buying it :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use it more weeks to see if the lines around my mouth disappears.</li>
            <li> I am 59 and have used many C&amp; E over the years.</li>
            <li> I love this product and give it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> Magic is all I can say.  </li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x60;m saving money because it works SO well that I don&#x60;t have to buy several of the products I bought BEFORE I found your wonderful serum!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more of it.</li>
            <li> i think my face looks plumper, more luminous.healthy</li>
            <li> Mostly because I didn&#x27;t need to before now.</li>
            <li> and all of my face seems to have a healthy glow</li>
            <li> I bought a second bottle at this great price, because it is working so well!</li>
            <li> My skin tone has improved noticeably and I am pleased with my results.  </li>
            <li> My skin has more clarity and is smoother.  </li>
            <li> I love it on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This might be better as a top layer exfoliant; for this, I believe it would work.  </li>
            <li> They also offered an excellent discount on my next purchase.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks  better, which is saying a lot because I DO have those  &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more for myself, my daughters, sisters and friends.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.</li>
            <li> My skin does look smoother and I have a lot more color in my face.  </li>
            <li> love the product...</li>
            <li> I am a &amp;#34;senior citizen&amp;#34; with age spots and many wrinkles around mouth.  </li>
            <li> I just had a facial yesterday and was told to keep using the serum because vitamin C is excellent for the skin-</li>

            <li> My skin has a healthy glow and feels firmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it as a night-time treatment and when I wake up my skin feels &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; ... just not so much under make-up.  </li>
            <li> The customer service is outstanding also.</li>
            <li> I’m glad I did,</li>
            <li> My face feels significantly more hydrated.</li>

            <li> I love this product, I&#x27;m 61</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find a better Vitamin C serum for any price-</li>
            <li> I will buy this again, Just love it.</li>
            <li> I will definitely stop looking around for the perfect serum-</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more results</li>
            <li> Others may be able to.</li>

            <li> I love this serum.</li>
            <li> I love this vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Good customer service - Vitamin C is a powerful ingredient and needs to be both used and stored correctly for maximum effect.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s thicker than a lot of serums.  </li>
            <li> but now I look forward to how refreshing it feels.</li>
            <li> I wish I had done a bit more research before I jumped on this one.</li>
            <li> and I must say i am pleased.</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist recommended this for my blackheads, wrinkles, and many years of sunning as a teenager.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure, but I have confidence  </li>
            <li> the results will be even greater.</li>
            <li> The complexion looks clearer, I would say more transparent or</li>

            <li> It feels good, healthy, like I really am doing something loving for my skin.</li>
            <li> I am glad to have this product and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> all i can really say is that it didn&#x27;t hurt, but i didn&#x27;t notice any great benifits.</li>
            <li> wrinkles are fading and love the tightening of my skin..</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using it twice a day for three months and received many complements on my more youthful skin.</li>
            <li> am a serum addict and what I have discovered is that a potent serum cannot smell and taste like water.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> its making the results of my skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Its okay.  </li>
            <li> She said it helps reduce the sun spots and make her skin look more radiant.  </li>
            <li> Great customer service and fast shipping .</li>
            <li> As one who spends a lot of time in the sun, I was pleased to find out that the serum also helps protect against, and repair, sun damage.</li>
            <li> I use it, I love it</li>
            <li> and I love this more.  </li>
            <li> I love the Vitamin C Serum 20%,</li>
            <li> It is one of my favorite products now</li>
            <li> and I even purchased a couple more bottles since they were still offering the launch price</li>
            <li> It feels so refreshing and protective to my skin.</li>
            <li> Have tried several of the vitamin C serums but this one is the best.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was expecting a more citrus scent or something.</li>
            <li> Not terrible or anything</li>
            <li> I have been using to for 2 months and my skin is clearer and more luminous.</li>
            <li> I have had many complements on my skin.</li>
            <li> I actually have been using the serum for two months now and I am so happy with it!</li>
            <li> Has a nice light feel on skin.</li>
            <li> I use this in the morning and it gives my skin a refreshing glow.  </li>
            <li> did not notice anything except more breakouts.</li>
            <li> and I would purchase more without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products and this product has provided the best results.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  </li>
            <li> I have gifted it to friends and they continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> It has diminished wrinkles and I have more skin clarity.</li>
            <li> OUI  Skincare&#x27;s  Vitamin C 20% serum came nicely packaged in a gorgeous box and an air-tight  very opaque bottle.  </li>
            <li> Smells clean and fresh and has helped greatly with my skin texture.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> I am really thrilled with this product and am so excited that it works so well.</li>
            <li> I was using Ole Henriksen&#x27;s Truth Serum and was getting pretty good results, but I noticed that by the end of the day, the effects of the serum were mostly gone.</li>
            <li> and it seems to be working pretty good on me.</li>
            <li> I thought it was pretty good.</li>
            <li> The age spots are not as prominent, the fine lines look smoother and the over all appearance has a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the money!!  </li>
            <li> smell is also extremely pleasant but what really cinched it for me  was the effect it had on my skin.</li>
            <li> It is pleasant on the skin and has a very rapid brightening effect.  </li>
            <li> This goes on nicely and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and the packaging was nice.</li>
            <li> I break out easily and my skin ends up looking like I have a rash with most skincare products.</li>
            <li> A friend sent me what she claimed was the \\&quot;latest, most advanced, vitamin C 20% serum.</li>
            <li> I think is a good product, I can see good results next day when I wake up</li>
            <li> This is a great Vit C serum, it appears to help faden dark spots and make complexion more all over bright and even skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Ok I got this one with the super C!</li>
            <li> I have used other Vitamin C products purchased from my dermatologist, for much more money, and this product has shown the best results on my skin!</li>
            <li> This is a great product , really works, it hydrates and significantly helped with my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I did have a problem with my second order but seller was able to compensate and make sure I am happy within a day.</li>
            <li> And unlike many products the instructions are detailed.</li>
            <li> I apply it directly to my face, it feels great.</li>
            <li> even think that my sunspots are becoming lighter .&lt;br /&gt;I am now applying it generously on my neck and am looking forward to the results.</li>
            <li> They have never felt so soft and my skin looks great</li>
            <li> So far, I am happy with the OUI Skincare Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> Also I was very pleased that the company contacted me and sent me an email on exactly how to use the serum and things to watch out for.  </li>
            <li> A lot of sellers on amazon.com do that for asking good review, but I could feel coui company really care about their customers.</li>
            <li> After only 3 days I am seeing good results!  </li>
            <li> I live for great products and I have been using this for 3 weeks and see a significant change in my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this serum, your face has a nice glow to it after using, I also have turned my husband on to this who isn&#x27;t into skin care but absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> It easily spreads.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very quick.</li>
            <li> The seller responds very quickly to the questions and always asks for feedback.</li>
            <li> because surprisingly it had the same amazing results that I got from Ole Henrikson.</li>
            <li> noticeable difference in my deeper lines very quickly.</li>
            <li> I can easily go without foundation</li>
            <li> Good price point makes a high quality product affordable.  </li>
            <li> It looks much smoother and the fine lines have diminished!!</li>
            <li> At first I thought I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed using this serum because it feels like a true serum.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the seller is nice and emailed me right back when i  had questions, the support was great.</li>
            <li> this softens the fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> The fine lines on my forehead, around my nose where you squint your nose has softened &amp; practically disappear.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a favorable improvement in the fine lines around my eyes since using this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has helped my fine lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product is easy to use and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> For 20$ i expected to recieve a full intact bottle of this wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li> a noticeable improvement in fine line as well...</li>
            <li> Have fine line around my eyes</li>
            <li> fine lines on my forehead and cheeks are getting noticeably fainter and my skin is feeling smoother and somehow also plumper.</li>
            <li> In the 4 months I have been using this product, my skin is brighter, age spots have diminished and fine lines are not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter and fine lines have shown some improvement.</li>
            <li> Ok I  love experiments, so the first thing I did when I got this serum as a gift from my sister was smell and taste</li>
            <li> /&gt;It soaks into my skin very quickly and leaves my skin feeling like there is a protective barrier between my skin and the sun and any free radicals that may try to enter.</li>
            <li> After three weeks, there has been no improvement in fine lines or wrinkles or brown spots from sun damage.</li>
            <li> Fine lines have have faded away.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate the quick reply to my questions about the use of Super C with Vitamin C. ”Using the COUI skin care line is easy, clean and effective.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a beautiful, clean looking and super professional packaging.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much and recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy w this product, and I intend to continue using it, especially because it&#x27;s not ridiculously overpriced!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s making a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> but I will post another review when I notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li> At 27, I simply want my skin to breathe, to be free from makeup and still look great.</li>
            <li> My pores were huge and I was getting blackheads</li>
            <li> nothing huge</li>
            <li> in my book this is HUGE.</li>
            <li> yet no one has accurately described it .</li>
            <li> despite being a huge sunscreen user.  </li>
            <li> A huge plus - this serum is clearing up the my blemish breakouts and my pores have lessened.</li>
            <li> If you make sure to apply as directed it brings a fresh looking skin.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a couple of days and my pores and complexion have greatly improved.</li>
            <li> serum is great and I am already ordering my next bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using OUI&#x27;s vitamin C serum for two weeks now and my boyfriend has already remarked at how smooth and supple my skin</li>
            <li> Adding this product to my facial regime was a great choice.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with the results and must tell you, this is painless and I look years younger.</li>
            <li> I would like to continue using Oui to keep that smooth look</li>
            <li> My skin is looking fresh and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I was paying $75 for a &amp;#34;big name&amp;#34; serum and this performs so much better, keeps your skin fresh and youthful.</li>
            <li> - it is thicker and goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li> This serum lightly exfoliates also.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Exfoliation is important in order for skin renewal to take place.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth after about three weeks of the product.</li>
            <li> Vit C degrades with exposure to air, heat, light.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job of making my skin look smoother, healthier, and younger.</li>
            <li> Smooth as a whistle.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry</li>
            <li> improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it is so cheap because it is sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I have light skin.</li>
            <li> My skin has become so smooth and even in color that I never wear makeup anymore.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a light citrus scent.</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> The vitamin C is actually L-ascorbic acid (the effective kind)  according to your site, and that is what compelled me to order &amp;#34;Oui&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> Good so far.</li>
            <li> So far, I used it for three days, so I can&#x27;t verify if it&#x27;s doing any good to my skin, which is why I am giving a 4 star instead of 5 star.</li>
            <li> So  far so good.  </li>
            <li> I have to say OUI is far superior and</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good product, but my sensitive skin broke out.</li>
            <li> I still have my suspicions about the price, yet so far so good.</li>
            <li> I just had to write a review because I feel so comfortable while using this amazing product, I just really recommend this to anyone at all and</li>
            <li> smell is great, like fresh  orange, but not much a little bit, it is light  </li>
            <li> I have tried many Vitamin C serums looking for the right one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy to apply and works well under my moisturizer and sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It deeply hydrates and makes your skin feel fresh and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Obviously many users are very pleased with it, and I am also - but only at night.</li>
            <li> no oil, obsorbes very fast, I love it .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it had any effect on wrinkles, but for the even skin tone alone, it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> This product has made a significant difference in the clarity, feel and over all look to my skin..</li>
            <li> This is certainly worth giving as a gift to your mom/sister/friend/anyone!</li>
            <li> I just received this product so I do not know the long term benefits, but it feels great on my skin</li>
            <li> Keeps me fresh!</li>
            <li> but I did not notice any signicant or even nearly significant changes.</li>
            <li> At first I was nervous but now am really pleased.  </li>
            <li> So worth it!</li>
            <li> I have been using the product every morning and evening I immediately saw difference in my skin, I am very pleased with the results so far and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> Worth a try!</li>
            <li> It all looked very aesthetic and clean and most importantly tamper free.</li>
            <li> I keep it in the refrigerator and use on a clean skin.</li>
            <li> I use the serum every night on a clean face and wait 10 to 15 minutes for it to penetrate.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a nice dropper to make sure that the product is used properly and helps prevent over pouring or spilling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li> so i showered that night and applied on clean skin and went to bed.  </li>
            <li> all those wonderful natural nutrients penetrating my cells and healing me of all of the daily toxins I encounter everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the stickiness - it is mildly sticky, rather than smooth, to apply.</li>
            <li> I alternate it with their super c serum which is also amazing!</li>
            <li> I also feel my skin seems brighter and have used less make-up because I feel more confident in my own skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are other good products out there, but I think you have to find the product that works for YOU.</li>
            <li> It is not thick so this is very easy.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure how many stars to give this, because for someone younger than me it will probably be just fine.  </li>
            <li> Just started on the Super Serum to use along with the original.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, but I don&#x27;t feel it does much for my skin.  </li>
            <li> But the last two bottles I&#x27;ve received haven&#x27;t seemed to be as good of a product as before.</li>
            <li> Overall, REALLY REALLY good vitamin C serum in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This serum is in the sweet spot--</li>
            <li> A good topical Vit C is one of my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; products.  </li>
            <li> product is also very concentrated and potent.  </li>
            <li> product is also very concentrated and potent.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased a bottle for my mom, and she is in absolute love w/</li>
            <li> She always email me back ASAP her reply and gave me all the good info I needed.</li>
            <li> Full Disclosure</li>
            <li> I love tanning and have been doing so my whole life, as a result my skin suffered.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on some of the reviews I read, and because it was such a good price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend it more highly!</li>
            <li> I am in my 60’s and have been using OUI Vitamin C serum for 3 months and must say I am very pleased with the results, I love being outside and because of this have brown spots on my face, this serum is amazing, the spots are fading with most gone altogether, I can see improvement in my skin tone and texture, the lines around my eyes and mouth are noticeably softer, my skin appearance is healthier and I am using a lot less makeup.  </li>
            <li> For years, I have tried many &amp;#34;dermatologist only&amp;#34; products and serums and have had very few results - OUI is outstanding!!  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m so happy to found coui company and going to try other products as well.</li>
            <li> My experience is that it burns going on and requires application of a moisturizer really quickly after applying it.  </li>
            <li> All dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and soft and looks more youthful.  </li>
            <li> This one and the super C was $50 dollars</li>
            <li> I use the serum once a day, along with the Super C serum (though I use the Super C serum twice a day).  </li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and in mint condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and makes your skin glow.  </li>
            <li> My skin seems smoother and softer, but don&#x27;t see any tremendous change yet in lines.  </li>
            <li> I use this product in the evening, and the Super C in the morning.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly</li>
            <li> I began using it before the Super C Serum was released</li>
            <li> so when I began using the Super C Serum</li>
            <li> am so looking forward to continuing to reap the benefits of this super serum.</li>
            <li> My skin is hydrated and plump, and my skin tone is evening out quickly.</li>
            <li> I just ordered their super c to try out this time.</li>
            <li> It has improved my skins appearance and given it a vibrant, healthy glow.</li>
            <li> reading a million reviews, I bought the COUI Super C Serum and the COUI Vitamin C Serum 20%.</li>
            <li> use the Super C 2x a day - morning and night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear and light and feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> I have used several Vit C 20% serums and I am most pleased with the results of the COUI serum.</li>
            <li> I also use the COUI Super C Serum with this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried the more expensive C serums and have found Coui the best of all of them.  </li>
            <li> I am now using Vitamin C super serum</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this potent skin care.</li>
            <li> There are other lipid forms of Vitamin C that are more stable than LAA, but they aren&#x27;t as effective (NIH, Vitamin C in dermatology).  </li>
            <li> In other words very, very, happy with the results I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li> stronger the taste and smell normally the better the effect.</li>
            <li> the great part about this product is that if it is not for your skin than there is 30 Day gaurentee back and thats the reason I actually make sure before buying any product.</li>
            <li> I alternate this product with the Super C Serum which also helps with my wrinkles, I love it as well!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation, just a slight tingling</li>
            <li> Smells fresh like citrus/orange, the scents fades away quickly.</li>
            <li> The first product I used had a light, fresh orange scent.</li>
            <li> This Product really works, You can see results very quickly.</li>
            <li> Recently added this to my usual regimen and really glad I did, I can see improvement in two weeks, and thats great!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> More even skin tone and less fine lines for sure.</li>
            <li> I noticed a significant difference within the first week.</li>
            <li> I am one of those that if it doesn&#x27;t help with that first one, I don&#x27;t buy it again!  </li>
            <li> Applied sparingly and let dry, it works synergistically  with my favorite moisturizer to make my skin feel tighter, yet  more supple and softer to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it just works differently; this seems to be a sit on top of your skin, where the Perricone absorbs very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love both the Super C and the Natural Vitamin C</li>
            <li> She swears by this product.&lt;br /&gt;The package looks great and the overall impression is very professional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually gone out without foundation -- just a bit of concealer under my eyes and a swipe of mineral veil on top of my COUI sunscreen -- and looked perfectly fine.  </li>
            <li> I like the packaging too, specially the dark bottle and good service</li>
            <li> the results I am seeing in my skin in a short period of time (yes, two days) are truly amazing.  </li>
            <li> I have been a proud fan and user of the Ole Henrikson Vitamin C serum for about a year now but at  $30 for only a tiny bottle of 0.5oz it eventually seems to take out a huge chunk from my beauty budget.</li>
            <li> We have also added more quality anti-oxidants such as Ferulic Acid, vitamin E and others, in generous amounts, in order to create a powerful anti-oxidant serum that fights the free radicals that your skin encounters daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A fantastic price for a product that really works.</li>
            <li> I am 75 years old and have tried, unsuccessfully, many anti-aging products....</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll get back as to how she liked it.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Noticed one of the manufacturer&#x27;s response implied there was no need to include paraben..  since they made the product fresh with a recommended shelf-life of 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I rated this five stars because the product has ingredients known to work and the product is fresh.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just worth the hassle to me.</li>
            <li> So far, I am quite satisfied with these product.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I immediately bought a second bottle!  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t need to look any further, I found a product I liked and addressed my issues.  </li>
            <li> I have faith that the product is fresh</li>
            <li> I liked the product and reordered it, but the second bottle arrived with a defective seal and the product had leaked.</li>
            <li> My face feels fresh.</li>
            <li> I keep this in the refrigerator to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li> Face is back to clear and feels great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed Natural Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li> Worth the cost</li>
            <li> There are three words to describe this product: COUI Natural Vitamin C Serum 20%, “I LOVE IT”.  </li>
            <li> I looked into it and found articles suggesting that a strong C serum might be too much to start off with for some first time users.</li>
            <li> I did feel a tingle when I first tried but that went away fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s been a little over 7 months since I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently, and all I can say, it&#x27;s been one of the best products that I have ever used so far.</li>
            <li> I had purchased the Perricone MD Vitamin C Serum cream (in a tube) on a whim, and was impressed with it after a short time, but the price was so high (per unit volume) that I shopped for some potential lower priced alternatives.  </li>
            <li> My friend was right.</li>
            <li> It’s like, it feels right to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got an email right away to ensure that I&#x27;ve received the product along with some skincare tips.</li>
            <li> I have to say that my skin has a beautiful clear heathy glow and at age 55 have minimal wrinkling.</li>
            <li> What I really like about this serum is it leaves your skin feeling fresh and full of moisture.  </li>
            <li> and I will only state a review which is thoroughly true and authentic.  </li>
            <li> This serum actually does contain a true 20% Vitamin C concentration, which many others do not have.  </li>
            <li> It reduced wrinkles, made my complexion clearer, and most important, reduced the large scar from a facial melanoma surgery.  </li>
            <li> The serum feels great on the skin, not the least bit oily, absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is loaded with great ingredients and after applying for few days, I felt a positive effect.</li>
            <li> You can really smell the vitamin C in it and once you put it on it absorbs quickly into the skin which allows you to start your make up or beauty routine right away.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my second bottle and can easily see this product becoming my staple (as long as the price remains a good bargain like it has been thus far).</li>
            <li> I have used QUI Vitamin C Serum for two weeks and am stunned that two large brown spots on the side of my face are gone!</li>
            <li> The delivery is super fast.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t review many products, but this product does it exactly what it claims to do.  </li>
            <li> It is a real serum loaded with maximum possible active ingredients to provide you with the best anti-oxidant and anti-aging effects.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> My new fav!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product long enough to be able to say I believe it makes a nice difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> The first was a different organic kind that I also rated 5 stars as it deserved it and worked very well, but that was before I tried this.</li>
            <li> So, I like it, my skyn has recovering very fast</li>
            <li> It absorbed quickly and readily into the skin making my skin feel really hydrated.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m allowed to continue, I&#x27;ve decided to try the Super C next since it appears to be more suited for sensitive skin and more mature skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have noticed an improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> The serum is extremely light and has made a marked improvement on my skin -- brighter, healthier looking --</li>
            <li> The point of Vitamin C is to  prevent future damage more than to correct current damage, so I wasn&#x27;t looking for a big change in pigmentation, but am very happy with the overall results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was the first product that I have used in this skin line</li>
            <li> Makes you feel the company are genuinely interested in your skin.</li>
            <li> My skin seems brighter and is incredibly soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> my skin gotten so much clearer!</li>
            <li> I will most definitely be getting this product again!!!</li>
            <li> I am definitely SEEING some improvement, but my skin FEELS better.</li>
            <li> I have even tried it on my crocodile hands and they are so soft and smooth now.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased thousands of products on Amazon and this is the first review I have written --</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be extra sure  about the feedback I continued to use it for another two weeks before commenting.</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks I noticed significant improvement in my skin tone and condition, my old acne spots started to face and my skin tone become brighter too!</li>
            <li> , I know it was because of the consistent use.</li>
            <li> I started to notice a change within the first 3-4 days but after 3 weeks the results were drastic.</li>
            <li> The first one I purchased was priced at ~$25.</li>
            <li> but my laugh lines are looking much smoother.</li>
            <li> However, with that said everyone&#x27;s skin is different and I would recommend this brand because for someone else it might absorb better than it does for me.  </li>
            <li> my skin not only looks radiant but it also feels more</li>
            <li> Overall the product was okay</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle and love this product.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this and will be returning for more.</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many comments and questions on what I am doing differently to my skin.   </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I like so much about it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician and avid researcher.  </li>
            <li> This was the first time that I used this brand of Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> My skin is finally where I want it to be :)</li>
            <li> and I still recommend it whole heartedly!  </li>
            <li> Really helps with texture, pores, and clarity!  </li>
            <li> Thanks COUI!  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and this product has made me look fabulous.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for making such a nice product.</li>
            <li> My skin if definitely smoother, brighter and I have so much more radiance.</li>
            <li> Really love this serum and can’t wait to get my next bottle .</li>
            <li> but those remarks struck me funny.</li>
            <li> I have more sunspots on my left side</li>
            <li> I have also appreciated all the tips and advice given by the company!</li>
            <li> Thanks OUI!</li>
            <li> when i first received it in the mail i decided to put in on immediately.</li>
            <li> It is also feels very sticky on my skin even after it has supposedly been absorbed.</li>
            <li> My skin is definitely brighter and it feels like my moisture lotion absorbs better.</li>
            <li> , this is my first experience with this ingredient).</li>
            <li> Instead, I got hot dog in a bottle.</li>
            <li> When I first began derma rolling, Vitamin C Serum was recommended by the company who sold the roller.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased many different C-serums over the years.  </li>
            <li> other place that I have noticed this serum having an amazing effect is on my hands.</li>
            <li> The product arrive before expected, it was a small envelope, great conditions and love the fact it fitted into my mail box.</li>
            <li> The first week I got this it was ok, but the second week I started using it to much.</li>
            <li> , dark spots disappear, and my skin looks much more youthful!  </li>
            <li> other aspects/ingredients that I liked...</li>
            <li> As a skincare professional,  I really appreciated that COUI emailed me detailed instructions on how to use and store this product.  </li>
            <li> The fine lines on  my face have diminished and my skin looks healthier in general.</li>
            <li> be honest a bit of a skeptic when it comes to anti-aging products, however I was pleasantly surprised after only two weeks of using this product I started to see a noticeable  difference in my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> As a former sun-bather, I have been very pro-active about trying to fade sun spots and appreciate the launch price that I was able to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much better, around my eyes is much smoother and the sagging look on mid face has diminished.  </li>
            <li> did a fair bit of research about the active ingredients in this serum and was excited to try something that could be kind to my 46-year old skin while softening the beginnings of wrinkles in the usual places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have seen my age spot lighten significantly and just overall general appearance of skin looks more youthful.</li>
            <li> and I already see positive changes.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much for sharing this!</li>
            <li> However, at my age I am so aware of how much my skin is changing, and I didn&#x27;t feel I had a choice but to try it.</li>
            <li> This serum reduced my wrinkles and lines that were just so irritating because I still want to be beautiful.</li>
            <li> Only LAA is biologically active is therefore favored in dermatology.  </li>
            <li> They list all the ingredients and there is not a single ingredient that I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable about being soaked into my skin.  </li>
            <li> They list all the ingredients and there is not a single ingredient that I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable about being soaked into my skin.  </li>
            <li> dermatologist thinks my skin is easily 15 years younger looking than my would suggest by my age.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one lists L-ascorbic acid (which is pure vitamin c) and this is known to be unstable and drying for the skin.  </li>
            <li> Women of a certain age (senior +)</li>
            <li> and this product is pure</li>
            <li> Well, it is literally a certain glow because my face has become brighter.</li>
            <li> My face has become clearer and there is certain radiance to it.</li>
            <li> I am certain with prolonged use</li>
            <li> and certainly doesn&#x27;t absorb.</li>
            <li> Anyone who is following to any extent news and updates on what is new in skin care surely has heard about benefits of Vitamin C Serums.  </li>
            <li> The fine lines on my upper cheeks are gone.</li>
            <li> It does make a difference on fine lines especially around chin area.</li>
            <li> Even the fine lines are starting to fade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, we do promise results, with constant use wrinkles and fine lines will fade and your skin will become and look healthier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The line had better results, felt good on the skin and less expensive than most lines I have tried, even those from the professionals.</li>
            <li> On the other days I use the Super C and the combination of both is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It shows gradual positive results and other people notice more than you will.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing - REAL Vitamin C Serum and at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars for now, but I&#x27;ll re-review it when i notice a  huge difference later.</li>
            <li> Fast service, but not packaged very well.  </li>
            <li> My use of these products is also part of a healthy life style- no smoking, rare alcohol, regular exercise and enough rest.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles...not so much.</li>
            <li> My skin thanks me for both,</li>
            <li> Is this really just Vitamin C serum ?</li>
            <li> Thanks for asking, Mrs. Winnie Montes</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t seen a whole lot of change in some of the darkness yet, I&#x27;m hoping with continued use my skin spots will begin to lighten.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the best...\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> It is not irritating or drying, nor does it have an oily feel.</li>
            <li> I like the vitamin C serum so much.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It is on the liquid side and absorbs very well into my skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very watery, so</li>
            <li> just keep the price reasonable.</li>
            <li> I was using another Vitamin C product that costs three times as much.</li>
            <li> It really promotes an even skin tone, and controls brown spots.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it all that much compared to Obaji, but I like the price point and that the folks distributing it were concerned with my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Going on three weeks now, I really think I am seeing a difference.  </li>
            <li> I really feel like my skin is getting rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> skin is really looking healthier.</li>
            <li> I don’t really have wrinkles</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> , I was really dying to try it myself.</li>
            <li> I really like this Vitamin C Serum -</li>
            <li> I really like this serum</li>
            <li> This was so embarrassing and affected my performance as a real estate professionals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for 3 months now, and can really see the difference.  </li>
            <li> guess that means that it really works.</li>
            <li> It comes out very watery and a cloudy almost transparent color.  </li>
            <li> Thanks OUI...</li>
            <li> /&gt;i&#x27;ll absolutely get it again</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> chose this form of Vitamin C for our serum because of its acidity so that you can benefit from its gentle exfoliation properties.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li> It really does what it is advertised to do.</li>
            <li> I really noticed the improvement on my chest.  </li>
            <li> did absolutely nothing but burn my skin</li>
            <li> Two important aspects of a topical vitamin C formulation I consider are bioavailability and stability.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I use two times day, morning and night , I see my skin  gloing very</li>
            <li> I will absolutely be ordering another bottle.</li>
            <li> Gentle exfoliation</li>
            <li> My skin tone has definitely evened out after 2 bottles and my face is smooth.  </li>
            <li> I really think it works and does what it is supposed to do for the skin based on what they say about the benefits of Vitamin C Serums.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very prone to break outs.</li>
            <li> I absolutely will be repurchasing this serum and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I guess it works very well with my SPF.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I guess the vitamin C here is really the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> My skin feels much smoother and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I think the serum is really working as it should be.</li>
            <li> Also; the seller, Ms Alessandra Poletti was very helpful and patient too.</li>
            <li> this stuff is really sticky.</li>
            <li> I apply it every morning and include my neck and chest which also looks much smoother.</li>
            <li> that really</li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum has really improved my complexion.</li>
            <li> It is also very watery.</li>
            <li> As prescription Fast delivery</li>
            <li> I will continue to use Coui products and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was given this product to try and I can only say that I am amazed and thrilled at the results after only 7 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was given this product to try and I can only say that I am amazed and thrilled at the results after only 7 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few highlights of what I liked about Coui vit C:  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I saw results within a few days.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t expected such good results.  </li>
            <li> Made my face slightly firmer the first week of use, and then I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could see a difference after that.</li>
            <li> I used both of the serums in combination, applying the Vitamin C Serum first which has the exfoliating factor (letting it fully absorb into my skin) and following it up with the Super C Serum.  </li>
            <li> I also apply it directly when I see a blemish or breakout cropping it up because it takes down the inflammation and helps it to heal more quickly.</li>
            <li> I found it to be a little sticky on my face at first, but wow the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> So far I notice no difference between the more expensive product and Oui, therefore, I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> the other hand, this serum from OUI feels very rich without much stinging.</li>
            <li> I love the price compared with other comparable products and will continue to repurchase.  </li>
            <li> Overall, my skin tone is better, almost no more pimples and blackheads and my skin is definitely better hydrated...  </li>
            <li> The elasticity of my skin especially around my mouth is significant.</li>
            <li> For that reason I use it every other day, at night.o absolutely love about this product and this brand of Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> Although it says in the direction to apply every other day, I do it every night and top it with a night moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but this seems to help more than the other ones that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> the smell - it&#x27;s not a bad smell, but not exactly nice and refreshing either.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this serum to anyone who wants to add a Vitamin C serum to their skincare regimen.</li>
            <li> I have used Peter Thomas Roth in the past but the results are as good if not better at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> company is quite special, as they send you personal thank</li>
            <li> I am 71 years old and have good skin, almost no wrinkles, but I had acne in high school in small patches on my chin and forehead.  </li>
            <li> After a month she notices that there is something new about me, a ‘certain glow’.</li>
            <li> a woman who has very fair skin with freckles, I have also been very sensitive to a wide array of skin products in the past.</li>
            <li> Being over 50 yrs old doesn&#x27;t help the matter too, especially with age spots, fine lines, dryness and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products that did absolutely nothing for me, and I&#x27;ve tried products that seemed to have helped a little bit - but nothing to write home about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> My co-workers think I am using new make-up that &amp;#34;looks great&amp;#34; and my husband commented that I looked 16!  </li>
            <li> but I live in Florida at this time and the sun really affected my skin and damaged it.</li>
            <li> I use this Vit C twice a week and the super C daily as per the e-mailed instructions.</li>
            <li> I now use this serum, the Super C and their UV Facial SPF 30.</li>
            <li> I have been  using Coui vitamin C super serum and the regular  C serum for&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I thought I would just buy the main ingredients and give it a try.</li>
            <li> I needed something to help with aging skin, particularly sagging skin, some plumping here and there to make my face seem fuller</li>
            <li> and I will always use it along with my Retin A. I tanned in my younger, more ignorant days, and now my goal is to undo the damage I caused back then.</li>
            <li> but it just doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as I like, so for that reason I&#x27;m only using it at night</li>
            <li> because my face is more hydrated, the few wrinkles I do have don&#x27;t crease as much because of the hydration, so it does give a diminished look to them...</li>
            <li> The smell is the main reason it&#x27;s not getting 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> They also talk about the particular benefits for aging skin and skin that has been exposed to the sun etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I alternate it with the Super C Serum (also by COUI)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is my main issue.</li>
            <li> One in particular was over $80.  </li>
            <li> I feel that I have seen more results using this serum than with the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> but the price is so high</li>
            <li> Highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> After all that I would highly recommend this serum to a friend.</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It did moisturize very well and I am sure it could be used to boost a regular moisturizer in the dry winter season.  </li>
            <li> It has a bit of a different (not bad, just not ordinary) sent and</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to everyone who wants to give their skin a swift kick in the A$$!!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the thickness of the product, as I am accustomed to very liquidy competitors.  </li>
            <li> So far, and it&#x27;s been two weeks, I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I have old skin, I am 59, this product has helped my skin so much in just a week.  </li>
            <li> Will post more after a few weeks of using this.</li>
            <li> I normally put this serum on at night as that is when I have the time to indulge myself.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I personally struggle with the smell and at first used too much</li>
            <li> It is essential to collagen production and a powerful antioxidant.</li>
            <li> My skin seems more firm, and some splotchiness I have had has evened out.  </li>
            <li> Not having changed my skin care routine except for using OUI moring and evening, I&#x27;ve noted my deepest lines--the 11&#x27;s, naso-labial lines, as well as those smile lines around the eyes, have diminished in only 30 days of use.  </li>
            <li> I can feel my skin drinking it in just like when I drink a big glass of freshly juiced fruits and vegetables,</li>
            <li> This and The Super C Serum are the only two C-Products I found that I would dare put on my sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> The price was right for such a power-packed serum.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was watching Dr. Oz show one day and they&#x27;re talking about the right ingredients in a facial care to look up to when buying.</li>
            <li> It felt so moisturized after only 2 days of use and now after two weeks I can actually see how the fine lines around my lips are fading.</li>
            <li> The instructions suggest to discard after 6 months due to chemicals losing effectiveness - no idea how accurate</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I thought my skin would adjust to the new product</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see new ones developing.</li>
            <li> I did not expect miracles and it did not get rid of 65 years of abuse, but I notice a glow and new softness to my skin.  </li>
            <li> The biggest difference I&#x27;ve noticed was when I put my makeup on my fine lines/ dark spots are gone.  </li>
            <li> This product made a huge difference in not only the depth and length of the wrinkles around my eyes but also over all my skin looks younger, tighter and healthier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and spent most of my years in the sun &amp; this product has truly helped in improving the overall look of my skin.</li>
            <li> which I think makes people look younger and something to help smooth over facial lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone who has sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend anybody who has sensitive and acne prone</li>
            <li> but I highly recommend not to use around the sensitive eye.  </li>
            <li> Some reviews mention the fact that this product is a little liquid, yet it is that light consistency that allows for the product to be absorbed deep into the skin.</li>
            <li> It tightens my jawline, it evens out my complexion, and it makes the fine lines around my eyes less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li> So far nothing!</li>
            <li> This is by far a keeper!</li>
            <li> Frequently get compliments on my completion !</li>
            <li> and I feel like it benefits my skin, but again if I&#x27;m not careful about how much of it I apply at one time it does remain sticky for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> I can say is WOW !</li>
            <li> It is really, really soft and supple!  </li>
            <li> Oz I think mentioned vit.C and Hyaluronic being important once; he can be a little overwhelming, with his vast knowledge of do&#x27;s, tries and haves.</li>
            <li> Before, my face would feel dry most of the day, even with moisturizer ( I have dry skin).</li>
            <li> I am far from young so this is high praise indeed.</li>
            <li> The ingredients look very promising - a lot of good stuff with large quantities and none of the bad ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried several Vitamin C serums in the past but this one is amazing.</li>
            <li> It has lifted and removed old scarring and imperfections with no reddening or peeling (and I have very sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li> and I have searched the world high and low for something to help with my crow&#x27;s feet, smile lines, and overall skin dullness.</li>
            <li> They said, it&#x27;s Vit C and hyaluronic acid, so I went to my Amazon account and research for products that will have those ingredients and found this OUI with several positive feedbacks; hence, I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Manufacturers know consumers are aware of phalates/parabens/SLS and are shifting to substitutes that are often toxic but less &#x27;recognizable&#x27; by consumers, like phenoxethanol.</li>
            <li> My skin feels tight and smooth.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s thick, goes on very light.</li>
            <li> a slight tingling or refreshing feeling) and you will definitely see it in the results.&lt;br /&gt;Please note that our serum is not transparent or clear.</li>
            <li> After a few days, I noticed my skin had plumped up and fine lines were reduced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple weeks, but it has helped with some dry spots, and I have felt that my skin feels younger and more &#x27;plump&#x27; since.</li>
            <li> I now just drizzle a little and smooth it out.  </li>
            <li> and when I went into the liquor store the other day and the cashier asked for my ID when he saw how old I was his eyes bugged out and he told me that I looked like I was right out of high school.</li>
            <li> After less than a week of staying faithful to using this every am, I noticed a significant difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I intend to use vitamin c serum to clear my acne scars.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried are clear and not sticky.</li>
            <li> I am 48 yrs old and my skin is looking younger thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> I have used COUI&#x27;s Natural Vitamin C Serium for over a year.  </li>
            <li> and I think my skin is too sensitive at my age.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give it to my 43 year old daughter</li>
            <li> I have tried others but like the consistency, lack of stickiness, and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Like so far.</li>
            <li> I have mature skin</li>
            <li> I have been using OUI Natural Vitamin C Serum, for some time now.</li>
            <li> and I think the serum is really working as it should be after only using it for one week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks, but so far, am really enjoying it.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I started getting all these breakouts on my 55 year old face after I started using this as directed.</li>
            <li> Natural</li>
            <li> The product has met all her expectations so far.</li>
            <li> I am an almost 70 year old woman.  </li>
            <li> My 27 year old daughter tried and&lt;br /&gt;liked</li>
            <li> But what I&#x27;ve notice so far, is that my skin texture, dryness and age spots are dramatically and continually diminishing.</li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve also started using it on the more delicate chest area.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels immensely soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> I am 29yrs old.</li>
            <li> Did not work well for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and when I applied this serum it tingled a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far the serum is working well.  </li>
            <li> I really can see the different in my skin</li>
            <li> One had a very chemical smell and stained my palm yellow, some didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference at all.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m 30 years old</li>
            <li> /&gt;Depending on your individual skin type and condition, you should expect to see an improvement very soon.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It really does its job by fading the red marks on my face.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the improvement in my skin after a week of using Natural Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li> is that it is all natural.  </li>
            <li> is that it is all natural.  </li>
            <li> and my sunspots are nearly gone.  </li>
            <li> and shall we say, very vain with how I look, and choose my facial products with utmost care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40 years old</li>
            <li> I think you are going to be pleasantly surprised, I was...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 years old</li>
            <li> I have never had a company do that and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It has a glow about it that I was pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 40s with combination skin.</li>
            <li> I deal with adult acne, and this has also helped with that.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t eliminated my acne completely, but my breakouts are diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My co-worker actually thought that I had a laser treatment done because my skin tone improved so much.  </li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum makes my skin so soft and looking brighter.  </li>
            <li> I give “TWO THUMBS UP” for COUI Natural Vitamin C Serum 20%.</li>
            <li> It is listed as professional because that&#x27;s what it is.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So, after a few months of use I can say I keep getting younger :)  </li>
            <li> It is too early to see significant results after such a short while, but there is definitely an</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to put on, I use very little each day (think 1/4 tsp) and</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve used a ton of other products paying a lot more for a whole lot less results!  </li>
            <li> At less no bad reaction</li>
            <li> -not tight.  </li>
            <li> My skin is softer, more toned, more even toned, less plagued with stubborn wrinkles and looks at least ten years younger.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;s and complete information on and about the products and their use.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased to share this information, as I have passed it along to my friends who are serious about their skin care regimine.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I have used a wide range of very expensive products but this serum is bar far the best investment I have made.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much, but  I recently had some treatments to my face and using both the creams I was given to use and the vitamin c serum together created a lot of peeling, so for now I have to back off.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s more improvement to come over the next few months!</li>
            <li> Love the way this makes my skin feel, and a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> No more trying out different serums, this is the one for me :-)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like very creamy substances and can&#x27;t bare tons of make-up on my face for that same reason.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, but something to be aware of depending on your personal expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> MAIN concern is my crow&#x27;s feet, and this is the ONLY product I&#x27;ve found that has softened them.</li>
            <li> i think my skin  does look a little better even though it has not been a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I use this product only twice a week because it is a little strong.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product and will be back again to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Fine lines are less!!  </li>
            <li> However, any topical vitamin C must have a pH level of 3.5 or less to penetrate the stratum corneum, which is the primary obstacle.  </li>
            <li> I ALWAYS use a moisturizing sunscreen everyday but since I&#x27;ve been using this product my skin has been more vibrant and brighter looking, I&#x27;ve also noticed that my blemishes heal faster than they used to as well as having less of them.</li>
            <li> I could really see a difference in my skin tone, decreased redness and it reduced the appearance of fine lines.  </li>
            <li> it absorbes quite quickly into your skin, with use with my other topical products</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate and using this every morning gently exfoliates my skin enough so that I have basically eliminated blemishes!</li>
            <li> I was offered OUI as part of their validation process in order to give some feedback and thought it worth a try, given that it was half the price of the Ole Henrikson.</li>
            <li> /&gt;With only 7 applications so far, my skin is markedly improved.</li>
            <li> Later I&#x27;ve got another email with further advices, for which I&#x27;m very thankful</li>
            <li> The Clinical C&#x27;s exfoliating effects are extremely gentle compared to my regular routine and my skin likes the extra Vitamin C for scarring.</li>
            <li> It is difficult for manufacturers to keep the vitamin c available to be absorbed by the skin.  </li>
            <li> I am now on my second bottle of this product and unfortunately I don&#x27;t think it is doing my skin any good.  </li>
            <li> I did not immediately start using product when I received it as I wanted to finish other products I had first.  </li>
            <li> why, but absolutely no other product I&#x27;ve tried has helped my crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> It does not dry stiff or sticky absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t experienced any unwanted reactions on my skin, nor any burning or anything bad.</li>
            <li> I am regularly told I appear to be in my early 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a couple weeks, but so far has been</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I only use it once a day, in the morning.</li>
            <li> The following morning i noticed my face was brighter and soft.</li>
            <li> i used to use skinceuticals C serum , oui looks, smells, feels the same and no where near the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very interested in trying the other products on next order- especially the Super-C serum.</li>
            <li> I had had a red spot on my cheek for months and this serum, used with the derma roller, has made it almost completely disappear.  </li>
            <li> have tried buying and using Vitamin C Serum several times, over the course of some years and several different brands, some of which were very pricy.  </li>
            <li> So far there&#x27;s is no different in wrinkle yet.  </li>
            <li> I was initially concerned because I have an intolerance to Vitamin C (digesting it) and I have extremely sensitive skin to boot.</li>
            <li> By applying OUI, I can barely see it.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with this Serum, I have bought plenty of anti aging products throughout my life and this Vitamin C Serum brings me back to at least three years younger!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s apparent that they care about what they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend it as a normal face serum (not only for after dema-rolling sessions) for daily use.</li>
            <li> It is thick, and goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> This product has helped make my face feel fresh and firm</li>
            <li> Skincare Vitamin 20% is one of the few serums on the market that actually does contain a true 20% Vitamin C concentration (not an “equivalent to”, “like” etc.).</li>
            <li> All of the ingredients are powerful antioxidants and this formula is moisturizing without being too heavy or oily</li>
            <li> I personally tried our newly formulated serum for the first time I felt a slight tingling feeling and a few minutes later a very “plumping” feeling as the high concentration of Vitamin C entered my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only recommendation to pass onto supplier is possibly either place shrink wrap around bottle cap or a sticker on box lid to show it is new unopened product.  </li>
            <li> She has dry, sensitive, and mature skin.</li>
            <li> I feel a slight tingling when I apply in to my freshly washed face, let it soak in for 5 minutes as directed, then follow it up with my daily moisture/ sunscreen combo.</li>
            <li> Truly I noticed a slight difference, I also noticed a few more breakouts..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands such as philosophy&#x27;s powder type one, ole henriksen, murad, tarte, mario badescu, jason, avalon, the body shop, and few other brands by amazon sellers.</li>
            <li> I saw only minimal improvement in dark spots and fine lines, and will keep looking...</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight difference after the first couple of applications.  </li>
            <li> It dries fairly quickly, so I can then apply my usual moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This one is much stickier on the skin than other brands</li>
            <li> I have used other Vitamin C Serums with Hyaluronic Acid and have not broken out ---I</li>
            <li> They both really compliment  each other.</li>
            <li> I’ve used other brands of vitamin C serums before, but COUI really makes a noticeable difference on my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is what it has done for me thus far (I&#x27;ve used it for one month); I significantly get less black heads and pimples on my face</li>
            <li> It does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li> however goes away after a few minutes and after I apply my night cream my skin feels juicier.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a few weeks and already my skin feels more elastic</li>
            <li> I got a bit confused and didn&#x27;t know where to start, so many options and different products.</li>
            <li> At first when you put out on you do feel a little tingle but its just the process of exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Over the past few years, I have used many different products, but none have given nearly the results as the COUI serums.</li>
            <li> But the last year or two I have noticed increased sunspots and a general unevenness in my skin.</li>
            <li> to expect in the first few weeks:&lt;br /&gt;Years of exposure to Sun and to Free-Radicals won’t go away overnight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She had been using this consistently at night time (mix a few drops with her moisturizer).  </li>
            <li> I have mature dry skin</li>
            <li> Just put a small drop and use you 4th finger to tap and smooth, then repeat other areas on your face.</li>
            <li> A decent serum, but not worth buying again.</li>
            <li> It also burned a little, I think it&#x27;s because I had so much slathered on.  </li>
            <li> It is a little sticky if you use too much.</li>
            <li> No matter how much or how little I put on it gave me the same sticky feeling</li>
            <li> I live in the dry SoCal climate and I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> After reading  reviews of several other suppliers, I opted for Coui Natural Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s and my skin has some sun damage, fine lines and dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I tasted it and it tastes natural with no funny &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> the other days,  I am 70 yrs old and have a background in skin care and health.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The first thing that appealed to me was that it actually looked like a serum .It is slightly thick and has an off white color .The</li>
            <li> It did irritate my skin a little at first, but switching to every other day and building up helped.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Reviewing the reviews to compare to buyers results, I notice now that the reviews are (at least) aggressively managed by the vendor, and makes me wonder if some of the submitted reviews are less than genuine.  </li>
            <li> Had sun damage and one dark spot from an old acne scar.</li>
            <li> I still have a big one on my forehead that is taking a long time to heal.</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly a quality product and well worth the small amount of money compared to other things I have tried.</li>
            <li> and I only noticed a small amount of burned odor when I first opened the bottle, the other times I didn&#x27;t smell anything and even if there was a smell, the air would have taken care of it.</li>
            <li> only very minor points I&#x27;d say aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Seriously, my pores shrunk so much, fine lines under my eyes fading, and one wrinkle that had been starting on my forehead (my first yay aging) has gotten so faint again.</li>
            <li> It nourishes my skin to the fullest because I have such dry skin.</li>
            <li> In fact, the product contains a paraben-substitute (phenoxethanol) that is a preservative and a known toxin, &amp;#34;...even in moderate amounts.&amp;#34;  Some tout the substance as being derived from grapefruit, and while it is naturally found in green tea, it is made in the lab for cosmetics [derived from benzene (known carcinogen) then treated with ethylene oxide (carcinogen)].  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Further, the ingredients shown in the listing are only a partial listing of the actual ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It ran out last month when I was lazy to order new bottle</li>
            <li> L-Ascorbic Acid (20%C) is the second ingredient after water, but it also includes several other antioxidants including, Ferulic Acid, Phloretin, Pomegranate Seed Oil, Vitamin E, Astaxanthin, Lutein, Lycopene, etc.</li>
            <li> I Want to give this product 5 stars, but due to the stickiness left on my face after applying it I only gave it four.</li>
            <li> My skin may just be a little sensitive for this product..</li>
            <li> I was afraid I would run out and made sure I ordered another while the launch price was still in effect.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous creams and dark spot correctors and this is the only one that works.</li>
            <li> and I will continue buying this product as long as it is on the markert</li>
            <li> The product arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I did see some of sun spots fading after a month, but they are not completely gone yet.</li>
            <li> and I am curious to see what results I might have if I keep using this in my daily skin care.  </li>
            <li> Will be buying again, but this bottle goes a long way</li>
            <li> My family has a long history of acne.</li>
            <li> also never really managed to finish all the bottle properly with a pump .With</li>
            <li> Be careful not to let it touch any open wounds though.</li>
            <li> without long term visible results until I found OUI Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> Will keep using and hopefully over the long term will see additional improvements.  </li>
            <li> Topical vitamin C can penetrate the stratum corneum and cross into the underlying dermal layers, when the pH is 3.5 or less (Draelos M.D., Zoe, Duke University, Dept. of Dermatology).  </li>
            <li> I plan to use it for a long, long time or until he tells me otherwise!</li>
            <li> Not only has it dramatically decreased the dark spots and fine lines but it has gone down and repaired my skin.  </li>
            <li> Obviously the acne marks are not completely faded but there was an improvement and since other than the serum I have not changed anything else in my skin care routine</li>
            <li> This is the second vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve tried, the other brand was a little more expensive</li>
            <li> I believe this product has helped to improve my skin above &amp; beyond the other products I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> have tried different brands, but this one is a little different</li>
            <li> I have tried other serums and had mixed results.</li>
            <li> I am in my middle twenties  and started using it every other night</li>
            <li> Other than that, I am really starting to like this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m using it every other day, maybe 3 drops for my entire face.</li>
            <li> Like other products, these product actually keeps my pores from getting clogged</li>
            <li> Other commercial cosmetic lines have 5 or 6 products and steps to their skincare regime and can be so costly.</li>
            <li> which means that you have to endure it for a very long time.</li>
            <li> and then the serum, I don&#x27;t feel my face dry anymore.</li>
            <li> my skin feels much fresher and its shallow appearance has improved considerably.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be put off by the sticky dry</li>
            <li> My skin face is mainly dry.</li>
            <li> The bonus of the OUI skincare Vitamin C serum is that it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin when I applied it in fact</li>
            <li> I use this at night and let it dry and then put cereve moisturizer on my face.</li>
            <li> In the mornings I put epiduo on and let it dry and then put cereve on again.</li>
            <li> ,it feels nice,doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out</li>
            <li> I saw the reviews that claim you need to be using this for a few months to see results, I&#x27;ve only been using for a short time</li>
            <li> I actually saw a difference in only a few days using this.</li>
            <li> Used regularly, there is no need for further exfoliation and even though I tend to get a bit of dry skin on my cheeks, this product is not drying or harsh.</li>
            <li> But I just ordered for a second time and only got half the contents of the bottle because the product leaked!</li>
            <li> It has a faint sweet smell, not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We do not merely fill our products with false</li>
            <li> While two weeks is much too soon for dramatic results, I can report the following:  </li>
            <li> I had pretty bad acne scars, large pores and blackheads on my face</li>
            <li> when I was only half way through the bottle.  </li>
            <li> As another reviewer mentioned, I&#x27;m needing less facial foundation, or I don&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> It appears clearer overall, and much less blotchy.</li>
            <li> This is a revised review to the second paragraph which is a previous review.</li>
            <li> my skin is glowing and lines look less obvious</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give this product five stars is because it has an odd smell.</li>
            <li> what I can tell you is that if you use this product and the super c serum consistently, you will not be disappointed, and I&#x27;ve used other products 3x the cost of theirs, and these two products combined, blow the other products that I have used out of the water.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything: from drugstore merch to super duper expensive brands.</li>
            <li> My face looks healthier, doesn&#x27;t get very dry or itchy</li>
            <li> Because it keeps my skin hydrated all day long, I don&#x27;t have to use any other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It does take a few min to dry, but again the amount you put on makes a big difference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 10 days now, and I noticed a little glow.</li>
            <li> Softer, smoother facial skin, and sometimes a little &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; from the reaction to the hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li> I have tried this OUI serum for 4 days now, and although it&#x27;s quite a little bit earlier to write my review, I think I need to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using this, and would recommend it to a friend looking for a little extra softness and plumpness at a value price.</li>
            <li> Have only used a few days.  </li>
            <li> Skin was improved after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> Also, the liquid was not very dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars as the seller really stands behind their product.  </li>
            <li> my face started to get a few white heads esp.</li>
            <li> I seen an improvement with my skin within a few days of daily use!</li>
            <li> Not much.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Note: I have been using this partially in conjunction with a derma roller (the micro-needle roller for your face).</li>
            <li> I personally think it smells like green</li>
            <li> This serum has made the scars less visible and less red.  </li>
            <li> My dark spots are already fading after only a few days.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use this before bed, as it can make my makeup look a little strange.</li>
            <li> I realized  a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The bonus effect is that the small lines above my lips have become less visible in the last few weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried various Vitamin C serums in the past but have found that they tend to over promise.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t see results with other products and move onto the next thing.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know about this product because I failed to read the directions and put a ton on my face and decotage before heading to bed.  </li>
            <li> I am considering ordering the other serum and the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It was tedious and time consuming, which means I didn&#x27;t use it consistently.  </li>
            <li> I tried other Vitamin C serums from other sellers on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> No BS, my husband came up to me the other night and felt my face...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the product every other day, as directed</li>
            <li> I have used it for the past two weeks following the instructions to the letter.  </li>
            <li> I have been using other Vitamin C products</li>
            <li> Had bought other product with vitamin C and it felt sticky hours after putting it on so do your homework.look at the reviews.</li>
            <li> I like the color and the smell, the other ones were like water.</li>
            <li> Even though the bottle is small, it will last me a long time because you need just a few drops to apply it all over the face and neck.</li>
            <li> - I have other products that I use for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> but about every other day, and I&#x27;ve already seen improvements to my skin.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the other person who said it was sticky.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m anxious to see what it will do in the next month or so.</li>
            <li> The other serum I used had a pump</li>
            <li> I must say with other things I have gotten for my face have not worked the way this has.</li>
            <li> I like this product, however, I have acne prone skin and have found that I can&#x27;t even use it every other day because it seems to cause bumps on my skin...</li>
            <li> That might in part be due to my age, (63 now), but I believe this product has helped that since I was oily before using this.</li>
            <li> Feels sticky - other</li>
            <li> I use it every other day, at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry if I am unable to report on the ultimate efficacy of this product,but I could never use it consistently to be able to opine.</li>
            <li> One other bonus...</li>
            <li> I use it at night and the other Vitamin C serum they make in the morning</li>
            <li> This is unlike any of the other Vit C treatments.  </li>
            <li> I use the Vit C 20% at bedtime every other night.</li>
            <li> like me are always game to try something new.  </li>
            <li> I know the benefits of vitamin C (and ferulic acid/ Vitamin E), but could not find an affordable product that had the type of active ingredients I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This days it is really difficult to find such natural products.  </li>
            <li> This days it is really difficult to find such natural products.  </li>
            <li> The other benefit is that it lightens dark spots and evens skin tones as well</li>
            <li> I suffered of acne and little dark spots, in the beginning I use the serum after cleaning my face with neutrogena soap but my face felt very dry.</li>
            <li> You will not waste your money again on some false promises on what other skin care products will do.</li>
            <li> It got itchy on me, so be careful not to over use this because a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> but if you look hard enough you can see it.</li>
            <li> only negative is that the serum feels somewhat sticky as it dries.</li>
            <li> even as late as 30 minutes later.</li>
            <li> Seems to be gradually helping with dark spots, lines, and discoloration.</li>
            <li> Not giving my age, but believe I look at least 10 years younger.  </li>
            <li> My dark spots are fading after using vitamin c almost every day for 9 months.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of dark spots I hope will fade as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It also does not sting around the delicate eye area (obviously don&#x27;t get it in your eyes).&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle should last at least 6 months, I&#x27;d predict.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any sensitivity issues but please note I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use it most nights before bed as the base under my night time moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells like lemon and even tastes a bit sour.</li>
            <li> When I apply the product I can feel it tingling and getting down into the pores, where all the changes take place!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> do a lot of running up and down stairs.</li>
            <li> but i just threw money down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over two weeks for scars on face due to acne.</li>
            <li> (I mean a BIG difference).</li>
            <li> Time will tell if it also provides the other benefits!</li>
            <li> Also the active acne and pimples have subsided a little.</li>
            <li> Lines are less noticeable ;pore are smaller;skin is lifted.</li>
            <li> received a discount coupon for another bottle, less that</li>
            <li> Since i started using C OUI they have faded by half their size.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking brighter and healthier, some creases and lines seem to be less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> The largest brown spot I have has lightened about half</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and my crow&#x27;s feet are much less.</li>
            <li> When I put on my moistureizer  it to had a slight tacky feel to it.</li>
            <li> I put this on at night before sleep like half an hour before.</li>
            <li> and I have much less need to be applying moisturizing cream throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have less blackheads, my face is no longer oily in those areas</li>
            <li> When I apply it to my skin, I have a slight stinging sensation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started to look into the subject.</li>
            <li> My skin  is plumper, smoother, less lined and brown spots and hyper pigmentation has faded.</li>
            <li> I did read a lot of reviews on the product, specially the bad ones</li>
            <li> i washed it off in the morning and tried using it for a 2nd time the next night and the same thing- sticky, except this time it bothered me so bad</li>
            <li> The wrinkles and a few dark spots will take a bit longer</li>
            <li> Also my skin feels a bit tight immediately after I apply the serum.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I like how the bottle comes with a little dropper that I can use to apply the product to my fingertips without too much of a mess.</li>
            <li> Love this and to think of all the crap I&#x27;ve wasted money on!</li>
            <li> My crow&#x27;s feet haven&#x27;t vanished (this isn&#x27;t botox!), but I can visibly see that they are less harsh.</li>
            <li> Feels a little sticky when applied, but I do it at night.</li>
            <li> Tingles and stings a little going on.</li>
            <li> Yes it is a little sticky, but I apply it at night.</li>
            <li> It tingles a little and reminds me of orange juice.  </li>
            <li> However it dries my skin a little</li>
            <li> (Oh, do not forget if you exfoliate and then put OUI CE on it may sting a little but use a B or cream</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s odor, a little orange-y, although that goes away in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I usually use it at night before my other products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months now and have noticed a little change, I do like the smell which is citrusy and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little watery and tingles when applied on skin.  </li>
            <li> Age spots may be fading but it is a little to soon to tell.  </li>
            <li> A summer of Mediterranean sun and airplane travel had wreaked havoc on my skin, so I wanted something to help repair it a little.</li>
            <li> Still not sure about decreasing wrinkles and or helping with even out skin tone because I am using other products as well.</li>
            <li> I used it for almost a week before I noticed all the little bumps appearing on my forehead.</li>
            <li> It may be a little too hydrating for me.  </li>
            <li> may of helped a little.</li>
            <li> It was a little on the sticky side</li>
            <li> but took a little while to absorb where it wasn&#x27;t sticky</li>
            <li> Not very satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lighteners but they dried the spot out.  </li>
            <li> In just a few days after using it I could already see and feel a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> so I used it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money again on another beauty product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;a few months.  </li>
            <li> i been using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> So, I have bought this a few times.</li>
            <li> Let it work for a few minutes before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have noticed visible results after just a few uses..  </li>
            <li> I wait a few minutes</li>
            <li> I apply it before going to sleep everyday.</li>
            <li> and I think my uneven skin tone has a lot to do with the truckload of makeup I tend to put on my face.</li>
            <li> bought a few products from COUI and could not be happier.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> If they begin to, I just continue to use the serum each night for a few nights, and the pimple dissolves.</li>
            <li> It did take a few weeks for me to see a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few days now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never have done that before, because my skintone edges toward uneven too often.  </li>
            <li> skin does &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; when I use it, but it does feel quite greasy after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a graveyard of wrinkle creams/serums that represents a LOT of wasted $.</li>
            <li> Not a huge difference on acne scars</li>
            <li> Can feel it working with a slight tingle!  </li>
            <li> You would need at least two products form other skin care lines to even get close to this list and each of those products would cost around $150.&lt;br /&gt;As for effectiveness, I noticed an immediate smoothing and firming of my skin that I could feel when washing my face.</li>
            <li> No allergic or other negative reactions to product.  </li>
            <li> the liquid is a little foggy, so I&#x27;m not sure if it comes that way.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this serum approximately every other day for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> If you use very little of it that helps</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get past it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used several name brand that are expensive.</li>
            <li> I am just not sure why it is labeled as an exfoliant.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what it was supposed to do, but I did not notice any changes in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have using this product for a few weeks and can already see a difference in my age/sun spots!  </li>
            <li> Within 2-3 days of use, I started getting small whiteheads.  </li>
            <li> My skin is brighter, small lines gone, sun spots fading.</li>
            <li> The small bottle lasts me a couple of months</li>
            <li> Because I work a lot with my hands I tend to have a difficult time keeping them moisturised for long enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some pimples got really bad and left dark spots.</li>
            <li> Hard to keep using it as it gives one a sticky skin.</li>
            <li> Listing all ingredients in the Amazon listing might reduce negative reviews from buyers who can&#x27;t use some ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (well, at least not yet)</li>
            <li> By then it was too late.</li>
            <li> A lot of people complained about the smell</li>
            <li> After a few months, my face does not look &amp;#34;drawn&amp;#34; or tired.</li>
            <li> champagne color is due to our base serum of antioxidants such as pomegranate, lemon and orange extracts, Ferulic acid etc.</li>
            <li> But on the serious note, I do like the way this serum make my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I just plain like it!!</li>
            <li> This stuff left my skin feeling softer and looking smoother, but is has a bad smell.</li>
            <li> Moreover, the smell is appalling.  </li>
            <li> serum is very thin and cloudy, and dries a little sticky.</li>
            <li> Also the product came in 2 days late!</li>
            <li> Could have arrived broken.</li>
            <li> No product will cover the ravages of poor lifestyle choices.</li>
            <li> I have brown patches on my face that keep getting worse with age.  </li>
            <li> I worked for years at a respected spa where we received training in the science behind skin care from representatives of some of the highest end skin care lines around.</li>
            <li> Being and working out in the sun, and cold everyday, my skin goes through a lot of abuse.</li>
            <li> Waste of money :(</li>
            <li> Still skeptical</li>
            <li> I have no evidence that any of the reviews are fake.  </li>
            <li> I am always skeptical of products making a lot of claims.</li>
            <li> But Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid were ingredients in an expensive cream i read about</li>
            <li> I also have a furrow between my eyebrows, caused by years of reading in poor lighting I guess!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was just a bad batch, but this product was the worst purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time!</li>
            <li> news is I left it behind somewhere on my way home :( :( :(  </li>
            <li> It leaves a sticky coating on my face, making my face feel dirty.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used some very expensive products</li>
            <li> That is very difficult to get past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF IT HAD GONE BAD</li>
            <li> OR IF IT IS SUPPOSED TO SMELL THIS BAD</li>
            <li> Each time I used it I broke out in a bad rash/hives.  </li>
            <li> dont think it is a bad product but need to find one that works for you.</li>
            <li> It stings bad but the sensation goes away.</li>
            <li> Then I came across this serum and thought,Vitamin C, that can&#x27;t be bad.</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t as bad as some others said.</li>
            <li> but leaves my skin sticky .. went bad after a month or 2</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this...like</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see any difference on my skin :(</li>
            <li> , It is an acid peeling with TCA base, my skin was brown, burned , and i start to use this serun 5 days afther my peel .</li>
            <li> I hate the metal smell of my door keys on my hands...</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.. :(</li>
            <li> , I had to deal with horrible cystic acne just like before I found coui serum.</li>
            <li> BUT THE SMELL IS AWFUL.</li>
            <li> another reviewer said, I found it smelled horrible, nothing at all like citrus!  </li>
            <li> This product has an absolutely awful smell that lingers all night</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you make sure to apply as directed it brings a fresh looking skin.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and will order it now for the 3rd time.  It shows gradual positive results and other people notice more than you will.</li>
            <li> So far the best vitamin c serum I&#x27;ve found! Feels a little sticky when applied, but I do it at night. Gives skin a nice healthy glow</li>
            <li> I use this product only twice a week because it is a little strong.  On the other days I use the Super C and the combination of both is fantastic.  My skin looks superb and the wrinkle lines on my neck are finally diminishing.  Am hoping the moisturizer is out soon so I can benefit from this as well.  Thanks again for great products.</li>
            <li> i LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  i HAVE BEEN USING IT ABOUT 2 MONTHS AND I CAN TELL A DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN!!!</li>
            <li> Theres a lot of anti aging in this bottle.The difference in skin is remarkable. You will notice a smoother;healthier;radiant;and all over appearance in your skin.Lines are less noticeable ;pore are smaller;skin is lifted.This is just the beginning .Exspect a lot from this serum.My skin looks better every day.  THANKS FOR A GREAT PRODUCT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  It is thick, and goes on smooth.  As presented.  Fast service, but not packaged very well.  Could have arrived broken.</li>
            <li> I am 75 years old and have tried, unsuccessfully, many anti-aging products....all prices. This is the first time I have noticed an improvement in my skin. While I don&#x27;t expect to look like 50 again, several people have guessed my age to be in my 60&#x27;s since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> This product is good for erasing brown spots.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in night and I have to wear hat every time I go in sunny days. I use it before I use night cream .</li>
            <li> I have used COUI&#x27;s Natural Vitamin C Serium for over a year.  The serum is extremely light and has made a marked improvement on my skin -- brighter, healthier looking -- even radiant (or so my friends say!).  I have been asked multiple times if I have had &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; and I say no...but I use this Vitamin C serum and it&#x27;s making a huge difference.  I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several C serums and this one is the best for results.  I have a brown mark on my skin from tanning when I was younger.  It is noticable if I don&#x27;t use the serum.  I&#x27;ve used lighteners but they dried the spot out.  This lightens w/o drying.  The spot is on my brow bone so it is noticable if I don&#x27;t use a good C serum.  This one is the best so far.  I suggest using twice a day for best results.  It will start to oxidize (turn yellowish) if you don&#x27;t use often and let it sit.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure how many stars to give this, because for someone younger than me it will probably be just fine.  This combinations of ingredients is recommended by of a lot of Hollywood stars.  I am 69 and I think my skin is too sensitive at my age.  I&#x27;m going to give it to my 43 year old daughter and I&#x27;ll get back as to how she liked it.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Will be purchasing again!!!</li>
            <li> Made my face slightly firmer the first week of use, and then I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could see a difference after that.</li>
            <li> I am getting to the end of the bottle that I started using in August. I am very happy and impressed with the results I am getting by using this once per day. The price makes it affordable to use when so many anti-aging products are out of my price range.&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount coupon for another bottle, less that a month after starting the product, and it expired before I could order again. Too short of time frame to buy a second bottle until I started seeing results. I&#x27;m seeing and feeling the results and am so pleased with  this product.</li>
            <li> I am now on my second bottle of this product and unfortunately I don&#x27;t think it is doing my skin any good.  Having done more research, I discovered that the form of Vitamin C in this product is not the kind that is the most beneficial for skin.  This one lists L-ascorbic acid (which is pure vitamin c) and this is known to be unstable and drying for the skin.  My experience is that it burns going on and requires application of a moisturizer really quickly after applying it.  According to research (as of this date) the better forms of vitamin c for the skin are Tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate or Sodium ascorbyl phosphate.  I have purchased a product that lists the latter form and will see if it makes a difference.    UPDATE:  I have to add a comment here about this seller, who gets an A+++.  I received a refund immediately within 2 days of this post without even asking for one.  Please see discussion/comments following this review.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I would never have bought it but my dermatologist recommended it so I gave it a try.  In just a few days after using it I could already see and feel a difference in my skin.  My skin was noticeably softer and the finer wrinkles were gone.  Of coarse  the deeper wrinkles are still there but I swear they don&#x27;t seem as pronounced  (the &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; between the eyes).  I have a lot of sun damage as I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s and spent quite a bit of time in my younger years sun worshiping with no sunscreen.  This product seems to be reversing some of that damage.  As I said before I bought it initially as a recommendation from my dermatologist - I have since reordered and will continue to do so.  Great product!  And, on top of a fabulous product, the company has very good customer service as well.</li>
            <li> i have tried alot of vitamin C serums and this one is by far the best!!  My skin feels great and you ust cant beat the price!</li>
            <li> this softens the fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Since I began using this serum every morning I have noticed my skin is brighter.  It&#x27;s quick and easy to apply and works well under my moisturizer and sunscreen.  An essential part of my morning skin ritual!</li>
            <li> I am impressed with this product. Is also a great value. Researching the literature shows that Vit C, Hyaluronic acid, and retinol are the leading products for skin care. Then its just a matter of finding reputable products. I did not want to write a review until I tried both COUI products for a while. I use this Vit C twice a week and the super C daily as per the e-mailed instructions. Over the these I use a moisturizer with retinol. I have to say that my skin has a beautiful clear heathy glow and at age 55 have minimal wrinkling. I am regularly told I appear to be in my early 40&#x27;s. My husband has even started using the products. My use of these products is also part of a healthy life style- no smoking, rare alcohol, regular exercise and enough rest. No product will cover the ravages of poor lifestyle choices.</li>
            <li> I like this serum. It keeps my skin moist all day without any oiliness whatsoever. I have tried others but like the consistency, lack of stickiness, and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Not very satisfied with the product.  I bought it a while back and have used it consistantly.  I just finished the bottle and have noticed no difference whatsoever.  It is light and feels good on the skin but showed no improvement for me.  I will probably continue my search for a better product.  Oh, and I noticed since using this that I have had problems with blackheads which I have never had before.  For now I will continue my search for better results.</li>
            <li> Makes skin brighter and nice glow. Wrinkles...not so much.</li>
            <li> Like so far. Scent is like a vitamin c tablet. Tingles and stings a little going on. All dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> This serum is such an awesome product! It deeply hydrates and makes your skin feel fresh and beautiful. I highly recommend this product for anyone who has sensitive skin as well. It hydrates your skin without blocking any pores. The other benefit is that it lightens dark spots and evens skin tones as well</li>
            <li> I have brown patches on my face that keep getting worse with age.  Since i started using C OUI they have faded by half their size.</li>
            <li> After using for 3 weeks, I have to say I love this product!  My face feels smooth and soft and looks more youthful.  I have tried almost every product out there, this is the one I will stick with.</li>
            <li> I worked for years at a respected spa where we received training in the science behind skin care from representatives of some of the highest end skin care lines around. I know the benefits of vitamin C (and ferulic acid/ Vitamin E), but could not find an affordable product that had the type of active ingredients I was looking for. Then I found Coui. The ingredient list is impressive. L-Ascorbic Acid (20%C) is the second ingredient after water, but it also includes several other antioxidants including, Ferulic Acid, Phloretin, Pomegranate Seed Oil, Vitamin E, Astaxanthin, Lutein, Lycopene, etc. I&#x27;m not even listing them all. You would need at least two products form other skin care lines to even get close to this list and each of those products would cost around $150.&lt;br /&gt;As for effectiveness, I noticed an immediate smoothing and firming of my skin that I could feel when washing my face. The point of Vitamin C is to  prevent future damage more than to correct current damage, so I wasn&#x27;t looking for a big change in pigmentation, but am very happy with the overall results.&lt;br /&gt;The product does need to be shaken before each use. I have recommended this product to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Best C serum I tried! It&#x27;s potent! I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks, and starting to see results. Had sun damage and one dark spot from an old acne scar. The serum erased the discolorations and noticeably lightened the brown spot! My skin also looks and feels smoother than it did prior to using this serum. I don&#x27;t know if it had any effect on wrinkles, but for the even skin tone alone, it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for just over 3 months now and although there is definitely a tiny improvement in my skin tone i wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle worker.  Let&#x27;s hope there&#x27;s more improvement to come over the next few months!</li>
            <li> Do not look even 1 min younger</li>
            <li> great product -- not that I see my wrinkles disappearing!</li>
            <li> The best product I have used on my face and neck. It tightens my jawline, it evens out my complexion, and it makes the fine lines around my eyes less noticeable. Yes it is a little sticky, but I apply it at night. So, who cares.</li>
            <li> I used one bottle of this serum, which was recommended by my dermatologist.  It reduced wrinkles, made my complexion clearer, and most important, reduced the large scar from a facial melanoma surgery.  It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, but I don&#x27;t feel it does much for my skin.  Moreover, the smell is appalling.  I can&#x27;t get past it.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  I keep it in the refrigerator and it feels so good going on cool.</li>
            <li> This is the best vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve ever found.I think I&#x27;m using my 5th bottle. I&#x27;ve tried many brands such as philosophy&#x27;s powder type one, ole henriksen, murad, tarte, mario badescu, jason, avalon, the body shop, and few other brands by amazon sellers. I intend to use vitamin c serum to clear my acne scars.  But surprisingly, coui serum even prevents cystic acne that I always had. It ran out last month when I was lazy to order new bottle, I had to deal with horrible cystic acne just like before I found coui serum. I&#x27;ve experienced a huge difference on my acne prone skin. I love this! I use it twice a day. Because it keeps my skin hydrated all day long, I don&#x27;t have to use any other moisturizer. (I have combination skin, but it tend to be oily during summer). I highly recommend anybody who has sensitive and acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;They also offer great customer service. Once you purchase their product, they send you email to explain the product. A lot of sellers on amazon.com do that for asking good review, but I could feel coui company really care about their customers. , I&#x27;m so happy to found coui company and going to try other products as well.</li>
            <li> This product is great. It has a bit of a different (not bad, just not ordinary) sent and it is a bit tacky for a few minutes after application, but overall I really like it.</li>
            <li> I have tried vitamin c serums from 6 different companies.  This one is much stickier on the skin than other brands and I also found that it oxidized (turned yellow) when I was only half way through the bottle.  I prefer to not put oxidized product on my skin as it can damage the skin, rather than help it.  I will purchase the CE Ferulic from Cosmetic Skin Solutions again rather than this product.</li>
            <li> A decent serum, but not worth buying again. I saw only minimal improvement in dark spots and fine lines, and will keep looking...</li>
            <li> This is a great product - just as good as any C serum for 3 to 4 times the price! Very happy to have found it.</li>
            <li> I love this serum, your face has a nice glow to it after using, I also have turned my husband on to this who isn&#x27;t into skin care but absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;different than the Super C, thinner consistency, and for me, it seems to hydrate my skin better...leaves it deweyer.  I love both the Super C and the Natural Vitamin C and I will continue to purchase both....Why not?????. My skin thanks me for both,</li>
            <li> I have tried various Vitamin C serums in the past but have found that they tend to over promise. Another thing that bothered me was that most had the consistency of water and even looked like water that is until  I received OUI skincare’s Vitamin C serum as a gift. The first thing that appealed to me was that it actually looked like a serum .It is slightly thick and has an off white color .The smell is also extremely pleasant but what really cinched it for me  was the effect it had on my skin. It felt so moisturized after only 2 days of use and now after two weeks I can actually see how the fine lines around my lips are fading. My skin also feels more elasticized. Is this really just Vitamin C serum ? I am eagerly looking forward to seeing the results in two months.</li>
            <li> I love this product ! I have mature skin and it has given my skin a wonderful glow and texture...I plan&lt;br /&gt;on staying with this brand of products AND endorse them fully.</li>
            <li> Great product. I would highly recommend it. And the company is really awesome to their customers :-)</li>
            <li> I CAN NOR YET TELL IF IT IS WORKING BUT THE SMELL IS AWFUL. I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF IT HAD GONE BAD OR IF IT IS SUPPOSED TO SMELL THIS BAD</li>
            <li> I have been using OUI Natural Vitamin C Serum, for some time now. I believe  I  am on my third bottle and I am about to order another soon. I really love this product.  It has made an amazing difference in my skin tone and lessened my fine lines.  I have suggested  it to many of my friends and my daughter. I am picky about the products I use and I can assure you , if you try this you will love it.</li>
            <li> probably one of the best products out there. I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li> Good for face but I highly recommend not to use around the sensitive eye.  .I have used the 20% for 2-3 weeks on my face, neck and chest and I must say that my skin tone on face and chest is like when I was in my teens. I&#x27;m now 57. I have some roseacia and its gone. I can&#x27;t believe the change. I sunbathed for years and went to tanning beds. My pores are smaller. The fine lines on my upper cheeks are gone. No redness. Along with the Coui for eyes I look 8-10 years younger. No joking. Love this and to think of all the crap I&#x27;ve wasted money on! I recently cleaned out my stuff and only products I use is this and Kiehl&#x27;s. Love you Coui.</li>
            <li> This was the first product that I have used in this skin line and I used every drop and purchased 2 bottles since. I usually don&#x27;t see results with other products and move onto the next thing. I now use this serum, the Super C and their UV Facial SPF 30. The line had better results, felt good on the skin and less expensive than most lines I have tried, even those from the professionals. I think any age could use the products and I have combo skin and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily, tacky or drying. Many compliments since using the products that my skin looks great. .</li>
            <li> I have tried many vitamin C products and by far this is the best.  I am so impressed with Coui and their staff.  All my questions have been answered in terms I can understand.  I hope everyone will try this wonderful serum.</li>
            <li> I feel my skin feeling softer and clarity in my face.  I love it.</li>
            <li> One of the best vitamin c serums I have used. I think this is my second bottle, will continue to buy this one again.</li>
            <li> This is a birthday present for his birthday next month.  We will have to let you know in a couple of months. Lol. Thanks for asking, Mrs. Winnie Montes</li>
            <li> Great skin regimen , use at night before bed I wake up with a glow.</li>
            <li> Good for my aging skin!!  Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Have only used a few days.  But it&#x27;s thick, goes on very light. And my skin looks smoother. Best of all,my large sunspot is getting lighter. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a beautifully packaged item, the serum smells delicious and has great consistency. The seller sends a follow up email with instructions, etc. What a novel idea! I was totally impressed with their knowledge and amazing customer-service skills. The delivery is super fast. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I got this serum from a friend. She swears by this product.&lt;br /&gt;The package looks great and the overall impression is very professional. The ingredients look very promising - a lot of good stuff with large quantities and none of the bad ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my face and it feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shall update if and when the promise is fulfilled.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know about this product because I failed to read the directions and put a ton on my face and decotage before heading to bed.  This stuff was so sticky and I had to go back read the directions and was some off.  It also burned a little, I think it&#x27;s because I had so much slathered on.  I now just drizzle a little and smooth it out.  It is not thick so this is very easy.  It tingles a little and reminds me of orange juice.  It&#x27;s not sticky now that I follow the instructions.  I am hoping to look younger but have not been using it enough for enough days.  I am considering ordering the other serum and the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I used to make my own Vitamin C serum (all of the ingredients are on Amazon) to maximize efficacy of the product--concentration, and more importantly pH.  It was tedious and time consuming, which means I didn&#x27;t use it consistently.  I tried other Vitamin C serums from other sellers on Amazon.  Although most of the products I tried felt luxurious on the skin, I didn&#x27;t see long-term results.  This serum has changed that!  This is made with L-ascorbic acid (LAA).  Only LAA is biologically active is therefore favored in dermatology.  There are other lipid forms of Vitamin C that are more stable than LAA, but they aren&#x27;t as effective (NIH, Vitamin C in dermatology).  Those of us who have done our serum-homework, know that a 20% serum is the optimal concentration for the skin.  However, any topical vitamin C must have a pH level of 3.5 or less to penetrate the stratum corneum, which is the primary obstacle.  Topical vitamin C can penetrate the stratum corneum and cross into the underlying dermal layers, when the pH is 3.5 or less (Draelos M.D., Zoe, Duke University, Dept. of Dermatology).  The pH of this serum is between 1.5 and 2.0 (I checked it with pH strips)!  It&#x27;s the optimal concentration 20%; and the optimal pH to build collagen, and lighten sun spots.  I highly recommend this serum to anyone who wants to add a Vitamin C serum to their skincare regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 2 weeks and I already see positive changes.  My skin is looking brighter and healthier, some creases and lines seem to be less noticeable.  I also love the fact that it is packaged in a brown glass bottle (not plastic) which will prolong the potency of the Vitamin C.  While the launch price is in effect is a great time to try the product for yourself.</li>
            <li> I researched all Vit. C Serums Amazon carried.  I decided to try this one and I&#x27;m glad I did. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I have used a more expensive 20% Vitamin C Serum but I&#x27;ve found that my skin responds better to the OUI Serum.  Try it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the 3rd time now and just started using this product about 3 weeks ago and I am very impressed with the way it left my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I  have purchased more expensive  serum&#x27;s before this product and I will continue buying this product as long as it is on the markert&lt;br /&gt;Very  IMPRESSED and you will be too!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the OUI SERUM!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using 20% vitamin c serum for several years now although a different brand and much more expensive. I have always taken very good care of my skin. So far I notice no difference between the more expensive product and Oui, therefore, I am very pleased.  My skin still looks great. Oui feels good on my skin. So far so good and I have already recommended it to a friend who also takes great care of her skin.  Love the back-up received. Makes you feel the company are genuinely interested in your skin.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. My face is glowing and I think the serum is really working as it should be after only using it for one week. I don&#x27;t regret buying it :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks, but so far, am really enjoying it.  My skin seems brighter and is incredibly soft and smooth.  While I haven&#x27;t seen a whole lot of change in some of the darkness yet, I&#x27;m hoping with continued use my skin spots will begin to lighten.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I suffered of acne and little dark spots, in the beginning I use the serum after cleaning my face with neutrogena soap but my face felt very dry. I read the comments and changed my cleaning routine: now I use coconut oil and rose water and then the serum, I don&#x27;t feel my face dry anymore. I have use the serum for 2 weeks and my face looks lighter and smoother, this is a great product and love it. I can&#x27;t wait to use it more weeks to see if the lines around my mouth disappears. The product arrive before expected, it was a small envelope, great conditions and love the fact it fitted into my mail box. You receive emails with great tips and what to expect about the product.</li>
            <li> I ordered a second one of these just to keep in the fridge so I don&#x27;t run out. Very good product.</li>
            <li> Ok I got this one with the super C! Only three stars because I did not see any results yet! This one and the super C was $50 dollars so I hope it does something! That is a lot of money for something that won&#x27;t work! Reviews should be later on so we could tell you if it does work! So far nothing!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Skin was improved after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> What I really like about this serum is it leaves your skin feeling fresh and full of moisture.  It does not dry stiff or sticky absorbs quickly.  I can see a difference in the total appearance of my skin in the couple of weeks I have been using it.  The age spots are not as prominent, the fine lines look smoother and the over all appearance has a healthy glow.  You do have to avoid the eyes.  I will buy this product again and reccomend it to others.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I have only used it a couple of days and my pores and complexion have greatly improved. The seller contacted me because I had a concern and was very kind and helpful. This kind of service really is exceptional. I would highly recommend this product and will be back again to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love, love this product!  After using for a couple of weeks, my skin looks brighter, tiny lines not as pronounced. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after 6 months of use.</li>
            <li> I had pretty bad acne scars, large pores and blackheads on my face but after a month of using OUI Vit C serum my skin gotten so much clearer! Acne scars have faded, blackheads reduced (i believe it is because of the exfoliation) and you can see my skin shining. However it dries my skin a little so i have to use thicker moisturizer nowadays.</li>
            <li> I am 59 and have used many C&amp; E over the years. I love this product and give it a 5 star. I have sensitive skin so I use it at night with a B serum. Magic is all I can say.  The fine lines on my forehead, around my nose where you squint your nose has softened &amp; practically disappear. I have larger lines around my mouth and this product has plump some of those deeper lines.  No BS, my husband came up to me the other night and felt my face...Just out of the blu and said your face looks wonderful. Even my grown daughters noticed at Mothers day.. Now they are going to buy.  Advice you will need to shake as it says, the smell to me is a wonderful light citrus. It easily spreads. Just put a small drop and use you 4th finger to tap and smooth, then repeat other areas on your face. Enjoy!!! (Oh, do not forget if you exfoliate and then put OUI CE on it may sting a little but use a B or cream and it goes away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used several name brand that are expensive. This is by far a keeper!</li>
            <li> I started getting all these breakouts on my 55 year old face after I started using this as directed. I thought my skin would adjust to the new product so I used it for a few weeks. Some pimples got really bad and left dark spots. I still have a big one on my forehead that is taking a long time to heal. I&#x27;ve stopped using the product and I don&#x27;t see new ones developing. I guess it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  My skin feels smoother already after two weeks!  I&#x27;ll be using this  product for years to come!</li>
            <li> I wasted my money again on another beauty product. It leaves a sticky coating on my face, making my face feel dirty. I don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  The naturalness of the product and the ingredients in it, are just what I was looking for.  The HA in the product is a bonus and keeps your face moisturized without drying it out.  When I apply the product I can feel it tingling and getting down into the pores, where all the changes take place!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OUI skincare has thought of everything!</li>
            <li> Recently added this to my usual regimen and really glad I did, I can see improvement in two weeks, and thats great!! And I&#x60;m saving money because it works SO well that I don&#x60;t have to buy several of the products I bought BEFORE I found your wonderful serum!</li>
            <li> Gets the job done..great exfoliation ! Frequently get compliments on my completion !</li>
            <li> Excellent product....i would recommend it. Natural and I could feel its tingling effects upon using it. I will be ordering more of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over two weeks for scars on face due to acne. Truly I noticed a slight difference, I also noticed a few more breakouts..I&#x27;m using the product every other day, as directed but I may have to stop because of the breakouts. This is the second vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve tried, the other brand was a little more expensive but I didn&#x27;t experience these breakouts.. My skin may just be a little sensitive for this product..</li>
            <li> This is preliminary review comments from my wife after 3 days of use.  The product has met all her expectations so far. No allergic or other negative reactions to product.  Hopefully will be same after longer term use too.  Only recommendation to pass onto supplier is possibly either place shrink wrap around bottle cap or a sticker on box lid to show it is new unopened product.  It would alleviated my wife&#x27;s concern that the product may have been a return/used product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> i think my skin  does look a little better even though it has not been a very long time.  i am looking forward to continuing using it every day and see what happens.  i think my face looks plumper, more luminous.healthy</li>
            <li> This serum is a winner.  My skin loves these three ingredients: E, C and HA.  The price was right for such a power-packed serum.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to have one serum for all three.</li>
            <li> I am 32 and have only recently taken a vested interest in doing any form of facial care. Mostly because I didn&#x27;t need to before now. But the last year or two I have noticed increased sunspots and a general unevenness in my skin. I tried another product, a cream, designed for sunspots and used it faithfully, twice a day for about 3 months. I noticed almost no change at all. I found this product and loved the introduction price, and said I&#x27;d give it a try. After less than a week of staying faithful to using this every am, I noticed a significant difference in my skin. The largest brown spot I have has lightened about half and all of my face seems to have a healthy glow (I&#x27;ve been using it about 10 days now). As another reviewer mentioned, I&#x27;m needing less facial foundation, or I don&#x27;t even use it. It&#x27;s easy to put on, I use very little each day (think 1/4 tsp) and I like it&#x27;s odor, a little orange-y, although that goes away in about 10 minutes. I bought a second bottle at this great price, because it is working so well!</li>
            <li> A friend sent me what she claimed was the \\&quot;latest, most advanced, vitamin C 20% serum. Absolutely the best...\\&quot;  I had already tried another Vitamin C 20% serum and didn&#x27;t like its oily silicone viscosity , nor its smell.  Still skeptical,  I thought I&#x27;d give it another shot.  Women of a certain age (senior +) like me are always game to try something new.  OUI  Skincare&#x27;s  Vitamin C 20% serum came nicely packaged in a gorgeous box and an air-tight  very opaque bottle.  It even has a pleasant light citrus smell.  And the water-like consistency does not feel oily...I have used it for the past two weeks following the instructions to the letter.  While two weeks is much too soon for dramatic results, I can report the following:  I use it once a day in the morning (after waking up my face with a creamy lotion).  Applied sparingly and let dry, it works synergistically  with my favorite moisturizer to make my skin feel tighter, yet  more supple and softer to the touch.  I look in the mirror and my complexion seems clearer and more even-toned!  It gives my spirits a lift, and I feel  like I AM glowing.  My friend was right. OUI Skincare Vitamin C 20%  serum is great and I am already ordering my next bottle.  And at this price $29.95 it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I am an almost 70 year old woman.  I have been  using Coui vitamin C super serum and the regular  C serum for&lt;br /&gt;a few months.  My skin tone has improved noticeably and I am pleased with my results.  I will continue to&lt;br /&gt;use these serums a part of my  skin-care routine.  Thank you for making a product that works.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a favorable improvement in the fine lines around my eyes since using this product.  I use the serum once a day, along with the Super C serum (though I use the Super C serum twice a day).  My skin tone appears brighter as well overall.  I am totally happy with this product.</li>
            <li> very happy with this product. i been using it for a few months. works just as fab as the skinceutical brand.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is having to get it out of the refrigerator when I want to use it.</li>
            <li> My skin has more clarity and is smoother.  I have been using this about 3 weeks and I saw results within a week.  I usually use it at night before my other products.  It is not irritating or drying, nor does it have an oily feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using OUI&#x27;s vitamin C serum for two weeks now and my boyfriend has already remarked at how smooth and supple my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with how quickly I received my product and the quality of the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to others. I&#x27;m excited to see how awesome my skin is going to look after long-term use.</li>
            <li> The product arrived earlier than expected. The package looks nice, and there is great customer service. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 10 days now, and I noticed a little glow. My skin feels firmer but there are not a lot of changes yet. I hope that my skin spots fade. I give it 4 stars for now but I will post another review when I notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li> So, I have bought this a few times. At first I thought I liked it a lot. But the last two bottles I&#x27;ve received haven&#x27;t seemed to be as good of a product as before. Idk....just seems different.</li>
            <li> Noticed one of the manufacturer&#x27;s response implied there was no need to include paraben..  since they made the product fresh with a recommended shelf-life of 6 months.  In fact, the product contains a paraben-substitute (phenoxethanol) that is a preservative and a known toxin, &amp;#34;...even in moderate amounts.&amp;#34;  Some tout the substance as being derived from grapefruit, and while it is naturally found in green tea, it is made in the lab for cosmetics [derived from benzene (known carcinogen) then treated with ethylene oxide (carcinogen)].  Phenoxethanol is banned In Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be a savvy consumer and google ingredients..  especially when it comes to beauty products which are not regulated..  Manufacturers know consumers are aware of phalates/parabens/SLS and are shifting to substitutes that are often toxic but less &#x27;recognizable&#x27; by consumers, like phenoxethanol.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the thickness of the product, as I am accustomed to very liquidy competitors.  It is pleasant on the skin and has a very rapid brightening effect.  The vitamin C is actually L-ascorbic acid (the effective kind)  according to your site, and that is what compelled me to order &amp;#34;Oui&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I rated this five stars because the product has ingredients known to work and the product is fresh.  It is very easy to use and.......best of all.....the results I am seeing in my skin in a short period of time (yes, two days) are truly amazing.  My skin is softer, more toned, more even toned, less plagued with stubborn wrinkles and looks at least ten years younger.  I am not exaggerating.  I depend on product reviews when I am shopping and I will only state a review which is thoroughly true and authentic.  Finally I have had no adverse effects from this product.  Thank you!  Please don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
            <li> The first week I got this it was ok, but the second week I started using it to much. It got itchy on me, so be careful not to over use this because a little goes along way. I&#x27;m on a break from it but will go back soon. It does make a difference on fine lines especially around chin area.</li>
            <li> Smells great, absorbs quickly, skin looks Dewey,radiant,more even toned and,I loved the price. A little goes a long way. husband even uses it!</li>
            <li> Adding this product to my facial regime was a great choice. I have been using other Vitamin C products but they do not the added ingredients this one has. I believe this product has helped to improve my skin above &amp; beyond the other products I&#x27;m using. I would recommend giving it a try. I have not experienced any sensitivity issues but please note I do not have sensitive skin. I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and spent most of my years in the sun &amp; this product has truly helped in improving the overall look of my skin.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely be getting this product again!!! I love it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;It has helped my fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> I like the vitamin C serum so much. I have already noticed a reduction&lt;br /&gt;in pore size and glow to my skin. My 27 year old daughter tried and&lt;br /&gt;liked it too. It is a great product and the price is great. Definitely be&lt;br /&gt;reordering.</li>
            <li> The serum feels great on the skin, not the least bit oily, absorbs quickly.  Let it work for a few minutes before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Works great! More even skin tone and less fine lines for sure. I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;S and a sephora/ultra product whore!! This stuff is truly a quality product and well worth the small amount of money compared to other things I have tried. I alternate it with their super c serum which is also amazing!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, Love it! It evens out skin tone and brightens face. Had bought other product with vitamin C and it felt sticky hours after putting it on so do your homework.look at the reviews.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I noticed a significant difference within the first week. I will continue to order in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is on the liquid side and absorbs very well into my skin. Smells fresh like citrus/orange, the scents fades away quickly. Skin feels great after application. so far so good.</li>
            <li> Quality product.  Will continue to purchase.  I have noticed visible results after just a few uses..  My pores are smaller, skin is brighter and tone improved.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing - REAL Vitamin C Serum and at a reasonable price.  I will continue to purchase this one as a stable</li>
            <li> I had not tried a Vitamin C serum before so I bought two. This is the second product I opened. The first product I used had a light, fresh orange scent. This product smells like someone used orange juice concentrate to put out a burning tire. (And no, it&#x27;s not expired.)</li>
            <li> I have been using for about a month on my face and hands and can definitely see a difference in the appearance of my skin.  It looks much smoother and the fine lines have diminished!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not fond of this serum.  It smells...  it&#x27;s very watery, so I need to put about a ten drops into my curled palm and try to put it onto my face, then smell it all night.  After two weeks of use, I didn&#x27;t notice any changes so I stopped using it.  It&#x27;s just worth the hassle to me.</li>
            <li> I had purchased the Perricone MD Vitamin C Serum cream (in a tube) on a whim, and was impressed with it after a short time, but the price was so high (per unit volume) that I shopped for some potential lower priced alternatives.  Also, the Perricone cream has some ingredients I&#x27;d rather not use if there are alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 4 products to try; this was one of them.  The product arrived quickly and in mint condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I selected this product on the 5 star reviews, but after a week, I wasnt getting results like the Perricone cream.  Maybe it just works differently; this seems to be a sit on top of your skin, where the Perricone absorbs very quickly.  This might be better as a top layer exfoliant; for this, I believe it would work.  I saw the reviews that claim you need to be using this for a few months to see results, I&#x27;ve only been using for a short time so you are welcome to your own conclusions.  For this reason, I&#x27;m won&#x27;t give it a one star review, and I&#x27;ll keep using the bottle since I already have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewing the reviews to compare to buyers results, I notice now that the reviews are (at least) aggressively managed by the vendor, and makes me wonder if some of the submitted reviews are less than genuine.  I have no evidence that any of the reviews are fake.  You can read the reviews and make your own decision.  I dont want to call out specifics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, the ingredients shown in the listing are only a partial listing of the actual ingredients.  This is a bit misleading/dishonest by the vendor.  The ingedients omitted from the listing are ones that might cause you to not buy the product.  Kudos to the manufacturer for listing all actual ingredients used (maybe the law requires this).  Listing all ingredients in the Amazon listing might reduce negative reviews from buyers who can&#x27;t use some ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VENDOR: will you make changes to the listing to list all ingredients?  Recommend you make the change,and not just post that you&#x27;ve requested Amazon to make a change.</li>
            <li> I think is a good product, I can see good results next day when I wake up, my face looks like a baby face but amazon sent me an expired product, by the time I got it home it was about to expire.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product daily now for over 2 months. I use it in the morning prior to my moisturizer. My skin has shown definite improvement since starting this routine. It appears clearer overall, and much less blotchy. I have used other Vitamin C products purchased from my dermatologist, for much more money, and this product has shown the best results on my skin! I also love how it smells and it goes on beautifully, soaking into my skin almost immediately. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months now and have noticed a little change, I do like the smell which is citrusy and the liquid is a little foggy, so I&#x27;m not sure if it comes that way.  It&#x27;s a little watery and tingles when applied on skin.  I assumed that serum is suppose to be thicker than received, so I&#x27;ll finish this bottle and try another brand, hopefully Ill get better results.</li>
            <li> So far, I am quite satisfied with these product. I have only been using it for a couple weeks, but so far has been&lt;br /&gt;the best one. I have sensitive skin, so I only use it once a day, in the morning. I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation, just a slight tingling and then I follow with a good moisturizer with sunscreen. I like the color and the smell, the other ones were like water. I like the packaging too, specially the dark bottle and good service too.&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder and would recommend to a friend, just keep the price reasonable.</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical of products making a lot of claims. But Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid were ingredients in an expensive cream i read about so I thought I would just buy the main ingredients and give it a try. My skin is smoother and my crow&#x27;s feet are much less. i wear it under moisturizer and sunscreen daily. Great product at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier, already seeing improvements in my skin. Only been using it for a couple of weeks. Great product.     Update on product 7 months later: Well it&#x27;s been a little over 7 months since I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently, and all I can say, it&#x27;s been one of the best products that I have ever used so far. Being and working out in the sun, and cold everyday, my skin goes through a lot of abuse. Being over 50 yrs old doesn&#x27;t help the matter too, especially with age spots, fine lines, dryness and wrinkles. But what I&#x27;ve notice so far, is that my skin texture, dryness and age spots are dramatically and continually diminishing. Granted I&#x27;m not saying it happened overnight, but what I can tell you is that if you use this product and the super c serum consistently, you will not be disappointed, and I&#x27;ve used other products 3x the cost of theirs, and these two products combined, blow the other products that I have used out of the water. In other words very, very, happy with the results I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and firmer after using the product for a month. I was using another Vitamin C product that costs three times as much. After one purchases the product, you will receive an email with instructions on how to use. They also offered an excellent discount on my next purchase.</li>
            <li> I only used this produce 2-3 times.  Each time I used it I broke out in a bad rash/hives.  I have used other Vitamin C Serums with Hyaluronic Acid and have not broken out ---I dont think it is a bad product but need to find one that works for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product long enough to be able to say I believe it makes a nice difference in my skin.  I did not expect miracles and it did not get rid of 65 years of abuse, but I notice a glow and new softness to my skin.  I will continue to use it.  It also reduced age spots.  I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I have used QUI Vitamin C Serum for two weeks and am stunned that two large brown spots on the side of my face are gone! Vanished!!! The wrinkles around my eyes are visibly diminished. I keep it in the refrigerator and use on a clean skin. After I apply it I wait a few minutes and then I use Johoba oil or Coconut oil as my moisturizer. Then I apply cream makeup. I am extremely happy with the results and must tell you, this is painless and I look years younger. As a former model (retired) I have always been tenacious about taking care of my skin and have had a lot of different products over the year. I enthusiastically say, this is the best product I&#x27;ve used. No face lift for me! Don&#x27;t need it because I have this product.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product. So far I like it. Will post more after a few weeks of using this. Looking forward to future products from this line of cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Have been using QUI for only about 2 weeks and it does seem to be performing as promised too.  My skin feels and looks  better, which is saying a lot because I DO have those  &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; and wrinkles.  I am definitely SEEING some improvement, but my skin FEELS better. Will try to review again with hopefully even more improvements as time goes by.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you QUI !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this serum for about a month.  I am 71 years old and have good skin, almost no wrinkles, but I had acne in high school in small patches on my chin and forehead.  This serum has made the scars less visible and less red.  In fact, I often receive compliments for my younger-than-my-age skin now.  Yes, OUI works as promised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative is that the serum feels somewhat sticky as it dries.</li>
            <li> It really promotes an even skin tone, and controls brown spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking to give my skin care regimen a boost and had been reading about Vitamin C serum for some time.  When I saw this come up on my Amazon search I had to give it a try.  And I&#x27;m so glad I did!  I use it most nights before bed as the base under my night time moisturizer.  And I&#x27;ve also started using it on the more delicate chest area.  I loved it so much I immediately bought a second bottle!  Lots of products come and go in my routine - but this one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I have been using this amazing product for four weeks now and am a believer.  I am in my late 40&#x27;s and my skin has some sun damage, fine lines and dark spots.  For years, I have tried many &amp;#34;dermatologist only&amp;#34; products and serums and have had very few results - OUI is outstanding!!  Not only has it dramatically decreased the dark spots and fine lines but it has gone down and repaired my skin.  It has lifted and removed old scarring and imperfections with no reddening or peeling (and I have very sensitive skin).  I have even tried it on my crocodile hands and they are so soft and smooth now.  I have purchased thousands of products on Amazon and this is the first review I have written -- this serum is that good! I will be buying more for myself, my daughters, sisters and friends. THANK YOU!!!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for over 2 months to see how it worked for me. Well it doesn&#x27;t. It is way to sticky tacky what ever you want to call it.  No matter how much or how little I put on it gave me the same sticky feeling even as late as 30 minutes later. When I put on my moistureizer  it to had a slight tacky feel to it. I also saw no difference in my face . I realize everything is not for ever one. This one is just not for me. I know I can&#x27;t return it now but I wanted to give it a fair shot.</li>
            <li> I did see some of sun spots fading after a month, but they are not completely gone yet. I did recommend some of my friends to use it as I do see some improvement overall.</li>
            <li> This product is in my athletic bag. Haven&#x27;t used it all that much compared to Obaji, but I like the price point and that the folks distributing it were concerned with my satisfaction. Who knows...it may replace my Obaji in the future.</li>
            <li> I am in my 60’s and have been using OUI Vitamin C serum for 3 months and must say I am very pleased with the results, I love being outside and because of this have brown spots on my face, this serum is amazing, the spots are fading with most gone altogether, I can see improvement in my skin tone and texture, the lines around my eyes and mouth are noticeably softer, my skin appearance is healthier and I am using a lot less makeup.  I love this serum.</li>
            <li> Oui was the second Vitamin C Serum I tried and I didn&#x27;t need to look any further, I found a product I liked and addressed my issues.  I needed something to help with aging skin, particularly sagging skin, some plumping here and there to make my face seem fuller which I think makes people look younger and something to help smooth over facial lines and wrinkles.  I have been using Oui for 2 months and I see improvement.  My skin does look smoother and I have a lot more color in my face.  I would like to continue using Oui to keep that smooth look and I am curious to see what results I might have if I keep using this in my daily skin care.  This product is currently unavailable and I am &#x27;not so patiently&#x27; waiting for my Oui Vitamin c serum  20% to be delivered</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. I have already seen some tightening to my skin. Product is easy to use and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Into weeks I already see results on my face and it feels so great for the price this is a great product</li>
            <li> This is a revised review to the second paragraph which is a previous review. I love this product so much and recommend it!! I am a beauty connoisseur. I live for great products and I have been using this for 3 weeks and see a significant change in my skin. I did have a problem with my second order but seller was able to compensate and make sure I am happy within a day. Thank you Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the product... This product has made a significant difference in the clarity, feel and over all look to my skin.. But I just ordered for a second time and only got half the contents of the bottle because the product leaked! Also the product came in 2 days late! Sufficient packaging should be used. For 20$ i expected to recieve a full intact bottle of this wonderful stuff. I am very disappointed.. :(</li>
            <li> I have only been using for 2 weeks but am seeing improvement in skin firmness and clarity.  Age spots may be fading but it is a little to soon to tell.  I was looking for a good Vitamin C Serum at a fair price and this is it.  Great customer service too.</li>
            <li> I did not immediately start using product when I received it as I wanted to finish other products I had first.  Going on three weeks now, I really think I am seeing a difference.  I am a &amp;#34;senior citizen&amp;#34; with age spots and many wrinkles around mouth.  I hope to continue improvement.  I am please with the service and recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great Vit C serum, it appears to help faden dark spots and make complexion more all over bright and even skin tone.  I will purchase this product again.  What attracted me to this product was it seemed to have everything you need in a Vit C serum, plus the cost made it an even better buy.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I got this Vitamin C serum as part of the OUI skincare validation process. I was asked to try this out and give my feedback.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest a bit of a skeptic when it comes to anti-aging products, however I was pleasantly surprised after only two weeks of using this product I started to see a noticeable  difference in my skin tone.  It was definitely brighter and my skin felt firmer.&lt;br /&gt;To be extra sure  about the feedback I continued to use it for another two weeks before commenting. Now I can give an honest feedback. My skin feels amazing. Even the fine lines are starting to fade. I really feel like my skin is getting rejuvenated. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Firstly I really loved the fact that this serum came in a box.&lt;br /&gt;Nice touch. I got this as a gift. I normally put this serum on at night as that is when I have the time to indulge myself.&lt;br /&gt;I then follow it up with my night time moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for three weeks I have started to see a difference in the clarity of my skin and in the size of my pores.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is really looking healthier. Because I am only 32 I don’t really have wrinkles (sorry :)),&lt;br /&gt;so I can&#x27;t comment on this serum’s effect on wrinkles but my skin feels much fresher and its shallow appearance has improved considerably.&lt;br /&gt;Can’t wait to see what my skin will look like in another two months.</li>
            <li> This product has helped make my face feel fresh and firm -not tight.  The biggest difference I&#x27;ve noticed was when I put my makeup on my fine lines/ dark spots are gone.  I just had a facial yesterday and was told to keep using the serum because vitamin C is excellent for the skin- and this product is pure</li>
            <li> I use the serum every night on a clean face and wait 10 to 15 minutes for it to penetrate. After about 2 weeks I noticed significant improvement in my skin tone and condition, my old acne spots started to face and my skin tone become brighter too! Obviously the acne marks are not completely faded but there was an improvement and since other than the serum I have not changed anything else in my skin care routine, I know it was because of the consistent use. I will definitely continue using it.</li>
            <li> Works like it says it will.  I&#x27;d definately buy again!</li>
            <li> Most effective toner I have ever used..a noticeable improvement in fine line as well...skin elasticity  better as well</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product. The shipping was very quick. The packaging is excellent. And unlike many products the instructions are detailed. I have faith that the product is fresh and it is what it is supposed to be.  I have no sensitivity to this product. I am even able to use it twice a day. My skin is looking fresh and healthy.  I will continue buying this brand.</li>
            <li> I liked the product and reordered it, but the second bottle arrived with a defective seal and the product had leaked. I am keeping it and hoping it hasn&#x27;t been compromised because the product is &amp;#34; currently unavailable&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This works miracles. I have tried numerous creams and dark spot correctors and this is the only one that works. I started to notice a change within the first 3-4 days but after 3 weeks the results were drastic. My mother bought some when she saw how well it worked for me. I have had numerous comments on my skin since using this product.</li>
            <li> Good so far. Fast shipping. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Oh My God! This serum rocks! I apply it before going to sleep everyday. My skin feels immensely soft in the morning. I can see it is growing healthier day by day. It is helping me in reducing the acne as well. Even though the bottle is small, it will last me a long time because you need just a few drops to apply it all over the face and neck. Sending it to my sister as a gift as well! This is certainly worth giving as a gift to your mom/sister/friend/anyone!</li>
            <li> I just received this product so I do not know the long term benefits, but it feels great on my skin and I am hoping it will be as effective as others have found it to be.</li>
            <li> Love this vitamin C serum.  I have used Peter Thomas Roth in the past but the results are as good if not better at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have always loved make up and  find it amazing magic even  how concealer and foundation and make my face appear bright and perfect. But eventually, the layers of cosmetics takes its toll and I often have break outs and I think my uneven skin tone has a lot to do with the truckload of makeup I tend to put on my face. At 27, I simply want my skin to breathe, to be free from makeup and still look great. When I heard on Dr. Oz show how Vitamin C serum can be good for the skin, I was really dying to try it myself. Of course I was very enthusiastic when I was asked to review OUI skincare’s Vitamin C serum 20% as part of their validation process . Here’s what I have to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging&lt;br /&gt;OUI  Vitamin C Serum comes with a neat packaging. It also comes with a nice dropper to make sure that the product is used properly and helps prevent over pouring or spilling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon use&lt;br /&gt;When I apply it directly to my face, it feels great. It does not dry my skin. I don’t feel any sting or irritation when I use it. It’s like, it feels right to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three weeks of usage&lt;br /&gt;My mom (who often talks about my weight) has finally said something encouraging. After a month she notices that there is something new about me, a ‘certain glow’. Well, it is literally a certain glow because my face has become brighter. My face has become clearer and there is certain radiance to it. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;If you want younger skin that beams then try this !</li>
            <li> This is my second time trying to Vitamin C/E Serum. The first one I purchased was priced at ~$25. I quit using it after third use because it created massive break out with a lot of stinging sensation. Also, the liquid was not very dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, this serum from OUI feels very rich without much stinging. The seller responds very quickly to the questions and always asks for feedback. It also has a 30 day guarantee in case you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s working. So far, I used it for three days, so I can&#x27;t verify if it&#x27;s doing any good to my skin, which is why I am giving a 4 star instead of 5 star. I will update the review once I reach a month.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product. I used it after i derma-rolled my face. It stings bad but the sensation goes away. The following morning i noticed my face was brighter and soft. Also the active acne and pimples have subsided a little. I gave it 4 stars for now, but I&#x27;ll re-review it when i notice a  huge difference later. I would recommend it as a normal face serum (not only for after dema-rolling sessions) for daily use.</li>
            <li> This product feels wonderful on My skin I will continue to use it regularly</li>
            <li> A summer of Mediterranean sun and airplane travel had wreaked havoc on my skin, so I wanted something to help repair it a little. My pores were huge and I was getting blackheads like I haven&#x27;t since I was a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;The serum is very thin and cloudy, and dries a little sticky. It has a faint sweet smell, not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it when i arrived back in the USA and had it delivered to me as itravelled. Applied it under my lotion for about 3 weeks. I my skin was glowing by the end of it. Seriously, my pores shrunk so much, fine lines under my eyes fading, and one wrinkle that had been starting on my forehead (my first yay aging) has gotten so faint again. Don&#x27;t be put off by the sticky dry down.&lt;br /&gt;Bad news is I left it behind somewhere on my way home :( :( :(  now trying to psych myself up to buy it again. Feel like I dropped $20 for a tsp of product arggh.</li>
            <li> Excellent service, fast shipping. I was paying $75 for a &amp;#34;big name&amp;#34; serum and this performs so much better, keeps your skin fresh and youthful. Lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> I am 29yrs old. My skin face is mainly dry. Have fine line around my eyes nothing huge but if you look hard enough you can see it. Bought a moisturizer and this product plus vitamins. It&#x27;s been I think two wks and I do do something. My face looks healthier, doesn&#x27;t get very dry or itchy which is great. I put this on at night before sleep like half an hour before. I will buy it i&#x27;m the future again. I put it i&#x27;m the fridge so it feels good once I apply it. I gave it a 5 because I do see a difference. I&#x27;m happy. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Wife uses this product and is loving her skin. Plumps up skin, diminishes lines. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Retin A along with vitamin C are the gold standards in skin care. I am using this serum daily and I will always use it along with my Retin A. I tanned in my younger, more ignorant days, and now my goal is to undo the damage I caused back then. This serum is a part of that repair process. My dermatologist recommends a much more expensive version, but when I saw this deal on Amazon, I bought it instead. I keep it in the refrigerator as recommended and I am loving the results.</li>
            <li> Great product...you can feel the effect as soon as you put it on</li>
            <li> On 2nd bottle of the serum.  I use it every morning.  Seems to be gradually helping with dark spots, lines, and discoloration.</li>
            <li> OMG...This product was so sticky and it stunk..I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin</li>
            <li> So  far so good.  At less no bad reaction</li>
            <li> I found it sticky and stinky.  Did not work well for my sensitive skin.  I gave it three stars as the seller really stands behind their product.  Offered me a refund and a discount to try a newer product.  They were so gracious I think I might just try it!</li>
            <li> Ohui&#x27;s products are great. Even though I only tried this item twice and it&#x27;s too short to see the result, but I trust OHui!</li>
            <li> Best product on the market. Everyone comments on how good my face looks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome, it works!</li>
            <li> Love this serum !  Feels good on your skin and refines its texture. Absorbs quickly and makes your skin glow.  Reasonslbly priced too! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Great product. Will definitely continue using.</li>
            <li> I really like this Vitamin C Serum - have tried different brands, but this one is a little different - it is thicker and goes on so smoothly.  I am just not sure why it is labeled as an exfoliant.  I did not think that is what Vitamin C Serum was supposed to do - I have other products that I use for that purpose.  It is also helpful to get tips occasionally by email on how to use the product.  Will be buying again, but this bottle goes a long way and I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> Not giving my age, but believe I look at least 10 years younger.  Face feels fuller and younger-looking.  I am 44 again!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this serum, I will definitely keep using it. It is a little sticky if you use too much.</li>
            <li> my skin is glowing and lines look less obvious, I&#x27;ve had a lot of compliments on my skin. I&#x27;m 43 and I&#x27;ve used some very expensive products and they sometimes work well but the price is so high, I&#x27;m sure this will become a very popular product</li>
            <li> The customer service from this product is amazing.  They follow-up and give you an idea of what to expect and skin tips.  Great product most importantly!!  Highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product now for two weeks. I&#x27;m not using it daily but about every other day, and I&#x27;ve already seen improvements to my skin. The color tone is a lot more balanced. My face feels fresh. Not a huge difference on acne scars (well, at least not yet) but my laugh lines are looking much smoother. I keep this in the refrigerator to keep it fresh. I&#x27;ve read that the serum has an expiration date and Vitamin C, keeping in the fridge extends the potency and life of the serum.</li>
            <li> I finally found a serum that does what it claims. After a few days, I noticed my skin had plumped up and fine lines were reduced. My skin has a healthy glow and feels firmer. I won&#x27;t be without this product. I just ordered three bottles!</li>
            <li> After only 3 days I am seeing good results!  My co-workers think I am using new make-up that &amp;#34;looks great&amp;#34; and my husband commented that I looked 16!  (Probably not quite, but I&#x27;ll take it). Customer service is beyond good!  I WILL be purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the other person who said it was sticky.  If you use very little of it that helps but it just doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as I like, so for that reason I&#x27;m only using it at night and I&#x27;m using another Vitamin C during the day under make-up.  I still like this brand and I feel like it benefits my skin, but again if I&#x27;m not careful about how much of it I apply at one time it does remain sticky for quite a while.  I&#x27;m happy with it as a night-time treatment and when I wake up my skin feels &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; ... just not so much under make-up.  However, with that said everyone&#x27;s skin is different and I would recommend this brand because for someone else it might absorb better than it does for me.  Obviously many users are very pleased with it, and I am also - but only at night.</li>
            <li> Update 1/4: I ran out and stopped using the C Serum. my face started to get a few white heads esp. upon waking up. ive reordered and using this product again. Face is back to clear and feels great..    bought a few products from COUI and could not be happier. After a few months, my face does not look &amp;#34;drawn&amp;#34; or tired. My skin has plumped and evened out. The customer service is outstanding also.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it was supposed to do, but I did not notice any changes in my skin.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is my second order! Waiting for my friends to ask what I&#x27;ve been using!</li>
            <li> I ordered about a month ago and used it every night.  My skin seems smoother and softer, but don&#x27;t see any tremendous change yet in lines.  I know it takes time and I&#x27;m anxious to see what it will do in the next month or so. I only tried I bottle of another brand before so I can&#x27;t compare it.</li>
            <li> My family has a long history of acne. And it wasn&#x27;t uncommon for me to get one or two MONSTER pimples. This was so embarrassing and affected my performance as a real estate professionals. I started using the Oui Vit C Serum about 8 months ago, and my life will NEVER BE THE SAME. I haven&#x27;t had one pimple surface. If they begin to, I just continue to use the serum each night for a few nights, and the pimple dissolves. Amazing, remarkable, miracle stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this product in the evening, and the Super C in the morning.  I&#x27;ve been using them for 3 months now, and can really see the difference.  Great Products!  Over the past few years, I have used many different products, but none have given nearly the results as the COUI serums.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and when I applied this serum it tingled a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I guess that means that it really works. Also my skin feels a bit tight immediately after I apply the serum.&lt;br /&gt;This however goes away after a few minutes and after I apply my night cream my skin feels juicier.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a few weeks and already my skin feels more elastic and it looks clearer too.&lt;br /&gt;I even think that my sunspots are becoming lighter .&lt;br /&gt;I am now applying it generously on my neck and am looking forward to the results. Will keep you updated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne</li>
            <li> I have been a proud fan and user of the Ole Henrikson Vitamin C serum for about a year now but at  $30 for only a tiny bottle of 0.5oz it eventually seems to take out a huge chunk from my beauty budget. I was offered OUI as part of their validation process in order to give some feedback and thought it worth a try, given that it was half the price of the Ole Henrikson. I’m glad I did, because surprisingly it had the same amazing results that I got from Ole Henrikson. The bonus of the OUI skincare Vitamin C serum is that it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin when I applied it in fact my skin not only looks radiant but it also feels more moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived in a box and the bottle was sealed with some type of plastic wrap . It all looked very aesthetic and clean and most importantly tamper free. I like how the bottle comes with a little dropper that I can use to apply the product to my fingertips without too much of a mess. The other serum I used had a pump and I found that it was always squirting beyond my fingertips .I also never really managed to finish all the bottle properly with a pump .With a dropper it is of course not even an issue.</li>
            <li> Good price for vitamin c serum.  It comes out very watery and a cloudy almost transparent color.  This is the third brand I have tried.  My dark spots are fading after using vitamin c almost every day for 9 months. Be careful not to let it touch any open wounds though.</li>
            <li> I have used this off and on for some time and I think it has made my skin brighter.  I love the price compared with other comparable products and will continue to repurchase.  It did irritate my skin a little at first, but switching to every other day and building up helped.  I feel like I can see texture improvements. I use this before bed, as it can make my makeup look a little strange.</li>
            <li> I can feel a difference on my face and hands with this serum. This is what it has done for me thus far (I&#x27;ve used it for one month); I significantly get less black heads and pimples on my face (I mean a BIG difference). I have seen visible results on the sun spots on my face and hands (especially on my hands). My face feels significantly more hydrated. Before, my face would feel dry most of the day, even with moisturizer ( I have dry skin). This serum makes my face feel like it is retaining moisture and I have much less need to be applying moisturizing cream throughout the day. I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles yet so I can&#x27;t vouch for it making lines vanish, however, because my face is more hydrated, the few wrinkles I do have don&#x27;t crease as much because of the hydration, so it does give a diminished look to them... Overall, REALLY REALLY good vitamin C serum in my opinion. I tasted it and it tastes natural with no funny &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; aftertaste (as opposed to another one I bought some time ago). I just ordered my second bottle and can easily see this product becoming my staple (as long as the price remains a good bargain like it has been thus far). Thanks OUI... I also like your name and the packaging. I have already recommended you to my sister and to my mother. Overall, my skin tone is better, almost no more pimples and blackheads and my skin is definitely better hydrated...  in my book this is HUGE.</li>
            <li> I have using this product for a few weeks and can already see a difference in my age/sun spots!  My skin feels and looks great and was told, for the first time in years, that my skin looked like it was glowing! I definitely recommend this product to everyone who wants to give their skin a swift kick in the A$$!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Smells clean and fresh and has helped greatly with my skin texture.  Excellent exfoliating properties.  Quite pleased with this find!</li>
            <li> I was asked to review this serum as part of the OUI skincare validation process. So what are the differences that I do see after such a short time?&lt;br /&gt;The fine lines on my forehead and cheeks are getting noticeably fainter and my skin is feeling smoother and somehow also plumper. Can’t quite explain the feeling but it is something that occurs inside the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I started feeling this about a week after using this serum. I will definitely continue to use this product because if this is the effect that I see and feel after 2 weeks then I can’t wait to see what it will be like after 6 months.</li>
            <li> Love this serum!  For a great price, it delivers as promised.  My skin looks better than it has in quite some time &amp; I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year. I have mature dry skin and I was delighted to find that it also replaces all the moisturizers I used to use on my skin. I like the way it feels . I did try another C serum but it wasn&#x27;t nearly as good. Just started on the Super Serum to use along with the original.</li>
            <li> I feel a difference the next morning...not gooey. I love this product, I&#x27;m 61 but people constantly tell me they think im in my 40&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Love the way this makes my skin feel, and a little goes a long way!  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Not oily and sticky, firms skin, evens skin tone. Keeps me fresh!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find a better Vitamin C serum for any price- and I have tried serums that are 2, 3, or 10 times the price.  This serum actually does contain a true 20% Vitamin C concentration, which many others do not have.  I did feel a tingle when I first tried but that went away fairly quickly.  You will notice a difference the next day after using it.  Softer, smoother facial skin, and sometimes a little &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; from the reaction to the hyaluronic acid.  This serum is in the sweet spot-- it doesn&#x27;t skimp on ingredients, but it doesn&#x27;t overprice them with for the sake of a fancy bottle or brand.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> So far the serum is working well.  My skin is softer. This serum lightly exfoliates also.  Time will tell if it also provides the other benefits!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with OUI&#x27;s vitamin C serum, and I intend to order it again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference and I keep the product in my refrigerator.</li>
            <li> i used to use skinceuticals C serum , oui looks, smells, feels the same and no where near the price.&lt;br /&gt;i can already see a difference in my skin .&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll absolutely get it again</li>
            <li> I really can see the different in my skin and I have only been using it for 3 weeks.  I must say with other things I have gotten for my face have not worked the way this has. I will buy this again, Just love it.</li>
            <li> This product has all the ingredients I was looking for in a Vitamin C serum. I have tried other serums and had mixed results. One had a very chemical smell and stained my palm yellow, some didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference at all. So far, and it&#x27;s been two weeks, I really like this product. I feel a slight tingling when I apply in to my freshly washed face, let it soak in for 5 minutes as directed, then follow it up with my daily moisture/ sunscreen combo.It took about a week to notice, but I will say that the skin on my face and neck look and feel smoother! I will definitely stop looking around for the perfect serum- I think I&#x27;ve found it! The only reason I did not give this product five stars is because it has an odd smell. Otherwise, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I use it twice daily. I use it on my entire face and neck.  It dries quickly and I then apply the rest of my serums/moisturizers. It did take a few weeks for me to see a noticeable difference.  I do keep this serum in the refrigerator.  So, after a few months of use I can say I keep getting younger :)  Yea...lines diminished, dark spots disappear, and my skin looks much more youthful!  Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I tried this out until it ran out.  I was hoping for more results but I did not notice any signicant or even nearly significant changes. It did moisturize very well and I am sure it could be used to boost a regular moisturizer in the dry winter season.  Overall the product was okay but I was kind of hoping for some improvement to sun damage and fine lines.  I did finally get results after I went to the dermatologist and got prescrinption retinols and a product line to use in conjunction with it. I think seeing the doctor may be the only way to get you onto a path where you can get results.</li>
            <li> This product made me break out.  Within 2-3 days of use, I started getting small whiteheads.  I stopped it, the breakouts stopped.  I tried it again, the breakouts started.  Having said that, I did feel like the product worked well.  I just can&#x27;t use it for my skin type.  Others may be able to.</li>
            <li> I noticed a change in my skin within a week, great product</li>
            <li> Excellent Product. My dark spots are already fading after only a few days. Very interested in trying the other products on next order- especially the Super-C serum. A review by a doctor convinced me to try this as I am a nurse massage therapist and I am really happy that I have such great results!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd bottle of this serum, that&#x27;s all. But on the serious note, I do like the way this serum make my skin feel. It absorbed quickly and readily into the skin making my skin feel really hydrated. Still not sure about decreasing wrinkles and or helping with even out skin tone because I am using other products as well. After all that I would highly recommend this serum to a friend.</li>
            <li> I like this product, however, I have acne prone skin and have found that I can&#x27;t even use it every other day because it seems to cause bumps on my skin... However, I&#x27;m 30 years old and when I went into the liquor store the other day and the cashier asked for my ID when he saw how old I was his eyes bugged out and he told me that I looked like I was right out of high school. So maybe it&#x27;s working better than I think.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle and love this product. I live in a dry climate and using this every morning gently exfoliates my skin enough so that I have basically eliminated blemishes! My skin has overall felt smoother and softer, too. I definitely recommend this and will be returning for more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE-LOVE this Vitamin C Serum!!  I began using it before the Super C Serum was released and I saw wonderful benefits from it so when I began using the Super C Serum I used both of the serums in combination, applying the Vitamin C Serum first which has the exfoliating factor (letting it fully absorb into my skin) and following it up with the Super C Serum.  My skin is very happy, healthy and nourished!!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this...like another reviewer said, I found it smelled horrible, nothing at all like citrus!  It was also incredibly sticky.  I am not sure if it was just a bad batch, but this product was the worst purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time!</li>
            <li> I was given this product to try and I can only say that I am amazed and thrilled at the results after only 7 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a woman who has very fair skin with freckles, I have also been very sensitive to a wide array of skin products in the past. I was given this product to try and I can only say that I am amazed and thrilled at the results after only 7 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a fair bit of research about the active ingredients in this serum and was excited to try something that could be kind to my 46-year old skin while softening the beginnings of wrinkles in the usual places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With only 7 applications so far, my skin is markedly improved. The elasticity of my skin especially around my mouth is significant. I also have a furrow between my eyebrows, caused by years of reading in poor lighting I guess! This particular area is already less noticeable and smoother!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of my face is so touchable. This, according to my husband. He has noticed the soft glow and smoothness of my skin especially around the jawline where I have been prone to slightly rough patchy spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so looking forward to continuing to reap the benefits of this super serum. Thanks so much for sharing this!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months now and am very impressed with the results.  I generally don&#x27;t review many products, but this product does it exactly what it claims to do.  I have gotten so many comments and questions on what I am doing differently to my skin.   I will continue to use this great product.</li>
            <li> Hard to keep using it as it gives one a sticky skin.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t done a thing for me.  Absolutely nothing.  Just a fantasy cream in a bottle.</li>
            <li> This serum is the 2nd Vitamin C serum I have ordered. The first was a different organic kind that I also rated 5 stars as it deserved it and worked very well, but that was before I tried this. This one I would rate 10 stars.Here is part of my follow up e-mail from the company:&lt;br /&gt;OUI Skincare Vitamin 20% is one of the few serums on the market that actually does contain a true 20% Vitamin C concentration (not an “equivalent to”, “like” etc.). We have also added more quality anti-oxidants such as Ferulic Acid, vitamin E and others, in generous amounts, in order to create a powerful anti-oxidant serum that fights the free radicals that your skin encounters daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We chose this form of Vitamin C for our serum because of its acidity so that you can benefit from its gentle exfoliation properties.&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliation is important in order for skin renewal to take place. While you won’t actually see the exfoliation you will feel it working (a slight tingling or refreshing feeling) and you will definitely see it in the results.&lt;br /&gt;Please note that our serum is not transparent or clear. It is a real serum loaded with maximum possible active ingredients to provide you with the best anti-oxidant and anti-aging effects.&lt;br /&gt;The champagne color is due to our base serum of antioxidants such as pomegranate, lemon and orange extracts, Ferulic acid etc. We do not merely fill our products with false fillers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to expect in the first few weeks:&lt;br /&gt;Years of exposure to Sun and to Free-Radicals won’t go away overnight.&lt;br /&gt;However, we do promise results, with constant use wrinkles and fine lines will fade and your skin will become and look healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Depending on your individual skin type and condition, you should expect to see an improvement very soon.&lt;br /&gt;When I personally tried our newly formulated serum for the first time I felt a slight tingling feeling and a few minutes later a very “plumping” feeling as the high concentration of Vitamin C entered my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum has noticeably given me the results I was looking for and I have only been using it for about a week. No more trying out different serums, this is the one for me :-)</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth after about three weeks of the product. It works very well. I apply it at night.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.  It leaves my skin soft and smooth.  It really does what it is advertised to do.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  In the 4 months I have been using this product, my skin is brighter, age spots have diminished and fine lines are not as noticeable. I really noticed the improvement on my chest.  Because it is so affordable, I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much, but  I recently had some treatments to my face and using both the creams I was given to use and the vitamin c serum together created a lot of peeling, so for now I have to back off.  When I&#x27;m allowed to continue, I&#x27;ve decided to try the Super C next since it appears to be more suited for sensitive skin and more mature skin.  The only downside is keeping it refrigerated.&lt;br /&gt;I do a lot of running up and down stairs.</li>
            <li> did absolutely nothing but burn my skin</li>
            <li> Love it,best of the best for your face.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. It leaves my skin hydrated and has helped with age spots on my forehead. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> At first I was nervous but now am really pleased.  I have used another brand of C serum for awhile but have not seen results like this.  Plus this was about $35 cheaper than the one I was using.  I personally struggle with the smell and at first used too much which made my skin oily.  The smell is the main reason it&#x27;s not getting 5 stars.  I realized  a little goes a long way.  I use it at night after I wash my face.  I use a derma roller then apply the serum.  It does take a few min to dry, but again the amount you put on makes a big difference.  I had had a red spot on my cheek for months and this serum, used with the derma roller, has made it almost completely disappear.  I also feel my skin seems brighter and have used less make-up because I feel more confident in my own skin.</li>
            <li> I like this product for my face.</li>
            <li> This goes on nicely and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I am honestly impressed. I live in the dry SoCal climate and I have dry skin. I was using Ole Henriksen&#x27;s Truth Serum and was getting pretty good results, but I noticed that by the end of the day, the effects of the serum were mostly gone. After using this for a week, my skin is hydrated till the next day without stickiness &amp; is glowing. My skin is hydrated and plump, and my skin tone is evening out quickly. So far, the best serum I&#x27;ve found yet. I will reorder.</li>
            <li> I love this vitamin C serum. It clears the imperfections, blackheads and bumps in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few days now.  I like so much about it!  I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician and avid researcher.  A good topical Vit C is one of my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; products.  It is essential to collagen production and a powerful antioxidant. Two important aspects of a topical vitamin C formulation I consider are bioavailability and stability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bioavailability in skincare refers to usability by the skin. A product must be accepted by the skin to be effective.  A few highlights of what I liked about Coui vit C:  L Ascorbic Acid, 20%, low pH&#x3D;maximum absorption &amp; efficacy.  (I tested the pH to be about 3.5).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topical Vitamin C is inherently unstable and one of the biggest challenges as an ingredient in skincare formulations.  Vit C degrades with exposure to air, heat, light.  Coui uses ferulic acid, an opaque bottle, and recommends refrigeration to increase shelf life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other aspects/ingredients that I liked... Vit E when combined with Vit C increases protection from UV damage.  Hyaluronic Acid is a humectant (binds water to skin) providing an instant plumping effect.  Good price point makes a high quality product affordable.  Good customer service - Vitamin C is a powerful ingredient and needs to be both used and stored correctly for maximum effect. As a skincare professional,  I really appreciated that COUI emailed me detailed instructions on how to use and store this product.  While I knew this information, it showed me that they really care about giving their clients the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I had an Blue peeling a 10 days a go, It is an acid peeling with TCA base, my skin was brown, burned , and i start to use this serun 5 days afther my peel . So, I like it, my skyn has recovering very fast, I use two times day, morning and night , I see my skin  gloing very nice.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great, like fresh  orange, but not much a little bit, it is light  no oil, obsorbes very fast, I love it .</li>
            <li> Great great product.  I love that it&#x27;s thicker than a lot of serums.  Can feel it working with a slight tingle!  Lone it</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely incredible! A fantastic price for a product that really works. I will never use anything else! My skin looks amazin!</li>
            <li> This was the first time that I used this brand of Vitamin C Serum. I was happy with the one I had been using, until I tried this one. I actually saw a difference in only a few days using this. It took me a while to get used to the tingling feeling when I applied it but now I look forward to how refreshing it feels. My husband even remarked how nice my skin looked, and believe me that&#x27;s amazing in itself.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!!!!  When I use Vitamin C Serum before going to bed I can feel it working on my skin all night.  Best product I have ever used.  I will absolutely be ordering another bottle.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this product! I bought this for some hyper pigmentation acne on my face and it has changed my life! I wish I took a before picture but the results are incredible. It really does its job by fading the red marks on my face. I use this at night and let it dry and then put cereve moisturizer on my face. In the mornings I put epiduo on and let it dry and then put cereve on again. My skin is finally where I want it to be :) Thank you COUI!</li>
            <li> This product made me break out on my forehead and cheeks. I looked into it and found articles suggesting that a strong C serum might be too much to start off with for some first time users. I wish I had done a bit more research before I jumped on this one. I recommend that you use this product with caution if you decide to try it. Do a patch test and wait several days. I used it for almost a week before I noticed all the little bumps appearing on my forehead. By then it was too late. I gave it two stars because I can&#x27;t comment honestly about whether or not it does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> This smells. After it dries if you rub or touch your face it rolls of like you put a layer of elmers glue on, kinda gross. Didn&#x27;t absorb or change my skin at all, just makes it feel gross. It kinda stings too. I wanted to like it but i just threw money down he drain...</li>
            <li> So I was looking for a good vitamin c serum that was easily absorbable and would help with my acne scars. I have noticed my skin changing with this serum and I must say i am pleased. I am in my middle twenties  and started using it every other night and I haven&#x27;t experienced any unwanted reactions on my skin, nor any burning or anything bad. I am now using it every night and my skin feels great.  I did read a lot of reviews on the product, specially the bad ones and I didn&#x27;t see anything that should stop me from buying this product. A lot of people complained about the smell and I only noticed a small amount of burned odor when I first opened the bottle, the other times I didn&#x27;t smell anything and even if there was a smell, the air would have taken care of it. My point is: Try this product and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin looks and feels!  Great product!</li>
            <li> I use all 3 products. The Super C one works great on wrinkles. This one works great on under eye darkness. The sunscreen is wonderful! I recommend all 3 products! So worth it!</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the improvement in my skin after a week of using Natural Vitamin C Serum.  I could really see a difference in my skin tone, decreased redness and it reduced the appearance of fine lines.  This product also has wonderful healing benefits.</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist recommended this for my blackheads, wrinkles, and many years of sunning as a teenager.  I have been using it for about 2 weeks or so.  It has already made a huge difference in my blackheads!  No kidding!  The wrinkles and a few dark spots will take a bit longer I&#x27;m sure, but I have confidence  it this stuff!  I wouldn&#x27;t leave this review if I didn&#x27;t believe in this stuff, I&#x27;ve used a ton of other products paying a lot more for a whole lot less results!  I love it!  I plan to use it for a long, long time or until he tells me otherwise! 3/4/15  I have been using this product for several months now and I still recommend it whole heartedly!  It has so helped my complexion.  I have less blackheads, my face is no longer oily in those areas it once was always.  That might in part be due to my age, (63 now), but I believe this product has helped that since I was oily before using this. I don&#x27;t have breakouts like I was before starting this product, and my brown spots on my face and my hands have almost disappeared!  I use the product that is left from my face to rub into the back of my hands! I alternate this product with the Super C Serum which also helps with my wrinkles, I love it as well!  I am one of those that if it doesn&#x27;t help with that first one, I don&#x27;t buy it again!  So, I can honestly say this one works!    Update!  Dec. 8, 2014 A really great product recommended by my dermatologist. It has totally helped my complexion and my brown spots disappear ! I am really thrilled with this product and am so excited that it works so well. He told me how good it was and that amazon.com was the best place to buy it. The seller is wonderful to deal with and will answer your questions and give you guidance in using their products.  I have recommended this product to all of my friends and relatives that are not already using it and now I am using the Super C also rotating it with this product and am seeing excellent results with it also.  I am super happy withthis company and their products, no kidding!  I would not give this review otherwise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle and plan to order a 3rd. Gentle exfoliation, my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Really helps with texture, pores, and clarity!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Great product. My skin tone has definitely evened out after 2 bottles and my face is smooth.  My pores are also noticeably reduced.  I just ordered their super c to try out this time.</li>
            <li> It is a terrific product. I found it to be a little sticky on my face at first, but wow the results are amazing. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love the feel, love the way my skin looks, love the product, love the price!  Thanks COUI!  Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. My husband keeps telling me how great I look and how he thinks it has changed my skin and made a noticeable difference. I no longer have blotchy skin and my skin tone is even. Acne marks fade and clogged pores un-clog. Great product. Will definitely keep ordering. I have extremely sensitive skin and this product has made me look fabulous. Thanks so much for making such a nice product.</li>
            <li> Feels sticky - other I&#x27;ve tried are clear and not sticky.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It was recommended that I use Vit C serum along with my Skin Restoring Ceramides.  It has made some improvement in my skin texture and looks.  I am certain with prolonged use the results will be even greater.</li>
            <li> Anyone who is following to any extent news and updates on what is new in skin care surely has heard about benefits of Vitamin C Serums.  This has been known for some years by now.  They also talk about the particular benefits for aging skin and skin that has been exposed to the sun etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried buying and using Vitamin C Serum several times, over the course of some years and several different brands, some of which were very pricy.  But it just never made it into my daily routine - until now with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this product/brand upon recommendation of a friend who&#x27;s been using it and liking it a lot.  I am totally loving it!  I have been using it for about three weeks now.  I really think it works and does what it is supposed to do for the skin based on what they say about the benefits of Vitamin C Serums.  When I apply it, it does feel like it&#x27;s doing something, the skin feels it.  The complexion looks clearer, I would say more transparent or something (I have fair skin), like porcelain.  The skin also looks and feel firmer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I also absolutely love about this product and this brand of Vitamin C Serum is that it is all natural.  They list all the ingredients and there is not a single ingredient that I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable about being soaked into my skin.  This days it is really difficult to find such natural products.  Because they don&#x27;t use chemical preservatives, they (the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions) advise that you store it in the refrigerator after opening, which is what I am doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is also very concentrated and potent.  For that reason I use it every other day, at night.o absolutely love about this product and this brand of Vitamin C Serum is that it is all natural.

            <li> The product arrived quickly and the packaging was nice. I have only been using this for a couple of weeks but I have noticed improvement in the way my skin looks and feels. My skin looks brighter and fine lines have shown some improvement. I have a couple of dark spots I hope will fade as I continue to use it. I had been using a different Vitamin C serum I purchased a couple of months before I found this one. It was priced the same but the results were not even close.  I have to say OUI is far superior and their customer service is excellent. I will be buying this product from them again.</li>
            <li> I Want to give this product 5 stars, but due to the stickiness left on my face after applying it I only gave it four. Other than that, I am really starting to like this product. I have been using it for about two wks now and just recently I am starting to see a difference in my face. I also purchased a bottle for my mom, and she is in absolute love w/this product. She said she will never go w/out it again. Lol. I personally just don&#x27;t like the stickiness left on my face afterwards. Makes me feel like all the dirt floating around in the air will get stuck to my face. Anyway, my overall experience w/this product has been pretty great and I would definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> noticeable difference in my deeper lines very quickly. I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good product, but my sensitive skin broke out. I think the quality is very good, just not the right product for me. I&#x27;m very prone to break outs. The package and customer service were terrific. I think I&#x27;d try something else from the product line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like putting lemon juice on your face... didn&#x27;t do anything ...</li>
            <li> Best antiaging product out there. I am 61 and got carded for a bottle of wine at the supermarket.</li>
            <li> I just love...love...love this vitamin c serum. It nourishes my skin to the fullest because I have such dry skin. I will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> I loved the ingredients and consistency of this product. What a great formula! Unfortunately I only had a pleasure of using it for a week or so and then dropped the bottle and it broke being the glass, so there went my summer time investment and sun damage reversal ... All of the ingredients are powerful antioxidants and this formula is moisturizing without being too heavy or oily</li>
            <li> I love this serum! I have really good results with it. My skin if definitely smoother, brighter and I have so much more radiance. I have tried several Vitamin C serums in the past but this one is amazing. I absolutely will be repurchasing this serum and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I took a chance and ordered this serum because it was within my budget. I am so very glad I did!! This is a wonderful vitamin C serum. My skin looks so much better. I was afraid I would run out and made sure I ordered another while the launch price was still in effect. Great customer service also.  They definitely deserve all five stars!!</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t work, I wouldn&#x27;t order more. It does a great job of making my skin look smoother, healthier, and younger.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum approximately every other day for a few weeks.  It has very nice packaging and a pleasant citrus smell.  When I apply it to my skin, I have a slight stinging sensation.  It dries fairly quickly, so I can then apply my usual moisturizer.  My skin does have a rosy glow after use.  I have made the observation that the day after I use it, I wake up with a pimple!  It may be a little too hydrating for me.  I will continue to use it on my neck and décolletage, but will use it sparingly on my face.</li>
            <li> I just plain like it!! It feels good, healthy, like I really am doing something loving for my skin. DR. Oz I think mentioned vit.C and Hyaluronic being important once; he can be a little overwhelming, with his vast knowledge of do&#x27;s, tries and haves. I am glad to have this product and will continue to purchase. It holds my skins moisture, smells citrus great. Helpful hint- keep in fridge.</li>
            <li> all i can really say is that it didn&#x27;t hurt, but i didn&#x27;t notice any great benifits. may of helped a little. i really don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll buy it again. the seller is nice and emailed me right back when i  had questions, the support was great. i think it has a money back guarantee but i didn&#x27;t use it, they were nice to deal with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just turned 30 and thought it was time to start looking through some skincare products. I got a bit confused and didn&#x27;t know where to start, so many options and different products. I don&#x27;t like very creamy substances and can&#x27;t bare tons of make-up on my face for that same reason. Then I came across this serum and thought,Vitamin C, that can&#x27;t be bad. So, I went for it and purchased one bottle. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a week now and my skin does feel smoother and gave my face a bit of a glow. I&#x27;m very pleased with the service. I&#x27;ve got an email right away to ensure that I&#x27;ve received the product along with some skincare tips. Later I&#x27;ve got another email with further advices, for which I&#x27;m very thankful cos I&#x27;ve just started to look into the subject. I&#x27;m looking forward to see what the result will be after weeks of using this Serum. It has very nice, tingling feeling when applied and is absorbed very quickly. In short, I&#x27;m getting another bottle.</li>
            <li> I often took my skin for granted and at 53, noticed lots of changes.  This product has helped me bring my face &amp; neck areas back to life!  It feels good and I can definitely see a difference after several weeks of use.</li>
            <li> wrinkles are fading and love the tightening of my skin..great product..will certainly buy again,,also recommended to all my friends, DMH</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been using it twice a day for three months and received many complements on my more youthful skin. Friends say i&#x27;ve turned back time. My skin  is plumper, smoother, less lined and brown spots and hyper pigmentation has faded. i would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Everyone keeps complaining about the offensive smell...yet no one has accurately described it . It is metallic and lingering..which means that you have to endure it for a very long time. the smell transfers to everything, pillowcases, towels, husbands and bratty children. I&#x27;m sorry if I am unable to report on the ultimate efficacy of this product,but I could never use it consistently to be able to opine. I do not know why it has to be so metallic but until that smell/aspect is eliminated, I cannot use this product. Perhaps it&#x27;s me: I hate the metal smell of my door keys on my hands...I just cannot tolerate the smell</li>
            <li> Ok I  love experiments, so the first thing I did when I got this serum as a gift from my sister was smell and taste it.&lt;br /&gt;I  am a serum addict and what I have discovered is that a potent serum cannot smell and taste like water.&lt;br /&gt;The stronger the taste and smell normally the better the effect. I have really enjoyed using this serum because it feels like a true serum.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like lemon and even tastes a bit sour. The bonus effect is that the small lines above my lips have become less visible in the last few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is also feels amazingly moisturised and supple. I guess it works very well with my SPF.&lt;br /&gt;The other place that I have noticed this serum having an amazing effect is on my hands. Because I work a lot with my hands I tend to have a difficult time keeping them moisturised for long enough.&lt;br /&gt;So being the experiment fiend that I am I started applying this liberally to my hands.&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is WOW ! They have never felt so soft and my skin looks great I guess the vitamin C here is really the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;Next I am going to try it on my knees and elbows. Will let you know how this works out. Really love this serum and can’t wait to get my next bottle .</li>
            <li> when I used this product it burns</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed Natural Vitamin C Serum.  My skin feels much smoother and&lt;br /&gt;I feel firming after applying.  Wouldn&#x27;t miss a day without it. I noticed&lt;br /&gt;some people are complaining of stickiness.  It would help you tremendously&lt;br /&gt;to give your skin a chance to absorb it.  About 5 minutes.  Smooth as a whistle.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry but those remarks struck me funny.</li>
            <li> I liked this vitamin C product. I seen an improvement with my skin within a few days of daily use! It was a little on the sticky side so I used it at night with a moisturizer. Over all...satisfied, will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39 this month and very fair.  I have more sunspots on my left side (ooh, hello sunshine as I drive!) despite being a huge sunscreen user.  This product is really amazing.  I use a teeny bit nightly and my face appears smoother and my sunspots are nearly gone.  I&#x27;ve actually gone out without foundation -- just a bit of concealer under my eyes and a swipe of mineral veil on top of my COUI sunscreen -- and looked perfectly fine.  I&#x27;d never have done that before, because my skintone edges toward uneven too often.  I love this stuff.  It honestly feels like I&#x27;m getting a $250 serum at a fraction of the price! And nope, I didn&#x27;t receive any compensation for this review, ha ha.</li>
            <li> Usually when you pay $30 for a skin care product, that&#x27;s exactly what you get. Not much. I try to avoid this mistake.&lt;br /&gt;However, a friend recommended  OUI C Serum so I decided to give it a try. It arrived in a beautiful, clean looking and super professional packaging. It is loaded with great ingredients and after applying for few days, I felt a positive effect. It is too early to see significant results after such a short while, but there is definitely an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it is so cheap because it is sold on Amazon. I still have my suspicions about the price, yet so far so good.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vit C serum for some time but this is the best one I have found and I can honestly say that I saw results within a few days. I can easily go without foundation and I think the best testimonial is that people have asked me what I use on my skin because it glows. I am far from young so this is high praise indeed.</li>
            <li> I have tried this OUI serum for 4 days now, and although it&#x27;s quite a little bit earlier to write my review, I think I need to. This product is amazing. My face is glowing and I think the serum is really working as it should be. Although it says in the direction to apply every other day, I do it every night and top it with a night moisturizer. And when I woke up, I washed my face and wholla... it&#x27;s glowing. I&#x27;m already 60 yrs and shall we say, very vain with how I look, and choose my facial products with utmost care. I was watching Dr. Oz show one day and they&#x27;re talking about the right ingredients in a facial care to look up to when buying. They said, it&#x27;s Vit C and hyaluronic acid, so I went to my Amazon account and research for products that will have those ingredients and found this OUI with several positive feedbacks; hence, I ordered it. Also; the seller, Ms Alessandra Poletti was very helpful and patient too. She answered all my questions about the product. She always email me back ASAP her reply and gave me all the good info I needed. Thanks a lot for the great product! Eagerly awaiting for your moisturizer which will come by April or May. Regards to your business. Keep up with the good work and products.</li>
            <li> So far, I am happy with the OUI Skincare Vitamin C Serum. I have been using it for about 10 days and feel like it is starting to take effect. As a former sun-bather, I have been very pro-active about trying to fade sun spots and appreciate the launch price that I was able to purchase this product. I have also appreciated all the tips and advice given by the company!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40 years old and I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 2 weeks and I can already tell a difference! My skin seems more firm, and some splotchiness I have had has evened out.  Didn&#x27;t even wear foundation today, only concealer under my eyes.  I&#x27;m super happy with this serum and plan on buying it again!</li>
            <li> I like this product..it absorbes quite quickly into your skin, with use with my other topical products its making the results of my skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Good product but took a little while to absorb where it wasn&#x27;t sticky</li>
            <li> Oui is everything you have said it is PLUS the time factor:  it worked on the tops of my hands after only one application.  I am totally sold on it.  God and OUI, now help my face.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this product.  I have old skin, I am 59, this product has helped my skin so much in just a week.  My skin looks so much better, around my eyes is much smoother and the sagging look on mid face has diminished.  A huge plus - this serum is clearing up the my blemish breakouts and my pores have lessened. Thanks OUI!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she&#x27;s been using it for about two weeks, she really enjoys it, was surprised at the great price given the quality of the product and is trying to get me to buy her more before the price goes up!  :D</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t expected such good results.  Not having changed my skin care routine except for using OUI moring and evening, I&#x27;ve noted my deepest lines--the 11&#x27;s, naso-labial lines, as well as those smile lines around the eyes, have diminished in only 30 days of use.  My skin does feel firmer, seems lifted and brighter...and I&#x27;m 62.  I am reordering month 2 in anticipation of continued good results. One other bonus...the price is so affordable!! This is a great product!!</li>
            <li> I happened upon this product by accident.....just browsing on Amazon. I&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt;tried a lot of products in my 59 years, at all cost levels, and this is one of my&lt;br /&gt;favorites.</li>
            <li> Its okay.  Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> My mom is the one using this serum.  She had been using this consistently at night time (mix a few drops with her moisturizer).  She said it helps reduce the sun spots and make her skin look more radiant.  So far there&#x27;s is no different in wrinkle yet.  She has dry, sensitive, and mature skin.</li>
            <li> This product got some mixed reviews but for the price could it be that bad?&lt;br /&gt;the answer is yes. this stuff is really sticky. and certainly doesn&#x27;t absorb. when i first received it in the mail i decided to put in on immediately. i assumed the reason it felt so sticky was that is was over moisturizer. so i showered that night and applied on clean skin and went to bed.  same issue, sticky- didn&#x27;t absorb and my hair kept sticking to my face. i washed it off in the morning and tried using it for a 2nd time the next night and the same thing- sticky, except this time it bothered me so bad i got up in the middle of the night to wash it off my face. the next morning i requested a refund. i don&#x27;t believe something that does not absorb and coats your face in a sticky wax like substance would really do much good anyways.</li>
            <li> This is a great product , really works, it hydrates and significantly helped with my wrinkles. I&#x27; just purchased my 2nd bottle.  Great customer service and fast shipping .</li>
            <li> I have been using the product every morning and evening I immediately saw difference in my skin, I am very pleased with the results so far and will continue to use it.  I have already purchased another bottle so that I can keep one in my bedroom and one in my bathroom so I don&#x27;t forget to use it thank you</li>
            <li> I just stumbled on this product and thought I would give it a try! I am so hooked now! I have seen my age spot lighten significantly and just overall general appearance of skin looks more youthful. I have experienced amazing customer service as well! Try this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for several months and I would not be without it! I alternate it with the Super C Serum (also by COUI) and I have been thrilled with the results. Used regularly, there is no need for further exfoliation and even though I tend to get a bit of dry skin on my cheeks, this product is not drying or harsh. I also apply it directly when I see a blemish or breakout cropping it up because it takes down the inflammation and helps it to heal more quickly. As one who spends a lot of time in the sun, I was pleased to find out that the serum also helps protect against, and repair, sun damage. I use it, I love it, I buy it again.  Full Disclosure: I received this product at a discount as part of a promotion.</li>
            <li> It simply doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Has evened out my skin tone noticeably.</li>
            <li> I started using this product 2 months ago and it seems to be working pretty good on me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this COUI Vitamin C Serum with E and Hyaluronic Acid Y Ferulic Acid!!!  It is amazing!!  I have only used a week and I can tell a huge difference in my skin!  It is really, really soft and supple!  My skin glows.  I also have not just begun using a Vitamin C serum.  I have used Skinceuticals for years and I love this more.  GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I love the Vitamin C Serum 20%, my husband and I have been using it for a while now and see great results.</li>
            <li> This product is very rewarding. It has improved my skins appearance and given it a vibrant, healthy glow. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now and I look forward to applying it every morning. I&#x27;ve always used C serum, and was using a different brand of C serum that I thought was working well, but I switched to this one because of the launch price, which is awesome BTW, but upon receiving it I found this one to have much better ingredients than the product I was using before, and upon using it I was very impressed with the way it felt on my skin and how my skin reacted to it. It is one of my favorite products now and I even purchased a couple more bottles since they were still offering the launch price and I do not want to be without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep it in the refrigerator and apply it after my toner each morning as recommended. It feels so refreshing and protective to my skin. I can feel my skin drinking it in just like when I drink a big glass of freshly juiced fruits and vegetables, all those wonderful natural nutrients penetrating my cells and healing me of all of the daily toxins I encounter everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It soaks into my skin very quickly and leaves my skin feeling like there is a protective barrier between my skin and the sun and any free radicals that may try to enter. I ALWAYS use a moisturizing sunscreen everyday but since I&#x27;ve been using this product my skin has been more vibrant and brighter looking, I&#x27;ve also noticed that my blemishes heal faster than they used to as well as having less of them. This is really an awesome product. Do yourself a favor and use it. I think you are going to be pleasantly surprised, I was...</li>
            <li> Seller was great,too. I&#x27;ve been using Vitamin C serum for years and this is a good one at a great price. I have now been using this product for over 2 years and wouldn&#x27;t be without it. I use it at night and the other Vitamin C serum they make in the morning and my skin looks great. People(including skincare professionals)tell me all the time I have great skin, so I am sticking with this product!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few weeks. It feels like a shot of concentrated vitamin C. I don&#x27;t know exactly what it&#x27;s doing, as I use really good products and take great care of my skin, but I feel good about it as an addition to my routine.</li>
            <li> I have been using OUI vitamin C serum for almost 2 months now and I am very happy with the results.  The fine lines on  my face have diminished and my skin looks healthier in general. I apply it every morning and include my neck and chest which also looks much smoother. I will definitely continue using this vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 years old and I have light skin. I love tanning and have been doing so my whole life, as a result my skin suffered. I tried ALL kinds of products from creams to serums to masks, etc. without long term visible results until I found OUI Vitamin C Serum. This product made a huge difference in not only the depth and length of the wrinkles around my eyes but also over all my skin looks younger, tighter and healthier. You can really smell the vitamin C in it and once you put it on it absorbs quickly into the skin which allows you to start your make up or beauty routine right away. Some reviews mention the fact that this product is a little liquid, yet it is that light consistency that allows for the product to be absorbed deep into the skin. I truly recommend this product. With a promotional price of $20 it would be a sin not to try it.</li>
            <li> After three weeks, there has been no improvement in fine lines or wrinkles or brown spots from sun damage. This product has an absolutely awful smell that lingers all night (I used it at bedtime). It is also feels very sticky on my skin even after it has supposedly been absorbed. Altogether yucky stuff! I feel Vitamin C is good for my skin, but I don&#x27;t think I can put up with this.</li>
            <li> I like this serum,it feels nice,doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and I can tell a difference in my skin,will keep using.</li>
            <li> I thought it was pretty good.</li>
            <li> Have tried several of the vitamin C serums but this one is the best.I noticed a slight difference after the first couple of applications.  I have only been using for a week or so but I did notice a difference . A couple of very fine lines are no longer there.  Nothing works miracles but this seems to help more than the other ones that I have tried.  Will keep using and hopefully over the long term will see additional improvements.  Also I was very pleased that the company contacted me and sent me an email on exactly how to use the serum and things to watch out for.  I have never had a company do that and was pleasantly surprised. I even emailed them a question and they answered promptly.  Great customer service.</li>
            <li> This serum does everything it claims! My skin feels tight and smooth. I will order again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is REALLY GOOD. An I&#x27;ve tried them all lol 😊😊☺️ My new fav!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for 6 months now and I absolutely love it. My skin has become so smooth and even in color that I never wear makeup anymore. I dont need too (except mascara) my face is so even and hydrated. I am 48 yrs old and my skin is looking younger thanks to this product. I use this serum with Hyaluronic  acid . They both really compliment  each other. I highly recommend this potent skin care. I had tried others and nothing compares to this one. 5 star rating !!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many Vitamin C serums looking for the right one.  This one had a chemical smell did not like it.</li>
            <li> This stuff left my skin feeling softer and looking smoother, but is has a bad smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about a year - retin A at night and this vitamin C serum under moisture during the day.  My skin is definitely brighter and it feels like my moisture lotion absorbs better.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on some of the reviews I read, and because it was such a good price. I keep this in my refrigerator based on tips received from the company. Great customer service by the way!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about two weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looking more even toned and bright. It has a glow about it that I was pleasantly surprised with.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product and I have and will recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good serum after I applied on my face . Recommend !</li>
            <li> This is unlike any of the other Vit C treatments.  It is not oily, but rather sticky and smells like it&#x27;s simply bottled lemon juice.  YUCK!!</li>
            <li> I was initially concerned because I have an intolerance to Vitamin C (digesting it) and I have extremely sensitive skin to boot. I break out easily and my skin ends up looking like I have a rash with most skincare products. However, at my age I am so aware of how much my skin is changing, and I didn&#x27;t feel I had a choice but to try it. I am thrilled to death with the Vitamin C Serum! I am hooked on it. I can&#x27;t recommend it more highly!</li>
            <li> I use this on my nights off from my acne treatments. The Clinical C&#x27;s exfoliating effects are extremely gentle compared to my regular routine and my skin likes the extra Vitamin C for scarring. This and The Super C Serum are the only two C-Products I found that I would dare put on my sensitive, acne-prone skin. I am Loving Coui!</li>
            <li> I was amazed by how well this product worked.  I have a deep line underneath my L-eye.  By applying OUI, I can barely see it.  I&#x27;ll try using it on my face and neck and not just the under eye area.  Thank you for making a product that truly works!&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! You can see the change in your skin after a week. Keep it in the fridge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I invested in this serum. I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple weeks, but it has helped with some dry spots, and I have felt that my skin feels younger and more &#x27;plump&#x27; since. I&#x27;m in my early 40s with combination skin. Note: I have been using this partially in conjunction with a derma roller (the micro-needle roller for your face). I was worried this would sting if I applied immediately after using the roller, but it does not sting at all, thankfully. It also does not sting around the delicate eye area (obviously don&#x27;t get it in your eyes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle should last at least 6 months, I&#x27;d predict. A little goes a long way. The instructions suggest to discard after 6 months due to chemicals losing effectiveness - no idea how accurate that really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only very minor points I&#x27;d say aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; about the product are 1) the smell - it&#x27;s not a bad smell, but not exactly nice and refreshing either. Maybe I was expecting a more citrus scent or something. 2) the stickiness - it is mildly sticky, rather than smooth, to apply. Not terrible or anything - maybe that is just how Hyaluronic Acid is (I don&#x27;t know, this is my first experience with this ingredient). But your fingers and face feel a bit sticky after application, so your face won&#x27;t be caressable by your partner, and you will probably feel like washing your hands. Not a big deal, but something to be aware of depending on your personal expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using this, and would recommend it to a friend looking for a little extra softness and plumpness at a value price. Worth a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a couple of weeks, so I don&#x27;t expect to see a difference yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is my main issue. I was expecting a light citrus scent. Instead, I got hot dog in a bottle. That is very difficult to get past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it every other day, maybe 3 drops for my entire face. There is no tingling or plumping sensation, which is actually a plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin does &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; when I use it, but it does feel quite greasy after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping to see improvements by the end of this bottle, but I&#x27;m no feeling hopeful at this point.</li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum has really improved my complexion. I have been using to for 2 months and my skin is clearer and more luminous. Fine lines have have faded away. I have had many complements on my skin. I have used a wide range of very expensive products but this serum is bar far the best investment I have made.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this Serum, I have bought plenty of anti aging products throughout my life and this Vitamin C Serum brings me back to at least three years younger! Not only that but I live in Florida at this time and the sun really affected my skin and damaged it. This serum reduced my wrinkles and lines that were just so irritating because I still want to be beautiful. I actually have been using the serum for two months now and I am so happy with it! Like other products, these product actually keeps my pores from getting clogged and I actually can feel the difference. I just had to write a review because I feel so comfortable while using this amazing product, I just really recommend this to anyone at all and the great part about this product is that if it is not for your skin than there is 30 Day gaurentee back and thats the reason I actually make sure before buying any product.</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t as bad as some others said. I personally think it smells like green olives.&lt;br /&gt;It made my face greasy as hell, though. And even though I used the product as directed, my face exploded with pimples. I know it was this product because nothing else has changed in my skincare routine, so I probably won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
            <li> Fa La la la la la la la laaaaaaa!!! I&#x27;VE FINALLY FOUND IT!!! I feel like I could bust out into an opera song! I am a PRODUCT JUNKIE and I have searched the world high and low for something to help with my crow&#x27;s feet, smile lines, and overall skin dullness. I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything: from drugstore merch to super duper expensive brands. I have a graveyard of wrinkle creams/serums that represents a LOT of wasted $. I&#x27;ve tried so many products that did absolutely nothing for me, and I&#x27;ve tried products that seemed to have helped a little bit - but nothing to write home about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading a million reviews, I bought the COUI Super C Serum and the COUI Vitamin C Serum 20%. I&#x27;ve been using them for about a month, and I&#x27;m so happy to say that I&#x27;m finally not disappointed this time! Within 3 days my skin had improved - it looked brighter and rejuvenated. I deal with adult acne, and this has also helped with that. My skin is clearer. It hasn&#x27;t eliminated my acne completely, but my breakouts are diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My MAIN concern is my crow&#x27;s feet, and this is the ONLY product I&#x27;ve found that has softened them. I&#x27;m sure there are other good products out there, but I think you have to find the product that works for YOU. And I have no idea why, but absolutely no other product I&#x27;ve tried has helped my crow&#x27;s feet. (Hyaluronic acid will help temporarily for a day fix - but I&#x27;m referring to long-term.) My crow&#x27;s feet haven&#x27;t vanished (this isn&#x27;t botox!), but I can visibly see that they are less harsh. Thank you!!! I&#x27;m hoping that with continued use it will only get better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Super C 2x a day - morning and night. It&#x27;s clear and light and feels refreshing. I use the Vit C 20% at bedtime every other night. It&#x27;s sticky and can&#x27;t be worn under makeup. It exfoliates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to say that this company has got it going on! They sent me an email with information and step-by-step directions. Then today I got a coupon for future purchases with them. It&#x27;s apparent that they care about what they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you COUI for making an incredible product that doesn&#x27;t break my bank!!!</li>
            <li> I have used several Vit C 20% serums and I am most pleased with the results of the COUI serum. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This makes your skin tacky &amp; sticky after it dries  did not like</li>
            <li> I have used this for a solid week. My skin is brighter, small lines gone, sun spots fading. Has a nice light feel on skin.</li>
            <li> I use this in the morning and it gives my skin a refreshing glow.  I have even purchased as a gift.</li>
            <li> Waste of money :( I bought this a while back and forgot to review it.&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice anything except more breakouts. It is also very watery.</li>
            <li> As prescription Fast delivery</li>
            <li> This Product really works, You can see results very quickly. Worth the cost and I would purchase more without hesitation. I have tried many different products and this product has provided the best results. For once a product lives up to it&#x27;s claims. It is the best professional Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I have ever used that I actually think has made a difference!  I have only been using it for a short time, but the tiny lines I thought I was getting around my eyes are almost gone.  I&#x27;m very happy w this product, and I intend to continue using it, especially because it&#x27;s not ridiculously overpriced!  Totally worth the money!!  Fast shipping and great customer service too!!</li>
            <li> Excellent service, fast shipping, great product! A++</li>
            <li> Works well. Kinda stinky and leaves a tacky feeling on my face. For this reason I only use at night.</li>
            <li> When I first began derma rolling, Vitamin C Serum was recommended by the company who sold the roller.  After reading  reviews of several other suppliers, I opted for Coui Natural Vitamin C Serum.  Not only have I noticed that my skin is brighter, others have as well.  Because of my results, I wanted to share a good thing with my cousin and a dear friend.  I am very pleased with the quality of this vitamin C serum and also the fact that it is offered at a great price.  I will continue to use Coui products and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It is making a difference in my skin tone, firming, overall appearance and feel. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> There are three words to describe this product: COUI Natural Vitamin C Serum 20%, “I LOVE IT”.  I’m a skincare product Junkie and I was so happy when I found this product on Amazon.  I’ve used other brands of vitamin C serums before, but COUI really makes a noticeable difference on my skin.  My co-worker actually thought that I had a laser treatment done because my skin tone improved so much.  This Vitamin C serum makes my skin so soft and looking brighter.  I ordered a bottle for my sister-in-law as a gift and she likes it as well.  I give “TWO THUMBS UP” for COUI Natural Vitamin C Serum 20%.</li>
            <li> stings , so i know it works .. but leaves my skin sticky .. went bad after a month or 2</li>
            <li> This is an incredible product at an incredible price!  I have purchased many different C-serums over the years.  One in particular was over $80.  I feel that I have seen more results using this serum than with the more expensive brand. Here&#x27;s why I like COUI:  *Stability of the vitamin C is very good in this serum.  It is difficult for manufacturers to keep the vitamin c available to be absorbed by the skin.  *Skin is noticeably smoother and softer.  *Fine lines are less!!  *Evens out skin tone  I am a HUGE fan of this product!!  Yea COUI!  I also use the COUI Super C Serum with this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried the more expensive C serums and have found Coui the best of all of them.  I am now using Vitamin C super serum 4 x weekly and the vitamin C serum the other days,  I am 70 yrs old and have a background in skin care and health.&lt;br /&gt;This company is quite special, as they send you personal thank you&#x27;s and complete information on and about the products and their use.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased to share this information, as I have passed it along to my friends who are serious about their skin care regimine.&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist thinks my skin is easily 15 years younger looking than my would suggest by my age.&lt;br /&gt;Ms. Poletti, keep up the great work,&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Patricia Gordon</li>
            <li> Great product!! I had been using a more expensive brand and this showed comparable ingredients so I thought I give it a go, and it works just as great! Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product.  My Second time ordering. Food price too.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  I have noticed a difference in the look and feel of my skin.  Before buying it, I had researched on the web to see what products have actually been laboratory proven to repair skin and prevent wrinkles and damage. The small bottle lasts me a couple of months and I use it for face and décolletage. I have gifted it to friends and they continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see any difference on my skin :(</li>
            <li> “I am very happy with my Coui Skincare. It has diminished wrinkles and I have more skin clarity. I also appreciate the quick reply to my questions about the use of Super C with Vitamin C. ”Using the COUI skin care line is easy, clean and effective. Other commercial cosmetic lines have 5 or 6 products and steps to their skincare regime and can be so costly.</li>
            <li> Best vitamin C for the money. Very good product- will purchase again</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!!! My dermatologist even asked me what I was using on my face to have it looking so good.As a skin care specialist, I review all the millions of skin care products out there. This has the best combination of ingredients that is needed for effective results. I have a much more youthful appearance and my skin drinks this serum in!! It is listed as professional because that&#x27;s what it is. The concentration of the ingredients deliver!!! And I have tried EVERYTHING out there. You will not waste your money again on some false promises on what other skin care products will do. I am on my 6th bottle and will keep buying.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this serum and I can honestly say this stuff is really good. I have sensitive skin and this did not cause any breakouts or irritations. At first when you put out on you do feel a little tingle but its just the process of exfoliation. It gave my skin a beautiful glow.</li>
