            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different HA serums</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know exactly what it is doing for my skin</li>
            <li>My one girlfriend has super sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use very much on her skin without having a reaction.</li>
            <li>thanks so much!</li>
            <li>Gone is the dry winter skin that so many of us suffer from this time of year.  </li>
            <li>I truly am impressed with Raw Biology&#x27;s HA serum + their other products.</li>
            <li>My fine lines have visibly improved,  especially around my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I especially like this product for the fine lines around my lips.  </li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>My mother and I both highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Arrived very speedily and was well packaged.</li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference with this Hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I like what it&#x27;s doing for my skin.</li>
            <li>and they too really like it.</li>
            <li>I ordered another version of this serum from a different seller originally and let me tell you , the quality and texture of this serum is outstanding compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for a week, but I already notice a difference in the texture, tone, quality, and clarity of my skin, as well as fine lines around my eyes and forehead becoming less noticeable.</li>
            <li>When I applied it to my face initially it felt cool and moist.</li>
            <li>so I am excited to see how this works in the long run.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many products and believe Raw Biology&#x27;s claim, without yet having tried the other two serums.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This product is high quality and packaged well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend .  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for a few weeks now and love it.  </li>
            <li>Raw Biology doesn&#x27;t fit in ANY of those categories!</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s 58 years old and says that within less than a week she noticed lessened signs of aging (fine lines and wrinkles) and a reduction of puffiness under her eyes.</li>
            <li>This product is superior to all other serums I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First you use the hyalauronic acid serum in the clear bottle.</li>
            <li>I will purchase the complete line</li>
            <li>do believe in aging naturally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried foods and every natural thing that someone claimed helped with wrinkles.</li>
            <li>By the way, I am 57 years old.  </li>
            <li>it leaves my skin soft and</li>
            <li>On top of that for the past 25 years I walk from 4 to 10 miles a day, outside.</li>
            <li>It actually is a high end product that does make a big difference.</li>
            <li>It works very well with my open pores and the fine lines that are slowly invading my face.</li>
            <li>In the morning, i wash my face very well, and pat dry.</li>
            <li>Now, after just little over a week, I have noticed that my skin appears more radiant and moisturized longer and it also appears to have reduced the appearance of my dark circles underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li>I was eager to get started:)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Hyaluronic Acid with Vitamin C last night and this morning, and so far it feels wonderful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this serum for a little over a week and already notice some positive results!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Raw Biology Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C to anyone who wants a premium product at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>I am noticing less breakouts and my fine lines and wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I really thought this would be an average product.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to others and will probably continue to use this as well as some other products I have tried that I really like.</li>
            <li>My laugh lines have disappears from using this and Argan oil for the past eight weeks.</li>
            <li>I let stand on my face 15 minutes, then I add coconut oil on top of that, and I don&#x27;t not apply sun block for at least a half hour.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen a whole lot of difference in the skin, although it FEELS a little softer.  </li>

            <li> Shipping was fast and I like what it&#x27;s doing for my skin.</li>
            <li> and they too really like it.</li>
            <li> I ordered another version of this serum from a different seller originally and let me tell you , the quality and texture of this serum is outstanding compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a week, but I already notice a difference in the texture, tone, quality, and clarity of my skin, as well as fine lines around my eyes and forehead becoming less noticeable.</li>
            <li> When I applied it to my face initially it felt cool and moist.</li>
            <li> so I am excited to see how this works in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many products and believe Raw Biology&#x27;s claim, without yet having tried the other two serums.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is high quality and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend .  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few weeks now and love it.  </li>
            <li> Raw Biology doesn&#x27;t fit in ANY of those categories!</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s 58 years old and says that within less than a week she noticed lessened signs of aging (fine lines and wrinkles) and a reduction of puffiness under her eyes.</li>
            <li> This product is superior to all other serums I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First you use the hyalauronic acid serum in the clear bottle.</li>
            <li> I will purchase the complete line</li>
            <li> do believe in aging naturally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried foods and every natural thing that someone claimed helped with wrinkles.</li>
            <li> By the way, I am 57 years old.  </li>
            <li> it leaves my skin soft and</li>
            <li> On top of that for the past 25 years I walk from 4 to 10 miles a day, outside.</li>
            <li> It actually is a high end product that does make a big difference.</li>
            <li> It works very well with my open pores and the fine lines that are slowly invading my face.</li>
            <li> In the morning, i wash my face very well, and pat dry.</li>
            <li> Now, after just little over a week, I have noticed that my skin appears more radiant and moisturized longer and it also appears to have reduced the appearance of my dark circles underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was eager to get started:)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Hyaluronic Acid with Vitamin C last night and this morning, and so far it feels wonderful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a little over a week and already notice some positive results!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Raw Biology Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C to anyone who wants a premium product at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I am noticing less breakouts and my fine lines and wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I really thought this would be an average product.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to others and will probably continue to use this as well as some other products I have tried that I really like.</li>
            <li> My laugh lines have disappears from using this and Argan oil for the past eight weeks.</li>
            <li> I let stand on my face 15 minutes, then I add coconut oil on top of that, and I don&#x27;t not apply sun block for at least a half hour.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a whole lot of difference in the skin, although it FEELS a little softer.  </li>
            <li> It does spread well, so I&#x27;ve started using a little less at each application because after one week it seems like it&#x27;s going fast.</li>
            <li> I am a 36 year old female and have had issues with dryness, dull looking skin and dark circles under my eyes, especially in the last couple of years.</li>
            <li> It helps to restore the hyaluronic acid your body used to make but slowly stopped producing as you got older.</li>
            <li> , my skin feels the same didn&#x27;t help with the dark circles I used every single day until the bottle was done and nothing</li>
            <li> Plus, with their 100% guarantee, you have nothing to lose and can tell that this company truely stands behind their products!</li>
            <li> Being of olive skinned tone I&#x27;m prone to dark circle under my eyes and deep &amp;#34;laugh lines&amp;#34; all over my face, in a couple of weeks of using hyaluronic acid serum I have noticed that the lines are finer and my dark circles have almost disappeared....</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Last you use the Vitamin C product in the green bottle.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a few weeks so</li>
            <li> did find it all over the internet, at prices that I was just not willing to try.</li>
            <li> Extremely lightweight .</li>
            <li> rince well, pat dry and apply my Raw Hyaluronic</li>
            <li> At night after my shower I exfoliate with a face stub, rince well, pat dry and apply my Raw Hyaluronic</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re using this combination you no longer need any other skin care products!</li>
            <li> I again apply coconut oil and let that sit for a half hour.</li>
            <li> I again apply coconut oil and let that sit for a half hour.</li>
            <li> With this serum, it smoothed out her skin, and I could even tell the difference after a couple uses on her as it seemed to be reducing the size of the marks in her face from previous blemishes.</li>
            <li> There is a slight tingle after application, but that just lets me know its working.</li>
            <li> I applied as directed and discovered my face was a soft and moist at the end of the day even though I live in a very cold climate.</li>
            <li> Everyday</li>
            <li> will update after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I apply the Raw Biology Hyaluronic Acid +Vit C.</li>
            <li> , I apply a couple drops each of Raw Biology&#x27;s Retinal serum &amp; Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> When I received this product there was a card from Raw Biology stating that their three products, the Hyaluronic Acid, the Vitamin C, and the Retinol Serums are all anyone would need for their skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Peacely sun block for at least a half hour.</li>
            <li> I usually use it along with another vitamin C serum that I have, my toner and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> When I hit my late 30&#x27;s, (I just turned 40!)</li>
            <li> The texture of this is very thick and couldn&#x27;t get the rest of the product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I do see some results but nothing dramatic.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizer just wasn&#x27;t cutting it, anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with products that were not.</li>
            <li> I hate giving bad reviews but this serum did nothing for me , it feels like water</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My skin feels so fresh and smooth.  Wonderful product. Has cleared bothersome spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product takes the puffiness away from around my eyes.  It almost immediately made my skin feel firmer and the fine lines are disappearing.  This really works.</li>
            <li> This product is superior to all other serums I have used in the past. I can actually see and feel the benefits to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is smoother and younger looking. My fine lines have visibly improved,  especially around my mouth.  Several years ago I had a spot on my face treated with a laser.  The spot did not improve -- until now!!!!!!! This Hyaluronic Acid Serum is working. The spot is is almost gone. I am using it twice a day and can&#x27;t believe my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome Product!!!!! I recommend it to Everyone.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a week, but I already notice a difference in the texture, tone, quality, and clarity of my skin, as well as fine lines around my eyes and forehead becoming less noticeable. It does spread well, so I&#x27;ve started using a little less at each application because after one week it seems like it&#x27;s going fast. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get results.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a whole lot of difference in the skin, although it FEELS a little softer.  Wrinkles still look the same.</li>
            <li> exceptional results especially on my face. I applied as directed and discovered my face was a soft and moist at the end of the day even though I live in a very cold climate. I will purchase the complete line and I appreciate the value.</li>
            <li> First I must say, this is a great seller, I will do business with them again and I have posted their information on my Facebook for my friends to use them. Thank you for the fast service, the great prices and the speedy delivery!&lt;br /&gt;The product is great. I have seen a wonderful difference in the fine lines, as they are almost gone. The deep wrinkles now seem more like fine lines. My skin tone is more even. I have used this product for 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I was born and raised in Phoenix Arizona, and lived there till just this year. Growing up in that he&#x27;s and sun exposure will mess up your skin regardless if u use good sun screen. On top of that for the past 25 years I walk from 4 to 10 miles a day, outside. So being almost 56, with all that sun exposure, you know I had skin damage.&lt;br /&gt;I do believe in aging naturally. I am not against plastic surgery, but its not for me. So I have tried many products as have my friends. From stuff that cost under 10. 00 to stuff that cost over 100.00. I&#x27;ve tried foods and every natural thing that someone claimed helped with wrinkles. At no avail!&lt;br /&gt;I seen Dr. Oz talking about the combination of hyaluronic acid and Vit c. After the results I seen on that show, I set out to find and try some for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I did find it all over the internet, at prices that I was just not willing to try. Then I hit on Amazon, and this company was in the line up.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t beat the price of just under 13.00 But to my surprise they had a special going on, buy one get one free. And free shipping! What a deal.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who really wants  help with the problem of wrinkles, fine and deep.&lt;br /&gt;We all know that we are going to age, and wrinkles are a part of life. But this product helps to diminish them. Very worth your time and money.&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day. In the morning, i wash my face very well, and pat dry. I apply the Raw Biology Hyaluronic Acid +Vit C. I let stand on my face 15 minutes, then I add coconut oil on top of that, and I don&#x27;t not apply sun block for at least a half hour. I go about my day.&lt;br /&gt;At night after my shower I exfoliate with a face stub, rince well, pat dry and apply my Raw Hyaluronic Acid+Vit C. Again I let set for about 15 minutes. I again apply coconut oil and let that sit for a half hour. Then I add a wonderful lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Everyday I see improvements! My friends and family ask me why I look so healthy! And I have to tell them about this amazing product and company.&lt;br /&gt;Best of loving yourself here at a great bargain! Plus I am a smoker..&lt;br /&gt;Simply put,,worth the 13.00 !&lt;br /&gt;Peacely sun block for at least a half hour. I go about my day.  At night after my shower I exfoliate with a face stub, rince well, pat dry and apply my Raw Hyaluronic Acid+Vit C. Again I let set for about 15 minutes.

            <li> I have been paying 3X more for these products from a med spa so I&#x27;m happy to see them available on Amazon for this price. My skin has never looked better. Thanks</li>
            <li> I can see where my skin looks dewy and glistens after using by his regularly.  The best way I can say to apply this is while your face is still wet apply moisturizer and then this serum after.</li>
            <li> After using this product for one month, I do think I see a reduction of the fine wrinkles on my cheeks. I can&#x27;t see a difference around my eyes yet. Will update when I do.</li>
            <li> Just starting to use the product...., so far it seems to be doing a good job very light weight and goes on very smooth! Am looking forward to see the great results!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!!  My face feels smooth and fresh and after a week of use, I SWEAR I can see a difference.. Going to get another bottle, and one for my mom too!!  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Raw Biology Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C to anyone who wants a premium product at an affordable price. My skin looks and feels amazing!  Gone is the dry winter skin that so many of us suffer from this time of year.  By the way, I am 57 years old.  I am pleased that the normal signs of aging have lessened in appearance since using this product.  I think you will be pleased with the results, too.</li>
            <li> I love it. It is not tacky like many serums. Super fast shipping</li>
            <li> I originally bought this item for my mother and she loves it. She&#x27;s 58 years old and says that within less than a week she noticed lessened signs of aging (fine lines and wrinkles) and a reduction of puffiness under her eyes. Upon her suggestion, I have incorporated this serum into my own skincare routine and have noticed improved moisturization despite the winter dryness I normally struggle with. This product was also affordable and arrived very quickly. My mother and I both highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived yesterday surprisingly quick. Thank you... I was eager to get started:)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Hyaluronic Acid with Vitamin C last night and this morning, and so far it feels wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs quickly and completely and leaves my skin very smooth, plump and polished.&lt;br /&gt;I will update after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Arrived very speedily and was well packaged. The product itself is a pleasure to use as it&#x27;s not tacky like others. It works very well with my open pores and the fine lines that are slowly invading my face. All in all a good, natural product.</li>
            <li> I love this product I order it over and over again.  It goes on smooth and makes your skin feel wonderful.   I would definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I hate giving bad reviews but this serum did nothing for me , it feels like water nothing woow, my skin feels the same didn&#x27;t help with the dark circles I used every single day until the bottle was done and nothing , thank god I didn&#x27;t pay more for this</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference with this Hyaluronic acid. Makes skin feel so taught</li>
            <li> When I hit my late 30&#x27;s, (I just turned 40!) my skin began to change. Moisturizer just wasn&#x27;t cutting it, anymore. So, I did some research and found that HA serum, Retinal serum, and Vitamin C were imperative!&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve tried many different HA serums~some aren&#x27;t very.. potent, some clog your pores, and others are scented! Raw Biology doesn&#x27;t fit in ANY of those categories! Their HA serum is extremely potent, isn&#x27;t greasy &amp; absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;  I use it every night after cleansing + toning. (a couple drops cover your entire face &amp; neck) After, I allow it to soak in for a good 10min., I apply a couple drops each of Raw Biology&#x27;s Retinal serum &amp; Vitamin C serum. Then, I apply coconut oil or moisturizer, to get the full hydrating benefit of the Serums. In the morning, I use the HA serum before I put on my make up. it leaves my skin soft and primed.&lt;br /&gt; All in All? I truly am impressed with Raw Biology&#x27;s HA serum + their other products. I will be purchasing more as I run out!!!&lt;br /&gt; *i received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. I never guarantee 5 stars</li>
            <li> Just received and already feel like my pores are clean &amp; that soapy film is gone. Great product. Great price for  the high quality. I really thought this would be an average product. It actually is a high end product that does make a big difference.</li>
            <li> When I received this product there was a card from Raw Biology stating that their three products, the Hyaluronic Acid, the Vitamin C, and the Retinol Serums are all anyone would need for their skin.  I have used this product for a few weeks now and love it.  I have tried many many products and believe Raw Biology&#x27;s claim, without yet having tried the other two serums.  Give this a try and you will agree with me.  My skin is soft and the fine lines are diminishing.  Thank you!  I am going to order the Retinol today!</li>
            <li> I could tell a big difference since using hyaluronic acid for a week. Mybskin texture feels tighter and more toned. I could tell a difference on my forehead the most. However, I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it comes in a bottle with a dropper. The texture of this is very thick and couldn&#x27;t get the rest of the product out of the bottle. It goes rather quickly also. I used about a third a dropper morning and night and used it all in two weeks. I have since switched to another brand that comes in a jar and is a thinner texture and am loving it. I love the idea of what the hyaluronic acid does for the skin, just not this particular brand.</li>
            <li> First off I will say this is a great seller to buy from! I have purchased two orders from this seller &amp; I have received them both very quickly! This product is wonderful. I have been using it, in combination with a derma roller, &amp; I am definitely seeing a difference in my skin! I can tell there has already been a reduction in the dreaded crows feet! I have only been using this for a few weeks so I am excited to see how this works in the long run.</li>
            <li> I especially like this product for the fine lines around my lips.  I apply it at night and just before my make up; so my lips feel fuller.  The tiny lines when plumped up take years off of my face.</li>
            <li> Being of olive skinned tone I&#x27;m prone to dark circle under my eyes and deep &amp;#34;laugh lines&amp;#34; all over my face, in a couple of weeks of using hyaluronic acid serum I have noticed that the lines are finer and my dark circles have almost disappeared.... I have used all three of your serums and can honestly say that your product not only works but has made a great difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I now use much less make up than I have ever used before, and my skin not only feels great but looks great also.julia</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was a kid. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is high quality and packaged well. Shipping was fast and I like what it&#x27;s doing for my skin. It was important to me that this it is made in the United States. I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with products that were not.</li>
            <li> This is part 1 of a 3 part skin care system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First you use the hyalauronic acid serum in the clear bottle. It helps to restore the hyaluronic acid your body used to make but slowly stopped producing as you got older. Next you use the Retinol in the blue bottle. Last you use the Vitamin C product in the green bottle. When you&#x27;re using this combination you no longer need any other skin care products! And use this twice each day (assuming you have a pre-bed routine). Don&#x27;t forget to use each product on your neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased product review.</li>
            <li> Raw biology makes the best serums and this blend of vitamin c and hyaluronic acid is the best of the best. It makes my skin soft and the texture has improved a great deal. I am noticing less breakouts and my fine lines and wrinkles are less noticeable. I always use this after I wash my face on damp skin so it glides In perfectly. Will buy more when this runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for a honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Love it. Goes on smooth..feels good and good results..</li>
            <li> Just love the way  this makes my skin feel...can  almost &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34;  my pores tightening up!</li>
            <li> Omg I just placed this order on march 6 it is march 9 and I already have my order . very fast service . I&#x27;m very pleased . thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a few weeks so don&#x27;t know exactly what it is doing for my skin but my skin is feeling soft and nice.  I have ordered another bottle to see where this is taking me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a little over a week and already notice some positive results! I am a 36 year old female and have had issues with dryness, dull looking skin and dark circles under my eyes, especially in the last couple of years. After using this product just one time, I noticed my skin felt smoother and much more softer to the touch. Now, after just little over a week, I have noticed that my skin appears more radiant and moisturized longer and it also appears to have reduced the appearance of my dark circles underneath my eyes. I usually use it along with another vitamin C serum that I have, my toner and moisturizer. I also noticed that it seems to be making my skin appear more even color/tone better than what I was using before and I believe I will continue to see more results over time. I have had a couple of my friends try this and they too really like it. My one girlfriend has super sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use very much on her skin without having a reaction. With this serum, it smoothed out her skin, and I could even tell the difference after a couple uses on her as it seemed to be reducing the size of the marks in her face from previous blemishes. I would definitely recommend this to others and will probably continue to use this as well as some other products I have tried that I really like. My skin seems to do better when I switch products every now and then as I think one&#x27;s skin &amp;#34;gets used to&amp;#34; something after a while. Plus, with their 100% guarantee, you have nothing to lose and can tell that this company truely stands behind their products! I received this product at a promotional rate in exchange for my honest review/opinion.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks better.  I do see some results but nothing dramatic.  I think I need to use it longer.  Hoping for better results as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Great product, love it!</li>
            <li> This Profesional Product arrived very quickly. I was impressed by the competitive price offered and the ease of use. It&#x27;s ingredients are pretty impressive as well. Ingredients include organic aloe, organic jojoba oil, greentea, geranium essential oil, vitamin c, among others.  When I applied it to my face initially it felt cool and moist. I&#x27;m also impressed that it practices safe testing and animals are not harmed. I look forward to seeing the results promised I will definitely update you after a trial period. Other reviewed are good, so I am expecting good results.  I also will be applying their Vitamin C serum as suggested after I use this serum. Darkness under my eyes as well as smile lines are what I&#x27;m Looking Forward To Correcting. Other customers have said that they received great results in these two areas. I&#x27;m confident that I will also.</li>
            <li> This product is nice and thick and applies very smoothly over my face. I love the large size. There is a slight tingle after application, but that just lets me know its working. I will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Superb quality. I ordered another version of this serum from a different seller originally and let me tell you , the quality and texture of this serum is outstanding compared to other brands. Sooooo worth the money ! Great moisturizing ability without being heavy or oily . Perfect for oily skin and warm weather. Extremely lightweight . I highly recommend .  My laugh lines have disappears from using this and Argan oil for the past eight weeks. Happy !!</li>
