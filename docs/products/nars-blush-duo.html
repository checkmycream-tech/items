            <li>I&#x27;m a redhead and this combination works perfectly for my color pallette.  </li>
            <li>LOVE!!!!</li>
            <li>This is the best.</li>
            <li>Laguna is the perfect shade of brown and Orgasm is the perfect blush.</li>
            <li>perfect combo for my skin.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, came on time and in tact.  </li>
            <li>I was in a store where they were doing make overs, and the woman doing them said my blush was perfect.  </li>
            <li>Orgasm pairs beautifully with laguna and is probably the best blush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Laguna is an excellent shade of bronzer and is also great for contouring.</li>
            <li>Great color palette and perfect for traveling</li>
            <li>But for me, it is ideal.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been so happy with my choice in cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Great blush combo.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I heard great reviews on it.</li>
            <li>Both the orgasm blush and laguna bronzer are great.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Colors are great and it&#x27;s long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>The orgasm/laguna is perfect for creating a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>Orgasm is the most wonderful blush I have ever used.</li>
            <li>it is beautiful and works with all warm colors.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s gorgeous depending on what look you&#x27;re going for-</li>
            <li>This product is good for all lighter skin tones.</li>
            <li>Price wise, E.L.F. is $3 and NARS is $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the pan and swatched on your hand, both appear to have shimmer.</li>
            <li>Loved the color of this product and how it looked.</li>
            <li>and I think price wise</li>
            <li>I love their makeup artist Carmindy and she always has great suggestions.</li>
            <li>Thank you guys so much I love my make up!</li>
            <li>I love makeup but have always struggled with contour and blush!</li>
            <li>Applies flawlessly and really pretty colors.  </li>
            <li>The color combo is perfect - every bronzer needs a little brightener at times and the Orgasm color goes perfectly with the bronzer.</li>
            <li>Nice, but ZERO coverage.</li>
            <li>NARS&#x27; Orgasm really is the most beatiful blush on the market...&amp; works perfectly with every skintone.</li>
            <li>goes on very easy and weightless.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s good as I have a light complexion.</li>
            <li>Also, the Laguna did not tonally change my foundation look, which is very important to me.</li>

            <li>HUGE FAN!</li>
            <li>I very much love the Laguna Bronzer but find myself not evening needing the Orgasm blush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Gives you a tanned/bronzed healthy appearance&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>I love Nars blush/bronzer.  </li>
            <li>I love this duo.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure this is intentional on E.L.F&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even describe how much I love this bush/ bronzing duo.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the third time that I&#x27;m buying this product and it&#x27;s still the best!</li>
            <li>Love the peachy Orgasm</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase. :)</li>
            <li>It makes your neck look more defined.  </li>
            <li>do very much prefer the Cargo Bronzers, but this was equally good as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks fantastic on :)</li>
            <li>Nothing clown-like about it and excellent quality as can be expected with the NARS brand.</li>
            <li>The NARS Laguna felt more precise.</li>
            <li>The NARS Laguna felt more precise.</li>
            <li>I personally loved the pigments in both and highly recommend both products!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money and love the free shipping!</li>
            <li>The bronzer is easy to use under check bone to show definition.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo2HRHC5CT6RLPM]]This a great product I felt that the only way to convey this was through my video review</li>
            <li>The ELF blush and contour didn&#x27;t look very nice, since the ELF contour color is so yellow.</li>
            <li>The ELF blush and contour didn&#x27;t look very nice, since the ELF contour color is so yellow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Skin Custom Glow Blush &amp; Bronzer in Natural Glow, and then top off with a light dusting of NARS&#x27; Orgasm.</li>
            <li>I use the Orgasm, love love love the name, on my upper cheeks.  </li>
            <li>Perfect colors for all occasions-you can glam it up for the night life, or wear it daily for a natural look.</li>
            <li>gorgeous colour, application is smooth and shimmer is not too obvious.</li>
            <li>Love it because it suits very well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Now that is cool for an inept woman huh?</li>
            <li>This duo makes it so easy for an amateur like me to do beautiful contouring and highlighting.</li>
            <li>everything was taken care of on the same day, such a great shopping experience and they care about their customers!</li>
            <li>The ELF product is very powdery and transfers to a brush easily.</li>
            <li>I do reach for this often-it complements many skin types-and high quality NARS makeup for the loyal fans-it does contain minute amounts of sparkle for those that need to be aware of this (those of us over 40)-</li>
            <li>Very natural and perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li>To me this is a good thing, because I found that the ELF powder was so soft, that it was easy to over-apply it, and to apply it in places I didn&#x27;t necessarily want it to be.</li>
            <li>it is worth it to buy one container of each instead of just the combo.</li>
            <li>Applies the right amount of color and distributes evenly.</li>
            <li>I wish now that I had just bought the Laguna bronzer by itself since it would have been cheaper, and in general the Orgasm is NOT my favorite blush.</li>

            <li>(Deep Throat is nice, not as much glitter or brightness).</li>
            <li>(Deep Throat is nice, not as much glitter or brightness).</li>
            <li>I have never been quite happy with how muddy and muffled blush looks on my skin, and it&#x27;s so hard to find the right color for my skin.</li>
            <li>It was my first time trying NARS products</li>
            <li>I love the Laguna bronzer, I&#x27;ve had it since last summer</li>
            <li>Love NARS Orgasm blush &amp; have been using it since discovering it several years ago.</li>
            <li>so you could actually see how much I love this product.</li>
            <li>So my first day trying the trick, I blotted it on my sweater.  </li>
            <li>and I find myself wearing less makeup overall because it really looks so beautiful.</li>
            <li>The blush is very pinky-pink</li>
            <li>By midafternoon my eyes looked very grody</li>
            <li>My advice would be to TRY the E.L.F. if you can get it cheap locally, and see how you like it before you fork out $50 for a NARS palette.  </li>

            <li>I was told about this product by a very \\&quot;ept\\&quot; friend.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*E.L.F.&#x27;s blush is so pretty and natural looking!</li>
            <li>However I was out of the bronzer within about 2 months of using the product, and I still have a significant amount of blush left.</li>
            <li>However the longevity of the ELF blush is pretty short.</li>
            <li>Use in conjunction with Benefit&#x27;s High Beam on the upper cheekbone and eyebrow ridge for a lovely glow all year round!</li>
            <li>At first, I was apprehensive about trying out this duo because I have very porcelain skin and thought it might be too dark or clownish looking.</li>
            <li>NARS&#x27; Orgasm is a very long-lasting product but as you can see it is nowhere near the same color family as the ELF blush.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how the color looked so natural on my skin.</li>
            <li>You din&#x27;t need much just a couple of strokes on the cheek and instantly makes the face look slim!</li>
            <li>I feel professionally made up when I wear these tones</li>
            <li>I have a light olive skin tone (not by any means pale, though).</li>
            <li>Love the subtly of color and the quality of the makeup.</li>
            <li>Slightly spendy, but worth EVERY penny</li>
            <li>When I used the Orgasm/Laguna duo, the Orgasm&#x27;s pink color on my lids really brought out the fact that I have redness in my skin.</li>

            <li> HUGE FAN! It was my first time trying NARS products but I am a big makeup connoisseur, usually using MAC products for years until i tried something different. I have a light olive skin tone (not by any means pale, though). The bronzer works perfectly for my skin. The blush is very pinky-pink but it&#x27;s gorgeous depending on what look you&#x27;re going for- it is dramatic.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Orgasm/Laguna Duo. I very much love the Laguna Bronzer but find myself not evening needing the Orgasm blush.&lt;br /&gt;I do very much prefer the Cargo Bronzers, but this was equally good as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasting Power: 4-6 Hours (Without Primer)&lt;br /&gt;Color: Not Orange! Gives you a tanned/bronzed healthy appearance&lt;br /&gt;How long does the powder last? I&#x27;ve been using it everyday since September 2011..so a long time!</li>
            <li> At first, I was apprehensive about trying out this duo because I have very porcelain skin and thought it might be too dark or clownish looking. I was pleasantly surprised how the color looked so natural on my skin. Laguna is an excellent shade of bronzer and is also great for contouring. Orgasm pairs beautifully with laguna and is probably the best blush I&#x27;ve ever used. It gives a radiant glow and touch of color without being too overdone. This is definetly a must-have product, one that I can&#x27;t imagine being without now. Well worth the money and love the free shipping!</li>
            <li> Still the best bronzer/blush I&#x27;ve ever used. Applies the right amount of color and distributes evenly. Love the subtly of color and the quality of the makeup. Will never use anything else!</li>
            <li> This is the only blush/bronzer I use everyday. I love the Laguna bronzer, I&#x27;ve had it since last summer and I still haven&#x27;t hit pan. You din&#x27;t need much just a couple of strokes on the cheek and instantly makes the face look slim!</li>
            <li> I do reach for this often-it complements many skin types-and high quality NARS makeup for the loyal fans-it does contain minute amounts of sparkle for those that need to be aware of this (those of us over 40)- so I usually wear it for indoor use or nighttime events.  I used it once on a sunny day and I was glittering!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after watching an episode of What Not To Wear on TLC. I love their makeup artist Carmindy and she always has great suggestions. This product is good for all lighter skin tones. I put a bit of the bronzer (Laguna) around my outer forehead and my upper cheekbone and then brush the blush (orgasm) on my entire cheekbone in a sweeping motion and it just gives a slight glow without going overboard. It looks like you were kissed by the sun! And that&#x27;s good as I have a light complexion. Use in conjunction with Benefit&#x27;s High Beam on the upper cheekbone and eyebrow ridge for a lovely glow all year round!</li>
            <li> I love Nars blush/bronzer.  And it lasts! I used it everyday for 3 years, and now it&#x27;s almost gone, so I will reorder it.  The orgasm/laguna is perfect for creating a healthy glow.  I use the bronzer color all over and the pink on my cheeks (sometimes eyelids too).</li>
            <li> Even though the make up arrived broken as soon as I notified them everything was taken care of on the same day, such a great shopping experience and they care about their customers! Thank you guys so much I love my make up! It looks fantastic on :) I&#x27;m very pleased!!!</li>
            <li> Great color palette and perfect for traveling</li>
            <li> Love NARS Orgasm blush &amp; have been using it since discovering it several years ago. The bronzer in this duo is a little too brown for my skintone. I&#x27;ll stick with Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Skin Custom Glow Blush &amp; Bronzer in Natural Glow, and then top off with a light dusting of NARS&#x27; Orgasm. NARS&#x27; Orgasm really is the most beatiful blush on the market...&amp; works perfectly with every skintone.</li>
            <li> The color combo is perfect - every bronzer needs a little brightener at times and the Orgasm color goes perfectly with the bronzer. I feel professionally made up when I wear these tones</li>
            <li> Nice, but ZERO coverage.</li>
            <li> This blush can&#x27;t be beat. I love this duo. The bronzer is easy to use under check bone to show definition. The orgasm blush is peach with gold flakes it is beautiful and works with all warm colors.</li>
            <li> I purchased this months ago and am STILL using the blush part-have already gone through the bronzer!  Perfect colors for all occasions-you can glam it up for the night life, or wear it daily for a natural look. Nothing clown-like about it and excellent quality as can be expected with the NARS brand. Slightly spendy, but worth EVERY penny</li>
            <li> Best combo EVER! gorgeous colour, application is smooth and shimmer is not too obvious. I&#x27;m not surprised this compact keeps smashing the review charts! Perfect!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2HRHC5CT6RLPM]]This a great product I felt that the only way to convey this was through my video review so you could actually see how much I love this product.</li>
            <li> like the color and case</li>
            <li> Lots of people say that E.L.F&#x27;s \\&quot;highlight and contour\\&quot; is a dupe for NARS&#x27; Laguna/Orgasm duo. Truly, they are not even close, in formula or color. I have uploaded a customer image of them side by side to show you just how they differ. Price wise, E.L.F. is $3 and NARS is $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the pan and swatched on your hand, both appear to have shimmer. This is because when you did that, you probably used your finger, which practically acts like a shovel.  They have incredibly similar packaging and I&#x27;m sure this is intentional on E.L.F&#x27;s part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*E.L.F.&#x27;s blush is so pretty and natural looking! On your hand it may appear to be sparkly but on your face it won&#x27;t be. (Use a fluffy brush, not one with compact bristles, to avoid the glitter effect). However the longevity of the ELF blush is pretty short. I don&#x27;t notice it still on my face when I leave work. NARS&#x27; Orgasm is a very long-lasting product but as you can see it is nowhere near the same color family as the ELF blush. I find Orgasm to be a glitterbomb on me for daytime use. I do find it&#x27;s less so if I use a very fluffy brush to apply it, however I can still see bits of glitter in my pores (especially as the day wears on). This for me is a nighttime or evening color, or one I wear only if I plan on being out just for a little bit. I will say though that when I have tested the Orgasm blush through a day of work, it was still there when I went home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The contour colors may appear to be similar but in use, they are nothing alike. The ELF product has a yellow cast to it, which tends to affect how my foundation looks throughout the course of the day. The ELF product is very powdery and transfers to a brush easily. NARS&#x27; Laguna highlighter has a less powdery formula, very firm, and you have to use a stiffer contour brush to apply it. To me this is a good thing, because I found that the ELF powder was so soft, that it was easy to over-apply it, and to apply it in places I didn&#x27;t necessarily want it to be. The NARS Laguna felt more precise. Also, the Laguna did not tonally change my foundation look, which is very important to me. I&#x27;m pasty-pale, I probably shouldn&#x27;t even be playing with bronzer, but I have been and I don&#x27;t want it to look like war paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I used the blush products on my eyelids as a base, and the contour colors on my crease, for a cohesive &#x60;natural&#x27; look. This worked well with the ELF blush and NARS Laguna contour. The ELF blush and contour didn&#x27;t look very nice, since the ELF contour color is so yellow. By midafternoon my eyes looked very grody and I had to fix it with another color. When I used the Orgasm/Laguna duo, the Orgasm&#x27;s pink color on my lids really brought out the fact that I have redness in my skin. It looked horrible. The ELF blush and Laguna bronzer though, paired nicely.&lt;br /&gt;In no way, shape or form are these two palettes interchangeable for each other, no matter what you read elsewhere. Just look at the color differences in the photos, and imagine just how different they are on your face!  My advice would be to TRY the E.L.F. if you can get it cheap locally, and see how you like it before you fork out $50 for a NARS palette.  I wish now that I had just bought the Laguna bronzer by itself since it would have been cheaper, and in general the Orgasm is NOT my favorite blush. (Deep Throat is nice, not as much glitter or brightness). I keep both of these palettes because I like the blush from E.L.F. and the Laguna from NARS.it to be. The NARS Laguna felt more precise.

            <li> I can&#x27;t even describe how much I love this bush/ bronzing duo. Orgasm is the most wonderful blush I have ever used. I have never been quite happy with how muddy and muffled blush looks on my skin, and it&#x27;s so hard to find the right color for my skin. The colors of the blush and bronzer are perfect for me. This duo makes it so easy for an amateur like me to do beautiful contouring and highlighting. A little bit goes a long way with this pair and I find myself wearing less makeup overall because it really looks so beautiful. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been so happy with my choice in cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Loved the color of this product and how it looked. Unfortunately, my skin did not agree, and it gave me one of the worst breakouts I have had in a long time.  Would have been one of my go-to makeup products if not for the breakouts.</li>
            <li> Great blush combo.  I&#x27;m a redhead and this combination works perfectly for my color pallette.  Blush stays on throughout the day.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> LOVE!!!! I love makeup but have always struggled with contour and blush! This is the best. Laguna is the perfect shade of brown and Orgasm is the perfect blush. If you are thinking of getting this--- just DO IT!!</li>
            <li> Color looks natural but has a little sparkle for the cheek color.  The bronzer is very sheer and also looks natural.  Would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Very natural and perfect for everyday use. goes on very easy and weightless. love it. perfect combo for my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the third time that I&#x27;m buying this product and it&#x27;s still the best! Love it because it suits very well with my skin tone. Love the peachy Orgasm</li>
            <li> I bought this because I heard great reviews on it. I personally loved the pigments in both and highly recommend both products! However I was out of the bronzer within about 2 months of using the product, and I still have a significant amount of blush left. I would definitely get the bronzer separately in the bigger size next time.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, came on time and in tact.  Applies flawlessly and really pretty colors.  I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase. :)</li>
            <li> Both the orgasm blush and laguna bronzer are great. However, these are fairly small quantities and I think price wise it is worth it to buy one container of each instead of just the combo. Additionally, since I personally use bronzer all over my face and swipe a little on my neck and collar bones, but just put blush on the apples of my cheeks, I used up all the bronzer while only about 1/3 of my way through the blush - so again, I will just buy individual containers of each in the future.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Colors are great and it&#x27;s long-lasting.  I told all my friends about it but it turns out they all already use it.</li>
            <li> Now I am not saying that anyone who uses this product does it because they are inept.  I was told about this product by a very \\&quot;ept\\&quot; friend.  But for me, it is ideal.  I use the Orgasm, love love love the name, on my upper cheeks.  And I use the Laguna for the hollows of my cheeks.  Then I use the laguna to shade from each side under my chin.  That is the secret trick.  Maybe you know it but I did not.  It makes your neck look more defined.  Now another piece of advise.  After you apply the laguna to your neck, take a tissue and blot the excess.  You probably knew that, but I did not.  So my first day trying the trick, I blotted it on my sweater.  I was in a store where they were doing make overs, and the woman doing them said my blush was perfect.  Now that is cool for an inept woman huh?</li>
