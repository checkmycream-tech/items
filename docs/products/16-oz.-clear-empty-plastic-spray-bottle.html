            <li>It is perfect!</li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>Prompt shipping, nice bottle, thank you!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This product works great.</li>
            <li>Good quality &amp; Good value</li>
            <li>It is a good water bottle.</li>
            <li>Check the dimensions in the FAQs to make sure it&#x27;s the size you want.</li>
            <li>Maybe you saw this one, liked it, but wondered if it&#x27;s too good to be true, since the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I paid about $4.50, which I thought was higher priced for a spray bottle, but I think it&#x27;s a fair price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good, though.</li>
            <li>Just the right size to use for our glass top tables, granite counters, etc.</li>
            <li>star because a slightly longer neck would make gripping it a bit easier; or a contoured top piece to fit in your grip more comfortably.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Very durable.</li>
            <li>Okay for squirting, but no amount of twisting and fiddling with the sprayer nozzle results in a wide spray.</li>
            <li>This spry is not bad and works correctly but after some day that I bought it, I saw the exactly the same one in the one dollar store...</li>
            <li>Easy to operate &amp; mists lightly with bigger puffs than i would have expected.</li>
            <li>Nozzle adjusts to a rather voluminous mist or a single strong stream.</li>
            <li>Well, worry no more, because I&#x27;ve been using several of them for some time and been very pleased.</li>
            <li>The construction of the bottle is also noticeably better than any sprayer I&#x27;ve bought for less at local department stores.  </li>
            <li>Wish I would have purchased a few more to have as a back up in case this one breaks.  </li>
            <li>works great for my dogs when they are bad.</li>

            <li> works great for my dogs when they are bad.</li>
            <li> Use it for our homemade glass cleaner (50% alcohol solution, 50% water and a few drops of dish soap) which we use becuase my wife is sensitive to ammonia.</li>
            <li> (it was too long when it arrived, so didn&#x27;t draw well), but that was a simple task with ordinary scissors.</li>
            <li> Yeah, does the job, but if u wanna use it for bonsai, I recommend the ones with extra dispenser in the front to poor water in addition to spraying it.</li>
            <li> The postman shoved it into a tight mailbox and it still survived!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda hard on things and this will be going out in the barn.  </li>
            <li> It was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> I did have to trim the inner hose so that it just reached the base</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
            <li> You might have been searching for something to use when spritzing the ironing, but shudder at the ugly and high-center-of-gravity spray bottles sold at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> This is item is terrible.</li>

            <li> Good quality &amp; Good value</li>
            <li> Very durable. The postman shoved it into a tight mailbox and it still survived! It is a good water bottle.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate &amp; mists lightly with bigger puffs than i would have expected. Hasn&#x27;t fallen apart despite 3 weeks of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> It is perfect! Exactly what I needed. I used it to spray my cat to keep her away from our Christmas tree.</li>
            <li> This is item is terrible. It was broken when I received it. Don&#x27;t buy this item.</li>
            <li> This spry is not bad and works correctly but after some day that I bought it, I saw the exactly the same one in the one dollar store...So it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
            <li> There is no Mist adjustment on this bottle.  It gets close and then the nozzle closes. Works for what I need it for just tends to overspray for my use.</li>
            <li> I thought it had different spray settings but with my body oil it is only a stream not a mist</li>
            <li> This product works great. The dimensions with the nozzle are 3.25&amp;#34; x 8&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Works as described!  Perfect.</li>
            <li> Nozzle adjusts to a rather voluminous mist or a single strong stream. The bottle is actually bigger than I anticipated. Check the dimensions in the FAQs to make sure it&#x27;s the size you want. However, with the volume of water it puts out, a larger body is almost necessary to prevent constant refilling. The construction of the bottle is also noticeably better than any sprayer I&#x27;ve bought for less at local department stores.  I paid about $4.50, which I thought was higher priced for a spray bottle, but I think it&#x27;s a fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -1 star because a slightly longer neck would make gripping it a bit easier; or a contoured top piece to fit in your grip more comfortably.</li>

Meanwhile, it works like a charm and hasn&#x27;t worn out or anything, so... five stars!</li>
