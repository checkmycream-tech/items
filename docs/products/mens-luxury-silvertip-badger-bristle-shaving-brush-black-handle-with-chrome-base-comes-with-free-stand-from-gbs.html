    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This works wonderful</li>
            <li>Best buy of all badger brushes on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Best brush at this price point.  </li>
            <li>The brush itself has a nice heft to it, and the handle has excellent weight so that there is no concern about the brush tipping over when it sits upright on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it has been great.  </li>
            <li>Great silver tip badger brush.</li>
            <li>Feels great on the face.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve used it for some time, I think I can write a fair review.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t in good conscience recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I am know see why people pay a lot of money for a good brush.  </li>
            <li>others are dirt cheap, and VERY good.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s best for medium to large hands.</li>
            <li>The GBS brush looks nice and works well.</li>
            <li>It is the softest one I own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It felt fine on the face, and was quick, with very good lather, and warm water retention.</li>
            <li>There was a bit of a odor when I first opened it, but this isn&#x27;t uncommon.</li>
            <li>The diameter of the brush&#x27;s handle is significantly greater than can be accommodated by most brush/razor holders.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can get a better quality product for lower price</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I like this product as the hair is very full and to date no hair loss .</li>
            <li>Brush is soft and lathers amazingly!  </li>
            <li>It is very sharp looking and performs beautifully!</li>
            <li>The brush diameter is perfect for the average face, has a great luxorious feel, lathers well and provides nice firm pressure against your face.</li>
            <li>Huge difference from the one I started with.</li>
            <li>Also, the plastic holder for the brush is so light and the brush</li>
            <li>The quality is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use canned, or cheap shave cream that might have badger hair harming chemicals in</li>
            <li>I think it is a great value for the price and might get a second one.</li>
            <li>the amazon website said this brush came with a chrome stand and I got a cheap plastic one instead.  </li>
            <li>Transforms the tedium of the morning shave into an important ritual.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, absorb water well, and have allowed me to work up a good lather in my shaving bowl.  </li>
            <li>Customer service from this company is superior above the rest as well.</li>
            <li>For VDH soap, try a full 45 seconds (for 3+ shave passes) of brush loading, and then go to cup/bowl, or face lather.</li>
            <li>It has a good low smell.</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase considering the cost of other brushes.</li>
            <li>Lost one or two bristles on the first use, but it turned out fine.</li>
            <li>It really creates a nice lather easily, and it is soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend super heating it.</li>
            <li>Still it has tremendous support.</li>
            <li>I want to love this brush for the price, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is as high quality as it claims to be.</li>
            <li>Accurate description fast shipping</li>
            <li>All these beat the popular English</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Real Shave (Moisturizing variety) CREAM, is about $4 at the -marts. Tabac is high rated too; but I do not like the granny (NOT manly IMHO), Lavender \\&quot;top</li>
            <li>Based on quality I would recommend this brush and most other GBS products, but not being able to hang this well from a stand really is a bit of a concern</li>
            <li>This brush is bottom heavy from such a subtaintial handle, so when sitting it on the plastic stand, it tends to fall over if you don&#x27;t find a perfect balance for it.</li>
            <li>First off, the bristles have held up well.  </li>
            <li>This was clearly the best quality/dollar proposition of all the brushes I researched (and, as usual, I spent way too many hours researching this).</li>
            <li>no smell even when I first used it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You get exactly what you pay for here.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s heavy and feels good in the hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will get soft, creamy peaks, and far more slippery lather on your skin, this way.</li>
            <li>The parker brush is fuller , I did not think this possible as the GBS is in itself very full .</li>
            <li>A dozen or so manage to free themselves each time during the shaving process, and several more appear at the bottom of the wash bowl during the final rinse.</li>
            <li>Pretty much, this is a brush.  </li>
            <li>Especially when so many other silvertips cost so much more.</li>
            <li>Super soft and dense.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some bristles come out, but I feel it&#x27;s a pretty normal amount.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s real badger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I shampooed and conditioned it with a natural organic shampoo and conditioner and it was right as rain after that.</li>
            <li>I am no expert on shaving brush care, but seeing as all I do is rinse and gently wring it dry and hang from the included (albeit cheap) stand and it has become no worse for the wear, this is one quality item.</li>
            <li>And since the handle is too thick to fit into any of the heavier brush stands on the market, I&#x27;ve been stuck using the cheap plastic stand that came with</li>
            <li>I prefer this brush to the parker brand because this really is 100% Silvertip Badger hair and again is very soft.</li>
            <li>If I could choose again, I&#x27;d go with a high quality boar brush instead of the budget badger brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Faint, typical smell when wet, and a hot soak seemed like it may have been oiled a bit; but all that easily washed out, and it now smells like the mild VDH shave soap; with the badger smell, almost completely disappeared, after the first use.</li>
            <li>I soak the brush in hot water before use, thoroughly rinse after, and use the cheap little stand</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: Put some warm water, temporarily, on a hard soap; while the brush is soaking.</li>
            <li>Not scratchy either, and it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li>After doing way more research on shaving brushes and wet shaving tools than any sane person should, I came across enough people claiming that if you&#x27;re going to invest in a brush, it&#x27;s silvertip badger or bust.</li>
            <li>I washed it with Dawn briefly, and that hot water soak; before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No hairs lost.</li>
            <li>This was my 2nd brush and my first silvertip.  </li>
            <li>problem with hard soap lathering (always put two finger on top of your brush, and use the tips.)</li>
            <li>and Cella (not rock hard soap) is many folks tops; at about $10.</li>
            <li>After over two years, they are still soft and retain soap and water well.  </li>
            <li>; when dry, after the first use.</li>
            <li>Dont use too hot of water and only soak the tips of the hairs for 30 seconds or so prior to your shave.</li>
            <li>I have other brushes that took much more time before starting to loose hairs.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased a parker pure badger hair brush with a similar design (black/chrome).</li>
            <li>Yet it, didn&#x27;t feel to big; even though it&#x27;s big, and fast to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After seven months of near daily use, this brush is still solid, clean, and shows signs that it will last for much longer than any 40 dollar item usually does.  </li>
            <li>Body of the brush is much heavier than I had expected, giving it that feeling of quality and reliability.</li>
            <li>Apparently, that&#x27;s been an issue.</li>
            <li>After a lot of use, I&#x27;ve seen a minor hair speck, or 2; but this is normal.</li>
            <li>Yeah, that little logo rubbed right off, and with ease; but I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>Other than the first few uses, it has lost precious few hairs from the knot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s plastic rather than the elegant enamel of the brush&#x27; base, but it works fine for me.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the included stand looks and feels cheap in comparison to the brush.</li>
            <li>Mitchells Wool Fat (hard, english) is the defacto forum favorite; due to it&#x27;s performance, once worked-up well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on how well it holds up, but it is very comfortable and is easier to get a thick lather than other, more expensive brushes that I have used.</li>

            <li> My only real complaint about this brush is that it doesn&#x27;t fit in my Colonel Conk chrome shaving stand.</li>
            <li> The only con is that the printed logo did not last very long, but who cares.</li>
            <li> I was slightly worried it might be too soft; but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This little brush, bought nearly seven months ago, can make that claim.  </li>
            <li> I lose a few bristles per shave and it isn&#x27;t that soft.</li>
            <li> Not very high quality.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I can&#x27;t comment on any other hairs, since this is the only brush I have used.</li>
            <li> Always dry, and hang it brush-down.</li>
            <li> , unless your medicine cabinet contains a jar of \\&quot;Rogaine for badger bristles\\&quot;, it&#x27;s hard to see this particular product lasting more than a few months, which is of course quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> I carefully wash and dry it after each use.  </li>
            <li> I suspect that people who report losing bristles may have been wetting the entire length of the bristles instead of just the bottom half of the bristles.</li>
            <li> so heavy, it has constantly tipped over since day one.  </li>
            <li> Few purchases actually have the cumulative effect of improving your quality of life.</li>
            <li> you are doubting spending the money to make the transition to wet shaving, stop doubting and do it.</li>
            <li> , bristles are falling out of the handle at an alarming rate.</li>
            <li> If you do this and don&#x27;t be too rough when your building your lather, you shouldn&#x27;t lose one hair.</li>
            <li> After it&#x27;s loaded, add drops of water; after swirling (bowl, or face), and so you never get it overly wet</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that it did not fit in the stand it came with.</li>
            <li> I do keep it hunch upside down to dry.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to lose any hairs from this brush, but I did have a few that were hanging at an odd angle, so I just cut them back with a pair of scissors.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this brush a couple of years ago.  Now that I&#x27;ve used it for some time, I think I can write a fair review.  First off, the bristles have held up well.  After over two years, they are still soft and retain soap and water well.  Also it&#x27;s heavy and feels good in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again as the quality just isn&#x27;t there.  After two years, the bristles literally fell out of the handle.  The bristles are glued into a shallow dish, which in turn is glued into the handle.  The dish/bristles fell out of the handle.  I&#x27;ve reglued them into the handle, which may or may not last, but the fact remains this should not have happened.  Also, the plastic holder for the brush is so light and the brush so heavy, it has constantly tipped over since day one.  And since the handle is too thick to fit into any of the heavier brush stands on the market, I&#x27;ve been stuck using the cheap plastic stand that came with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t in good conscience recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This works wonderful but it seems to keep loosing hairs.  I have other brushes that took much more time before starting to loose hairs.  This is a wounderful brush but I am concerned about it&#x27;s longivity.</li>
            <li> 4x using it and it broke in half. The bristles separated from the handle. Could be just mine but for the average consumer be cautious.</li>
            <li> The bristles brush came unglued after about 1 month. I like the brush until that happened.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush since June and I&#x27;ve had zero issues.  I soak the brush in hot water before use, thoroughly rinse after, and use the cheap little stand it came with when not in use.  I&#x27;ve had some bristles come out, but I feel it&#x27;s a pretty normal amount.  All in all, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase considering the cost of other brushes.</li>
            <li> Few purchases actually have the cumulative effect of improving your quality of life. This little brush, bought nearly seven months ago, can make that claim.  The quality is fantastic. Body of the brush is much heavier than I had expected, giving it that feeling of quality and reliability. After doing way more research on shaving brushes and wet shaving tools than any sane person should, I came across enough people claiming that if you&#x27;re going to invest in a brush, it&#x27;s silvertip badger or bust. That being said, I can&#x27;t comment on any other hairs, since this is the only brush I have used. What I can comment on is that if there is anything that will beat silvertip badger, it&#x27;s probably too expensive and endangered for practical use. This truly transforms your shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seven months of near daily use, this brush is still solid, clean, and shows signs that it will last for much longer than any 40 dollar item usually does.  Other than the first few uses, it has lost precious few hairs from the knot. I am no expert on shaving brush care, but seeing as all I do is rinse and gently wring it dry and hang from the included (albeit cheap) stand and it has become no worse for the wear, this is one quality item. The only con is that the printed logo did not last very long, but who cares. The chrome still shine, the handle shows no signs of wear, and the bristles are still luxurious and make for a fin shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are doubting spending the money to make the transition to wet shaving, stop doubting and do it. It truly transforms any man&#x27;s morning routine from a rushed painful experience to an enjoyable ritual that makes you slow down and concentrate on yourself, even if for just 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Accurate description fast shipping</li>
            <li> The GBS brush looks nice and works well. The bristles are soft, absorb water well, and have allowed me to work up a good lather in my shaving bowl.  The brush itself has a nice heft to it, and the handle has excellent weight so that there is no concern about the brush tipping over when it sits upright on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the story doesn&#x27;t stop there, however.  Some caveats of which you should be aware:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The diameter of the brush&#x27;s handle is significantly greater than can be accommodated by most brush/razor holders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The chrome holder that comes \\&quot;free\\&quot; with this brush is of very poor quality; mine broke after one day of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Alas, after less than a month of regular duty (five shaves during the workweek, plus an occasional shave or two each weekend), bristles are falling out of the handle at an alarming rate. A dozen or so manage to free themselves each time during the shaving process, and several more appear at the bottom of the wash bowl during the final rinse. With this brush, cleaning up stray badger bristles has become the last part of my morning shaving ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, unless your medicine cabinet contains a jar of \\&quot;Rogaine for badger bristles\\&quot;, it&#x27;s hard to see this particular product lasting more than a few months, which is of course quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> I had some issues with hairs coming out but it turned out to be user error! Dont use too hot of water and only soak the tips of the hairs for 30 seconds or so prior to your shave. You do this to soften the bristles before applying your lather. If you do this and don&#x27;t be too rough when your building your lather, you shouldn&#x27;t lose one hair. Brush is soft and lathers amazingly!  Best buy of all badger brushes on Amazon. Customer service from this company is superior above the rest as well.</li>
            <li> I like the brush and it is all as described, I received it on time and I think I will order again from him.</li>
            <li> Yeah, that little logo rubbed right off, and with ease; but I don&#x27;t care. Just FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faint, typical smell when wet, and a hot soak seemed like it may have been oiled a bit; but all that easily washed out, and it now smells like the mild VDH shave soap; with the badger smell, almost completely disappeared, after the first use. I washed it with Dawn briefly, and that hot water soak; before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No hairs lost. Update: After a lot of use, I&#x27;ve seen a minor hair speck, or 2; but this is normal. No problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package did say it was sanitized, and NOT to boil it. Apparently, that&#x27;s been an issue. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend super heating it. Just wash it. It&#x27;s no big deal. It&#x27;s real badger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base is heavy. I guess it&#x27;s best for medium to large hands. Update: You would NOT want to drop it on your toe. LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problem with hard soap lathering (always put two finger on top of your brush, and use the tips.) For VDH soap, try a full 45 seconds (for 3+ shave passes) of brush loading, and then go to cup/bowl, or face lather. Adjust as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Put some warm water, temporarily, on a hard soap; while the brush is soaking. Pour off water, and shake this brush out hard once, or twice, to dry(ish) load your brush(Swirl, paint, and pump! 60 seconds?). After it&#x27;s loaded, add drops of water; after swirling (bowl, or face), and so you never get it overly wet (foamy falling off). You will get soft, creamy peaks, and far more slippery lather on your skin, this way. Every soap has a differing latitude for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It felt fine on the face, and was quick, with very good lather, and warm water retention. I was slightly worried it might be too soft; but it wasn&#x27;t. Not scratchy either, and it&#x27;s new. Still it has tremendous support. Not floppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s about 75 mm across; when dry, after the first use. Yet it, didn&#x27;t feel to big; even though it&#x27;s big, and fast to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Don&#x27;t use canned, or cheap shave cream that might have badger hair harming chemicals in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soaps:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, Van Der Hagen \\&quot;Deluxe\\&quot; (1.58 Small; but long-lasting. Shea butter, Aloe), Arko ($5 Small; but long-lasting; questionable smell), and others are dirt cheap, and VERY good. Spieck STICK travel soap($5). ...and Cella (not rock hard soap) is many folks tops; at about $10. Real Shave (Moisturizing variety) CREAM, is about $4 at the -marts. Tabac is high rated too; but I do not like the granny (NOT manly IMHO), Lavender \\&quot;top notes\\&quot; to it&#x27;s complex cologne smell. Mitchells Wool Fat (hard, english) is the defacto forum favorite; due to it&#x27;s performance, once worked-up well. It has a good low smell. All these beat the popular English creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Hold on to the hairs themselves, at the base; when flinging it dry. Not just the handle alone (with any brush). You do not want to require re-gluing it. Update: Not been a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Always dry, and hang it brush-down. Make a hanger out of a piece of wire; if nothing else (but this one came with passable hanger).</li>
            <li> I have not had the issues that other reported about loosing bristles.  I do keep it hunch upside down to dry.  I am know see why people pay a lot of money for a good brush.  Huge difference from the one I started with.</li>
            <li> I like this product as the hair is very full and to date no hair loss . I only recently bought a Parker set which includes a brush almost identical to the GBS . The parker brush is fuller , I did not think this possible as the GBS is in itself very full . You do have to hold the two together  in order to make that comparison . Time will tell how each brush holds up to wear . When you pay this amount for a product you expect quality and I believe you will not be disappointed .</li>
            <li> After several uses the bristles are falling out.  I carefully wash and dry it after each use.  Unfortunately, it is just past the return date.</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for about six months and it has been great.  I have noticed in the last month that two or three bristles have fallen out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this brush for the price and quality.</li>
            <li> No significant loss of bristles after a year, but I&#x27;m careful not to wet or rinse it with hot water up to the base. I suspect that people who report losing bristles may have been wetting the entire length of the bristles instead of just the bottom half of the bristles. Bristles are glued to the base; so obviously if you wet their entire length with really hot water, you&#x27;ve going to dissolve the glue. Also, there were negative comments about the holder. It&#x27;s plastic rather than the elegant enamel of the brush&#x27; base, but it works fine for me. Heavy, classy base and dense, sculptural bristles. This was clearly the best quality/dollar proposition of all the brushes I researched (and, as usual, I spent way too many hours researching this).</li>
            <li> Not very high quality.  After 1 month of use the brush is still loosing bristles. The logo on the handle is now smudged. For that price I would not recommend. You can get a better quality product for lower price</li>
            <li> Best brush at this price point.  Super soft and dense.  The handle has a substantial feel in your hand.  My only complaint is the included stand looks and feels cheap in comparison to the brush.</li>
            <li> This was my 2nd brush and my first silvertip.  For the price and quality, you can&#x27;t beat it.  Especially when so many other silvertips cost so much more.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It is the softest one I own. The only downfall is that it did not fit in the stand it came with. The base is too big and VERY heavy! It is very sharp looking and performs beautifully! no smell even when I first used it. If you don&#x27;t mind standing it on your counter, then this is the brush for you!</li>
            <li> Great silver tip badger brush. Feels great on the face. The handle is a bit heavy. Lost one or two bristles on the first use, but it turned out fine.</li>
            <li> Pretty much, this is a brush.  Its not a great brush, at least mine isn&#x27;t.  It sheds 5 or 6 hairs every time I look at it, and I got no response from GBS about it.  If I could choose again, I&#x27;d go with a high quality boar brush instead of the budget badger brush.</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for a couple months. I can&#x27;t comment on how well it holds up, but it is very comfortable and is easier to get a thick lather than other, more expensive brushes that I have used. I think it is a great value for the price and might get a second one.</li>
            <li> It really creates a nice lather easily, and it is soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> the amazon website said this brush came with a chrome stand and I got a cheap plastic one instead.  You ought to replace my stand as advertised</li>
            <li> I want to love this brush for the price, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is as high quality as it claims to be. I lose a few bristles per shave and it isn&#x27;t that soft. Maybe my expectations were too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get exactly what you pay for here.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush has a quality heft to it.  Transforms the tedium of the morning shave into an important ritual. Have lost hardly any bristles.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a parker pure badger hair brush with a similar design (black/chrome). I prefer this brush to the parker brand because this really is 100% Silvertip Badger hair and again is very soft. There was a bit of a odor when I first opened it, but this isn&#x27;t uncommon. I shampooed and conditioned it with a natural organic shampoo and conditioner and it was right as rain after that. The brush diameter is perfect for the average face, has a great luxorious feel, lathers well and provides nice firm pressure against your face. I have yet to lose any hairs from this brush, but I did have a few that were hanging at an odd angle, so I just cut them back with a pair of scissors. My only real complaint about this brush is that it doesn&#x27;t fit in my Colonel Conk chrome shaving stand. It does come with a black plastic stand, but it doesn&#x27;t sit well in this either. This brush is bottom heavy from such a subtaintial handle, so when sitting it on the plastic stand, it tends to fall over if you don&#x27;t find a perfect balance for it. Based on quality I would recommend this brush and most other GBS products, but not being able to hang this well from a stand really is a bit of a concern and I would keep that in consideration. Enjoy!</li>
