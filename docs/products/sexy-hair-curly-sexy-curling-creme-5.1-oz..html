            <li>I have used many styling products for curly hair and this is the absolute best!</li>
            <li>AND the frizz has me super happy.</li>
            <li>And it smells pretty good too!</li>
            <li>I was already in love with sexy hair soy renewal beach spray and the spray clay to set my curls and waves, and this is the perfect first step.</li>
            <li>Very good product fast shipping</li>
            <li>best creme to use on my natural wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Sure does smell nice though, just wished it worked.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to work great!</li>
            <li>This goes on smooth, it&#x27;s the consistency of lotion, gives great hold and keeps my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty great.</li>
            <li>My favorite curl creme.</li>
            <li>Amazon price is much better than a salon.</li>
            <li>Since using this product I have a more uniform look to my curls that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I bought this from my hairdresser, and was pleased to find it on line</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to travel to get more,.</li>
            <li>Was glad I could get it here, as I can&#x27;t find it in any shops around here.</li>
            <li>I love what this does to my hair.</li>
            <li>Works great and is much cheaper than at the hair dressers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>Says the word SEXY twice on the front of the tube.</li>
            <li>Love this product. ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use many curling cremes but not one like this one. .....</li>
            <li>This Curly Sexy Hair product is okay</li>
            <li>Curly Sexy Hair curling cr√®me was recommended by a hairdresser.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products for curly hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This product worked better for me than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before.  </li>
            <li>Am also using Curly Sexy Hair shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this on Amazon for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It is authentic quality...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I took the chance and am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>My goal is to provide a thorough review to assist others with their purchase, as there are many choices on Amazon</li>
            <li>It will make your hair look really sexy :)</li>
            <li>I fell in love and decided to buy a tube to see if I could replicate it at home.</li>
            <li>This does such a wonderful job</li>
            <li>It gives my hair lots of great needed definition that stays in place all day while still being nice soft.</li>
            <li>Shea moisture is better than this.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It was more of a curl relaxer in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Gel make your curls stand up better.</li>
            <li>Just wish it was a lit softer and had more shine in winter.</li>
            <li>and she said: as i said in my topic it is okay, i have tried worst.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>It pulled more curl out than it put in.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I just wish more came in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>I love this curling creme.  </li>

            <li>love this product helps keep my curls - curly through the day -</li>
            <li>And Curly Sexy Hair products are my go to products the majority of the time.</li>
            <li>I really love how it controls my curls</li>
            <li>It works ok in my hair</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>I probably would not buy again if I can find something better.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my curls look.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many curling cremes.</li>
            <li>I have used bed head for curly hair and find that this product works better and of course smells better.</li>
            <li>Love this product for my hair.</li>
            <li>Love the way it works.</li>
            <li>I use this with Healthy Sexy Hair Soy Renewal + Argan oil</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my hair feel and look.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser used this on my natural curly hair and I loved it!  </li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>I also really like the pleasant smell it has on the product.</li>
            <li>Great product for my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff for naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>after I wash my hair: I use an ultra light oil/water spray called Miracle 7 then use Curly Sexy Hair creme</li>
            <li>This product really brings out my curls and makes my hair look gorgeous.</li>
            <li>After trying dozens of other products we are very happy to of found this.</li>
            <li>This works great to smooth out my frizz and encourages my natural curl.</li>
            <li>It is easy to wash off my hands, and the bottle is easy to squeeze out of.</li>
            <li>I used to buy another brand, but this is much cheaper and honestly holds better.</li>
            <li>Just doesn&#x27;t have a strong hold.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend to ladies with curly hair.</li>
            <li>I liked the older formula more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hold was light and strong.  </li>
            <li>Love the product it came quick too</li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST product for natural curls with shine!</li>
            <li>For someone who has un-sexy, or even asexual hair, this will make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Great product for my curly hair, and I&#x27;ve tried lots of different products.</li>
            <li>Stops frizzing and lightly texturizes.</li>
            <li>I use it to smooth and defrizz curls.</li>
            <li>Works great on my short curly hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light cream</li>
            <li>But if you have naturally, very curl hair, or your hair is fresh off the perm rods, this is good cream.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff and it has a great smell!</li>
            <li>If I had to pick 1 hair product I couldn&#x27;t live without, it would be CURLY SEXY HAIR cream!</li>
            <li>i have used this product consistently for many years.</li>
            <li>This is a cream and usually a gel works best for keep in curl.</li>
            <li>I bought the original at the salon.  </li>
            <li>After the first trim after a perm most of the body and curl is gone.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally pretty curly, and this just makes it better.</li>
            <li>It did a pretty good job at keeping my natural waves from becoming frizzy but I am not amazed by it.  </li>
            <li>Best to use it on wet hair straight out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I love &#x27;Curly Sexy Hair curling Creme&#x27; because it leaves my hair feeling soft and not wiry.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m positive that says more about my hair than about this product.</li>
            <li>This styling creme is really nice for my natural curly longish hair!  </li>
            <li>it actually looks better if I don&#x27;t dry my hair which is great and saves me time in my morning routine!</li>
            <li>Smell is ok - floral but can be stinky if you use too much.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair so soft and nicely curly.  </li>
            <li>Sexy hair will continue to get my paychecks haha</li>
            <li>so I can just restyle it the next day with good results.</li>
            <li>One more thing thanks to my daughter for getting me some to try, bess you girl child.</li>
            <li>I try not to pay full price</li>
            <li>My hair even looks good several days later.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product it keeps my curly hair very curly.  </li>
            <li>Helped my hair have nice soft curls without being crunchy.  </li>
            <li>However it does have a pretty strong odor that not everyone can tolerate.</li>
            <li>The first time it worked fine as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I got it quickly though.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I have super curly hair when I am not wearing it strait.</li>
            <li>After sleeping on it, it pretty much flattened out and the curls were mostly gone.</li>
            <li>The service was very good and the price was excellent, it is difficult to find the product for less than 13.00</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair, and I use this to help keep my curls in when I use the curling wand.  </li>
            <li>First time I used this in addition to my other regimen, I have soft SPIRAL curls, no frizz, no crunchies, and absolutely beautiful, shiny, sleek hair!</li>
            <li>I enjoy having the choice between straight and curly hair and this cream gives me that option.</li>
            <li>I recently used it without the leave in conditioner and was thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>I love how soft my hair feels with this product but the frizz is still there..</li>
            <li>I love the way it manages my hair and leaves my hair and curls soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different things, and this is the only thing that makes my hair look good.</li>
            <li>My favorite curl creme for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>This works, however, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Super easy for him to use and keeps his wild hair tamed all day.</li>
            <li>I have below shoulder length natural gray curly hair, this product leaves my curls soft, not stiff, completely gets rid of the frizz, best product I have ever used on my hair in 60 plus years of trying curling products.  </li>
            <li>it leaves my hair super curly and full of live.</li>
            <li>it dried my hair out more &amp; made it seem even more frizzy.</li>
            <li>It is light and leaves my hair looking very natural.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t give this more than 3 stars, because it only worked well right after I got my spiral perm.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft (so happy that not fizzy like other products), and shiny.</li>
            <li>Ok I use this for totally different reason than it&#x27;s meant for.</li>
            <li>Being able to get this at my local drug store or online at Amazon.com</li>
            <li>This is possibly one of my favorite hair products.</li>
            <li>Then I did the same methods, but with more product.  </li>
            <li>sure to have a magnifying glass to read the back label, if you buy it.</li>
            <li>I get nice bouncy curls, a shiny finish, and absolutely no frizz.  </li>
            <li>and I personally rely on reviews when making most of my purchases.  </li>
            <li>I must first point out that along with this, I use the Brazilian Keratin Shampoo and Conditioner by Organix and Garnier Fructis&#x27;</li>
            <li>Another plus, it doesn&#x27;t take more than about a quarter sized amount to control my entire head of hair.</li>
            <li>overall pretty much the same great product...</li>
            <li>My hairdresser first recommended it to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the ingredients themselves are healthy for the hair, but my hair looks healthy and moisturized with this product.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this product for my fiance about 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>Daily conditioning then an application of Curly Sexy Hair followed by a a crispy-creme to set the curls without the crunchiness of a drying gel.</li>
            <li>I purchased it on sale to have on hand when the first bottle ran out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products to control my curly hair.</li>
            <li>I actually like Garnier Fructis Curl Sculpting Cream Gel much better</li>
            <li>This stuff works pretty well.</li>
            <li>so my hair dries in waves since its so hot in the summer.</li>
            <li>Love the stuff and cannot say enough positive words about it.  </li>
            <li>I was introduced to this product at Great Clips and unfortunately it is expensive if you pay full price which right now is $17.99.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it smells great and doesn&#x27;t make my hair dirty or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Does work best when put in wet hair and dried with hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>and some pieces are very wavy, while some are very straight.</li>
            <li>This one works pretty well, and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I can just do without the new smell and the new cheap packaging.</li>
            <li>Good definition to curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price was a little to high for me to rebuy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even in this high humidity summer the East Coast is getting right now, no frizz in sight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a simple, easy to use product for my 13.</li>
            <li>Works better when you let your hair air dry.</li>
            <li>I have fine short curly/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>and I love how this stuff gives me soft thick body, gets rid of static, and I don&#x27;t have to blow dry my hair when using it like I do with most products.</li>
            <li>This really helps to control frizz and my curly hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this product as much as the gel.</li>
            <li>It really like this curly creme</li>
            <li>It is very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not help too much with the freeze.</li>
            <li>Add shine to your hair and a gentle hold that isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li>and it works really well.</li>
            <li>this product didn&#x27;t really help my hair.</li>
            <li>, that is real frizzy.</li>
            <li>I really like this now that Nexxus has stopped producing</li>
            <li>It makes it springier, and the curls are really well defined.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair, that becomes very frizzy in humid climates...</li>
            <li>This creme and oil work very well.</li>
            <li>and it did not give much curl to my hair either.  </li>
            <li>I actually think that the sleek look works better than this for curls and it makes my hair soft too..</li>
            <li>however, Curly Sexy Hair took the frizz away and gave me lots of soft curls which by the way last until I wash it again.  </li>
            <li>Local salons marked up Sexy Hair products at the beginning of 2014.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products but nothing works better than this stuff for scrunching and defining the curl and doing away with any frizziness.</li>
            <li>You only need a small amount and it works great.</li>
            <li>You only need a little and it has a pleasant smell and is non greasy.  </li>
            <li>Probably better for super thick unruly hair.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice as well, not too strong, just vaguely citrusy maybe?</li>
            <li>Works pretty well on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>w/ the updside down letter K on it and then knock four more times and wait for John to answer and tell him Joe sent you.    </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li>I live in Minnesota where summers are very humid.</li>
            <li>tressemme works better for half the cost.</li>
            <li>My previous favorite by Aveda was discontinued.</li>
            <li>I had previously been using a gel, but this is much better for me.  </li>
            <li>It might work better for someone with less frizz.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s light weight and left my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, at $2/oz, I find it pretty overpriced (like a lot of &#x27;high end&#x27; hair products, honestly), but if that&#x27;s not an issue for you, it&#x27;s worth trying it out.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It gives me a little more hold without being crunchy.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for it, but it definitely proves that not all curly hair is made equal.</li>
            <li>She has natural very curly hair and this product keeps her hair under control without being sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li>This product really holds my curls with a soft hold which I like</li>
            <li>Really enhances my natural curl.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if I add a few more products into the mix</li>
            <li>I ran out of what I normally use for my curls (a Deva Curl product)</li>
            <li>When blow dried, my hair will hold it&#x27;s shape much better and for a lot longer.</li>
            <li>If I use much more than that, my hair seems to get sticky and stiff.</li>
            <li>but this stuff is my new jam.</li>
            <li>The leave in treatment I had used for years was discontinued, so I have been searching for a new one.</li>
            <li>How did I ever live without this frizz controlling cream?</li>
            <li>I have curly hair, but live in the desert</li>
            <li>Plus it smells nice but is fairly subtle, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched and bought various curling creme products yet many do not really enhance the curl.</li>
            <li>Most products either make my hair look crunchy and wet or frizzy and big.</li>
            <li>This may seem like a small difference, but you must remember that I have naturally sexual, luxurious hair.</li>
            <li>It generally does not frizz up much after drying, but I am concerned about this product building up in my hair/scalp because of what it&#x27;s made of it.</li>
            <li>It brings out the natural curl in my hair &amp; is not sticky at all!  </li>
            <li>I like it, but not sure I love it.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, wavy, and a natural mess kind of hair and this product is a big hit for me.</li>
            <li>controls my frizz pretty well, wish they made it in a bigger bottle though.</li>
            <li>I put my hair up in a ponytail or bun for 30 minutes to an hour before letting it down and they come out fantastic.</li>
            <li>The same or a bit better effect can be achieved by buying the curling gel from any other brand at a much lower price such as Tresemme&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I have fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li>My stylist said it&#x27;s okay to use this product on dry hair the 2nd day, just don&#x27;t overdo it, and apply at the roots only.</li>
            <li>Works really well for my dry hair--really does make it more curly, and not too stiff.</li>
            <li>Curly Sexy hair creme is hard to find in shops and salons, another hair curling product that works is Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls)</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li>Yr old sons curly hair for years and found this.</li>
            <li>Looks and feels natural, not sticky.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair softly curly without looking or feeling sticky.  </li>
            <li>It helps define soft curls/waves.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair, but it tends to frizz a bit</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair which tends to frizz a bit,</li>
            <li>I have natural wavy hair and this product did not enhance my curls.</li>
            <li>Helps hold neat soft curls ALL DAY</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and curly without frizz.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>This makes my curls soft, not crunchy and helps with frizz.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and this has helped my hair.</li>
            <li>but it left my hair looking very frizzy.</li>
            <li>No greasiness, and soft enhanced curls.</li>
            <li>By the way I am 74 years old</li>
            <li>keeps hair soft and perks up the perm</li>
            <li>When I let it dry naturally, it&#x27;s a controlled curly and pretty look.  </li>
            <li>If I dry it with a defuser, it can get big, curly and full, which is just how I like it.</li>
            <li>instead -- I don&#x27;t need to use as much to smooth out curls curls and tame frizz.  </li>
            <li>The new one smells a little funny and the new plastic packaging stunk up my bath room for about a week!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It works pretty well, but I guess I have a mental issue with the silicone in it.</li>
            <li>I just have to be careful to use the exact amount every time, or else it can look wet/greasy.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin straight hair</li>
            <li>Cream is a little bit more watery than expected.  </li>
            <li>Even in the cold winter it keeps my hair smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li>This product is nice because I can use just a little after using a drop of moroccon oil and my hair is left tames and soft and wavy with little frizz.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so start with only a tiny bit because if your hair is anything like mine, this super rich formula will weigh your hair down if you use too much.  </li>
            <li>I have hair that is more on the dry side and this product dried it out further.</li>
            <li>After using this, her hair always looks natural and not flat.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t bad, but it wasn&#x27;t great either.  </li>
            <li>I also find that I do not need to use too much of this product; I use about a quarter sized dollop for my hair, which is almost breast length wet.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to use too much or your hair gets crunch.</li>
            <li>but I have to be careful with it and not use to much.</li>
            <li>My hair is only naturally wavy, so when the perm began to relax, the product did not enhance or support curls.  </li>
            <li>My hair is pretty thick, but I still don&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li>I have thin hair that doesn&#x27;t seem to like many products.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m just having a casual day I only use this cream on my damp hair and it works amazing.</li>
            <li>I tried using it when my hair was damp and letting it dry, and also tried putting it on my hair when it was dry to smooth it down.</li>
            <li>They are soft and stay that way all day long without making my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have wavy to curly hair and its pretty uneven.</li>
            <li>I like this the first few times that I used it.  </li>
            <li>This product weighted down the curls too much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a heavier product, and didn&#x27;t hold down the frizz as much.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair which I air dry in a bun.</li>
            <li>naturally wavy, shoulder length hair and a tiny bit of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl super well cuz its thick</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and shiny with limited frizz.  </li>
            <li>I normally wash my hair every other day</li>
            <li>It is light enough not to be sticky or weigh your hair down, but heavy enough to take away all frizz and add texture.</li>
            <li>I put about a dime size of this along with a drip of paul michell&#x27;s Fast Form when my hair is wet and then use a diffuser to dry my hair only to damp.  </li>
            <li>I have thin fine hair.</li>
            <li>so either good or bad thing</li>

            <li> best creme to use on my natural wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Sure does smell nice though, just wished it worked.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to work great!</li>
            <li> This goes on smooth, it&#x27;s the consistency of lotion, gives great hold and keeps my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty great.</li>
            <li> My favorite curl creme.</li>
            <li> Amazon price is much better than a salon.</li>
            <li> Since using this product I have a more uniform look to my curls that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I bought this from my hairdresser, and was pleased to find it on line</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to travel to get more,.</li>
            <li> Was glad I could get it here, as I can&#x27;t find it in any shops around here.</li>
            <li> I love what this does to my hair.</li>
            <li> Works great and is much cheaper than at the hair dressers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> Says the word SEXY twice on the front of the tube.</li>
            <li> Love this product. ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use many curling cremes but not one like this one. .....</li>
            <li> This Curly Sexy Hair product is okay</li>
            <li> Curly Sexy Hair curling cr√®me was recommended by a hairdresser.  </li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This product worked better for me than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before.  </li>
            <li> Am also using Curly Sexy Hair shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this on Amazon for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It is authentic quality...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I took the chance and am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> My goal is to provide a thorough review to assist others with their purchase, as there are many choices on Amazon</li>
            <li> It will make your hair look really sexy :)</li>
            <li> I fell in love and decided to buy a tube to see if I could replicate it at home.</li>
            <li> This does such a wonderful job</li>
            <li> It gives my hair lots of great needed definition that stays in place all day while still being nice soft.</li>
            <li> Shea moisture is better than this.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It was more of a curl relaxer in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Gel make your curls stand up better.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was a lit softer and had more shine in winter.</li>
            <li> and she said: as i said in my topic it is okay, i have tried worst.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> It pulled more curl out than it put in.</li>

            <li> I probably would not buy again if I can find something better.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my curls look.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many curling cremes.</li>
            <li> I have used bed head for curly hair and find that this product works better and of course smells better.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my hair.</li>
            <li> Love the way it works.</li>
            <li> I use this with Healthy Sexy Hair Soy Renewal + Argan oil</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my hair feel and look.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on my natural curly hair and I loved it!  </li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> I also really like the pleasant smell it has on the product.</li>
            <li> Great product for my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff for naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> after I wash my hair: I use an ultra light oil/water spray called Miracle 7 then use Curly Sexy Hair creme</li>
            <li> This product really brings out my curls and makes my hair look gorgeous.</li>
            <li> After trying dozens of other products we are very happy to of found this.</li>
            <li> This works great to smooth out my frizz and encourages my natural curl.</li>
            <li> It is easy to wash off my hands, and the bottle is easy to squeeze out of.</li>
            <li> I used to buy another brand, but this is much cheaper and honestly holds better.</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t have a strong hold.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend to ladies with curly hair.</li>
            <li> I liked the older formula more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hold was light and strong.  </li>
            <li> Love the product it came quick too</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST product for natural curls with shine!</li>
            <li> For someone who has un-sexy, or even asexual hair, this will make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Great product for my curly hair, and I&#x27;ve tried lots of different products.</li>
            <li> Stops frizzing and lightly texturizes.</li>
            <li> I use it to smooth and defrizz curls.</li>
            <li> Works great on my short curly hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light cream</li>
            <li> But if you have naturally, very curl hair, or your hair is fresh off the perm rods, this is good cream.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff and it has a great smell!</li>
            <li> If I had to pick 1 hair product I couldn&#x27;t live without, it would be CURLY SEXY HAIR cream!</li>
            <li> i have used this product consistently for many years.</li>
            <li> This is a cream and usually a gel works best for keep in curl.</li>
            <li> I bought the original at the salon.  </li>
            <li> After the first trim after a perm most of the body and curl is gone.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally pretty curly, and this just makes it better.</li>
            <li> It did a pretty good job at keeping my natural waves from becoming frizzy but I am not amazed by it.  </li>
            <li> Best to use it on wet hair straight out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I love &#x27;Curly Sexy Hair curling Creme&#x27; because it leaves my hair feeling soft and not wiry.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m positive that says more about my hair than about this product.</li>
            <li> This styling creme is really nice for my natural curly longish hair!  </li>
            <li> it actually looks better if I don&#x27;t dry my hair which is great and saves me time in my morning routine!</li>
            <li> Smell is ok - floral but can be stinky if you use too much.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair so soft and nicely curly.  </li>
            <li> Sexy hair will continue to get my paychecks haha</li>
            <li> so I can just restyle it the next day with good results.</li>
            <li> One more thing thanks to my daughter for getting me some to try, bess you girl child.</li>
            <li> I try not to pay full price</li>
            <li> My hair even looks good several days later.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product it keeps my curly hair very curly.  </li>
            <li> Helped my hair have nice soft curls without being crunchy.  </li>
            <li> However it does have a pretty strong odor that not everyone can tolerate.</li>
            <li> The first time it worked fine as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I got it quickly though.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair when I am not wearing it strait.</li>
            <li> After sleeping on it, it pretty much flattened out and the curls were mostly gone.</li>
            <li> The service was very good and the price was excellent, it is difficult to find the product for less than 13.00</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair, and I use this to help keep my curls in when I use the curling wand.  </li>
            <li> First time I used this in addition to my other regimen, I have soft SPIRAL curls, no frizz, no crunchies, and absolutely beautiful, shiny, sleek hair!</li>
            <li> I enjoy having the choice between straight and curly hair and this cream gives me that option.</li>
            <li> I recently used it without the leave in conditioner and was thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> I love how soft my hair feels with this product but the frizz is still there..</li>
            <li> I love the way it manages my hair and leaves my hair and curls soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different things, and this is the only thing that makes my hair look good.</li>
            <li> My favorite curl creme for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> This works, however, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Super easy for him to use and keeps his wild hair tamed all day.</li>
            <li> I have below shoulder length natural gray curly hair, this product leaves my curls soft, not stiff, completely gets rid of the frizz, best product I have ever used on my hair in 60 plus years of trying curling products.  </li>
            <li> it leaves my hair super curly and full of live.</li>
            <li> it dried my hair out more &amp; made it seem even more frizzy.</li>
            <li> It is light and leaves my hair looking very natural.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t give this more than 3 stars, because it only worked well right after I got my spiral perm.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft (so happy that not fizzy like other products), and shiny.</li>
            <li> Ok I use this for totally different reason than it&#x27;s meant for.</li>
            <li> Being able to get this at my local drug store or online at Amazon.com</li>
            <li> This is possibly one of my favorite hair products.</li>
            <li> Then I did the same methods, but with more product.  </li>
            <li> sure to have a magnifying glass to read the back label, if you buy it.</li>
            <li> I get nice bouncy curls, a shiny finish, and absolutely no frizz.  </li>
            <li> and I personally rely on reviews when making most of my purchases.  </li>
            <li> I must first point out that along with this, I use the Brazilian Keratin Shampoo and Conditioner by Organix and Garnier Fructis&#x27;</li>
            <li> Another plus, it doesn&#x27;t take more than about a quarter sized amount to control my entire head of hair.</li>
            <li> overall pretty much the same great product...</li>
            <li> My hairdresser first recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the ingredients themselves are healthy for the hair, but my hair looks healthy and moisturized with this product.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this product for my fiance about 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> Daily conditioning then an application of Curly Sexy Hair followed by a a crispy-creme to set the curls without the crunchiness of a drying gel.</li>
            <li> I purchased it on sale to have on hand when the first bottle ran out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products to control my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I actually like Garnier Fructis Curl Sculpting Cream Gel much better</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well.</li>
            <li> so my hair dries in waves since its so hot in the summer.</li>
            <li> Love the stuff and cannot say enough positive words about it.  </li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product at Great Clips and unfortunately it is expensive if you pay full price which right now is $17.99.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it smells great and doesn&#x27;t make my hair dirty or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Does work best when put in wet hair and dried with hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> and some pieces are very wavy, while some are very straight.</li>
            <li> This one works pretty well, and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I can just do without the new smell and the new cheap packaging.</li>
            <li> Good definition to curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price was a little to high for me to rebuy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even in this high humidity summer the East Coast is getting right now, no frizz in sight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a simple, easy to use product for my 13.</li>
            <li> Works better when you let your hair air dry.</li>
            <li> I have fine short curly/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> and I love how this stuff gives me soft thick body, gets rid of static, and I don&#x27;t have to blow dry my hair when using it like I do with most products.</li>
            <li> This really helps to control frizz and my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product as much as the gel.</li>
            <li> It really like this curly creme</li>
            <li> It is very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not help too much with the freeze.</li>
            <li> Add shine to your hair and a gentle hold that isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li> and it works really well.</li>
            <li> this product didn&#x27;t really help my hair.</li>
            <li> , that is real frizzy.</li>
            <li> I really like this now that Nexxus has stopped producing</li>
            <li> It makes it springier, and the curls are really well defined.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, that becomes very frizzy in humid climates...</li>
            <li> This creme and oil work very well.</li>
            <li> and it did not give much curl to my hair either.  </li>
            <li> I actually think that the sleek look works better than this for curls and it makes my hair soft too..</li>
            <li> however, Curly Sexy Hair took the frizz away and gave me lots of soft curls which by the way last until I wash it again.  </li>
            <li> Local salons marked up Sexy Hair products at the beginning of 2014.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products but nothing works better than this stuff for scrunching and defining the curl and doing away with any frizziness.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount and it works great.</li>
            <li> You only need a little and it has a pleasant smell and is non greasy.  </li>
            <li> Probably better for super thick unruly hair.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice as well, not too strong, just vaguely citrusy maybe?</li>
            <li> Works pretty well on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> w/ the updside down letter K on it and then knock four more times and wait for John to answer and tell him Joe sent you.    </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li> I live in Minnesota where summers are very humid.</li>
            <li> tressemme works better for half the cost.</li>
            <li> My previous favorite by Aveda was discontinued.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using a gel, but this is much better for me.  </li>
            <li> It might work better for someone with less frizz.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s light weight and left my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, at $2/oz, I find it pretty overpriced (like a lot of &#x27;high end&#x27; hair products, honestly), but if that&#x27;s not an issue for you, it&#x27;s worth trying it out.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It gives me a little more hold without being crunchy.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for it, but it definitely proves that not all curly hair is made equal.</li>
            <li> She has natural very curly hair and this product keeps her hair under control without being sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> This product really holds my curls with a soft hold which I like</li>
            <li> Really enhances my natural curl.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if I add a few more products into the mix</li>
            <li> I ran out of what I normally use for my curls (a Deva Curl product)</li>
            <li> When blow dried, my hair will hold it&#x27;s shape much better and for a lot longer.</li>
            <li> If I use much more than that, my hair seems to get sticky and stiff.</li>
            <li> but this stuff is my new jam.</li>
            <li> The leave in treatment I had used for years was discontinued, so I have been searching for a new one.</li>
            <li> How did I ever live without this frizz controlling cream?</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, but live in the desert</li>
            <li> Plus it smells nice but is fairly subtle, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched and bought various curling creme products yet many do not really enhance the curl.</li>
            <li> Most products either make my hair look crunchy and wet or frizzy and big.</li>
            <li> This may seem like a small difference, but you must remember that I have naturally sexual, luxurious hair.</li>
            <li> It generally does not frizz up much after drying, but I am concerned about this product building up in my hair/scalp because of what it&#x27;s made of it.</li>
            <li> It brings out the natural curl in my hair &amp; is not sticky at all!  </li>
            <li> I like it, but not sure I love it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, wavy, and a natural mess kind of hair and this product is a big hit for me.</li>
            <li> controls my frizz pretty well, wish they made it in a bigger bottle though.</li>
            <li> I put my hair up in a ponytail or bun for 30 minutes to an hour before letting it down and they come out fantastic.</li>
            <li> The same or a bit better effect can be achieved by buying the curling gel from any other brand at a much lower price such as Tresemme&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li> My stylist said it&#x27;s okay to use this product on dry hair the 2nd day, just don&#x27;t overdo it, and apply at the roots only.</li>
            <li> Works really well for my dry hair--really does make it more curly, and not too stiff.</li>
            <li> Curly Sexy hair creme is hard to find in shops and salons, another hair curling product that works is Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li> Yr old sons curly hair for years and found this.</li>
            <li> Looks and feels natural, not sticky.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair softly curly without looking or feeling sticky.  </li>
            <li> It helps define soft curls/waves.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair, but it tends to frizz a bit</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair which tends to frizz a bit,</li>
            <li> I have natural wavy hair and this product did not enhance my curls.</li>
            <li> Helps hold neat soft curls ALL DAY</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and curly without frizz.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> This makes my curls soft, not crunchy and helps with frizz.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair</li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this has helped my hair.</li>
            <li> but it left my hair looking very frizzy.</li>
            <li> No greasiness, and soft enhanced curls.</li>
            <li> By the way I am 74 years old</li>
            <li> keeps hair soft and perks up the perm</li>
            <li> When I let it dry naturally, it&#x27;s a controlled curly and pretty look.  </li>
            <li> If I dry it with a defuser, it can get big, curly and full, which is just how I like it.</li>
            <li> instead -- I don&#x27;t need to use as much to smooth out curls curls and tame frizz.  </li>
            <li> The new one smells a little funny and the new plastic packaging stunk up my bath room for about a week!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It works pretty well, but I guess I have a mental issue with the silicone in it.</li>
            <li> I just have to be careful to use the exact amount every time, or else it can look wet/greasy.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin straight hair</li>
            <li> Cream is a little bit more watery than expected.  </li>
            <li> Even in the cold winter it keeps my hair smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li> This product is nice because I can use just a little after using a drop of moroccon oil and my hair is left tames and soft and wavy with little frizz.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so start with only a tiny bit because if your hair is anything like mine, this super rich formula will weigh your hair down if you use too much.  </li>
            <li> I have hair that is more on the dry side and this product dried it out further.</li>
            <li> After using this, her hair always looks natural and not flat.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad, but it wasn&#x27;t great either.  </li>
            <li> I also find that I do not need to use too much of this product; I use about a quarter sized dollop for my hair, which is almost breast length wet.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to use too much or your hair gets crunch.</li>
            <li> but I have to be careful with it and not use to much.</li>
            <li> My hair is only naturally wavy, so when the perm began to relax, the product did not enhance or support curls.  </li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick, but I still don&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that doesn&#x27;t seem to like many products.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m just having a casual day I only use this cream on my damp hair and it works amazing.</li>
            <li> I tried using it when my hair was damp and letting it dry, and also tried putting it on my hair when it was dry to smooth it down.</li>
            <li> They are soft and stay that way all day long without making my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have wavy to curly hair and its pretty uneven.</li>
            <li> I like this the first few times that I used it.  </li>
            <li> This product weighted down the curls too much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heavier product, and didn&#x27;t hold down the frizz as much.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair which I air dry in a bun.</li>
            <li> naturally wavy, shoulder length hair and a tiny bit of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl super well cuz its thick</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and shiny with limited frizz.  </li>
            <li> I normally wash my hair every other day</li>
            <li> It is light enough not to be sticky or weigh your hair down, but heavy enough to take away all frizz and add texture.</li>
            <li> I put about a dime size of this along with a drip of paul michell&#x27;s Fast Form when my hair is wet and then use a diffuser to dry my hair only to damp.  </li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> so either good or bad thing</li>
            <li> I have fine, not overly thick hair and this does not weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty curly hair, and I cannot stand to have to use regular gel or anything that makes my hair hard or scrunchy.</li>
            <li> My hair usually decides whether to be straight or curly, and I&#x27;m just the servant trying to accomodate.  </li>
            <li> Totally moisturizes and defines my long, permed hair.</li>
            <li> Hair fell flat to a &amp;#34;wavy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I had damaged my hair with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty thick.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, naturally wavy/curly long hair and alternate between curly and straight styles.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit and my hair had soft, defined curls.  </li>
            <li> being said, this was the last piece to my long struggling puzzle (20+ years)!</li>
            <li> The second bottle was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> If hair is wet, makes smaller curls.</li>
            <li> I have long layered somewhat curly hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s long.  </li>
            <li> I use it after the shower when my hair is wet and by the time it dries, I can manage my hair in a way that doesn&#x27;t make it frizzy or too big.</li>
            <li> It is adequate but not ideal.  </li>
            <li> I air dry my hair and this holds its shape without looking &amp;quot;styled&amp;quot;.  </li>
            <li> so i put this product on after a shower, air dry</li>
            <li> I put it in after the shower, comb through and let air dry.</li>
            <li> but it leaves my hair looking dry.</li>
            <li> Now, she wears it down 50% of the time and instead of having to brush her hair 5 times a day, we only do it twice.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and naturally very curl, so finally having found something to tame the curls</li>
            <li> This has really helped tame my daughter&#x27;s tight curls - even on a cruise!</li>
            <li> I can put it in my hair, let it air dry, and it does not frizz!  </li>
            <li> You only need to use a small amount which also helps the product last.</li>
            <li> I tried with my hair wet and also dry.</li>
            <li> Can be used for wet or dry look</li>
            <li> I apply to wet hair, dry with a diffuser, then spray to hold.  </li>
            <li> I use this every day, on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is a curly, wavy combination and a little on the coarse side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using only a little</li>
            <li> This gives me that beachy wave look with zero crunchiness and without the wet look.</li>
            <li> Minus 1 star for the smell of the product.  </li>
            <li> A bit stickier than I expected.</li>
            <li> I use this while it is still wet</li>
            <li> Sometimes with just a wide toothed comb or an air brush curling iron.</li>
            <li> I tried to salvage the bottle by using it as a rinse out conditioner instead, and in that capacity it has absolutely no effect on the hair.</li>
            <li> Only stiff that works 100% all the time.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the only stuff that will tame my hair without making it crunchy or leaving product flakes in it.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly thin, straight hair, if I don&#x27;t dry it there is just a slight wave.</li>
            <li> Unlike other product that leave your curls crunchy and wet looking.</li>
            <li> Does not curl hair as well as other products I have used.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews and it seemed like others were using this in addition to other products.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy like other products for curly hair do.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
            <li> but some days it seems to weigh my hair down and other days not.</li>
            <li> I like a hair product that I can use w a hair spray that is going to last at least two days.</li>
            <li> My wife commonly thought I smelled of french fries...</li>
            <li> It keeps the frizz down in all kinds of weather.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel like my hair is weighed down with product either.</li>
            <li> I use it every day on my hair to keep the frizz down &amp; to tighten up my shag cut curls.</li>
            <li> it weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but cheaper than the most expensive stuff and works almost as well.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair that tends to be frizzy if I don&#x27;t put moisture in it.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or leave it tangled and heavy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> She has crazy curly hair and ccould never leave it down without her hair getting like a fro and very frizzy.</li>
            <li> : It does NOT control frizz at ALL, and it seems you have a little bit of hair</li>
            <li> I used a little as suggested, and I worked it through like suggested, and what I ended up with is a helmet head type of curl..</li>
            <li> A little hair spray</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like products that are stiff, but this is simply too weak, with little control and less holding power.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be a little to heavy for my hair type.  </li>
            <li> im an on the go mom that doesn&#x27;t have time to do my hair for longer than a few mins.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I found that it made my hair heavy and look greasy.  </li>
            <li> Instead of support for my curls, I get heavy limpness.</li>
            <li> It was heavy cream and didn&#x27;t hold the curl too well</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my curls fluffy, but they also feel oily.</li>
            <li> and I read on a few websites that this stuff is the go-to for girls with my hair type.</li>
            <li> Does not work as well with air dried hair.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products I&#x27;ve found that prevents frizz but is weightless, and doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ve used any product at all.  </li>
            <li> I have super crazy hair and there is NOTHING like this product!</li>
            <li> It smells wonder and isn&#x27;t stiff.</li>
            <li> I like this creme to tame my summer frizzies.  </li>
            <li> I work in an office and sometimes get a &#x27;puff&#x27; to my curls or waves from the a/c, but my hair is tame as soon as it dries.</li>
            <li> Thin cream that makes hair stiff if its dry.</li>
            <li> Before I knew it, it was past the date to return it.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not sure if you want to take the plunge or not, DO IT.</li>
            <li> Goes totally wrong the next day.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Because I had purchased it ahead of time, but the time I used it and realized it was faulty, I was past the return window.</li>
            <li> In fact, it becomes a bit dull.  </li>
            <li> This stuff sucks for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have just below the shoulder length med - thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> This did not work well with my thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, curly hair which tends to be frizzy and out of control unless I use a lot of product in it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair that has an attitude.  </li>
            <li> I mean hold my curl and not be too frizzy.</li>
            <li> not sexy at all!  </li>
            <li> It works, but not exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> Not a good look.</li>
            <li> it was inexpensive and does exactly, if not more than the expensive salon samples I used before.</li>
            <li> I hate using products or heat on my hair, especially in summer.</li>
            <li> I have tired them all</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed like with all those other products!</li>
            <li> A bit expensive but coaxes unruly curls and &#x27;pushes&#x27; the curl.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so dang expensive</li>
            <li> so be wary of that.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I found out I am allergic to propylene glycol</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair that is permed - and this product did not define or keep my curls beyond ~1 hour.  </li>
            <li> I was not so crazy about the smell of it</li>
            <li> Curls are still impossible to retain</li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>
            <li> or I just got a bad batch, but I won&#x27;t be risking the money again.  </li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed...</li>
            <li> It is a completely worthless product.  </li>
            <li> I find it extremely annoying that a company will not stand by their product.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my 4 year old. She has crazy curly hair and ccould never leave it down without her hair getting like a fro and very frizzy. Now, she wears it down 50% of the time and instead of having to brush her hair 5 times a day, we only do it twice. This stuff works amazing and im very happy with my purchace.</li>
            <li> Ok I use this for totally different reason than it&#x27;s meant for. I have fine thin straight hair and I love how this stuff gives me soft thick body, gets rid of static, and I don&#x27;t have to blow dry my hair when using it like I do with most products. I hate using products or heat on my hair, especially in summer.</li>
            <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve come across. Works really well for my dry hair--really does make it more curly, and not too stiff. Plus it smells nice but is fairly subtle, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a simple, easy to use product for my 13. Yr old sons curly hair for years and found this. It is awesome!!! Super easy for him to use and keeps his wild hair tamed all day. He also finds his hair easier to comb after applying. After trying dozens of other products we are very happy to of found this. Definately the best for super curly hair!</li>
            <li> My favorite curl creme. A bit expensive but coaxes unruly curls and &#x27;pushes&#x27; the curl. You only need to use a small amount which also helps the product last.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this product. it dried my hair out more &amp; made it seem even more frizzy. the only thing going for it is the smell. tressemme works better for half the cost.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t hold any of my curls.  It actually made my hair frizzy.  I wish I could get my money back.  I got it quickly though.</li>
            <li> I used to always mix a leave in conditioner with a curling creme in order to control my curly hair. I bought this on a whim and have had very good results.  I recently used it without the leave in conditioner and was thrilled with the results. No frizz and nice curls.  I have just below the shoulder length med - thick curly hair.  I ended up using about two nickel sized amounts per application. My previous favorite by Aveda was discontinued. Let&#x27;s hope this one doesn&#x27;t get discontinued.</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t have a strong hold. I like a hair product that I can use w a hair spray that is going to last at least two days. I mean hold my curl and not be too frizzy. This just didn&#x27;t do it. By the end of the day. I thought my hair was too frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair is now 20% sexier as a result of this cream. This may seem like a small difference, but you must remember that I have naturally sexual, luxurious hair. For someone who has un-sexy, or even asexual hair, this will make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product before. Works great on my curly hair. Amazon price is much better than a salon.</li>
            <li> not so good .. it doesn&#x27;t give me the cure that I want.</li>
            <li> Great product for my naturally curly hair.  It keeps the frizz down in all kinds of weather.  Looks and feels natural, not sticky.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product! Totally moisturizes and defines my long, permed hair. I have tried other products but nothing works better than this stuff for scrunching and defining the curl and doing away with any frizziness. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if they ever quit making it!!</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair that is permed - and this product did not define or keep my curls beyond ~1 hour.  Hair fell flat to a &amp;#34;wavy&amp;#34; look at the end of the day.  Cream is a little bit more watery than expected.  Smell is ok - floral but can be stinky if you use too much.</li>
            <li> I love how soft my hair feels with this product but the frizz is still there.. it&#x27;s almost &#x27;fly away&#x27; frizz too.. not sexy at all!  I actually think that the sleek look works better than this for curls and it makes my hair soft too.. so going to that!</li>
            <li> I just tried this product this morning and it&#x27;s is so going back to the store!  My curls have turned into saggy waves and my hair is frizzier than I&#x27;ve ever seen it.  Too bad.  Being able to get this at my local drug store or online at Amazon.com made it a front runner as I seem to like products you can only get if you go into the back alley knock three times in succession on the door w/ the updside down letter K on it and then knock four more times and wait for John to answer and tell him Joe sent you.    Oh well... back to the drawing board. This one doesn&#x27;t define curl, enhance curl or eliminate frizz.  Bummer.  Maybe if I add a few more products into the mix but that&#x27;s not my goal. I&#x27;d like to find one all encompassing product that will define the curl, enhance the curl and control the frizz.</li>
            <li> Recommended to give your curls a boost without a gunky look. I have wavy to curly hair and its pretty uneven. Since using this product I have a more uniform look to my curls that lasts all day. Pair it with the Curly Sexy Hair shampoo and conditioner too!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great runner up for what I was using before</li>
            <li> Great stuff for naturally curly hair.  I bought this from my hairdresser, and was pleased to find it on line so I didn&#x27;t have to travel to get more,.</li>
            <li> Does not curl hair as well as other products I have used.</li>
            <li> This really helps to control frizz and my curly hair. You only need a small amount and it works great. Was glad I could get it here, as I can&#x27;t find it in any shops around here.</li>
            <li> I have fine short curly/wavy hair.  This product makes my hair softly curly without looking or feeling sticky.  I air dry my hair and this holds its shape without looking &amp;quot;styled&amp;quot;.  I have used many styling products for curly hair and this is the absolute best!</li>
            <li> I love what this does to my hair. It helps define soft curls/waves. I have naturally wavy hair, but it tends to frizz a bit and some pieces are very wavy, while some are very straight. It&#x27;s also pretty thick. This gives me that beachy wave look with zero crunchiness and without the wet look. It also smells wonderful - like a red delicious apple.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product as much as the gel. It doesn&#x27;t have the hold that I thought it would, but it still helps with reviving my curls.</li>
            <li> i have used this product consistently for many years. since i started wearing my hair curly.  it consistently is great. i like the way it smells and makes my hair feel.  i also use ardigan oil as well. the product arrived in a very timely manner and the price was the best.</li>
            <li> Works great and is much cheaper than at the hair dressers.</li>
            <li> Minus 1 star for the smell of the product.  It wasn&#x27;t bad, but it wasn&#x27;t great either.  My wife commonly thought I smelled of french fries... so either good or bad thing I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold was light and strong.  No crusty curls.  Good definition to curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price was a little to high for me to rebuy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current go-to is John Frieda Frizz Ease Curl Reviver Styling Mousse</li>
            <li> It really like this curly creme it really brings out the curls in my hair and makes it firm</li>
            <li> best creme to use on my natural wavy hair. im an on the go mom that doesn&#x27;t have time to do my hair for longer than a few mins. so i put this product on after a shower, air dry and i have no frizz!</li>
            <li> This is possibly one of my favorite hair products. My hair is a curly, wavy combination and a little on the coarse side. This goes on smooth, it&#x27;s the consistency of lotion, gives great hold and keeps my hair smooth. I can&#x27;t imagine using anything different.</li>
            <li> This has really helped tame my daughter&#x27;s tight curls - even on a cruise! Will never go anywhere without it again!</li>
            <li> This styling creme is really nice for my natural curly longish hair!  It helps the curls stay neat and shiny. When I let it dry naturally, it&#x27;s a controlled curly and pretty look.  If I dry it with a defuser, it can get big, curly and full, which is just how I like it.</li>
            <li> I like this the first few times that I used it.  After a few weeks I found that it made my hair heavy and look greasy.  I switched brands because of this.  I have naturally curly hair.  This product weighted down the curls too much.  I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> A bit stickier than I expected. Thin cream that makes hair stiff if its dry. If hair is wet, makes smaller curls.</li>
            <li> Best product for curly hair</li>
            <li> Great product seems to work well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this curling creme for about a month, and I&#x27;m a bit on the fence about it. It works, but not exceptionally well. I have naturally curly hair which I air dry in a bun. It generally does not frizz up much after drying, but I am concerned about this product building up in my hair/scalp because of what it&#x27;s made of it. It contains silicone, and since I do not shampoo my hair every day, I suspect it builds up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like about this product is that it is not overly sticky, or slimy. It is easy to wash off my hands, and the bottle is easy to squeeze out of. I also find that I do not need to use too much of this product; I use about a quarter sized dollop for my hair, which is almost breast length wet. If I use much more than that, my hair seems to get sticky and stiff. The scent is not overpowering, either. It is very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it. It works pretty well, but I guess I have a mental issue with the silicone in it.</li>
            <li> Its excellent for when you have wavy hair...hair you can&#x27;t leave alone when getting out of the shower.  This has worked wonders after having a baby at letting me put the product in my hair and letting it go.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I tried using it with my hair damp as they suggested. I tried with my hair wet and also dry. Then I did the same methods, but with more product.  Nothing. Before I knew it, it was past the date to return it.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to have a magnifying glass to read the back label, if you buy it. This is the smallest print I have ever seen on any product.&lt;br /&gt;Nice artwork on tube. Says the word SEXY twice on the front of the tube. I guess the company is a believer in the term: &amp;#34;sex sells&amp;#34;. Sure does smell nice though, just wished it worked.</li>
            <li> Love this product. ... it leaves my hair super curly and full of live. I&#x27;ve use many curling cremes but not one like this one. ..... just amazing</li>
            <li> The service was very good and the price was excellent, it is difficult to find the product for less than 13.00</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be the product that would enhance my short curls.  It is adequate but not ideal.  I am looking for a product to enhance curls while at the same time provide shine.  This Curly Sexy Hair product is okay but after some time elapsed from application, hair is not shinny.  In fact, it becomes a bit dull.  The same or a bit better effect can be achieved by buying the curling gel from any other brand at a much lower price such as Tresemme&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on my natural curly hair and I loved it!  But dreaded spending almost $17 for one tube.  Glad I found it here for $5 less!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great product for my curly hair, and I&#x27;ve tried lots of different products.</li>
            <li> The product itself is nice.  I found it to be a little to heavy for my hair type.  Only a drop is needed.  Probably better for super thick unruly hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that smells wonderful!  It only takes a little bit and my hair had soft, defined curls.  Be careful not to use too much or your hair gets crunch.</li>
            <li> Curly Sexy Hair curling cr√®me was recommended by a hairdresser.  I had previously been using a gel, but this is much better for me.  I have fine, not overly thick hair and this does not weigh it down.  I will continue using this product as it does help me style my hair and leaves it softer.</li>
            <li> I love this creme, it gives me beautiful curls. My hair is wavy and this creme turns my wavy hair into curly hair.</li>
            <li> this is the only product I use on my curly hair for about 6 years now. It is light enough not to be sticky or weigh your hair down, but heavy enough to take away all frizz and add texture. Can be used for wet or dry look</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products for curly hair. I just have to be careful to use the exact amount every time, or else it can look wet/greasy.</li>
            <li> Love the product it came quick too</li>
            <li> very nice hair cream but some days it seems to weigh my hair down and other days not. Maybe because my hair is oily. My hair is wavy and will curl in the summer.  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Ordered on prime so that was nice. Like the way it smells...and if you&#x27;re wondering, yes, it does make your curly hair sexy! Holla!</li>
            <li> I like this product for my curly hair but I have to be careful with it and not use to much. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff and it has a great smell!</li>
            <li> This is a good product. I ran out of what I normally use for my curls (a Deva Curl product) so thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it&#x27;s not as spend. It&#x27;s a heavier product, and didn&#x27;t hold down the frizz as much. I live in Minnesota where summers are very humid. I will use this all up, but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. It might work better for someone with less frizz.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t give this more than 3 stars, because it only worked well right after I got my spiral perm.  My hair is only naturally wavy, so when the perm began to relax, the product did not enhance or support curls.  I don&#x27;t like products that are stiff, but this is simply too weak, with little control and less holding power.  But if you have naturally, very curl hair, or your hair is fresh off the perm rods, this is good cream.  Stops frizzing and lightly texturizes.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it smells great and doesn&#x27;t make my hair dirty or greasy feeling. I use it to smooth and defrizz curls.</li>
            <li> I have fine, limp hair.  To get body I perm my hair.  This product gives me curl even when perm is just about grown out and also gives my hair body.  I can&#x27;t imagine not using this product.</li>
            <li> I liked that you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of the product to get great results. It is light and leaves my hair looking very natural. This is great!</li>
            <li> I love this product. it was inexpensive and does exactly, if not more than the expensive salon samples I used before. it actually looks better if I don&#x27;t dry my hair which is great and saves me time in my morning routine!</li>
            <li> This product worked better for me than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before.  I have naturally curly hair which tends to frizz a bit, however, Curly Sexy Hair took the frizz away and gave me lots of soft curls which by the way last until I wash it again.  Am also using Curly Sexy Hair shampoo.  Both are big winners for me...........................try it!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get people who have curly hair wanting to straighten it out. This product doesn&#x27;t claim to do that, but it might as well. Instead of support for my curls, I get heavy limpness. Not a good look.</li>
            <li> I like this creme to tame my summer frizzies.  Even in the cold winter it keeps my hair smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li> I have super crazy hair and there is NOTHING like this product! I absolutely love this stuff. Local salons marked up Sexy Hair products at the beginning of 2014. I was so happy to find this on Amazon for a reasonable price. It is authentic quality...so don&#x27;t buy that stuff about it not being the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; product. This stuff works awesome!</li>
            <li> I was heartbroken when Biolage discontinued their Curl Creme, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  I&#x27;m glad I took the chance and am pleased with the results.  I have very thick, naturally wavy/curly long hair and alternate between curly and straight styles.  I get nice bouncy curls, a shiny finish, and absolutely no frizz.  A little goes a long way, so start with only a tiny bit because if your hair is anything like mine, this super rich formula will weigh your hair down if you use too much.  My goal is to provide a thorough review to assist others with their purchase, as there are many choices on Amazon and I personally rely on reviews when making most of my purchases.

            <li> I have long layered somewhat curly hair. I enjoy having the choice between straight and curly hair and this cream gives me that option. It makes perfect curls in my hair without using any heat and the curls can be refreshed with just a bit of water on my hands scrunching the hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best curling creme I have ever used.  It smells really nice and leaves your curls well defined and manageable.  I have been using this product for years but the products came to me damaged and exploded in the package and I had to return them.  I will continue to buy this item at my local Ulta store instead of online.</li>
            <li> Give your wavy hair extra oomph!  I apply to wet hair, dry with a diffuser, then spray to hold.  Beautiful curl booster!</li>
            <li> I use Marc Anthony Strictly Curls Curl Envy Perfect Curl Cream or now TIGI Catwalk Curl Collection Curlesque Curls Rock Amplifier plus this one. Nothing else will do! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair, and I use this to help keep my curls in when I use the curling wand.  So far it seems to work great!</li>
            <li> It was heavy cream and didn&#x27;t hold the curl too well</li>
            <li> I do not know what people think of this product. It is excellent. I purchased one.  As soon as I saw the wonderful effect I ordered 3 more. The best cream I have ever used. Makes my hair soft (so happy that not fizzy like other products), and shiny. The volume it creates is great. Just love it!!! Strongly recommend to ladies with curly hair. It will make your hair look really sexy :)</li>
            <li> I must first point out that along with this, I use the Brazilian Keratin Shampoo and Conditioner by Organix and Garnier Fructis&#x27; Sleek and Shine serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this was the last piece to my long struggling puzzle (20+ years)! I got my hair chopped to chin length about 2 weeks ago and the stylist used this stuff on my hair. I fell in love and decided to buy a tube to see if I could replicate it at home. First time I used this in addition to my other regimen, I have soft SPIRAL curls, no frizz, no crunchies, and absolutely beautiful, shiny, sleek hair! My hair is thick and naturally very curl, so finally having found something to tame the curls AND the frizz has me super happy. This does such a wonderful job and I don&#x27;t feel like my hair is weighed down with product either. Another plus, it doesn&#x27;t take more than about a quarter sized amount to control my entire head of hair. I put it in after the shower, comb through and let air dry. Even in this high humidity summer the East Coast is getting right now, no frizz in sight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not sure if you want to take the plunge or not, DO IT. You won&#x27;t be disappointed like with all those other products!</li>
            <li> I liked the older formula more. The new one smells a little funny and the new plastic packaging stunk up my bath room for about a week!&lt;br /&gt;But overall pretty much the same great product... I can just do without the new smell and the new cheap packaging.</li>
            <li> This is the best curling cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I have naturally wavy, shoulder length hair and a tiny bit of this goes a long way. It gives my hair lots of great needed definition that stays in place all day while still being nice soft. And it smells pretty good too!</li>
            <li> I love the way it manages my hair and leaves my hair and curls soft. It&#x27;s never sticky and has a pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> I bought this and only used it twice... Idk what the hype is about but it leaves my hair looking dry. I prefer products with no alcohol. Shea moisture is better than this. For the price, it should have worked! It smells amazing though. Anyone want it? Lets trade for something.</li>
            <li> Perfect definition of curls. Works better when you let your hair air dry. I put my hair up in a ponytail or bun for 30 minutes to an hour before letting it down and they come out fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s the only stuff for hair that works on my curly hair. I&#x27;ve tried so many different things, and this is the only thing that makes my hair look good. It was recommended by my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice and does hold the curls without the sticky feel like some products do. Does not help too much with the freeze. A one day wear. Goes totally wrong the next day.</li>
            <li> It brings out the natural curl in my hair &amp; is not sticky at all!  I find the best price for this product is at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Pretty good. Works fairly well. Not perfect, but cheaper than the most expensive stuff and works almost as well.</li>
            <li> Very good product fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have natural wavy hair and this product did not enhance my curls. It was more of a curl relaxer in my opinion. I like that it&#x27;s light weight and left my hair soft. Unlike other product that leave your curls crunchy and wet looking. It does smell good! I read some of the reviews and it seemed like others were using this in addition to other products. Maybe combination is key.</li>
            <li> This is a cream and usually a gel works best for keep in curl. Gel make your curls stand up better. I&#x27;ll use and not return but not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair that tends to be frizzy if I don&#x27;t put moisture in it. This product made no difference in my hair. I tried using it when my hair was damp and letting it dry, and also tried putting it on my hair when it was dry to smooth it down. Neither did any good.</li>
            <li> I have this on auto delivery for my course wavy/Curley hair.  Proof enough?  Good price too!  Just wish it was a lit softer and had more shine in winter.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Add shine to your hair and a gentle hold that isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My hairdresser first recommended it to me. This product really brings out my curls and makes my hair look gorgeous. It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
            <li> I bought this for me daughter and she said: as i said in my topic it is okay, i have tried worst.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It does holds and defines the curls.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It does NOT control frizz at ALL, and it seems you have a little bit of hair only.&lt;br /&gt;After all i will keep using this product but mix with another one, i would not repurchase this item.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my hair. It pulled more curl out than it put in.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair so soft and nicely curly.  I have tired them all and this is the one that works for me.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! keeps the curl without the crunch.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Helps hold neat soft curls ALL DAY and it smells AMAZING! My hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl super well cuz its thick but this stuff is my new jam.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It&#x27;s so dang expensive but it&#x27;s the only stuff that will tame my hair without making it crunchy or leaving product flakes in it.  I have curly hair but if I don&#x27;t put something in it, it&#x27;s frizzy.  I put about a dime size of this along with a drip of paul michell&#x27;s Fast Form when my hair is wet and then use a diffuser to dry my hair only to damp.  Takes me 10 minutes to do my hair and it&#x27;s long.  I tried everything before finding this stuff.  It&#x27;s the only thing that works.  It leaves my hair soft and curly without frizz.</li>
            <li> I bought the original at the salon.  Then I got one as a gift and now I ordered another.  This is a great product to hold your curls without being smelly or crunchy.</li>
            <li> I like that this product is not a gel. Also that your hair doesn&#x27;t crunch like when using a gel. It doesn&#x27;t take out all of the frizz from my hair. All in all good product but probably not the best.</li>
            <li> Awesome price! Arrived quickly. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while and it works really well. I have naturally curly hair and it keeps it from frizzing.</li>
            <li> This did not work well with my thick wavy hair. May work well for another hair type. Smells great though!</li>
            <li> this product didn&#x27;t really help my hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, curly hair which tends to be frizzy and out of control unless I use a lot of product in it. The leave in treatment I had used for years was discontinued, so I have been searching for a new one. This one works pretty well, and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> This hair lotion works well with my 3B/3C hair type.  It leaves my hair soft and shiny with limited frizz.  I&#x27;m not sure if the ingredients themselves are healthy for the hair, but my hair looks healthy and moisturized with this product.  I have been using it for a couple of years off and on and always come back to it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a product that greatly reduced the frizz, doesn&#x27;t seem to be one out there, though this helps my curls a lot!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love!!  This makes my curls soft, not crunchy and helps with frizz.</li>
            <li> Works great on my short curly hair! Nice scent.</li>
            <li> definitely helps make curly hair curlier.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curling creme! I have natural curly hair, that is real frizzy. This stuff kept my curls together, without the crunch of gel/mousse.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product.  I had damaged my hair with a flat iron.  I use this while it is still wet and my hair stop breaking off.  I have ordered 3 times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best styling creme/gel for wavy/curly hair that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product for my fiance about 2 years ago. She has natural very curly hair and this product keeps her hair under control without being sticky or greasy. After using this, her hair always looks natural and not flat. She has gone thru about 6 of these already and still loves it. No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well on my naturally curly hair.  I need to use a lot of it,but it keeps the frizzies away.  After scrunching it my hair as it dries it doen&#x27;t end up crunchy.</li>
            <li> My favorite curl creme for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Lightweight cream. I like it a lot. I used to buy another brand, but this is much cheaper and honestly holds better.</li>
            <li> it gives me curl hair, but it makes my hair disheveled.</li>
            <li> I like it, but not sure I love it. I have naturally curly hair and I am fussy with my products. It leaves my curls fluffy, but they also feel oily. Not sure if I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It makes my hair smell good and my fiance loves the smell too! Helps with fly aways and frizz. I have naturally curly hair and this has helped my hair. I just wish more came in the bottle.</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks for my hair. It did help define some curls but it left my hair looking very frizzy. I&#x27;ve tried using only a little and I&#x27;ve tried using a lot and still, it didn&#x27;t do what i was hoping. Oh well.</li>
            <li> Ugh! I have 3b curly hair and I read on a few websites that this stuff is the go-to for girls with my hair type. I used a little as suggested, and I worked it through like suggested, and what I ended up with is a helmet head type of curl.. They weren&#x27;t bouncy and lost all volume. I felt like I had a film of chalky type stuff on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I was already in love with sexy hair soy renewal beach spray and the spray clay to set my curls and waves, and this is the perfect first step. If I&#x27;m just having a casual day I only use this cream on my damp hair and it works amazing. No greasiness, and soft enhanced curls. A+ in my book. Sexy hair will continue to get my paychecks haha</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help with frizz but does add volume and some curl defining....too pricey for outcome. Needs to come in bigger quantities too</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair. After the first trim after a perm most of the body and curl is gone. This product gives my hair body and the curls last longer.  I just work some into my hair when it is still damp after my shower and when it dries I style  it. Sometimes with just a wide toothed comb or an air brush curling iron. A little hair spray and it is good all day. I normally wash my hair every other day so I can just restyle it the next day with good results. By the way I am 74 years old so It can be used by all ages.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I have below shoulder length natural gray curly hair, this product leaves my curls soft, not stiff, completely gets rid of the frizz, best product I have ever used on my hair in 60 plus years of trying curling products.  Love the stuff and cannot say enough positive words about it.  One more thing thanks to my daughter for getting me some to try, bess you girl child.</li>
            <li> I use this every day, on wet or dry hair. This works great to smooth out my frizz and encourages my natural curl. Love it.</li>
            <li> Best to use it on wet hair straight out of the shower. It gives me a little more hold without being crunchy. It didn&#x27;t work well in conjunction with any curlers, though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light cream so when your hair dries you can&#x27;t tell you have a product in but your hair defiantly has a nice shape and curl to it. not greasy at all!</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. I have hair that is more on the dry side and this product dried it out further. I had high hopes for it, but it definitely proves that not all curly hair is made equal.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, wavy, and a natural mess kind of hair and this product is a big hit for me. I love it and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product at Great Clips and unfortunately it is expensive if you pay full price which right now is $17.99.  It was nice to find it for a lower price at amazon.  I try not to pay full price but sometimes don&#x27;t have a choice. Smells like apricots! controls my frizz pretty well, wish they made it in a bigger bottle though.</li>
            <li> I love this curling creme.  It smells wonder and isn&#x27;t stiff.</li>
            <li> I really like this now that Nexxus has stopped producing it&#x27;s leave-in conditioner.  It would be rather nice&lt;br /&gt;if the Stop and Shop in Bayonne NJ would start stocking it again.</li>
            <li> Curly Sexy Hair Curling creme works fabulously!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, you have to know your hair (curls have a mind of their own) and also know how to style your mane. I&#x27;ve searched and bought various curling creme products yet many do not really enhance the curl. Through trail and error, I found the best method for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Styling after I wash my hair: I use an ultra light oil/water spray called Miracle 7 then use Curly Sexy Hair creme&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Daily styling in-between washes: Daily conditioning then an application of Curly Sexy Hair followed by a a crispy-creme to set the curls without the crunchiness of a drying gel. Alagio worked but the I cannot find this product anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Since Curly Sexy hair creme is hard to find in shops and salons, another hair curling product that works is Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls)</li>
            <li> I purchased this on two occasions for my daughter. The first time it worked fine as a leave-in conditioner. The second bottle was a complete waste of money. I purchased it on sale to have on hand when the first bottle ran out. It turns to suds the minute I put it in her hair. It is definitely not something that can be left in the hair as directed. I tried to salvage the bottle by using it as a rinse out conditioner instead, and in that capacity it has absolutely no effect on the hair. It is a completely worthless product.  I don&#x27;t know if the formula has changed or I just got a bad batch, but I won&#x27;t be risking the money again.  Because I had purchased it ahead of time, but the time I used it and realized it was faulty, I was past the return window. However,  I wrote the company to explain the problem with the product, but have received no response. I find it extremely annoying that a company will not stand by their product.</li>
            <li> This product really holds my curls with a soft hold which I like</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty great. My hair is naturally pretty curly, and this just makes it better. My hair is pretty thick, but I still don&#x27;t use much. It makes it springier, and the curls are really well defined. My hair even looks good several days later.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of fragrances and hair products, but this one doesn&#x27;t bother me. The scent is nice as well, not too strong, just vaguely citrusy maybe? It smells like conditioner. But it&#x27;s pleasant.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser uses this product so i got some, It gives my hair the body it needs to hold a style.</li>
            <li> My wife has curly hair so she wanted to try this. It provides some help with friz but she said they have already spammed her looking for feedback. Last I heard feedback was voluntary, not required and not to be gotten by sending you emails bugging you for it.</li>
            <li> Really enhances my natural curl.  You only need a little and it has a pleasant smell and is non greasy.  Does work best when put in wet hair and dried with hair dryer.  Does not work as well with air dried hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products to control my curly hair. This does it the best. However it does have a pretty strong odor that not everyone can tolerate. I can&#x27;t  use it around my mom, because the smell causes her headaches. I still use it when she isn&#x27;t around.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy like other products for curly hair do.  But it still defines my curls enough so I don&#x27;t have a frizz-ball on my hands.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, that becomes very frizzy in humid climates... This is one of the few products I&#x27;ve found that prevents frizz but is weightless, and doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ve used any product at all.  The shape of the curls will hold for about a day- or until I sleep on them.  I would recommend this to anybody with frizzy hair, even if your hair isn&#x27;t curly!</li>
            <li> Just what my wife needed, she say&#x27;s it is great stuff</li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length curly/wavy hair and this was not enough hold for me.  It didn&#x27;t make my hair feel crunchy, but it didn&#x27;t eliminate frizz or define my curls.  I&#x27;ve been using Jane Carter Solution&#x27;s Curl Defining Cream (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00479L6F8/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1) instead -- I don&#x27;t need to use as much to smooth out curls curls and tame frizz.  I recommend it if this product doesn&#x27;t do enough for you.</li>
            <li> Only stiff that works 100% all the time.</li>
            <li> love this product helps keep my curls - curly through the day -</li>
            <li> How did I ever live without this frizz controlling cream? I use it every day on my hair to keep the frizz down &amp; to tighten up my shag cut curls. If I had to pick 1 hair product I couldn&#x27;t live without, it would be CURLY SEXY HAIR cream!</li>
            <li> Love this!  I can put it in my hair, let it air dry, and it does not frizz!  I use it every day!!!!</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair when I am not wearing it strait. And Curly Sexy Hair products are my go to products the majority of the time. I really love how it controls my curls and it does not cause frizzing of any kind. I also really like the pleasant smell it has on the product. This is a product I regularly buy in my home for my self. And I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair that has an attitude.  My hair usually decides whether to be straight or curly, and I&#x27;m just the servant trying to accomodate.  This product, is amazing at helping me have well defined curls without that gel look.  My hair looks and feels healthier too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 or 3 years, I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> It works ok in my hair</li>
            <li> I liked this okay.  It did a pretty good job at keeping my natural waves from becoming frizzy but I am not amazed by it.  I probably would not buy again if I can find something better.</li>
            <li> I love &#x27;Curly Sexy Hair curling Creme&#x27; because it leaves my hair feeling soft and not wiry.  I only have to use a quarter sized drop for my entire head and crunch it into my curls and it does the rest.  I use it after the shower when my hair is wet and by the time it dries, I can manage my hair in a way that doesn&#x27;t make it frizzy or too big.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that doesn&#x27;t seem to like many products. Most products either make my hair look crunchy and wet or frizzy and big. I also don&#x27;t like to have to use a lot of product b/c it weighs my hair down. This product is nice because I can use just a little after using a drop of moroccon oil and my hair is left tames and soft and wavy with little frizz. It also doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or leave it tangled and heavy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my curls look. They are soft and stay that way all day long without making my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> The one I got was very different from the picture so be wary of that.</li>
            <li> keeps hair soft and perks up the perm</li>
            <li> This works, however, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the cost. It takes away frizz and defines curls, so I won&#x27;t take away that it does its job, but I actually like Garnier Fructis Curl Sculpting Cream Gel much better and it&#x27;s only about $3-$4. I have tried so many curling cremes. This one smells great, and it works, but I had to use a lot. I have pretty curly hair, and I cannot stand to have to use regular gel or anything that makes my hair hard or scrunchy. This cream didn&#x27;t d that, but I still prefer Garnier Fructis Curl Sculpting Cream Gel over it any day regardless of the cost.</li>
            <li> I love this product it keeps my curly hair very curly.  The only issue that I have is that this product does not control frizz.  I have used bed head for curly hair and find that this product works better and of course smells better.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my hair. Love the way it works.</li>
            <li> I like the fact it does not cause my hair to be greasy, sticky or stuck together.  It works great on day 2 too to give my hair the curls I want.</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well. Makes my hair curl nicely without that crunchy hairspray/gel feel or a greasy feeling. Unfortunately, at $2/oz, I find it pretty overpriced (like a lot of &#x27;high end&#x27; hair products, honestly), but if that&#x27;s not an issue for you, it&#x27;s worth trying it out.</li>
            <li> I use this with Healthy Sexy Hair Soy Renewal + Argan oil and it works well. I have curly hair, but live in the desert so my hair dries in waves since its so hot in the summer. This creme and oil work very well. I work in an office and sometimes get a &#x27;puff&#x27; to my curls or waves from the a/c, but my hair is tame as soon as it dries. I use more creme than oil because the oil stretches my curls out and it&#x27;ll go lame if you over do it.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product.  Helped my hair have nice soft curls without being crunchy.  Unfortunately I found out I am allergic to propylene glycol so I can no longer use it</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my hair feel and look.</li>
            <li> I was not so crazy about the smell of it and it did not give much curl to my hair either.  I was disappointed...</li>
            <li> I have fairly thin, straight hair, if I don&#x27;t dry it there is just a slight wave. This seems to add a bit of conditioning and body. When blow dried, my hair will hold it&#x27;s shape much better and for a lot longer. Curls are still impossible to retain but I&#x27;m positive that says more about my hair than about this product. All in all I like it and I wouldwill buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST product for natural curls with shine! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> I have used standard mousse for several years to hold the curl, then tried this at the suggestion of my stylist. I loved the curls and it held them nicely for that one day. After sleeping on it, it pretty much flattened out and the curls were mostly gone. My mousse holds for 2 days. My stylist said it&#x27;s okay to use this product on dry hair the 2nd day, just don&#x27;t overdo it, and apply at the roots only. I haven&#x27;t done that yet but will try it.</li>
