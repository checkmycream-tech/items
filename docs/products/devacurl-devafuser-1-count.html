            <li>Not that I figured it out it works great every time.  </li>
            <li>This diffuser is great.  </li>

            <li>The vendor was great.</li>
            <li>This is a very effective diffuser, because it can sit inside the hair instead of just pushing from the ends.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like hotels come stocked with amazing defusers!</li>
            <li>This really is amazing!</li>

            <li>/&gt;UPDATE ON 1-12-13:  I am still absolutely in LOVE with this diffuser!  </li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it !</li>
            <li>It works amazingly.</li>
            <li>This amazing thing gave me corkscrew curls all over.</li>
            <li>Barely fit my t3 but works great.</li>
            <li>It was great in the salon, but didn&#x27;t fit my hair dryer, so I had to return it.  </li>
            <li>they stay nicely formed and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Extremely effective.</li>
            <li>goodness, what kind of dryer do you have?</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with it, along with the fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with it, along with the fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of dryer others have that cause</li>
            <li>I guess I always thought that I just had &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; curls - not the nice, smoothe looking curls/waves I always wanted and then came the DevaFuser.  </li>
            <li>This crazy-looking attachment is fantastic for loving your curls when drying!  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s a good idea to take it on a trip since it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>Love, love, love, this diffuser!</li>
            <li>I love, love, love, LOVE this diffuser!  </li>
            <li>Got a hot sock instead that works great.</li>
            <li>The devacurl fits fine on my hairdryer and the fingers are nice for lifting underneath curl sections and drying from two directions.  </li>
            <li>HUGE!  </li>
            <li>Really love it.</li>
            <li>And much more portable than a helmet diffuser, of course.</li>
            <li>Love how it works the curls....</li>
            <li>Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>love the circulation and the way it dries my hair without making it frizzy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great for gently holding up your curls while drying so</li>
            <li>The price is better on this than when I purchased.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay, but</li>
            <li>So at $25 dollars, I&#x27; wouldn&#x27;t advise another friend not to purchase but anything more</li>
            <li>I wonder if that&#x27;s why so many people have a problem.</li>
            <li>I found a hairdryer to finally fit it!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this diffuser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought it would be ok.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok -</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had this product now about 2 weeks, and my fluency with the product may get better.</li>
            <li>hence more</li>
            <li>For this reason, this device may become better over time.</li>
            <li>hence more</li>
            <li>For this reason, this device may become better over time.</li>
            <li>Love the style.</li>
            <li>LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I love the design of this diffuser.</li>
            <li>For this price, they should have chosen more durable material.  </li>
            <li>I am getting better at it.  </li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s any better than another diffuser or a cloth cover.</li>
            <li>and it supposedly fits most hair dryers.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this diffuser.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t realize that this is more for longer curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>Better than most diffusers.</li>
            <li>It mostly just increased the frizziness of my hair, and didn&#x27;t help set the curl at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to my bowl diffuser which works better for me.  </li>
            <li>They fell in love.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you slide it all the way on</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you slide it all the way on</li>
            <li>There are plenty of wonderful videos on YouTube that demonstrate different ways to use the DevaFuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok - I read all the raving reviews and thought that I would try this product.  </li>
            <li>My hair just got 90 percent easier and quicker to do and looks 100 percent better.  </li>
            <li>More waves - more</li>
            <li>One of the biggest selling points for me was the promise of more volume and curl.</li>
            <li>I get more volume and wave from a blowout.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of it and enjoy the devacurl products for my swavy hair</li>
            <li>Hopefully, I&#x27;ll be able to return it.</li>
            <li>What i like about it the most, is that it has ventilators holes all over the place.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine this fitting on any hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Maybe a beautician could do a better job with it.  </li>
            <li>Love the way this product works</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got a curly perm or natural curls Run and buy this , it is fabulous, I love love love mine!!!  </li>
            <li>was very excited when i saw this</li>
            <li>I was very excited to buy one after my stylist used one to do my hair.</li>
            <li>and I have soft, shiny, beautiful curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;bowl&amp;#34; diffuser (which came with the NEW hairdryer i purchased to work with this product) thankfully works great.  </li>
            <li>I ended up being able to use it on my travel dryer just fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I waited until this was redesigned to fit on any drier.  </li>
            <li>At its widest, seems like it would fit most hair dryers.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit mine and when I took it to a store that had about 10 to choose from, it didn&#x27;t fit ANY!  </li>
            <li>but I think DevaCurl should address this issue by either modifying their design or telling people it won&#x27;t fit most of the dryers on the market.  </li>
            <li>It states that it &amp;#34;fits most hair dryers&amp;#34; however  it didn&#x27;t fit the one I have .  </li>
            <li>It fit my dryer chi low emf brilliant.</li>
            <li>Now I can get it on easily, but it still fits snugly around the hairdyer.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see that many great reviews about this tool but took a risk at my local beauty store and bought it.</li>
            <li>I always thought my normal diffuser did a good job</li>
            <li>Fits fine on dryer.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair</li>
            <li>It seems to help reduce frizz in my 3b, fine, BSL hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with this odd looking tool.</li>
            <li>Also dries hair more quickly.</li>
            <li>It fit my blowdryer just fine</li>
            <li>I wish I had returned mine because at almost forty dollars, it was a HUGE rip off.  </li>
            <li>By the way, it is huge.....</li>
            <li>There is a huge gap at the seams.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found that the DevaCurl products make a huge difference too.  </li>
            <li>Had to go to a hair salon supply store to find a hair dryer that it would fit on.</li>
            <li>It fit over the dryer but did not stay in place.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit two dryers I have.  </li>
            <li>it doesnt fit all dryers</li>
            <li>did not hate it, but it&#x27;s not my go-to attachment either.</li>
            <li>I was trying to figure out before I bought this if it fit the T3 hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, I have Prime and didn&#x27;t have to pay return shipping.</li>
            <li>for instructions - there weren&#x27;t any detailed provided on the box, either, and were no instruction booklets.</li>
            <li>This is such a great diffuser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the fabulous diffuser:  </li>
            <li>the fit with my hairdryer:  </li>
            <li>So I did my research online and measured the nozzle of the diffuser attachment and determined that the nozzle of the blow drier had to be about 1.5&amp;#34; measured across the nozzle for attachment to fit.</li>
            <li>Forget the reviews that say it won&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>I think on my trip, it maybe fit 1 out of about 10.</li>
            <li>and I do think it will fit on every hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my hairdryer.</li>
            <li>The diffuser is a snug fit, and I would not want to take it off and on a lot.</li>
            <li>but for some reason it does not stay securely attached to the blow dryer&#x27;s nozzle.</li>
            <li>but I, too, thought this didn&#x27;t fit mine until I realized that I had to push it all the way onto the barrel</li>
            <li>OMG it is truly fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try to get a babyblisspro dryer, as one person mentioned it fit.</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t fit my dryer.  </li>
            <li>Well, it didn&#x27;t fit on my dryer.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit my hair dryer, so now I have a diffuser I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li>It will fit over just about any blow dryer.</li>
            <li>It does an amazing job at keeping my curls not frizzy and it drys my hair really fast</li>
            <li>But I have one of those Conair round brush blowdryers, and it fit perfectly on that.  </li>
            <li>Now that its available on its own, I really wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li>A regular diffuser does just a good of job, this is over priced and I does not seem to be able to handle the heat because it is coming apart.</li>
            <li>I took mine to Target and tried a few of the sample one they had out, to see which one it would fit on best.</li>
            <li>Probably best for long curly hair; mine is short, but I get a nice tousled look.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I love my curls when using the DevaFuser to dry them (even more so than air drying).  </li>
            <li>It is also handy to dry the roots to achieve a nice lift.  </li>
            <li>As a user of DevaCurl products for over a year - I was excited to try this since all their products are amazeballs.</li>
            <li>It does take longer to use, but its totally worth it!</li>
            <li>so i was excited</li>
            <li>I found this unique diffuser while searching for a replacement diffuser for mine that had just died.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this because I am a fan of all Deva products</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to hold it no more than 5 seconds and keep doing this all over your head.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about this</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t understand why this is so much better than a regular diffuser.</li>
            <li>BUT my curls were less frizzy, more defined, and had amazing volume!  </li>
            <li>It seemed to fit my Remington Hair Dryer fine, but after using it the first time, it warped and melted.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the next bright, shiny object is just that.</li>
            <li>It fits my blowdryer perfectly, but my dryer (Hot Tools Tourmaline Tools 2000) has a narrow nozzle.</li>
            <li>As much as these things cost they should have a better design.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only thing this is good for is giving lift to my roots.</li>
            <li>the full results).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the full results).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to trying this out because of the good reviews however this &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; diffuser does not even come close to fitting on my current hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I loved this, but after only 3 months of use, the arms started breaking off.</li>
            <li>Loving my natural hair and curls.</li>
            <li>I do use it, and it does decrease the frizz, but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job  of lifting my short curly hair from the roots.</li>
            <li>Love this diffuser and highly recommend for any one with curls!</li>
            <li>This gave my hair nice lift off my scalp and the rest of the curls are able to dry quickly with ambient air and they look well-defined.  </li>
            <li>I love this, I had one of the original ones and it broke and didn&#x27;t hesitate to order a new one.</li>
            <li>I thought for sure I&#x27;d have to buy a new dryer, but it really does stretch to fit!  </li>
            <li>one more time I won&#x27;t be able to get it back on the hair dryer</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is much cheaper to buy this attachment to put on any kind of dryer than buy the whole kit.</li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>It would also be nice if read the numerous reviews (over 50%) where the diffuser didn&#x27;t fit (or maybe they do and don&#x27;t care).</li>
            <li>My hair seems to be more soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It definitely brings them out in the best possible way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>im sure there must be another way to make this usable more universally.</li>
            <li>Made my hair super frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I have difficulty keeping volume up top, and this doesn&#x27;t do much better than a regular diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this one as I love the Deva styling products.  </li>
            <li>I love the new design and</li>
            <li>It started melting the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>I just hold it in place... which is tricky, and gets hot!</li>
            <li>However, I think I have more success with the basic diffuser my cheap hair dryer came with.</li>
            <li>Wish they made it more universal, and wish the description was clearer about fit.  </li>
            <li>This definately works if you want to make your natural curls, curlier. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It makes my waves look better than they ever have, and my hair has volume and soft, frizz-free texture.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I was pleased that it fit my hair drying which has a snap on diffuser that is not universal.  </li>
            <li>So far I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Made my naturally curly hair more frizzy.</li>
            <li>It also pretty easily fit over the end of my hot tools hair dryer.</li>
            <li>But my curls were still kind of frizzy and falling flat by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my eye on the original dryer and diffuser but just did not see myself spending that much for a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>once the right hairdryer was identified the defuser worked well.</li>
            <li>So, I went home, went on Amazon, bought it right away.</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t curl up right onto your scalp.  </li>
            <li>Devafuser slid right on the dryer and stayed put.</li>
            <li>With the right products and this DevaFuser</li>
            <li>First off, it didn&#x27;t fit on any of the 3 blow dryers I have, so they really shouldn&#x27;t say it fits &amp;#34;most&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even keep it on my main dryer, but it did fit on another one I had laying around.  </li>
            <li>- you can&#x27;t really use it just as a dryer - unless it&#x27;s right up next to your scalp it blows your hair around which is exactly what a diffuser is supposed to prevent - but it would probably be good for someone who wants super bouncy curls - not me.</li>
            <li>My curls are more spiraly (if that is a word), and there is barely any frizz.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really exciting for me because being able to wear my hair curly (and not blow it out) saves me so much time and with 22 month old twin boys time is at a premium these days.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t fit on my dryer had to get a new one</li>
            <li>Hair dries so much quicker and leaves hair looking more natural.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am extremely happy with this item and it has definitely improved my daily hair routine and appearance!to consider when purchasing this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am extremely happy with this item and it has definitely improved my daily hair routine and appearance!</li>
            <li>This is a very gentle way of blow drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>was hoping that maybe I had the magic dryer that would fit but should have listened to the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it on the Nordie&#x27;s website so that I could return it in case it didn&#x27;t fit any of my dryers, but was happy to see that it really is almost universal, unlike other diffusers I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it, but don&#x27;t expect it to fit on your blow dryer unless you have one with a really skinny nozzle.</li>
            <li>This made such a HUGE difference!  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning</li>
            <li>I have tried many diffusers depending on whether I wear my hair short or curly.  </li>
            <li>You may have to stretch the rubber part quite a bit the first time you put it on your dryer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it did any better job than my regular diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Much better than a standard diffuser!</li>
            <li>but it fit an old hair dryer that I had</li>
            <li>also it cracked the first time i used it but is still works BEWARE</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an interesting item, and i continue to TRY to use it, but still go back to my bowl diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I first heard about this product from my hair stylist.</li>
            <li>but I think I&#x27;m getting better now by scooping larger portions of my hair up with my non-blowdryer-holding-hand to position into this hand-type diffuser.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it because it took so much more time and the results were not significantly different</li>
            <li>It blows hot air from both sides, not just the palm side, so the hair drys faster, too.  </li>
            <li>Thanks..!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok if you can find a hair dryer it actually fits.</li>
            <li>I just got done drying my hair with this for the first time -- and</li>
            <li>Not any better than a regular diffuser.</li>
            <li>Ok, so this diffuser definitely gave me lots of volume...</li>
            <li>love big hair; however, I had a lot of frizz as well.</li>
            <li>My regular diffuser attachment does a much better job...and without the frizz.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Works better than the traditional diffusers.  </li>
            <li>I used it several times over the course of a week before writing my review, just to give it more than one opportunity.  </li>
            <li>I missed it while using a Hot Shot Tools dryer I bought from Sally&#x27;s and a diffuser.  </li>
            <li>my dryer can get uncomfortably hot if I use it on the hottest setting.</li>
            <li>So much frizz!  </li>
            <li>My regular diffuser works much better.</li>
            <li>A regular diffuser worked much better.</li>
            <li>Melted on the first use.</li>
            <li>I gave feedback in the first week.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately this diffuser, which looks like a great design does is not actually made to fit &#x27;most dryers.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>but don&#x27;t  used in high hot speed remember plastic melt...!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit the hairdryer my wife has--the air nozzle is too wide to fit.  </li>
            <li>I returned it and happily returned to my old, round diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted this product, and overall I love how it made my hair look.</li>
            <li>At first I needed to find a hairdryer that would fit the defuser (some are too short,others too wide and one was just right!)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would create much volume, but it really does!  </li>
            <li>But I was able to dry the roots and that&#x27;s what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This gets 4 starts rather than 5 simply because it&#x27;s not an easy travel piece.</li>
            <li>It is a very clever idea and it does penetrate to the roots of my hair.  </li>
            <li>much better results because it can dry the inside hair, instead of just drying the ends and outsides.  </li>
            <li>The fingers get the air into deeper parts of my scalp &amp; thusly provides more fullness (as areas not normally reached by the air in a cup diffuser wouldn&#x27;t get the impact that this product does by having finger-type thingies that pierce deeper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While it was nice, it didn&#x27;t work like this (gentle without tornado-like speed whipping my curls around into a frizzy mess).</li>
            <li>Mine is 1875w, which is pretty high.  </li>
            <li>have tried my cup shaped diffuser since purchasing this, to confirm my impression that this device (while increasing fullness without adding frizziness, &amp; providing minimal curl definition - more of a wave) didn&#x27;t create as much of a curly-curl to my hair.</li>

            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>We wish it fit short nosed hair dryers too!</li>
            <li>That said, my wife really likes the defuser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting ready to fall apart.  </li>
            <li>Be warned this is not a universal fit.  </li>
            <li>Does keep the curl in - but plumps my hair up too much.  </li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>so much pressure feels like it will break.</li>
            <li>all the newer hairdryers have a much bigger barrel, and this won&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>Mine is longer so it did not help me much.  </li>
            <li>If you have curly hair, get ready to feel like a million bucks.</li>
            <li>It does not, however, provide as much of a curl as the cup shaped diffusers, do.</li>
            <li>Delivered fast.</li>
            <li>If I scrunch my hair too much with the diffuser then it breaks my curl cast and</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s really great).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t see that much of a difference between the two.</li>
            <li>And can do this without much disruption to the curls.</li>
            <li>Use this with a gentle flow from a blow dryer and your curls will be what you always hoped they would be.</li>
            <li>I used this on twelve different blow dryers while traveling through Ireland and it fit them all</li>
            <li>(If your hair blows around too much, it will create frizz.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very bulky to use.</li>
            <li>I am a very routine-Deva user (DevaCare No Poo,</li>
            <li>It drys your hair evenly, and its very lightweight.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would caution it this diffuser doesn&#x27;t fit just any hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Would only fit a blow dryer with a diameter of 1 1/2 inches.</li>
            <li>This puts my hair moderately into the shape of a natural curl while drying and provides more curl than just using the diffuser as is.</li>
            <li>This puts my hair moderately into the shape of a natural curl while drying and provides more curl than just using the diffuser as is.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the kind of hair that gets all the way dry with a diffuser, and this one doesn&#x27;t do it either, but it gets me to the 75% dry faster than a regular one, and MUCH more evenly</li>
            <li>One side opened up more than the other, causing it to split a bit, but not broken and still usable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It did a pretty good job, I didn&#x27;t dry my hair as long as I would have liked since it was hard to hold it on.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use...and my hair dried quickly.  </li>
            <li>Was so excited to finally receive this in the mail.  </li>
            <li>more and more following the Curly Girl method but find that it&#x27;s not always feasible to leave the house with wet hair, especially in the winter months.</li>
            <li>Took about 15 minutes to dry my shoulder length fine 3B (spirals) hair.</li>
            <li>i wanted to LOVE this produce and am always down for trying a curly hair product.  </li>
            <li>I read other reviewers saying the device didn&#x27;t fit their hairdryers which definitely may be true of certain models</li>
            <li>nothing really more or less.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit every blow drier but works well giving a slower diffused dry for curly hair.</li>
            <li>As it currently stands, I&#x27;m alternating between my cup-shaped diffuser and this one.ng better now by scooping larger portions of my hair up with my non-blowdryer-holding-hand to position into this hand-type diffuser.</li>
            <li>I had the older version of the DevaFuser (and blow-dryer).  </li>
            <li>What I love about this diffuser is that you can approach your entire head from various angles and the air blows from both sides of the diffuser in addition to airflow coming from each side of the \\&quot;fingers\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The fingers also enable you to target specific areas that a bowl diffuser might not be able to get to, like the back of your head, without breaking up the curl/wave clumps.</li>
            <li>I like this curly diffuser, but like some people, I don&#x27;t think it necessarily works any better than a regular diffuser.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get your hopes up too high.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it works well with high heat.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I have a Revlon something or other that I bought on amazon a few years ago, it works great.</li>
            <li>It also works to introduce a little more volume because you lift the hair as it dries, this sort of stretches the roots</li>
            <li>Makes my daily routine much easier!!</li>
            <li>I expected my curls would look fabulous with this diffuser</li>
            <li>Once my hair completely dries, I can remove the clips, rescrunch hair gently to remove the gel cast</li>
            <li>Partially because they offered a Free gift with purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really does create soft, tousled curls.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used round diffusers for years, so when I saw this, I thought it would be fun and interesting to try something different.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so it did not fit on my blow dryer, my dryer has a wider end..</li>
            <li>It specifically did not fit, nor come close to fitting my dryer which is a Centrix QZone.  </li>
            <li>It is ok but is very large/long and makes my hair dryer difficult to fit anywhere when it is attached.  </li>
            <li>Been lazy the last few years and kind of just let the curls go their own way.</li>
            <li>less frizzy, more natural.</li>
            <li>I like the way I can lift, spray the roots with hair spray and dry to hold more simply with the diffuser.</li>
            <li>It fit onto my regular blow dryer, I use high heat and low air.  </li>
            <li>I fully knew i&#x27;d probably have to buy a new hairdryers, which i did.  </li>
            <li>She has curly hair just like me and even though I air-dry my hair during summer (I live in New York)</li>
            <li>Slightly more frizz than using a helmet diffuser, but gets to the undersides of thick hair much easier so faster drying times.</li>
            <li>A bit challenging as my dryers nozzle is short and wide</li>
            <li>see if the fit really is universal, I tried this on my cheapie Conair dryer, my T3 Featherweight (the regular model), and my Sedu Revolution.  </li>
            <li>I tried 6 different dryers at a local store just to find ONE that fit.</li>
            <li>The band that holds the bottom of the fuser together is a very strong, thick &#x27;rubber-band&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>When I first opened the box and saw how tiny the opening was</li>
            <li>My ordinary diffuser was better.</li>
            <li>but I never even got to try it because I couldn&#x27;t get it to go on my hair dryer, which seems to be a pretty standard size.</li>
            <li>Also it seems pretty sturdy as I have dropped it several times with no cracks or breaks.</li>
            <li>they should definitely make this diffuser more compatible with other brands or warn you that the elastic band is not stretchy AT ALL.</li>
            <li>My review is based upon my hair, which is naturally neither straight nor curly, but frizzy and puffy - very afro like without correct product &amp; maintenance (currently use Ouidad for frizz &amp; Kinky Kurly for curl).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wish I had read all the reviews about the diffuser not fitting most dryers.</li>
            <li>I do not usually write reviews.</li>
            <li>The difuser is definetly odd looking and don&#x27;t forget to put the rubber band on to secure it over your blow dryer or else</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but I really like how I have better control over where I can put the diffuser.</li>
            <li>I was using it on low power and high heat because there was nothing in the instructions that cautioned against using it on high heat.</li>
            <li>Had a little difficulty finding a blow dryer it would fit.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if those who had dryers that fit the diffuser were older models or what,</li>
            <li>I had my doubts because many people complained about the fuser melting, well, that did not happen with my old con air dryer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the reviews about the plastic melting, My hair is medium-thick and I used the highest heat setting and had no trouble.</li>
            <li>i have an old revlon drying i have had for about 5 years now</li>
            <li>As far as my understanding of this product, however, you used this attachment to your dryer as another hand.</li>
            <li>then my old defuser.</li>
            <li>I got lift at the roots that was needed and my hair is so soft.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know how much longer it will last.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t see any improvement over my regular defuser.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work like my traditional diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Completely unimpressed by how it worked.  </li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t follow the \\&quot;hold in each spot for two minutes\\&quot;, it still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worked the back with getting in a bulk of my hair into it gently and letting it work there for awhile, then moved to the sides.  </li>
            <li>I have been embracing my hair&#x27;s natural wave pattern (2b)</li>
            <li>but my curls are soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>had been reading about DevaCurl and thought of giving it a try, buying the fuser which I use with my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li>but I have to say I am very concerned that it won&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea behind this diffuser</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time with a more expensive new hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I have hair that when stretched reaches to the top of my waist, and it got my hair mostly dry in about ten minutes with my T3 Featherweight dryer.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, she put a handful of mousse for my full head and gave it a slight scrunch and lifted it using this.</li>
            <li>; in diameter - which is entirely conventional), but we went to the hair care department of a local store with a measuring device, and found it would not have fit any of the units they had there either.  </li>
            <li>I tried to fit this on three different hair dryers, with no success.  </li>
            <li>The first few times getting the diffuser on the hair dyer I had to really shove it on, twist it back-and-forth, etc.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does get hot, so you&#x27;ll want to use this on low heat and low air flow with your dryer.  </li>
            <li>I have little friz and my waves are more curls (if I lay on the floor and dry them)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use, I can blow dry my hair without the frizziness or the need to use any other tool.</li>
            <li>I really had to push harder than expected, but when it finally slipped on it is secure and works</li>
            <li>i had such high hopes.  </li>
            <li>The DevaFuser is a bit more expensive ther regular defusers, but it was worth the additional cost</li>
            <li>it reduces the frizz that I normally get with a regular defuser.</li>
            <li>It fits my Conair and my T3, but not my Sedu, which has a pretty wide nozzle.  </li>
            <li>Unless you plan to buy a new one several times a year, I would stay away from this diffuser.</li>
            <li>Most reviewers discuss how hard it is to put on their dryer!  </li>
            <li>and I can dry my curly perm fast and ez</li>
            <li>I did not dry my hair completely because I prefer the look when it air-dries.  </li>
            <li>Obviously we are returning it, and suggest that, unless you have a very slim-diameter unit, you buy a different brand.</li>
            <li>Not very easy to use on fine, long hair.</li>
            <li>Often I usually alternate with the warm setting, but if I use that too long then my scalp starts to feel too hot and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>If you have had a good diffuser, the results won&#x27;t be different if your curls are anything like mine (thin hair, lots of volume, loose curls with frizz).  </li>
            <li>Hard to find a dryer it fit</li>
            <li>at least one that kinda fit this guy,</li>
            <li>I can say now, though, is this product definitely increases volume of my hair - and does this without impacting my hair&#x27;s natural propensity to frizz.</li>
            <li>but the whole interior of your hair is still wet?  </li>
            <li>I called Devashon, spoke to someone there, and she told me &amp;#34;we are having a problem&amp;#34; with this unit -- which tells me we are far from the only ones.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions too and barely moved it.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty universal - I&#x27;d assume thicker barrels would be harder to get on it</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see instructions included in the ad, so I purchased kind of blindly.</li>
            <li>Big hand, but doesn&#x27;t dry fast.</li>
            <li>DevaFuser is worth it if you are looking to dry your curls carefully.  </li>
            <li>This may or may not be due to my use of the product, but the fact is that my hair curls more when placed in a curl type position while slowly drying, which the cup shaped diffuser naturally does.</li>
            <li>have fine, 2C waves, and this gently dried them, with minimal frizz.  </li>
            <li>I bought it hoping I could use it traveling, since it&#x27;s supposed to be universal, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t fit usual hotel hair dryers.</li>
            <li>hard to fit on my standard hair dryer without feeling like its going to break.</li>
            <li>(whereas with this device the minimal curls created do extend further out, as the diffusion goes straight to the scalp - explaining</li>
            <li>(whereas with this device the minimal curls created do extend further out, as the diffusion goes straight to the scalp - explaining</li>
            <li>Fixing my hair took much less time, looks great, and my girlfriend said the back of my head looks curlier and less flat than usual.</li>
            <li>use my blow dryer on high with a low heat setting, my hair is dry in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once I turned on the dryer, I was worried there wasn&#x27;t enough air flow coming out of the attachment, I could barely feel it.  </li>
            <li>It created massive frizz and took far too long.</li>
            <li>oh wet to dry straighter, really?</li>
            <li>Left my hair LESS curly and not as much volume as I get with my regular diffuser.</li>
            <li>But I really love all the other DevaCurl products I use regularly: (One Condition, no-poo shampoo,  light defining gel, styling cream, and frizz-free volumizing foam).</li>

            <li> Not that I figured it out it works great every time.  </li>
            <li> This diffuser is great.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, though the product works great for us curly headed people, it is not sturdy.</li>

            <li> Great for curly hair</li>
            <li> The vendor was great.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective diffuser, because it can sit inside the hair instead of just pushing from the ends.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like hotels come stocked with amazing defusers!</li>
            <li> This really is amazing!</li>

            <li> This adds volume to the top of my hair which is great.</li>

            <li> /&gt;UPDATE ON 1-12-13:  I am still absolutely in LOVE with this diffuser!  </li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it !</li>
            <li> It works amazingly.</li>
            <li> This amazing thing gave me corkscrew curls all over.</li>
            <li> Barely fit my t3 but works great.</li>
            <li> It was great in the salon, but didn&#x27;t fit my hair dryer, so I had to return it.  </li>
            <li> they stay nicely formed and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Extremely effective.</li>
            <li> goodness, what kind of dryer do you have?</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with it, along with the fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with it, along with the fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of dryer others have that cause</li>
            <li> I guess I always thought that I just had &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; curls - not the nice, smoothe looking curls/waves I always wanted and then came the DevaFuser.  </li>
            <li> This crazy-looking attachment is fantastic for loving your curls when drying!  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s a good idea to take it on a trip since it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li> Love, love, love, this diffuser!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love, LOVE this diffuser!  </li>
            <li> Got a hot sock instead that works great.</li>
            <li> The devacurl fits fine on my hairdryer and the fingers are nice for lifting underneath curl sections and drying from two directions.  </li>
            <li> HUGE!  </li>
            <li> Really love it.</li>
            <li> And much more portable than a helmet diffuser, of course.</li>
            <li> Love how it works the curls....</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li> love the circulation and the way it dries my hair without making it frizzy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is great for gently holding up your curls while drying so</li>
            <li> The price is better on this than when I purchased.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, but</li>
            <li> So at $25 dollars, I&#x27; wouldn&#x27;t advise another friend not to purchase but anything more</li>
            <li> I wonder if that&#x27;s why so many people have a problem.</li>
            <li> I found a hairdryer to finally fit it!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this diffuser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought it would be ok.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok -</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this product now about 2 weeks, and my fluency with the product may get better.</li>
            <li> hence more</li>
            <li> For this reason, this device may become better over time.</li>
            <li> hence more</li>
            <li> For this reason, this device may become better over time.</li>
            <li> Love the style.</li>
            <li> LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> I love the design of this diffuser.</li>
            <li> For this price, they should have chosen more durable material.  </li>
            <li> I am getting better at it.  </li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s any better than another diffuser or a cloth cover.</li>
            <li> and it supposedly fits most hair dryers.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this diffuser.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t realize that this is more for longer curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> Better than most diffusers.</li>
            <li> It mostly just increased the frizziness of my hair, and didn&#x27;t help set the curl at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to my bowl diffuser which works better for me.  </li>
            <li> They fell in love.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you slide it all the way on</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you slide it all the way on</li>
            <li> There are plenty of wonderful videos on YouTube that demonstrate different ways to use the DevaFuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok - I read all the raving reviews and thought that I would try this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair just got 90 percent easier and quicker to do and looks 100 percent better.  </li>
            <li> More waves - more</li>
            <li> One of the biggest selling points for me was the promise of more volume and curl.</li>
            <li> I get more volume and wave from a blowout.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of it and enjoy the devacurl products for my swavy hair</li>
            <li> Hopefully, I&#x27;ll be able to return it.</li>
            <li> What i like about it the most, is that it has ventilators holes all over the place.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine this fitting on any hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Maybe a beautician could do a better job with it.  </li>
            <li> Love the way this product works</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got a curly perm or natural curls Run and buy this , it is fabulous, I love love love mine!!!  </li>
            <li> was very excited when i saw this</li>
            <li> I was very excited to buy one after my stylist used one to do my hair.</li>
            <li> and I have soft, shiny, beautiful curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;bowl&amp;#34; diffuser (which came with the NEW hairdryer i purchased to work with this product) thankfully works great.  </li>
            <li> I ended up being able to use it on my travel dryer just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I waited until this was redesigned to fit on any drier.  </li>
            <li> At its widest, seems like it would fit most hair dryers.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit mine and when I took it to a store that had about 10 to choose from, it didn&#x27;t fit ANY!  </li>
            <li> but I think DevaCurl should address this issue by either modifying their design or telling people it won&#x27;t fit most of the dryers on the market.  </li>
            <li> It states that it &amp;#34;fits most hair dryers&amp;#34; however  it didn&#x27;t fit the one I have .  </li>
            <li> It fit my dryer chi low emf brilliant.</li>
            <li> Now I can get it on easily, but it still fits snugly around the hairdyer.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see that many great reviews about this tool but took a risk at my local beauty store and bought it.</li>
            <li> I always thought my normal diffuser did a good job</li>
            <li> Fits fine on dryer.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair</li>
            <li> It seems to help reduce frizz in my 3b, fine, BSL hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this odd looking tool.</li>
            <li> Also dries hair more quickly.</li>
            <li> It fit my blowdryer just fine</li>
            <li> I wish I had returned mine because at almost forty dollars, it was a HUGE rip off.  </li>
            <li> By the way, it is huge.....</li>
            <li> There is a huge gap at the seams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found that the DevaCurl products make a huge difference too.  </li>
            <li> Had to go to a hair salon supply store to find a hair dryer that it would fit on.</li>
            <li> It fit over the dryer but did not stay in place.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit two dryers I have.  </li>
            <li> it doesnt fit all dryers</li>
            <li> did not hate it, but it&#x27;s not my go-to attachment either.</li>
            <li> I was trying to figure out before I bought this if it fit the T3 hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, I have Prime and didn&#x27;t have to pay return shipping.</li>
            <li> for instructions - there weren&#x27;t any detailed provided on the box, either, and were no instruction booklets.</li>
            <li> This is such a great diffuser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the fabulous diffuser:  </li>
            <li> the fit with my hairdryer:  </li>
            <li> So I did my research online and measured the nozzle of the diffuser attachment and determined that the nozzle of the blow drier had to be about 1.5&amp;#34; measured across the nozzle for attachment to fit.</li>
            <li> Forget the reviews that say it won&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li> I think on my trip, it maybe fit 1 out of about 10.</li>
            <li> and I do think it will fit on every hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my hairdryer.</li>
            <li> The diffuser is a snug fit, and I would not want to take it off and on a lot.</li>
            <li> but for some reason it does not stay securely attached to the blow dryer&#x27;s nozzle.</li>
            <li> but I, too, thought this didn&#x27;t fit mine until I realized that I had to push it all the way onto the barrel</li>
            <li> OMG it is truly fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try to get a babyblisspro dryer, as one person mentioned it fit.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t fit my dryer.  </li>
            <li> Well, it didn&#x27;t fit on my dryer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit my hair dryer, so now I have a diffuser I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> It will fit over just about any blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It does an amazing job at keeping my curls not frizzy and it drys my hair really fast</li>
            <li> But I have one of those Conair round brush blowdryers, and it fit perfectly on that.  </li>
            <li> Now that its available on its own, I really wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li> A regular diffuser does just a good of job, this is over priced and I does not seem to be able to handle the heat because it is coming apart.</li>
            <li> I took mine to Target and tried a few of the sample one they had out, to see which one it would fit on best.</li>
            <li> Probably best for long curly hair; mine is short, but I get a nice tousled look.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I love my curls when using the DevaFuser to dry them (even more so than air drying).  </li>
            <li> It is also handy to dry the roots to achieve a nice lift.  </li>
            <li> As a user of DevaCurl products for over a year - I was excited to try this since all their products are amazeballs.</li>
            <li> It does take longer to use, but its totally worth it!</li>
            <li> so i was excited</li>
            <li> I found this unique diffuser while searching for a replacement diffuser for mine that had just died.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this because I am a fan of all Deva products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to hold it no more than 5 seconds and keep doing this all over your head.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t understand why this is so much better than a regular diffuser.</li>
            <li> BUT my curls were less frizzy, more defined, and had amazing volume!  </li>
            <li> It seemed to fit my Remington Hair Dryer fine, but after using it the first time, it warped and melted.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the next bright, shiny object is just that.</li>
            <li> It fits my blowdryer perfectly, but my dryer (Hot Tools Tourmaline Tools 2000) has a narrow nozzle.</li>
            <li> As much as these things cost they should have a better design.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only thing this is good for is giving lift to my roots.</li>
            <li> the full results).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the full results).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to trying this out because of the good reviews however this &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; diffuser does not even come close to fitting on my current hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I loved this, but after only 3 months of use, the arms started breaking off.</li>
            <li> Loving my natural hair and curls.</li>
            <li> I do use it, and it does decrease the frizz, but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job  of lifting my short curly hair from the roots.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser and highly recommend for any one with curls!</li>
            <li> This gave my hair nice lift off my scalp and the rest of the curls are able to dry quickly with ambient air and they look well-defined.  </li>
            <li> I love this, I had one of the original ones and it broke and didn&#x27;t hesitate to order a new one.</li>
            <li> I thought for sure I&#x27;d have to buy a new dryer, but it really does stretch to fit!  </li>
            <li> one more time I won&#x27;t be able to get it back on the hair dryer</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is much cheaper to buy this attachment to put on any kind of dryer than buy the whole kit.</li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> It would also be nice if read the numerous reviews (over 50%) where the diffuser didn&#x27;t fit (or maybe they do and don&#x27;t care).</li>
            <li> My hair seems to be more soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It definitely brings them out in the best possible way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> im sure there must be another way to make this usable more universally.</li>
            <li> Made my hair super frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have difficulty keeping volume up top, and this doesn&#x27;t do much better than a regular diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this one as I love the Deva styling products.  </li>
            <li> I love the new design and</li>
            <li> It started melting the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> I just hold it in place... which is tricky, and gets hot!</li>
            <li> However, I think I have more success with the basic diffuser my cheap hair dryer came with.</li>
            <li> Wish they made it more universal, and wish the description was clearer about fit.  </li>
            <li> This definately works if you want to make your natural curls, curlier. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It makes my waves look better than they ever have, and my hair has volume and soft, frizz-free texture.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I was pleased that it fit my hair drying which has a snap on diffuser that is not universal.  </li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Made my naturally curly hair more frizzy.</li>
            <li> It also pretty easily fit over the end of my hot tools hair dryer.</li>
            <li> But my curls were still kind of frizzy and falling flat by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my eye on the original dryer and diffuser but just did not see myself spending that much for a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> once the right hairdryer was identified the defuser worked well.</li>
            <li> So, I went home, went on Amazon, bought it right away.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t curl up right onto your scalp.  </li>
            <li> Devafuser slid right on the dryer and stayed put.</li>
            <li> With the right products and this DevaFuser</li>
            <li> First off, it didn&#x27;t fit on any of the 3 blow dryers I have, so they really shouldn&#x27;t say it fits &amp;#34;most&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even keep it on my main dryer, but it did fit on another one I had laying around.  </li>
            <li> - you can&#x27;t really use it just as a dryer - unless it&#x27;s right up next to your scalp it blows your hair around which is exactly what a diffuser is supposed to prevent - but it would probably be good for someone who wants super bouncy curls - not me.</li>
            <li> My curls are more spiraly (if that is a word), and there is barely any frizz.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really exciting for me because being able to wear my hair curly (and not blow it out) saves me so much time and with 22 month old twin boys time is at a premium these days.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t fit on my dryer had to get a new one</li>
            <li> Hair dries so much quicker and leaves hair looking more natural.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am extremely happy with this item and it has definitely improved my daily hair routine and appearance!to consider when purchasing this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am extremely happy with this item and it has definitely improved my daily hair routine and appearance!</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle way of blow drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> was hoping that maybe I had the magic dryer that would fit but should have listened to the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it on the Nordie&#x27;s website so that I could return it in case it didn&#x27;t fit any of my dryers, but was happy to see that it really is almost universal, unlike other diffusers I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it, but don&#x27;t expect it to fit on your blow dryer unless you have one with a really skinny nozzle.</li>
            <li> This made such a HUGE difference!  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this morning</li>
            <li> I have tried many diffusers depending on whether I wear my hair short or curly.  </li>
            <li> You may have to stretch the rubber part quite a bit the first time you put it on your dryer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it did any better job than my regular diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Much better than a standard diffuser!</li>
            <li> but it fit an old hair dryer that I had</li>
            <li> also it cracked the first time i used it but is still works BEWARE</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an interesting item, and i continue to TRY to use it, but still go back to my bowl diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I first heard about this product from my hair stylist.</li>
            <li> but I think I&#x27;m getting better now by scooping larger portions of my hair up with my non-blowdryer-holding-hand to position into this hand-type diffuser.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because it took so much more time and the results were not significantly different</li>
            <li> It blows hot air from both sides, not just the palm side, so the hair drys faster, too.  </li>
            <li> Thanks..!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok if you can find a hair dryer it actually fits.</li>
            <li> I just got done drying my hair with this for the first time -- and</li>
            <li> Not any better than a regular diffuser.</li>
            <li> Ok, so this diffuser definitely gave me lots of volume...</li>
            <li> love big hair; however, I had a lot of frizz as well.</li>
            <li> My regular diffuser attachment does a much better job...and without the frizz.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Works better than the traditional diffusers.  </li>
            <li> I used it several times over the course of a week before writing my review, just to give it more than one opportunity.  </li>
            <li> I missed it while using a Hot Shot Tools dryer I bought from Sally&#x27;s and a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> my dryer can get uncomfortably hot if I use it on the hottest setting.</li>
            <li> So much frizz!  </li>
            <li> My regular diffuser works much better.</li>
            <li> A regular diffuser worked much better.</li>
            <li> Melted on the first use.</li>
            <li> I gave feedback in the first week.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this diffuser, which looks like a great design does is not actually made to fit &#x27;most dryers.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> but don&#x27;t  used in high hot speed remember plastic melt...!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit the hairdryer my wife has--the air nozzle is too wide to fit.  </li>
            <li> I returned it and happily returned to my old, round diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted this product, and overall I love how it made my hair look.</li>
            <li> At first I needed to find a hairdryer that would fit the defuser (some are too short,others too wide and one was just right!)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would create much volume, but it really does!  </li>
            <li> But I was able to dry the roots and that&#x27;s what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This gets 4 starts rather than 5 simply because it&#x27;s not an easy travel piece.</li>
            <li> It is a very clever idea and it does penetrate to the roots of my hair.  </li>
            <li> much better results because it can dry the inside hair, instead of just drying the ends and outsides.  </li>
            <li> The fingers get the air into deeper parts of my scalp &amp; thusly provides more fullness (as areas not normally reached by the air in a cup diffuser wouldn&#x27;t get the impact that this product does by having finger-type thingies that pierce deeper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While it was nice, it didn&#x27;t work like this (gentle without tornado-like speed whipping my curls around into a frizzy mess).</li>
            <li> Mine is 1875w, which is pretty high.  </li>
            <li> have tried my cup shaped diffuser since purchasing this, to confirm my impression that this device (while increasing fullness without adding frizziness, &amp; providing minimal curl definition - more of a wave) didn&#x27;t create as much of a curly-curl to my hair.</li>

            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> We wish it fit short nosed hair dryers too!</li>
            <li> That said, my wife really likes the defuser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting ready to fall apart.  </li>
            <li> Be warned this is not a universal fit.  </li>
            <li> Does keep the curl in - but plumps my hair up too much.  </li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> so much pressure feels like it will break.</li>
            <li> all the newer hairdryers have a much bigger barrel, and this won&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li> Mine is longer so it did not help me much.  </li>
            <li> If you have curly hair, get ready to feel like a million bucks.</li>
            <li> It does not, however, provide as much of a curl as the cup shaped diffusers, do.</li>
            <li> Delivered fast.</li>
            <li> If I scrunch my hair too much with the diffuser then it breaks my curl cast and</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s really great).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t see that much of a difference between the two.</li>
            <li> And can do this without much disruption to the curls.</li>
            <li> Use this with a gentle flow from a blow dryer and your curls will be what you always hoped they would be.</li>
            <li> I used this on twelve different blow dryers while traveling through Ireland and it fit them all</li>
            <li> (If your hair blows around too much, it will create frizz.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very bulky to use.</li>
            <li> I am a very routine-Deva user (DevaCare No Poo,</li>
            <li> It drys your hair evenly, and its very lightweight.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would caution it this diffuser doesn&#x27;t fit just any hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Would only fit a blow dryer with a diameter of 1 1/2 inches.</li>
            <li> This puts my hair moderately into the shape of a natural curl while drying and provides more curl than just using the diffuser as is.</li>
            <li> This puts my hair moderately into the shape of a natural curl while drying and provides more curl than just using the diffuser as is.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the kind of hair that gets all the way dry with a diffuser, and this one doesn&#x27;t do it either, but it gets me to the 75% dry faster than a regular one, and MUCH more evenly</li>
            <li> One side opened up more than the other, causing it to split a bit, but not broken and still usable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It did a pretty good job, I didn&#x27;t dry my hair as long as I would have liked since it was hard to hold it on.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use...and my hair dried quickly.  </li>
            <li> Was so excited to finally receive this in the mail.  </li>
            <li> more and more following the Curly Girl method but find that it&#x27;s not always feasible to leave the house with wet hair, especially in the winter months.</li>
            <li> Took about 15 minutes to dry my shoulder length fine 3B (spirals) hair.</li>
            <li> i wanted to LOVE this produce and am always down for trying a curly hair product.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviewers saying the device didn&#x27;t fit their hairdryers which definitely may be true of certain models</li>
            <li> nothing really more or less.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit every blow drier but works well giving a slower diffused dry for curly hair.</li>
            <li> As it currently stands, I&#x27;m alternating between my cup-shaped diffuser and this one.ng better now by scooping larger portions of my hair up with my non-blowdryer-holding-hand to position into this hand-type diffuser.</li>
            <li> I had the older version of the DevaFuser (and blow-dryer).  </li>
            <li> What I love about this diffuser is that you can approach your entire head from various angles and the air blows from both sides of the diffuser in addition to airflow coming from each side of the \\&quot;fingers\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The fingers also enable you to target specific areas that a bowl diffuser might not be able to get to, like the back of your head, without breaking up the curl/wave clumps.</li>
            <li> I like this curly diffuser, but like some people, I don&#x27;t think it necessarily works any better than a regular diffuser.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get your hopes up too high.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it works well with high heat.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I have a Revlon something or other that I bought on amazon a few years ago, it works great.</li>
            <li> It also works to introduce a little more volume because you lift the hair as it dries, this sort of stretches the roots</li>
            <li> Makes my daily routine much easier!!</li>
            <li> I expected my curls would look fabulous with this diffuser</li>
            <li> Once my hair completely dries, I can remove the clips, rescrunch hair gently to remove the gel cast</li>
            <li> Partially because they offered a Free gift with purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really does create soft, tousled curls.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used round diffusers for years, so when I saw this, I thought it would be fun and interesting to try something different.  </li>
            <li> Ok, so it did not fit on my blow dryer, my dryer has a wider end..</li>
            <li> It specifically did not fit, nor come close to fitting my dryer which is a Centrix QZone.  </li>
            <li> It is ok but is very large/long and makes my hair dryer difficult to fit anywhere when it is attached.  </li>
            <li> Been lazy the last few years and kind of just let the curls go their own way.</li>
            <li> less frizzy, more natural.</li>
            <li> I like the way I can lift, spray the roots with hair spray and dry to hold more simply with the diffuser.</li>
            <li> It fit onto my regular blow dryer, I use high heat and low air.  </li>
            <li> I fully knew i&#x27;d probably have to buy a new hairdryers, which i did.  </li>
            <li> She has curly hair just like me and even though I air-dry my hair during summer (I live in New York)</li>
            <li> Slightly more frizz than using a helmet diffuser, but gets to the undersides of thick hair much easier so faster drying times.</li>
            <li> A bit challenging as my dryers nozzle is short and wide</li>
            <li> see if the fit really is universal, I tried this on my cheapie Conair dryer, my T3 Featherweight (the regular model), and my Sedu Revolution.  </li>
            <li> I tried 6 different dryers at a local store just to find ONE that fit.</li>
            <li> The band that holds the bottom of the fuser together is a very strong, thick &#x27;rubber-band&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened the box and saw how tiny the opening was</li>
            <li> My ordinary diffuser was better.</li>
            <li> but I never even got to try it because I couldn&#x27;t get it to go on my hair dryer, which seems to be a pretty standard size.</li>
            <li> Also it seems pretty sturdy as I have dropped it several times with no cracks or breaks.</li>
            <li> they should definitely make this diffuser more compatible with other brands or warn you that the elastic band is not stretchy AT ALL.</li>
            <li> My review is based upon my hair, which is naturally neither straight nor curly, but frizzy and puffy - very afro like without correct product &amp; maintenance (currently use Ouidad for frizz &amp; Kinky Kurly for curl).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish I had read all the reviews about the diffuser not fitting most dryers.</li>
            <li> I do not usually write reviews.</li>
            <li> The difuser is definetly odd looking and don&#x27;t forget to put the rubber band on to secure it over your blow dryer or else</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but I really like how I have better control over where I can put the diffuser.</li>
            <li> I was using it on low power and high heat because there was nothing in the instructions that cautioned against using it on high heat.</li>
            <li> Had a little difficulty finding a blow dryer it would fit.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if those who had dryers that fit the diffuser were older models or what,</li>
            <li> I had my doubts because many people complained about the fuser melting, well, that did not happen with my old con air dryer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the reviews about the plastic melting, My hair is medium-thick and I used the highest heat setting and had no trouble.</li>
            <li> i have an old revlon drying i have had for about 5 years now</li>
            <li> As far as my understanding of this product, however, you used this attachment to your dryer as another hand.</li>
            <li> then my old defuser.</li>
            <li> I got lift at the roots that was needed and my hair is so soft.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know how much longer it will last.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t see any improvement over my regular defuser.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work like my traditional diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Completely unimpressed by how it worked.  </li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t follow the \\&quot;hold in each spot for two minutes\\&quot;, it still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worked the back with getting in a bulk of my hair into it gently and letting it work there for awhile, then moved to the sides.  </li>
            <li> I have been embracing my hair&#x27;s natural wave pattern (2b)</li>
            <li> but my curls are soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> had been reading about DevaCurl and thought of giving it a try, buying the fuser which I use with my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> but I have to say I am very concerned that it won&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea behind this diffuser</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time with a more expensive new hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I have hair that when stretched reaches to the top of my waist, and it got my hair mostly dry in about ten minutes with my T3 Featherweight dryer.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, she put a handful of mousse for my full head and gave it a slight scrunch and lifted it using this.</li>
            <li> ; in diameter - which is entirely conventional), but we went to the hair care department of a local store with a measuring device, and found it would not have fit any of the units they had there either.  </li>
            <li> I tried to fit this on three different hair dryers, with no success.  </li>
            <li> The first few times getting the diffuser on the hair dyer I had to really shove it on, twist it back-and-forth, etc.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does get hot, so you&#x27;ll want to use this on low heat and low air flow with your dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have little friz and my waves are more curls (if I lay on the floor and dry them)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use, I can blow dry my hair without the frizziness or the need to use any other tool.</li>
            <li> I really had to push harder than expected, but when it finally slipped on it is secure and works</li>
            <li> i had such high hopes.  </li>
            <li> The DevaFuser is a bit more expensive ther regular defusers, but it was worth the additional cost</li>
            <li> it reduces the frizz that I normally get with a regular defuser.</li>
            <li> It fits my Conair and my T3, but not my Sedu, which has a pretty wide nozzle.  </li>
            <li> Unless you plan to buy a new one several times a year, I would stay away from this diffuser.</li>
            <li> Most reviewers discuss how hard it is to put on their dryer!  </li>
            <li> and I can dry my curly perm fast and ez</li>
            <li> I did not dry my hair completely because I prefer the look when it air-dries.  </li>
            <li> Obviously we are returning it, and suggest that, unless you have a very slim-diameter unit, you buy a different brand.</li>
            <li> Not very easy to use on fine, long hair.</li>
            <li> Often I usually alternate with the warm setting, but if I use that too long then my scalp starts to feel too hot and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> If you have had a good diffuser, the results won&#x27;t be different if your curls are anything like mine (thin hair, lots of volume, loose curls with frizz).  </li>
            <li> Hard to find a dryer it fit</li>
            <li> at least one that kinda fit this guy,</li>
            <li> I can say now, though, is this product definitely increases volume of my hair - and does this without impacting my hair&#x27;s natural propensity to frizz.</li>
            <li> but the whole interior of your hair is still wet?  </li>
            <li> I called Devashon, spoke to someone there, and she told me &amp;#34;we are having a problem&amp;#34; with this unit -- which tells me we are far from the only ones.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions too and barely moved it.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty universal - I&#x27;d assume thicker barrels would be harder to get on it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see instructions included in the ad, so I purchased kind of blindly.</li>
            <li> Big hand, but doesn&#x27;t dry fast.</li>
            <li> DevaFuser is worth it if you are looking to dry your curls carefully.  </li>
            <li> This may or may not be due to my use of the product, but the fact is that my hair curls more when placed in a curl type position while slowly drying, which the cup shaped diffuser naturally does.</li>
            <li> have fine, 2C waves, and this gently dried them, with minimal frizz.  </li>
            <li> I bought it hoping I could use it traveling, since it&#x27;s supposed to be universal, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t fit usual hotel hair dryers.</li>
            <li> hard to fit on my standard hair dryer without feeling like its going to break.</li>
            <li> (whereas with this device the minimal curls created do extend further out, as the diffusion goes straight to the scalp - explaining</li>
            <li> (whereas with this device the minimal curls created do extend further out, as the diffusion goes straight to the scalp - explaining</li>
            <li> Fixing my hair took much less time, looks great, and my girlfriend said the back of my head looks curlier and less flat than usual.</li>
            <li> use my blow dryer on high with a low heat setting, my hair is dry in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Once I turned on the dryer, I was worried there wasn&#x27;t enough air flow coming out of the attachment, I could barely feel it.  </li>
            <li> It created massive frizz and took far too long.</li>
            <li> oh wet to dry straighter, really?</li>
            <li> Left my hair LESS curly and not as much volume as I get with my regular diffuser.</li>
            <li> But I really love all the other DevaCurl products I use regularly: (One Condition, no-poo shampoo,  light defining gel, styling cream, and frizz-free volumizing foam).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out any other way to use this on my own, at least not significant differences outside tilting my head one way versus another.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out any other way to use this on my own, at least not significant differences outside tilting my head one way versus another.</li>
            <li> I finally got it on, but then one of the screws on the side came undone due to the pressure of how far it had to stretch.</li>
            <li> i would NOT recommend and it does NOT fit MOST hairdryers, like the reviews say - the opening is VERY small.  </li>
            <li> Up until this product, I&#x27;ve only ever seen/known diffusers that are bowl or flat shaped but circular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that my hair is actually wavier/borderline curly when I take the time to diffuse it using the DevaFuser, probably because it gently dries wet hair, forming and establishing the curl pattern, unlike with air drying in which the weight of the water in the hair can weigh it down and elongate or pull out the curl pattern.</li>
            <li> My hair has been changing from straight to wavy for the past couple of years, and I had no idea what to do with it, as with the slightest humidity would become frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This diffuser does not fit on normal hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty slow</li>
            <li> it makes it so my hair doesn&#x27;t fall flat at the roots!</li>
            <li> I will update my review after I get a new dryer and try it out a few times.</li>
            <li> I discover Deva products for curly hair a few years ago and cannot live without them.  </li>
            <li> , very east to put on, the only negative thing i have to say about it is , if you have never used it before it does take some getting used to, so i do reccomend watching youtube videos and things like that, also i will recomment getting the Deva styling prodects as well.</li>
            <li> She grabbed this oddly shaped item (the old version which has a square bottom not elastic).</li>
            <li> Not only is it dry</li>
            <li> There were only a few pictures with key words next to the pictures posted on the actual box.</li>
            <li> Using the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; setting is simply impractical -- my hair would take hours to dry on &amp;#34;cool,&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s not even beyond shoulder length!</li>
            <li> I know there were also complaints about it melting or not fitting, and I had mine on high and the hottest setting and haven&#x27;t had any issues.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I  struggled and struggled to get this to fit my Compact Vidal Sassoon dryer and no matter how I tried to attach it...</li>
            <li> I too was unable to get the attachment to fit.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t fit my dryer - but, that&#x27;s my fault as I didn&#x27;t bother to measure it before I bought it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long for it to melt and come apart.  </li>
            <li> Purchased at wifes request, she likes this for her long curly hair....</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving it in one spot for a long time.</li>
            <li> Strangely, the box does not contain any instructions on how they suggest getting it on.</li>
            <li> Very long hair will probably not completely \\&quot;fit\\&quot; into this diffuser the way that it might with a bowl diffuser, so that might be something to consider when purchasing this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did notice some separation at the attachment site when I put it on my Chi (hard to describe without a picture), but the thick rubber band seems to hold this diffuser in place fine.</li>
            <li> My curls look so different than the did with other diffusers,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve attempted other diffuser with mixed results.  </li>
            <li> It would take a very long time to dry my hair with this DevaFuser.  </li>
            <li> Really awkward to use, and definitely can&#x27;t take it to travel with you as the attachment is huge.</li>
            <li> and now I can dry the hair at my roots before heading out the door.  </li>
            <li> The design of this diffuser helps dry my hair while minimizing frizz and creating fantastically defined waves.  </li>
            <li> Hair slides off of it when trying to dry.</li>
            <li> , I need to blow dry it during winter</li>
            <li> So I asked her what can I do during winter to dry my hair and get that va-va-voom curls without the frizz.</li>
            <li> While doing this, the finger-thingies still dry area beyond the scrunched up hair -</li>
            <li> While doing this, the finger-thingies still dry area beyond the scrunched up hair -</li>
            <li> I dry my hair about 80% of the way as the manufacturer suggests, then let it air dry the rest of the way.  </li>
            <li> You know how your ends get dry</li>
            <li> I thought it would take forever for my hair to dry.  </li>
            <li> I can get it close to my head and get the roots dry without over drying the ends.</li>
            <li> I recommend to anyone with curly hair and needs to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> Helps dry the hair closest to scalp.</li>
            <li> But it deserves a single star in my book.  </li>
            <li> im sending it back its not worth 44 dollars</li>
            <li> I did  return this as I found it unwieldy to hold and not really useful for short hair which I have.</li>
            <li> So I need to buy a new blow dryer which I&#x27;m not totally thrilled about.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d rather air dry!</li>
            <li> There is a slight learning curve especially trying to figure out how to hold the dryer and position the hand in your hair.  </li>
            <li> all the devacurl blow dryers i am seeing are super expensive and include this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> This, coupled with the bowl diffuser&#x27;s awkwardness when trying to dry certain areas of my hair, proved frustrating.  </li>
            <li> A little big and clunky.</li>
            <li> But pretty disappointing generally.</li>
            <li> This will not fit 2 different dryers I have.</li>
            <li> Does not fit well on a standard blow dryer</li>
            <li> and i fully expected it to be ackward until i got used to it.  </li>
            <li> Not a problem... it is minimal.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful to keep the diffuser in one place on my head for awhile like the instructions say, as this reduces frizz.  </li>
            <li> are way too wide to slip between layers close to the scalp where I wanted to use it.  </li>
            <li> I prefer a regular round diffuser.</li>
            <li> It keeps slipping off when the dryer is on.</li>
            <li> Instead of forming pin curls and then drying them, I just made finger curls in my wet hair and then hugged them with the diffuser.</li>
            <li> The packaging says it fits &amp;#34;most&amp;#34; of them, but not only did it not fit the two we have in our home (both of which are 2&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I may even purchase another blow dryer for doing blow outs with a round brush because I don&#x27;t want to ever have to put the attachment back on my blow</li>
            <li> Did not fit my standard size blow dryer, so I could not even try it.</li>
            <li> and I can now go out with a dry head with no frizz!!</li>
            <li> difficult to find the right hair dryer that fits with it.</li>
            <li> Little tough to put on my dryer the first time.  </li>
            <li> After plopping my hair in a microfiber towel, I then usually just dry my hair with a blowdryer to about 60% dry, before letting it air dry the rest of the way.  </li>
            <li> As long as I don&#x27;t mess with it afterwards, it remains wavy for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Had a lot of messy flat looking curls.</li>
            <li> I anxiously awaited this product as  my curly hair is short but I am growing it out.  </li>
            <li> it will pop off like every other difuser in the world.</li>
            <li> I use the cool setting on my hairdryer, which isn&#x27;t cold air, it has some warmth.</li>
            <li> Be Careful..!</li>
            <li> and they looked like they do with any other diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any issues with the plastic melting like other reviewers</li>
            <li> - it doesn&#x27;t sit at the end like other diffusers.</li>
            <li> A little clumsy for me to use although hair cutters have no trouble using it on my hair.</li>
            <li> the box, it also shows you a few drawings for how to position this in your hair to get it to dry.  </li>
            <li> and you will be lucky to not be cutting melted plastic out of your hair.</li>
            <li> Not worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> Initially, I did have trouble getting it on my dryer and thought it was too small.</li>
            <li> I do believe that once I get past the learning curve, my dry time will be faster with this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to figure out how to use this tool with my hair, at first I was getting crazy &#x27;80&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> i seem to have less frizz with it.  </li>
            <li> Warning:  this unit does not fit conventional hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> The rubber band around the base stretches easily but remains tight to hold it on.  </li>
            <li> It just is not powerful enough fir air to get through, maybe a poor design.</li>
            <li> Anyone with thick curly hair knows that it takes quite a while to dry your curls.</li>
            <li> my hair looks a little frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I tried to place the &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; under my curls to get a little volume</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little awarkward and heavy to use</li>
            <li> it is big and awkward, but I find it gives my hair (thick-ish, coarse and wavy/curly, slow to get wet and slow to dry)</li>
            <li> Found this awkward to use as a regular diffuser - it seems like it&#x27;s only a hair scruncher/styler</li>
            <li> The devafuser did not fit on our hair dryer nor our daughters.</li>
            <li> It did not fit on any hair dryer sold at target.</li>
            <li> This product IS helpful if you have trouble drying underneath your hair, and IF your hair is shorter.  </li>
            <li> At then end, using one of the fingers, she grabbed a few curls and separated my hair in the front</li>
            <li> My curls wasn&#x27;t frizzy and my hair dried in record time.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money on this one.</li>
            <li> The attaching tube is extremely narrow and does not fit on my hairdryer or my husband&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;Jody</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I used with a non Devachan blower and it killed my blower.</li>
            <li> However, it does not fit every blow dryer nozzle.</li>
            <li> Not easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I anguished to buy this diffuser after reading all the reviews about it melting or not fitting on the hairdryer, the price, and all the other negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> I hated leaving the house with hair that was still wet near the roots or in the back.</li>
            <li> This was a little difficult to get over the barrel initially</li>
            <li> this product would not stay on my dryer the band that holds it on is very thin would not last very long and is very awkward to try to use i have very curly hair</li>
            <li> Sorry, but compared to a traditional round diffuser, for me, this gadget is a joke.  </li>
            <li> First of all, when I received the Devafuser, it did not fit my blow-drier :(  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this diffuser did not fit my hairdryer properly.</li>
            <li> I now can wash and dry my thick wavy curls in less time and have dry hair on a cold day.  </li>
            <li> Very little air coming through this piece.  </li>
            <li> I like this diffuser, but it&#x27;s really big and difficult to store.</li>
            <li> I never used a blow dryer in the past because my hear would frizz.</li>
            <li> i wish i had been warned that this would not fit my blow dryer before i bought it!</li>
            <li> Usually as I drive into work.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I was not impressed by the end result.  </li>
            <li> Too small for my dryer.</li>
            <li> Plus the structure of the difuser adds lift and height to my heavy hair!  </li>
            <li> (thankfully I have more than one) and tried it once, hated it!  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I was using it incorrectly but just didn&#x27;t seem to do the job.</li>
            <li> Gets into the roots with out making everything frizzy but difficult to get and keep on regular sized blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Extremely small shaft.</li>
            <li> Adds volume to thin curly hair and dries faster than other diffusers.</li>
            <li> Once you move the rubber piece toward the &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34;, the base opens fairly wide, you stick your dryer in and then work the rubbery band back up until it fits tightly around the nozzle.  </li>
            <li> In fact a little worse, as when you stick it under/inside your hair it just blows the canopy into a frizz...</li>
            <li> In addition it is very big, bulky &amp; awkward.</li>
            <li> Do you have thick hair?  </li>
            <li> Thick and bulky.</li>
            <li> The opening is so small!</li>
            <li> Overpriced and ridiculous.</li>
            <li> After they got to a drier point, I moved it to the roots gently and blasted with cold air.  </li>
            <li> how I don&#x27;t have to go out in the cold Maine winters with wet curly hair.</li>
            <li> Also, the product seems weak.</li>
            <li> Sending it back. :(</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s a little awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Then, I realized I just needed to adjust the big rubbery band at the base</li>
            <li> Alas, it does not.  </li>
            <li> I hated drying that part of my hair because the direct heat would burn my head, ouch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Game changer.</li>
            <li> broken in one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was not happy with this product at all.  </li>
            <li> I hate going out with wet hair in the winter</li>
            <li> i feel like i wasted my money :-(</li>
            <li> How disappointed I am that the Deva diffuser does NOT fit my hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Poor design!  </li>
            <li> I thought this was just some weird sculpture they had</li>
            <li> but boy, was I wrong.</li>
            <li> You just need a brain that can conquer the complexities of devices as complicated as a rubber band</li>
            <li> It is way too expensive for that to happen.</li>
            <li> Mine melted into a gnarled claw shape that is completely useless.</li>
            <li> I am not paying for an expensive hair dryer</li>
            <li> It looks totally weird but works like a charm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was difficult to get onto my blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t even test the product to see if I like the results.</li>
            <li> BUT the choice of material is very poor.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a TERRIBLE product, but totally not worth the $30+</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid though, you just have to be patient with your hair and the drying process.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about that awkward spot that is still wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it is difficult to attach to my dryer :(</li>
            <li> Was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> Really, really frustrating!!</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t painful.</li>
            <li> so I do not get sick.</li>
            <li> i was really disappointed that it did not work</li>
            <li> :-(  </li>
            <li> I tossed the box before testing (like a genius) so no returns for me :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hate the design.  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m disappointed, I will give it another try as I want to believe in this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this diffuser at $26.</li>
            <li> but this thing is horrible for my type of curl.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Considering the price, I feel it should adapt to any hair dryer. It seems to want to slip off because of&lt;br /&gt;design.</li>
            <li> Very little air coming through this piece.  It would take a very long time to dry my hair with this DevaFuser.  It just is not powerful enough fir air to get through, maybe a poor design.</li>
            <li> I love this attachment! I have very curly hair and I can now go out with a dry head with no frizz!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. As a user of DevaCurl products for over a year - I was excited to try this since all their products are amazeballs. This, however, sucketh. Left my hair LESS curly and not as much volume as I get with my regular diffuser.</li>
            <li> We wish it fit short nosed hair dryers too!</li>
            <li> I like this diffuser, but it&#x27;s really big and difficult to store. Works great with my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This devafuser is awesome it makes it so my hair doesn&#x27;t fall flat at the roots! If you have curly hair it&#x27;s a must. I do recommend going to their website so you can see how to use it. It does take longer to use, but its totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I waited until this was redesigned to fit on any drier.  When I first opened the box and saw how tiny the opening was I thought for sure I&#x27;d have to buy a new dryer, but it really does stretch to fit!  I used it for the first time this morning and I loved it.  I hate going out with wet hair in the winter and now I can dry the hair at my roots before heading out the door.  This gave my hair nice lift off my scalp and the rest of the curls are able to dry quickly with ambient air and they look well-defined.  I don&#x27;t know about the reviews about the plastic melting, My hair is medium-thick and I used the highest heat setting and had no trouble. I did not dry my hair completely because I prefer the look when it air-dries.  But I was able to dry the roots and that&#x27;s what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used round diffusers for years, so when I saw this, I thought it would be fun and interesting to try something different.  Sorry, but compared to a traditional round diffuser, for me, this gadget is a joke.  Perhaps I didn&#x27;t use it correctly, so I gave it an extra star just in case I&#x27;m the culprit.  But it deserves a single star in my book.  I returned it and happily returned to my old, round diffuser.  Sometimes the next bright, shiny object is just that.</li>
            <li> I love this defuser!  I never used a blow dryer in the past because my hear would frizz. No frizz with this defuser.</li>
            <li> Ok, so it did not fit on my blow dryer, my dryer has a wider end.. So I need to buy a new blow dryer which I&#x27;m not totally thrilled about. I did try it.. but I had to hold it on my blow dryer as it wouldn&#x27;t stay on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did a pretty good job, I didn&#x27;t dry my hair as long as I would have liked since it was hard to hold it on. I will update my review after I get a new dryer and try it out a few times.</li>
            <li> The devafuser did not fit on our hair dryer nor our daughters. It did not fit on any hair dryer sold at target. Had to go to a hair salon supply store to find a hair dryer that it would fit on. That said, my wife really likes the defuser.</li>
            <li> It started melting the first time I used it! Now one of the fingers is almost completed melted and it gets stuck in my hair ! I would not recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> This defuser works but it takes a lot of time... Which defeats the purpose.. I would not recommend if in a time crunch..</li>
            <li> Really love it. Fit my dryer perfectly. My curls look so different than the did with other diffusers, less frizzy, more natural.</li>
            <li> Fits my revlon dryer well. Great for drying curly hair and adding volume to the roots. Slightly more frizz than using a helmet diffuser, but gets to the undersides of thick hair much easier so faster drying times. And much more portable than a helmet diffuser, of course.</li>
            <li> Not worth the $$$. I didn&#x27;t find it helped my curly hair. My ordinary diffuser was better. Great concept but no.</li>
            <li> Its falling apart and has not even been six months since the purchase.</li>
            <li> Love how it works the curls....Hate the design.  It&#x27;s getting ready to fall apart.  As much as these things cost they should have a better design.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the oversized rubber band that is the issue - It&#x27;s the frail plastic pieces inside the rubber band that are obviously not made for heat from a hair dryer.  They have warped and are wearing.  I had to buy a different hair dryer because it&#x27;s to the point if I remover the diffuser one more time I won&#x27;t be able to get it back on the hair dryer or it&#x27;s going to break.  That is an inconvenience...Hopefully they will re-work their design and/or drop their prices.</li>
            <li> I anxiously awaited this product as  my curly hair is short but I am growing it out.  I have tried many diffusers depending on whether I wear my hair short or curly.  I had high hopes for this one as I love the Deva styling products.  Unfortunately, I  struggled and struggled to get this to fit my Compact Vidal Sassoon dryer and no matter how I tried to attach it...it always flew off.  I do not want to purchase another dryer.</li>
            <li> Best tool for curly hair I&#x27;ve ever had ..!!!</li>
            <li> Works well. Fits fine on dryer. No problems</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit the hairdryer my wife has--the air nozzle is too wide to fit.  We&#x27;ll have to buy a different dryer to try it.</li>
            <li> difficult to find the right hair dryer that fits with it.</li>
            <li> This will not fit 2 different dryers I have. It is supposed to be universal, and you can&#x27;t purchase the dryer to this separate.</li>
            <li> It fit my dryer chi low emf brilliant. It just pops off sometime. Big hand, but doesn&#x27;t dry fast.</li>
            <li> At first I needed to find a hairdryer that would fit the defuser (some are too short,others too wide and one was just right!) once the right hairdryer was identified the defuser worked well. This product is different from regular diffusers.  I have curly hair and it dries it well without making it frizzy.  It&#x27;s a little awarkward and heavy to use but I presume I will get used to it and use it as well as my hair stylist.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser. fit my dryer perfectly.  love the circulation and the way it dries my hair without making it frizzy. highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been embracing my wavy hair for almost two years now.  I&#x27;ve attempted other diffuser with mixed results.  The design of this diffuser helps dry my hair while minimizing frizz and creating fantastically defined waves.  I only wish that I bought it sooner.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got a curly perm or natural curls Run and buy this , it is fabulous, I love love love mine!!!  You may have to stretch the rubber part quite a bit the first time you put it on your dryer. I&#x27;ve had mine quite a while now and I can dry my curly perm fast and ez and it&#x27;s holding up great!</li>
            <li> This crazy-looking attachment is fantastic for loving your curls when drying!  The only challenge was getting the darn thing on my dryer.  I really had to push harder than expected, but when it finally slipped on it is secure and works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for gently holding up your curls while drying so they stay nicely formed and not frizzy.  It is also handy to dry the roots to achieve a nice lift.  I highly recommend this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is much cheaper to buy this attachment to put on any kind of dryer than buy the whole kit.</li>
            <li> Extremely effective. This gets 4 starts rather than 5 simply because it&#x27;s not an easy travel piece. It&#x27;s not like hotels come stocked with amazing defusers!</li>
            <li> the salon i go to uses this on my hair and i love it! so i was excited when they started selling just the diffuser, it fits my blow dryer perfect i have an old revlon drying i have had for about 5 years now, very east to put on, the only negative thing i have to say about it is , if you have never used it before it does take some getting used to, so i do reccomend watching youtube videos and things like that, also i will recomment getting the Deva styling prodects as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it did any better job than my regular diffuser.  I ended up returning it.</li>
            <li> Not easy to use.  Hair slides off of it when trying to dry.</li>
            <li> The price is better on this than when I purchased. I wish I had returned mine because at almost forty dollars, it was a HUGE rip off.  It&#x27;s just a diffuser, yeah it&#x27;s okay, but nothing really more or less. Don&#x27;t get your hopes up too high.  If you have had a good diffuser, the results won&#x27;t be different if your curls are anything like mine (thin hair, lots of volume, loose curls with frizz).  So at $25 dollars, I&#x27; wouldn&#x27;t advise another friend not to purchase but anything more and I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re getting ripped off.</li>
            <li> The DevaFuser is a bit more expensive ther regular defusers, but it was worth the additional cost and I highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> I wanted it to work but I never even got to try it because I couldn&#x27;t get it to go on my hair dryer, which seems to be a pretty standard size. I should have measured my hair dryer before ordering. I returned it.</li>
            <li> Be warned this is not a universal fit.  It specifically did not fit, nor come close to fitting my dryer which is a Centrix QZone.  So I had to send it back.</li>
            <li> Fits both my hair dryers and works great!</li>
            <li> Returned it. Did not work as claimed. Kept sliding off my hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Sorry but this thing is horrible for my type of curl. Had a lot of messy flat looking curls. Only thing this is good for is giving lift to my roots. I will stick to the standard diffuser.</li>
            <li> Poor design!  Does not fit well on a standard blow dryer</li>
            <li> If your hair dryer has a &amp;#34;fat&amp;#34; opening, you will struggle to get this on.  I finally got it on, but then one of the screws on the side came undone due to the pressure of how far it had to stretch.</li>
            <li> This diffuser does not fit on normal hair dryers.  I think they made it that way so you buy their hair dryer also.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be a solution for my frizzy curls.  Not to be. It is a very clever idea and it does penetrate to the roots of my hair.  It is ok but is very large/long and makes my hair dryer difficult to fit anywhere when it is attached.  And it is difficult to attach to my dryer :(</li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly.  Had a little difficulty finding a blow dryer it would fit.  Does keep the curl in - but plumps my hair up too much.  I need to keep toying with it, maybe just letting it blow over my hair, rather than going up from underneath.</li>
            <li> I too was unable to get the attachment to fit. It fit over the dryer but did not stay in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been trying products for my curly hair my entire life-30 years and FINALLY found some products that work! I use the gloves in combination with the difuser. When I travel I&#x27;ll probably just bring the gloves only. The difuser is definetly odd looking and don&#x27;t forget to put the rubber band on to secure it over your blow dryer or else it will pop off like every other difuser in the world. So happy with these products!</li>
            <li> The Deva Curl Deva Fuser adds volume to my curly hair without making it frizzy.  Much better than a standard diffuser!</li>
            <li> I really like this. Does the trick for me. I have baby fine hair so use the Deva clips too. Initially, I did have trouble getting it on my dryer and thought it was too small. Then, I realized I just needed to adjust the big rubbery band at the base (That&#x27;s not shown in the photo). I wonder if that&#x27;s why so many people have a problem. Once you move the rubber piece toward the &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34;, the base opens fairly wide, you stick your dryer in and then work the rubbery band back up until it fits tightly around the nozzle.  At its widest, seems like it would fit most hair dryers.</li>
            <li> It does work well but it doesn&#x27;t stay on my blow dryer all that well. So, it&#x27;s a little awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit two dryers I have.  To get it on one dryer had to apply so much pressure feels like it will break.</li>
            <li> this product would not stay on my dryer the band that holds it on is very thin would not last very long and is very awkward to try to use i have very curly hair i was really disappointed that it did not work was very excited when i saw this im sending it back its not worth 44 dollars</li>
            <li> I did  return this as I found it unwieldy to hold and not really useful for short hair which I have.</li>
            <li> Altered review!  I found a hairdryer to finally fit it!  I LOVE this diffuser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the function, but the fact that I can&#x27;t find a hairdryer to attach it to is a letdown!  I have looked and looked... all the newer hairdryers have a much bigger barrel, and this won&#x27;t fit.  :-(  I just hold it in place... which is tricky, and gets hot!</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair, you have to use DevaCurl products.</li>
            <li> This product works great. It does what it said it would in the description. I am please with my diffuser.</li>
            <li> This diffuser does a great job at drying my roots and creating volume.  It seems to help reduce frizz in my 3b, fine, BSL hair.  It fits my dryer well.  The rubber band around the base stretches easily but remains tight to hold it on.  Also it seems pretty sturdy as I have dropped it several times with no cracks or breaks.</li>
            <li> excellent for my curly hair but it fit an old hair dryer that I had also it cracked the first time i used it but is still works BEWARE it doesnt fit all dryers</li>
            <li> i wanted to LOVE this produce and am always down for trying a curly hair product.  i had such high hopes.  I fully knew i&#x27;d probably have to buy a new hairdryers, which i did.  at least one that kinda fit this guy, and i fully expected it to be ackward until i got used to it.  i never quite bonded with it after using it for a week.&lt;br /&gt;My &amp;#34;bowl&amp;#34; diffuser (which came with the NEW hairdryer i purchased to work with this product) thankfully works great.  This product IS helpful if you have trouble drying underneath your hair, and IF your hair is shorter.  Mine is longer so it did not help me much.  i would NOT recommend and it does NOT fit MOST hairdryers, like the reviews say - the opening is VERY small.  it&#x27;s an interesting item, and i continue to TRY to use it, but still go back to my bowl diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;I did not hate it, but it&#x27;s not my go-to attachment either.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t fit on my dryer had to get a new one</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product, and overall I love how it made my hair look. I had to give it 1 star, however because it&#x27;s really not a universal diffuser. It seemed to fit my Remington Hair Dryer fine, but after using it the first time, it warped and melted. I saw a review before purchasing the diffuser that cautioned against it. However the person said their hair dryer was made of aluminum and since mine is made of plastic I thought it would be ok. I was using it on low power and high heat because there was nothing in the instructions that cautioned against using it on high heat. I&#x27;m very disappointed. I&#x27;d like to purchase another one of these, if I could find a dryer that was compatible with it. I e-mailed DevaCurl asking if they have a list of compatible dryers.</li>
            <li> I tried to fit this on three different hair dryers, with no success.  On the third attempt, I bent it beyond the point of functionality.  Now I can&#x27;t return it, nor can I use it.</li>
            <li> I first heard about this product from my hair stylist. She has curly hair just like me and even though I air-dry my hair during summer (I live in New York), I need to blow dry it during winter so I do not get sick. So I asked her what can I do during winter to dry my hair and get that va-va-voom curls without the frizz. She grabbed this oddly shaped item (the old version which has a square bottom not elastic). I thought this was just some weird sculpture they had but boy, was I wrong. She told me she has one at home as well as all the products form DevaCurl line and they&#x27;re great for curly hair. After I got my haircut, she demonstrated on me. I was blown away (ha ha get it?). Anyway, she put a handful of mousse for my full head and gave it a slight scrunch and lifted it using this. At then end, using one of the fingers, she grabbed a few curls and separated my hair in the front and I felt like I just got a make-over. It was one of those &amp;#34;SEXY&amp;#34; hair moments and the result you see on the covers of the curly hair products and ads. So, I went home, went on Amazon, bought it right away. I use it with hair creams, lotions and milks . It works amazingly. If you have curly hair, get ready to feel like a million bucks.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok - i find it makes my hair frizzy.  i&#x27;d rather air dry!</li>
            <li> I was trying to figure out before I bought this if it fit the T3 hairdryer.  I read a review that said that it did, so I got it.  Alas, it does not.  It seems like it&#x27;s a great product.  Wish they made it more universal, and wish the description was clearer about fit.  Fortunately, I have Prime and didn&#x27;t have to pay return shipping.</li>
            <li> i wish i had been warned that this would not fit my blow dryer before i bought it! i cant find a place to buy the blow dryer separately either.  all the devacurl blow dryers i am seeing are super expensive and include this diffuser.  they should definitely make this diffuser more compatible with other brands or warn you that the elastic band is not stretchy AT ALL. i feel like i wasted my money :-(</li>
            <li> I found this unique diffuser while searching for a replacement diffuser for mine that had just died. I didn&#x27;t see instructions included in the ad, so I purchased kind of blindly. Up until this product, I&#x27;ve only ever seen/known diffusers that are bowl or flat shaped but circular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this product now about 2 weeks, and my fluency with the product may get better. If my results change drastically with time, I will update my review. My review is based upon my hair, which is naturally neither straight nor curly, but frizzy and puffy - very afro like without correct product &amp; maintenance (currently use Ouidad for frizz &amp; Kinky Kurly for curl).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can say now, though, is this product definitely increases volume of my hair - and does this without impacting my hair&#x27;s natural propensity to frizz. It does not, however, provide as much of a curl as the cup shaped diffusers, do. This may or may not be due to my use of the product, but the fact is that my hair curls more when placed in a curl type position while slowly drying, which the cup shaped diffuser naturally does. Using this hand shaped diffuser doesn&#x27;t quite capture my hair in the same manner as the cup, but rather dries a wider area of hair. The fingers get the air into deeper parts of my scalp &amp; thusly provides more fullness (as areas not normally reached by the air in a cup diffuser wouldn&#x27;t get the impact that this product does by having finger-type thingies that pierce deeper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for instructions - there weren&#x27;t any detailed provided on the box, either, and were no instruction booklets. There were only a few pictures with key words next to the pictures posted on the actual box. For this reason, I leave my review open to interpretation (given the possibility of my not using the device to its fullest extent). As far as my understanding of this product, however, you used this attachment to your dryer as another hand. It took me awhile to get used to it - but I think I&#x27;m getting better now by scooping larger portions of my hair up with my non-blowdryer-holding-hand to position into this hand-type diffuser. This puts my hair moderately into the shape of a natural curl while drying and provides more curl than just using the diffuser as is. While doing this, the finger-thingies still dry area beyond the scrunched up hair - hence more fullness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried my cup shaped diffuser since purchasing this, to confirm my impression that this device (while increasing fullness without adding frizziness, &amp; providing minimal curl definition - more of a wave) didn&#x27;t create as much of a curly-curl to my hair. I was correct, and the cup type diffuser did in fact provide thicker CURLS. That being said, the result with a cup shaped diffuser didn&#x27;t reach the inner scalp area of my hair as this diffuser did, so the bigger curls just drop and hang (whereas with this device the minimal curls created do extend further out, as the diffusion goes straight to the scalp - explaining the full results).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I anticipate my results will improve with time and fluidity of my hands/head while using this product. It may provide deeper curls if used differently, as there were approximately 4 different ways to use it depicted on the box. I can&#x27;t figure out any other way to use this on my own, at least not significant differences outside tilting my head one way versus another. For this reason, this device may become better over time. As it currently stands, I&#x27;m alternating between my cup-shaped diffuser and this one.ng better now by scooping larger portions of my hair up with my non-blowdryer-holding-hand to position into this hand-type diffuser.

            <li> Overpriced and ridiculous. Returned it.</li>
            <li> Found this awkward to use as a regular diffuser - it seems like it&#x27;s only a hair scruncher/styler - you can&#x27;t really use it just as a dryer - unless it&#x27;s right up next to your scalp it blows your hair around which is exactly what a diffuser is supposed to prevent - but it would probably be good for someone who wants super bouncy curls - not me.</li>
            <li> Best diffuser I&#x27;ve ever had! Love the style. Before receiving it, I was concerned about the weight. Not a problem... it is minimal. Delivered fast.</li>
            <li> I always thought my normal diffuser did a good job but I didn&#x27;t know what potential my curls had! This amazing thing gave me corkscrew curls all over. I did use the devacurl cream along with it and I never ever had hair like this before and I go to a salon for my hair care. Every girl with curls must have this. I never even knew it existed until last week...where has this been all my life?! Why it isn&#x27;t sold in every target store is beyond me😊</li>
            <li> I anguished to buy this diffuser after reading all the reviews about it melting or not fitting on the hairdryer, the price, and all the other negative reviews.  I eventually bought it and am 100% happy that I did.  This is such a great diffuser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the melting aspect:  I wonder what temperature people are setting their hairdryers on to MELT PLASTIC?  Hello.....if it is melting plastic, imagine what it is doing to your hair people! The point of any Deva product is to protect hair from damage. I use this several times per week and have had zero issues with melting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the fabulous diffuser:  I love, love, love, LOVE this diffuser!  The &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; slip into areas of my hair around my head in ways that a traditional diffuser cannot.  For example, I can slide it *into* the curls instead of just scrunching them.  It gives me great lift at the roots.  I use the cool setting on my hairdryer, which isn&#x27;t cold air, it has some warmth. Often I usually alternate with the warm setting, but if I use that too long then my scalp starts to feel too hot and uncomfortable.  I dry my hair about 80% of the way as the manufacturer suggests, then let it air dry the rest of the way.  Usually as I drive into work.  When I get to work I take out my clips, flip my head over, scrunch my curls......and BAM!  Awesome hair day!  It took me a few tries to figure out how to use this tool with my hair, at first I was getting crazy &#x27;80&#x27;s hair.  Not that I figured it out it works great every time.  I have to be careful to keep the diffuser in one place on my head for awhile like the instructions say, as this reduces frizz.  If I scrunch my hair too much with the diffuser then it breaks my curl cast and my hair looks a little frizzy.  Don&#x27;t be afraid though, you just have to be patient with your hair and the drying process.  I&#x27;m a nurse who gets up at the crack of dawn or earlier, and don&#x27;t have a lot of time to do my hair in the mornings.  So don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m putting a lotof effort into this, because I&#x27;m not (It&#x27;s really great).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the fit with my hairdryer:  I have a Rusk &amp;#34;deep shine&amp;#34;.  That&#x27;s all I know about it.  The first few times getting the diffuser on the hair dyer I had to really shove it on, twist it back-and-forth, etc.  Now I can get it on easily, but it still fits snugly around the hairdyer.  The circumference of my hairdryer is about 6 1/4&amp;#34; and the diameter is just under 2&amp;#34;, if that helps anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DevaCurl everything has transformed my hair from blah to wowza curls!</li>
            <li> I can wrestle this on to my travel sizes Chi Dryer, but it pops off after 5 mins. I honestly don&#x27;t understand why this is so much better than a regular diffuser. My hair didn&#x27;t see that much of a difference between the two. I tossed the box before testing (like a genius) so no returns for me :(</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to trying this out because of the good reviews however this &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; diffuser does not even come close to fitting on my current hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. I liked the idea behind this diffuser but I find the &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; are way too wide to slip between layers close to the scalp where I wanted to use it.  It just doesnt work as I hoped and for the price I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> A bit challenging as my dryers nozzle is short and wide so I have to hold the diffuser on. I guess I need to purchase a dryer with a longer thinner neck.</li>
            <li> I prefer a regular defuser because it is easier and faster. The devacurl fits fine on my hairdryer and the fingers are nice for lifting underneath curl sections and drying from two directions.  It is good quality but I gave it a three star because I don&#x27;t use it. I procrastinated returning it thinking I would get used to it.  Once I figured out How to use it for my short hair I stopped using it because it took so much more time and the results were not significantly different then my old defuser.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!! Hair dries so much quicker and leaves hair looking more natural.  I wish I had this Years ago!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very effective diffuser, because it can sit inside the hair instead of just pushing from the ends.  Do you have thick hair?  You know how your ends get dry but the whole interior of your hair is still wet?  This fixes that problem.  It fit onto my regular blow dryer, I use high heat and low air.  It also works to introduce a little more volume because you lift the hair as it dries, this sort of stretches the roots so they don&#x27;t curl up right onto your scalp.  It does both the job of a regular diffuser (press up from the ends) and drying and lifting the roots/inside part of hair (stick the &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; into your hair and lift up).  It blows hot air from both sides, not just the palm side, so the hair drys faster, too.  I don&#x27;t have the kind of hair that gets all the way dry with a diffuser, and this one doesn&#x27;t do it either, but it gets me to the 75% dry faster than a regular one, and MUCH more evenly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it is big and awkward, but I find it gives my hair (thick-ish, coarse and wavy/curly, slow to get wet and slow to dry) much better results because it can dry the inside hair, instead of just drying the ends and outsides.  And can do this without much disruption to the curls.</li>
            <li> First of all, when I received the Devafuser, it did not fit my blow-drier :(  But I really love all the other DevaCurl products I use regularly: (One Condition, no-poo shampoo,  light defining gel, styling cream, and frizz-free volumizing foam). So I did my research online and measured the nozzle of the diffuser attachment and determined that the nozzle of the blow drier had to be about 1.5&amp;#34; measured across the nozzle for attachment to fit. So I took my measuring tape with me to Walmart, Target, and then Sally Beauty supply. BINGO at Sally Beauty supply! This is what I got and fits perfectly: Plugged in Ceramic Tourmaline Stow&#x27;n Go mini dryer, which cost $19.99. Devafuser slid right on the dryer and stayed put. Took about 15 minutes to dry my shoulder length fine 3B (spirals) hair. I got lift at the roots that was needed and my hair is so soft.</li>
            <li> I am curly-hair challenged. Use this with a gentle flow from a blow dryer and your curls will be what you always hoped they would be.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is great.  Forget the reviews that say it won&#x27;t fit.  You just need a brain that can conquer the complexities of devices as complicated as a rubber band and you&#x27;ll have no problem.  I used this on twelve different blow dryers while traveling through Ireland and it fit them all and it never came close to melting.  Do be warned, the TSA will feel the need to go through your bag when this shows up on the x-ray.  Stay curly.</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle way of blow drying my hair.  It&#x27;s also pretty slow but I like that it reduces the frizz that I normally get with a regular defuser. It fit my blowdryer just fine and I traveled with it and used it with the tiny hotel hair dryers.  I haven&#x27;t used it on a &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; setting because people said it melted so I can&#x27;t say that it works well with high heat.</li>
            <li> Thanks..! nice and handy..! but don&#x27;t  used in high hot speed remember plastic melt...! Be Careful..!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok if you can find a hair dryer it actually fits. However, I think I have more success with the basic diffuser my cheap hair dryer came with. I bought it hoping I could use it traveling, since it&#x27;s supposed to be universal, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t fit usual hotel hair dryers. I think on my trip, it maybe fit 1 out of about 10.</li>
            <li> Wish I had read all the reviews about the diffuser not fitting most dryers. Didn&#x27;t fit mine and when I took it to a store that had about 10 to choose from, it didn&#x27;t fit ANY!  Not sure if those who had dryers that fit the diffuser were older models or what, but I think DevaCurl should address this issue by either modifying their design or telling people it won&#x27;t fit most of the dryers on the market.  It would also be nice if read the numerous reviews (over 50%) where the diffuser didn&#x27;t fit (or maybe they do and don&#x27;t care).</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t as frizzy now!  My hair seems to be more soft and smooth.  Also dries hair more quickly.</li>
            <li> I loved this, but after only 3 months of use, the arms started breaking off. It is way too expensive for that to happen. Therefore, though the product works great for us curly headed people, it is not sturdy. Unless you plan to buy a new one several times a year, I would stay away from this diffuser. By the way, it is huge.....</li>
            <li> This definately works if you want to make your natural curls, curlier. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I knew that Deva was going to be doing a re-design of the hand fuser, and have been patiently waiting over a year for it to come out.  I just got done drying my hair with this for the first time -- and LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, 2C waves, and this gently dried them, with minimal frizz.  After plopping my hair in a microfiber towel, I then usually just dry my hair with a blowdryer to about 60% dry, before letting it air dry the rest of the way.  Using this helped create the best frizz-free curls I&#x27;ve ever had!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does get hot, so you&#x27;ll want to use this on low heat and low air flow with your dryer.  (If your hair blows around too much, it will create frizz.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the box, it also shows you a few drawings for how to position this in your hair to get it to dry.  I have hair that when stretched reaches to the top of my waist, and it got my hair mostly dry in about ten minutes with my T3 Featherweight dryer.  To do the mid-lengths, I cupped the ends gently in the hand, and let it sit there a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To see if the fit really is universal, I tried this on my cheapie Conair dryer, my T3 Featherweight (the regular model), and my Sedu Revolution.  It fits my Conair and my T3, but not my Sedu, which has a pretty wide nozzle.  I ordered it on the Nordie&#x27;s website so that I could return it in case it didn&#x27;t fit any of my dryers, but was happy to see that it really is almost universal, unlike other diffusers I&#x27;ve bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this a try if you have curls or waves!  It definitely brings them out in the best possible way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 1-12-13:  I am still absolutely in LOVE with this diffuser!  I didn&#x27;t think it would create much volume, but it really does!  It makes my waves look better than they ever have, and my hair has volume and soft, frizz-free texture.  This really is amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this odd looking tool. I have wavy hair that loves this diffuser. I have little friz and my waves are more curls (if I lay on the floor and dry them)</li>
            <li> With the right products and this DevaFuser my hair is now back to all its&#x27; curly gloryness. Been lazy the last few years and kind of just let the curls go their own way. Now I&#x27;m receiving compliments every day. Curly hair girls know to use a diffuser. This is an awesome one.</li>
            <li> i love it it is a good product&lt;br /&gt;thank you for it I will recommend it to my friend .</li>
            <li> Works well and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is a great concept and I do like it BUT the choice of material is very poor. It didn&#x27;t take long for it to melt and come apart.  I use it low heat and it is curling into a fist. There is a huge gap at the seams. I have it almost 3 months and I don&#x27;t know how much longer it will last. After each use I have to try and push and mold it back into shape I am very disappointed in this diffuser at $26.</li>
            <li> I love the design of this diffuser. It definitely allows you to get air flow into your curls without distorting the shape of the curls. The problem is that material the dryer is composed of cannot withstand even the low heat of a dryer. Mine melted into a gnarled claw shape that is completely useless. Anyone with thick curly hair knows that it takes quite a while to dry your curls. Even in the DevaCurl videos, they suggest holding the dryer in each position for 2 minutes. Well, do that and you will be lucky to not be cutting melted plastic out of your hair. Using the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; setting is simply impractical -- my hair would take hours to dry on &amp;#34;cool,&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s not even beyond shoulder length! For this price, they should have chosen more durable material.  I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it in 30 years of using diffusers on my hair!</li>
            <li> I have been waiting over a year for this fuser to come out!!  I like it a lot.  i seem to have less frizz with it.  I would of given it 5 stars if it would of come with directions on how to use it.  I am getting better at it.  If you have curly hair I think you will like this and I do think it will fit on every hairdryer.  Also I have medium short hair.</li>
            <li> My curls wasn&#x27;t frizzy and my hair dried in record time. Loving my natural hair and curls. The product works y&#x27;all!</li>
            <li> A little big and clunky. I guess it does the job ok. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s any better than another diffuser or a cloth cover.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this because I am a fan of all Deva products but this is not really a big thing. It&#x27;s just a plastic hand, not too comfortable/easy to use. If I push it too deep into my dryer&#x27;s mouth, I feel it&#x27;s going to break.  I didn&#x27;t return it but I&#x27;m also not using it. I prefer a regular round diffuser. Maybe it&#x27;s a good idea to take it on a trip since it&#x27;s light and it supposedly fits most hair dryers.</li>
            <li> Purchased at wifes request, she likes this for her long curly hair....I dont think she needs it as she&#x27;s beautiful the moment she gets up in the morning.  But she likes this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this diffuser. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving it in one spot for a long time. It&#x27;s best to hold it no more than 5 seconds and keep doing this all over your head. My curls looked FAAAAAAAAAANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> I have very short curly hair and I didn&#x27;t realize that this is more for longer curly hair.  I do use it, and it does decrease the frizz, but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job  of lifting my short curly hair from the roots.</li>
            <li> This is not universal.  It will not stay on my standard hairdryer.  It keeps slipping off when the dryer is on.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t see any improvement over my regular defuser. In fact a little worse, as when you stick it under/inside your hair it just blows the canopy into a frizz... I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. I used this for the first time with a more expensive new hair dryer. Instead of forming pin curls and then drying them, I just made finger curls in my wet hair and then hugged them with the diffuser. Fixing my hair took much less time, looks great, and my girlfriend said the back of my head looks curlier and less flat than usual.</li>
            <li> Not any better than a regular diffuser. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Use this every day. This is a great invention.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair. This adds volume to the top of my hair which is great. but it does make it frizzy. I have been using 2 different diffuses. I could have done without this product.</li>
            <li> I have wavy curly hair.  I recently started using the devacurl line about a month ago.  But my curls were still kind of frizzy and falling flat by the end of the day.  So I thought I would give this hand a try.  First off, it didn&#x27;t fit on any of the 3 blow dryers I have, so they really shouldn&#x27;t say it fits &amp;#34;most&amp;#34; hairdryers.  But I have one of those Conair round brush blowdryers, and it fit perfectly on that.  I used it this morning, and I am so impressed!  My curls are more spiraly (if that is a word), and there is barely any frizz.  This made such a HUGE difference!  I would highly recommend it, but don&#x27;t expect it to fit on your blow dryer unless you have one with a really skinny nozzle.</li>
            <li> A little clumsy for me to use although hair cutters have no trouble using it on my hair.</li>
            <li> I expected my curls would look fabulous with this diffuser and they looked like they do with any other diffuser.  I couldn&#x27;t even keep it on my main dryer, but it did fit on another one I had laying around.  Wasn&#x27;t impressed.  Returned it.</li>
            <li> Ok, so this diffuser definitely gave me lots of volume...love big hair; however, I had a lot of frizz as well. It fits my blowdryer perfectly, but my dryer (Hot Tools Tourmaline Tools 2000) has a narrow nozzle. It was easy to use...and my hair dried quickly.  Overall, I was not impressed by the end result.  My regular diffuser attachment does a much better job...and without the frizz.  Although I&#x27;m disappointed, I will give it another try as I want to believe in this!</li>
            <li> I discover Deva products for curly hair a few years ago and cannot live without them.  I&#x27;ve had my eye on the original dryer and diffuser but just did not see myself spending that much for a hair dryer.  Now that its available on its own, I really wanted to try it.  I was also in need of a universal diffuser so I could take with me on travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I was pleased that it fit my hair drying which has a snap on diffuser that is not universal.  Once I turned on the dryer, I was worried there wasn&#x27;t enough air flow coming out of the attachment, I could barely feel it.  I thought it would take forever for my hair to dry.  (I have shoulder length, deva cut, type 3A curls.)  Was I wrong!  There is a slight learning curve especially trying to figure out how to hold the dryer and position the hand in your hair.  It took about the same amount of time as with a standard diffuser BUT my curls were less frizzy, more defined, and had amazing volume!  I do believe that once I get past the learning curve, my dry time will be faster with this diffuser.  I&#x27;m never going to give this up.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my hairdryer. Thick and bulky. Wasted my money on this one. Got a hot sock instead that works great.</li>
            <li> Did not like it.  It didn&#x27;t really work like my traditional diffuser.  I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is great for curly girls.  Works better than the traditional diffusers.  It&#x27;s a bit bulky, so I&#x27;m trying to find a hose that I can hook to this and attach it to my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> My curly hair never looked so good!</li>
            <li> Better than most diffusers. Little tough to put on my dryer the first time.  I like the way I can lift, spray the roots with hair spray and dry to hold more simply with the diffuser.</li>
            <li> Was so excited to finally receive this in the mail.  I used it several times over the course of a week before writing my review, just to give it more than one opportunity.  Completely unimpressed by how it worked.  It mostly just increased the frizziness of my hair, and didn&#x27;t help set the curl at all.  It wasn&#x27;t a TERRIBLE product, but totally not worth the $30+ price tag.  I&#x27;ll stick to my bowl diffuser which works better for me.  I ended up returning this.</li>
            <li> Makes my daily routine much easier!!</li>
            <li> Recommended by our daughter&#x27;s stylist.  He used it with great effect on her curly hair, which had just gotten a pixie cut.</li>
            <li> not universal at all.  was hoping that maybe I had the magic dryer that would fit but should have listened to the other reviewers.  Would just pop off.</li>
            <li> How disappointed I am that the Deva diffuser does NOT fit my hairdryer.  I was very excited to buy one after my stylist used one to do my hair. She did mention that the hairdryer and diffuser were sold together.  I am not paying for an expensive hair dryer so what shall I do? The attaching tube is extremely narrow and does not fit on my hairdryer or my husband&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;Jody</li>
            <li> Love this! I had the deva dryer with diffuser for a couple of years and was amazed by the results vs a regular diffuser. When my deva dryer died I was devistated. So happy to have this cheaper alternative to buying the dryer again!</li>
            <li> Really awkward to use, and definitely can&#x27;t take it to travel with you as the attachment is huge. I was so excited about this but once I got it and physically saw how giant it is it was a no for me. Had to return and stick to regular diffusers.</li>
            <li> A regular diffuser does just a good of job, this is over priced and I does not seem to be able to handle the heat because it is coming apart.</li>
            <li> If I can keep it on one of my dryers better it works great.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit every blow drier but works well giving a slower diffused dry for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Too small for my dryer. Had to return it</li>
            <li> Using this difuser has changed my hair care.  I now can wash and dry my thick wavy curls in less time and have dry hair on a cold day.  Plus the structure of the difuser adds lift and height to my heavy hair!  A win win for me!</li>
            <li> This product was not for me.  Hard to find a dryer it fit (thankfully I have more than one) and tried it once, hated it!  Very bulky to use.</li>
            <li> I had the older version of the DevaFuser (and blow-dryer).  My Deva stylist had it and I loved it.  While being there for a cut one time, my son accidentally knocked hers off the counter and busted her dryer.  So I gave her mine.  I missed it while using a Hot Shot Tools dryer I bought from Sally&#x27;s and a diffuser.  While it was nice, it didn&#x27;t work like this (gentle without tornado-like speed whipping my curls around into a frizzy mess). When I saw this and that it would work with \\&quot;most\\&quot; dryers, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  I read the reviews - one person said it melted...goodness, what kind of dryer do you have? Mine is 1875w, which is pretty high.  Anyway, I got this, ripped it out of the box and took it to meet my blow-dryer.  They fell in love.  This was a little difficult to get over the barrel initially but once I did, it was harmonious unity! I couldn&#x27;t wait to actually use it.  I am a very routine-Deva user (DevaCare No Poo, One Condition, ArcAngel gel mixed with Styling Creme, using the Deva towels or cheese cloth to dry/scrunch, don&#x27;t wash daily, co-wash in between deep washings, etc.).  So this was what my curls needed.  While I don&#x27;t follow the \\&quot;hold in each spot for two minutes\\&quot;, it still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worked the back with getting in a bulk of my hair into it gently and letting it work there for awhile, then moved to the sides.  After they got to a drier point, I moved it to the roots gently and blasted with cold air.  I use the clips to help with lifting roots.  Once my hair completely dries, I can remove the clips, rescrunch hair gently to remove the gel cast and I have soft, shiny, beautiful curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This DevaFuser is worth it if you are looking to dry your curls carefully.  It is pretty universal - I&#x27;d assume thicker barrels would be harder to get on it (mine is 1.75\\&quot;).  The band that holds the bottom of the fuser together is a very strong, thick &#x27;rubber-band&#x27;.  It took some time to work it on, but now that it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s not going anywhere...and that&#x27;s okay.  Make sure you slide it all the way on so there is no loss of air flow through the bottom part of the &#x27;hand&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with it, along with the fast shipping.

            <li> good diffuser. hard to fit on my standard hair dryer without feeling like its going to break. One side opened up more than the other, causing it to split a bit, but not broken and still usable.  im sure there must be another way to make this usable more universally.</li>
            <li> HUGE!  Way TOO big to use on my head.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but I really like how I have better control over where I can put the diffuser. I can get it close to my head and get the roots dry without over drying the ends. I don&#x27;t know what kind of dryer others have that cause melting bc my dryer can get uncomfortably hot if I use it on the hottest setting. I use mine on a medium heat setting so it isn&#x27;t painful. The diffuser is a snug fit, and I would not want to take it off and on a lot. I am very pleased with it. Mine cost $25---Half if what I have seen it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It looks totally weird but works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Perfect for curly hair</li>
            <li> I have been embracing my hair&#x27;s natural wave pattern (2b) more and more following the Curly Girl method but find that it&#x27;s not always feasible to leave the house with wet hair, especially in the winter months. I have a standard bowl diffuser that came with my blow dryer (a Chi Pro) but for some reason it does not stay securely attached to the blow dryer&#x27;s nozzle. This, coupled with the bowl diffuser&#x27;s awkwardness when trying to dry certain areas of my hair, proved frustrating.  Enter the DevaFuser. What I love about this diffuser is that you can approach your entire head from various angles and the air blows from both sides of the diffuser in addition to airflow coming from each side of the \\&quot;fingers\\&quot;. The fingers also enable you to target specific areas that a bowl diffuser might not be able to get to, like the back of your head, without breaking up the curl/wave clumps. There are plenty of wonderful videos on YouTube that demonstrate different ways to use the DevaFuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DevaFuser fits both my Chi Pro and my mom&#x27;s antiquated Revlon dryer which have different sized nozzles. I did notice some separation at the attachment site when I put it on my Chi (hard to describe without a picture), but the thick rubber band seems to hold this diffuser in place fine. I have not had any issues with the plastic melting like other reviewers have stated, but I definitely recommend using the low setting on your dryer when using this attachment. I find that my hair is actually wavier/borderline curly when I take the time to diffuse it using the DevaFuser, probably because it gently dries wet hair, forming and establishing the curl pattern, unlike with air drying in which the weight of the water in the hair can weigh it down and elongate or pull out the curl pattern. I should also mention that I recently cut my hair to shoulder length. Very long hair will probably not completely \\&quot;fit\\&quot; into this diffuser the way that it might with a bowl diffuser, so that might be something to consider when purchasing this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am extremely happy with this item and it has definitely improved my daily hair routine and appearance!to consider when purchasing this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am extremely happy with this item and it has definitely improved my daily hair routine and appearance!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love, this diffuser! I recommend to anyone with curly hair and needs to dry your hair. I wish I had gotten it sooner!</li>
            <li> Barely fit my t3 but works great. Helps dry the hair closest to scalp. Gives good lift to your roots.</li>
            <li> Warning:  this unit does not fit conventional hair dryers.  The packaging says it fits &amp;#34;most&amp;#34; of them, but not only did it not fit the two we have in our home (both of which are 2&amp;#34; in diameter - which is entirely conventional), but we went to the hair care department of a local store with a measuring device, and found it would not have fit any of the units they had there either.  I called Devashon, spoke to someone there, and she told me &amp;#34;we are having a problem&amp;#34; with this unit -- which tells me we are far from the only ones.  Obviously we are returning it, and suggest that, unless you have a very slim-diameter unit, you buy a different brand.</li>
            <li> I guess I always thought that I just had &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; curls - not the nice, smoothe looking curls/waves I always wanted and then came the DevaFuser.  In all seriousness, I cannot believe the difference in my hair after drying with this device.  It&#x27;s really exciting for me because being able to wear my hair curly (and not blow it out) saves me so much time and with 22 month old twin boys time is at a premium these days.  I can honestly say that I love my curls when using the DevaFuser to dry them (even more so than air drying).  I&#x27;ve also found that the DevaCurl products make a huge difference too.  As you can tell, I&#x27;m definitely a believer.  Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I read other reviewers saying the device didn&#x27;t fit their hairdryers which definitely may be true of certain models but I, too, thought this didn&#x27;t fit mine until I realized that I had to push it all the way onto the barrel - it doesn&#x27;t sit at the end like other diffusers.</li>
            <li> I do not usually write reviews. I didn&#x27;t see that many great reviews about this tool but took a risk at my local beauty store and bought it. Partially because they offered a Free gift with purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was difficult to get onto my blow dryer. I have a Revlon something or other that I bought on amazon a few years ago, it works great. But getting the defuser on the blow dryer was a struggle. I may even purchase another blow dryer for doing blow outs with a round brush because I don&#x27;t want to ever have to put the attachment back on my blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick and curly hair. I hated leaving the house with hair that was still wet near the roots or in the back. I hated drying that part of my hair because the direct heat would burn my head, ouch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use my blow dryer on high with a low heat setting, my hair is dry in about 10 minutes. Not only is it dry but my curls are soft and manageable. Game changer. I feel like my hair drys evenly and I don&#x27;t have to worry about that awkward spot that is still wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who is blessed with curly hair, you can&#x27;t afford to not have this gadget. I&#x27;ve googled, youtube&#x27;d, and the like every hair product, oh wet to dry straighter, really? broken in one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product actually works and does wonders.</li>
            <li> So much frizz!  I tried to place the &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; under my curls to get a little volume and it wrecked my hair.  Back to the bowl diffuser.</li>
            <li> Ok - I read all the raving reviews and thought that I would try this product.  OMG it is truly fabulous.  My hair just got 90 percent easier and quicker to do and looks 100 percent better.  More waves - more curls - I never have to use the curling iron now.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I have tried it multiple times just as directed. It created massive frizz and took far too long. A waste of money. I am back to ploping overnight.</li>
            <li> As I measured before ordering, the DevaFuser fits perfectly on my dryer. Probably best for long curly hair; mine is short, but I get a nice tousled look. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this diffuser, which looks like a great design does is not actually made to fit &#x27;most dryers.&#x27;  I have yet to find a list of dryers this diffuser fits on.  Strangely, the box does not contain any instructions on how they suggest getting it on. Most reviewers discuss how hard it is to put on their dryer!  I&#x27;m going to try to get a babyblisspro dryer, as one person mentioned it fit. But pretty disappointing generally.</li>
            <li> My hair has been changing from straight to wavy for the past couple of years, and I had no idea what to do with it, as with the slightest humidity would become frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I had been reading about DevaCurl and thought of giving it a try, buying the fuser which I use with my old hair dryer. Nailed it! It&#x27;s so easy to use, I can blow dry my hair without the frizziness or the need to use any other tool. As long as I don&#x27;t mess with it afterwards, it remains wavy for the rest of the day. I had my doubts because many people complained about the fuser melting, well, that did not happen with my old con air dryer. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ended up returning this product. One of the biggest selling points for me was the promise of more volume and curl. I get more volume and wave from a blowout. I just wasn&#x27;t impressed. Also, the product seems weak. The seams started splitting.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of it and enjoy the devacurl products for my swavy hair but this didn&#x27;t work for me.  Made my hair super frizzy.  I followed the instructions too and barely moved it.  It also didn&#x27;t fit my dryer.  My regular diffuser works much better.</li>
            <li> Works great!!  Adds volume to thin curly hair and dries faster than other diffusers.</li>
            <li> Well, it didn&#x27;t fit on my dryer. I never even got a chance to use it. For whatever reason, the packing slip wasn&#x27;t included in my purchase either. Hopefully, I&#x27;ll be able to return it.</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I used with a non Devachan blower and it killed my blower.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair, you gotta get this. What i like about it the most, is that it has ventilators holes all over the place. It drys your hair evenly, and its very lightweight. However, it does not fit every blow dryer nozzle. I took mine to Target and tried a few of the sample one they had out, to see which one it would fit on best. Definetely use this for your curls, it makes them look sensational!!</li>
            <li> I love this, I had one of the original ones and it broke and didn&#x27;t hesitate to order a new one. I love the new design and how I don&#x27;t have to go out in the cold Maine winters with wet curly hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine this fitting on any hair dryer.  The opening is so small! I have to return.  Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t even test the product to see if I like the results.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this diffuser did not fit my hairdryer properly. In addition it is very big, bulky &amp; awkward. Not very easy to use on fine, long hair.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work without the their branded blow dryer. I sent it back.</li>
            <li> Did not fit my standard size blow dryer, so I could not even try it. Sending it back. :(</li>
            <li> I love it.  My hair dries beautifully with this</li>
            <li> Was not happy with this product at all.  Not sure if I was using it incorrectly but just didn&#x27;t seem to do the job. Maybe a beautician could do a better job with it.  would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit my hair dryer, so now I have a diffuser I can&#x27;t use. I can&#x27;t find a way to buy the deva hair dryer without the diffuser, nor can I find a list of compatible hair dryers. Really, really frustrating!!</li>
            <li> This really does create soft, tousled curls.  What I really love about it is that it gives great lift at the scalp without ruining the curl structure.  It gives a perfect amount of heat and air movement.  It will fit over just about any blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Made my naturally curly hair more frizzy. A regular diffuser worked much better. Think it would work best if someone else was drying your hair with this product, as it was a bit cumbersome to manipulate.</li>
            <li> Love the way this product works but I have to say I am very concerned that it won&#x27;t last. It has already split up the side and I have only had it a week. It does an amazing job at keeping my curls not frizzy and it drys my hair really fast but the durability is in question.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t fit my dryer - but, that&#x27;s my fault as I didn&#x27;t bother to measure it before I bought it.</li>
            <li> It states that it &amp;#34;fits most hair dryers&amp;#34; however  it didn&#x27;t fit the one I have .  I tried 6 different dryers at a local store just to find ONE that fit.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would caution it this diffuser doesn&#x27;t fit just any hair dryer. It only fits driers with a smaller circumference. I ended up being able to use it on my travel dryer just fine. One can purchase the optional DevaCurl drier.</li>
            <li> Gets into the roots with out making everything frizzy but difficult to get and keep on regular sized blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Love it ! Great for curly hair</li>
            <li> It was great in the salon, but didn&#x27;t fit my hair dryer, so I had to return it.  The vendor was great.</li>
            <li> Melted on the first use. I gave feedback in the first week.  Now they won&#x27;t take it back. I loved it when my hairdresser used it.</li>
            <li> Extremely small shaft. Would only fit a blow dryer with a diameter of 1 1/2 inches.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser and highly recommend for any one with curls!</li>
            <li> I like this curly diffuser, but like some people, I don&#x27;t think it necessarily works any better than a regular diffuser.  I have difficulty keeping volume up top, and this doesn&#x27;t do much better than a regular diffuser.  I know there were also complaints about it melting or not fitting, and I had mine on high and the hottest setting and haven&#x27;t had any issues.  It also pretty easily fit over the end of my hot tools hair dryer.</li>
