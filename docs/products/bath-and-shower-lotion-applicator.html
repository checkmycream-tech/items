    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Furthermore, after \\&quot;a year or so\\&quot; of use, it&#x27;s as good as it was when I got it.</li>
            <li>This item sounded good on paper</li>
            <li>sponge absorbs but is not the kind that you can squeeze out (like a dish sponge) which I like because its smoother and doesnt absorb ALL the soap</li>
            <li>, i love it and it makes it easier for me</li>
            <li>The size and shape are good as well as the grip, but most of the lotion gets absorbed from the applicator.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok what I have paid for it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely wonderful to reach those areas on your back!  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed the sponge applicator and it was well made.  </li>
            <li>Works OK.</li>
            <li>and this is wonderful to use to apply  lotion to my back after a shower.</li>
            <li>I just squirt the lotion right on the applicator pad, smear it around with my fingers, and - voila - no problem!!  </li>
            <li>The foam head break for pretty quickly, better to go with a tanning mitt instead!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to control the amount of lotion you use at one time.</li>
            <li>great way to get lotion on back</li>
            <li>Thanks for this handy helper.</li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if that was a feature or a flaw -</li>
            <li>Good for areas you cannot reach, it is a medical tool for me.</li>
            <li>I do not like the sponge of the applicator, it does not feel good on my back so gave away</li>
            <li>I liked the natural wood handle</li>
            <li>The sponge quickly came off and had to be re-glued.  </li>
            <li>This applicator is great for people who need to put lotion on their back and live alone.  </li>
            <li>This was cheap but really does not work well.  </li>
            <li>The foam does not absorb the lotion so it is easy to clean and is soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>This works perfectly for applying lotion to those areas of the back not easily reached.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item to be able to spread lotion on my back.  </li>
            <li>This is easy to use and really gets to the places on my back that I can&#x27;t reach.  </li>
            <li>I finally found a simple shower brush thats smooth and comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Better than a similar one that had gotten old.  </li>
            <li>The foam surface is too smooth and could also be a little wider to glige better on the back.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The surface of this one is not perfectly smooth which seems to allow better spreading of lotions.</li>
            <li>as the lotion just slides right off of it before you can apply it to your back.</li>
            <li>I ordered this scrubber for a newly put together bathroom.  </li>
            <li>would recommend this brush to anyone that wants a simple shower scrubber.</li>
            <li>Nice long handle, but foam is really hard and non-absorbent  </li>
            <li>No matter how much I tried I couldn&#x27;t get lotion on my entire back.</li>

            <li> No matter how much I tried I couldn&#x27;t get lotion on my entire back.</li>
            <li> This lotion applicator is used by me to oil my back for the dry skin condition, instead of lotion, it arrived timely, and this is my second order</li>
            <li> This applicator last a long time, and there are no signs of wear.  </li>
            <li> I have limited use of my left arm</li>
            <li> I have to be very careful not to drip the lotion prior to using it on my back.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe the pad was loose and would fall off the handle.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> but the little sponge at the end does nothing to help scrub my back.  </li>
            <li> I use the other one in the bedroom on my night stand in case I feel dry, and itchy</li>
            <li> This back scrubber works well to reach those hard to soap areas of my back in the shower</li>
            <li> and it does not really rub the cream in but leaves it on the surface of the skin&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;have given up on it.</li>
            <li> , I use one in the bath room, so when I get out of the shower, dry odd, and on goes the oil on the hard spongie area, and applied to my back, so soothing.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, it snapped after 2 uses.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to move it all over my back</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27;6\\&quot; and somewhat long limbed, so even holding the tip of the handle, this didn&#x27;t even reach my ankles and was useless for scrubbing my legs.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Do you see what is wrong with this picture??</li>
            <li> Also not impressed with the texture of the sponge.</li>
            <li> and this saved me from itching like crazy.</li>
            <li> but I used it once and put it away because it is awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Really useless piece of junk!  </li>

            <li> great way to get lotion on back</li>
            <li> This lotion applicator is used by me to oil my back for the dry skin condition, instead of lotion, it arrived timely, and this is my second order, I use one in the bath room, so when I get out of the shower, dry odd, and on goes the oil on the hard spongie area, and applied to my back, so soothing.  I use the other one in the bedroom on my night stand in case I feel dry, and itchy, I put a prescribed ointment to the sponge area and rub it on the back area.  This applicator last a long time, and there are no signs of wear.  I do wash them as often as I need to, and they are still holding up. Good for areas you cannot reach, it is a medical tool for me.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly for applying lotion to those areas of the back not easily reached.  I just squirt the lotion right on the applicator pad, smear it around with my fingers, and - voila - no problem!!  It&#x27;s holding up well, but if it does finally need replacing, I will definitely reorder.  Thanks for this handy helper.</li>

            <li> broke before I could ever use it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if that was a feature or a flaw - I thought maybe the pad was loose and would fall off the handle. After using it for a year or so, I am convinced it is a feature. Furthermore, after \\&quot;a year or so\\&quot; of use, it&#x27;s as good as it was when I got it.</li>
            <li> The foam surface is too smooth and could also be a little wider to glige better on the back. I had a different one and you could see the difference. Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> This applicator is great for people who need to put lotion on their back and live alone.  The foam does not absorb the lotion so it is easy to clean and is soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> This thing snapped into second time I used it</li>
            <li> The size and shape are good as well as the grip, but most of the lotion gets absorbed from the applicator.</li>
            <li> No comment. It&#x27;s ok what I have paid for it. I have to be very careful not to drip the lotion prior to using it on my back.</li>
            <li> For those of us&lt;br /&gt;who have no one at home to apply lotion to your back, this is a life saver.  I have recommended and bought this for several friends,  it&#x27;s a MUST HAVE!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful to reach those areas on your back!  I handle is well made and will last a life time.  I enjoyed the sponge applicator and it was well made.  It is also helpful for bathing the elderly.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I tried I couldn&#x27;t get lotion on my entire back. I have very dry skin and this saved me from itching like crazy. I wish I would have purchased it sooner.</li>
            <li> Nice long handle, but foam is really hard and non-absorbent  I don&#x27;t know what to use this for, as the lotion just slides right off of it before you can apply it to your back. It was a waste of money. Except for the handle.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to be able to spread lotion on my back.  It could be six inches longer to reach all areas.  Works OK.</li>
            <li> I do not like the sponge of the applicator, it does not feel good on my back so gave away</li>
            <li> I finally found a simple shower brush thats smooth and comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;The sponge absorbs but is not the kind that you can squeeze out (like a dish sponge) which I like because its smoother and doesnt absorb ALL the soap but just enough.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this brush to anyone that wants a simple shower scrubber.</li>
            <li> Really useless piece of junk!  Don&#x27;t waste your money, it snapped after 2 uses.  Not at all absorbent for lotions or soap as advertised.</li>
            <li> I ordered this scrubber for a newly put together bathroom.  I liked the natural wood handle but the little sponge at the end does nothing to help scrub my back.  Do you see what is wrong with this picture??</li>

            <li> This item sounded good on paper but I used it once and put it away because it is awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Bought this in anticipation of undergoing hip replacement surgery, needing to bathe and shower from a shower chair, and being restricted in terms of forward bending. I am 5&#x27;6\\&quot; and somewhat long limbed, so even holding the tip of the handle, this didn&#x27;t even reach my ankles and was useless for scrubbing my legs. Also not impressed with the texture of the sponge.</li>
