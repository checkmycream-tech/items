            <li>It&#x27;s very original.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very clean.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it as a gift but decided to keep it and ad it to my favorite perfumes because it lasts all day long and smells so very good.</li>
            <li>strong going on but lots of compliments once the smell settled.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like floral or strong perfumes.</li>
            <li>My husband loves it too, he says it make me smell snuggle worthy and sexy.</li>
            <li>I love the licorice notes, but this isn&#x27;t a super sweet fragrance...</li>
            <li>Came in original packaging with no signs of tampering.</li>
            <li>The Loverdose I bought from Amazon is just like water and does not smell like the original Loverdose.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh, bright, makes you feel young, radiant, special.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it, it is a very rich fragrance for those who like sweet but not cloying fragrance.</li>
            <li>This one is just right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overly sweet or floral and is designed for a girl who wants you to pay attention to her.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s perfect for year round and isn&#x27;t season specific -</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon was absolutely the best also - it&#x27;s super expensive at Sephora which it&#x27;s supposedly exclusive to.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what my mom wanted for her birthday and cheaper than anywhere else</li>
            <li>but when it first came out in stores and I smelled it, I knew I had to have it.</li>
            <li>My first whiff of this delectable perfume was from a sample.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise I apply only sparingly and love it.</li>
            <li>The citrus adds a nice, slightly bitter edge.</li>

            <li>Absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few fragrances that have fallen in love from the first time the probe.</li>
            <li>Less gourmand and more oriental.</li>
            <li>However, the spray of the actual bottle is quite a bit larger than the sample, so I found the amount of perfume dispersed a little overwhelming, and at times, sickeningly sweet.  </li>
            <li>I better buy an expensive item which is original.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone and will certainly re-order it again for myself in the future.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Me encanta esta fragancia dulce, sensual y excitante! Es una fragancia para cautivar, enamorar y sentirse muy femeninas. A quienes les agraden los aromas dulces esta es una excelente opci√≥n!</li>
            <li> I get compliments everywhere I go with this scent - from men and women alike. It is beyond seductive. My prior scent used a Gucci that has been discontinued.. I have found the perfect replacement!!</li>
            <li> I like this item. I originally bought it as a gift but decided to keep it and ad it to my favorite perfumes because it lasts all day long and smells so very good. I would recommend this product to anyone and will certainly re-order it again for myself in the future. Thank you for your prompt shipping!</li>
            <li> I love this scent for fall/winter. It is earthy &amp; warm with hints of spice. My husband loves it too, he says it make me smell snuggle worthy and sexy. Came in original packaging with no signs of tampering.</li>
            <li> was not what I expected, the scent is strong enough, it disgusted me inlcuso</li>
            <li> I used this perfume for a couple of months and I loved the smell but I noticed that the smell wares off after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what my mom wanted for her birthday and cheaper than anywhere else I could find. Good luck</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy mines from here but when it first came out in stores and I smelled it, I knew I had to have it. I don&#x27;t really wear perfumes but I knew I had to add this to my collection of fragrances. It&#x27;s a winner hands down!!</li>
            <li> The Loverdose I bought from Amazon is just like water and does not smell like the original Loverdose. Am so sad I wasted my money, am just going to through it in the trash. I will never again buy perfume from this site. I better buy an expensive item which is original. It is so disgusting!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, its warm and inviting, sweet but not cloying, its lux and the bottle is so cute</li>
            <li> strong going on but lots of compliments once the smell settled. I bought this because my boyfriend smelled it on a girl and he liked it.</li>
            <li> I really like this scent. It&#x27;s very unique. I love the licorice notes, but this isn&#x27;t a super sweet fragrance...there are a lot of top-level floral notes in there, too. It&#x27;s very original.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments when I wear this perfume. I love it and I am very picky. I don&#x27;t like floral or strong perfumes. This one is just right. It&#x27;s very clean.</li>
            <li> My first whiff of this delectable perfume was from a sample.  And I really loved it.  So i bought it.  However, the spray of the actual bottle is quite a bit larger than the sample, so I found the amount of perfume dispersed a little overwhelming, and at times, sickeningly sweet.  Otherwise I apply only sparingly and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It&#x27;s fresh, bright, makes you feel young, radiant, special. I really recommend it, it is a very rich fragrance for those who like sweet but not cloying fragrance. This is one of the few fragrances that have fallen in love from the first time the probe. It is very good for both day and night. I recommend it! The seller was very satisfied, met all my expectations!</li>
            <li> I got a mini one at Sephora and I loved it. I was afraid of ordering perfume from a seller other than Diesel or Sephora but I&#x27;m not disappointed. It seems a little different but I think it&#x27;s just cause I&#x27;m paranoid.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Absolutely love!\\&quot;. Perfume smells different on everyone after it mixes with your individual pheromones. Well, this one is my perfect match! It smells amazing on me and every time I swear it I get so many compliments. The price on Amazon was absolutely the best also - it&#x27;s super expensive at Sephora which it&#x27;s supposedly exclusive to. The price on here is nearly half of what it was there! I love this perfume, it&#x27;s perfect for year round and isn&#x27;t season specific - I have Marc Jacob&#x27;s \\&quot;Dot\\&quot;, but I feel like that one is Springy/Summery because it smells so floral. This one is just the perfect scent all around!!! Absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> All the licorice of Lolita Lempicka with half the sweetness. Less gourmand and more oriental. The citrus adds a nice, slightly bitter edge.</li>
            <li> This fragrance will turn heads and get the attention you&#x27;re looking for. It&#x27;s not overly sweet or floral and is designed for a girl who wants you to pay attention to her. ;)</li>
