    <ol>
            <li>Best men&#x27;s hairspray out there.  </li>
            <li>Best value as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product</li>
            <li>Perfect hair spray for men.  </li>
            <li>The very best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>AND FOUND THE BEST BUY WAS FOR A  4 CANS PACK OF CONSORT HAIR SPRAY.I HAVE BEEN USING CONSORT HAIR SPRAY FOR ABOUT 40 YEARS AND HAVE ABOUT</li>
            <li>Great Product and wonderful fragrance!!</li>
            <li>My husband used this years ago and was happy to see it&#x27;s still around.</li>
            <li>but this works great.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy which is good.</li>
            <li>Smells good too...and added bonus.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Good quality</li>
            <li>Great product and very easy to spray on.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this hair spray.</li>
            <li>Amazon does a great job on most products I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li>It has a fine, even mist and holds really great.  </li>
            <li>5 stars better than sexy hair or tresemme</li>
            <li>Unscented is much better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure he will continue to do so.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair spray.</li>
            <li>It has always been available at Amazon; ergo we buy!</li>
            <li>A pump is much more environmentally friendly, as well as easier to use.  </li>
            <li>Even though I get a lot of snickers from my friends when they learn I still buy a hair spray with my fast disappearing hair line, I always are able to convince them that with thinning hair, its even more convenient and makes more sense to use a hair spray.  </li>
            <li>Consort is a very good, and very manly scented hair spray that I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Consort really does smell nice.  </li>
            <li>A scent that I think most men will enjoy and find complimentary.</li>
            <li>I have used this hair Spray for Years, and I Love it, and the Price is right.</li>
            <li>This seems particularly true if your hair is wet/damp when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells like hairspray for about 10 seconds and then quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li>so this is not an economical way to buy this</li>
            <li>No scent, right amount of hold.</li>
            <li>And as mentioned before, I happen to very much like Consorts scent.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff, \\&quot;barbershop\\&quot; smell that smells a little like Clubman.</li>
            <li>I use it lightly after I&#x27;ve already fixed my hair with another product.</li>
            <li>As for its holding ability, I have never seen any major difference in holding power with any hair spray, and Consorts extra hold does the job exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li>I choose the cented hair spray, the blind ladies think I&#x27;m handsome because my hair smells good.</li>
            <li>It has a smell that im not a big fan of, tends to be really strong, I want a hairspray that doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>The spray is great for lots of different reasons, such as keeping hair in place, washes off nicely, easy &amp; quick to use, no hair damage, nicely on thick &amp; wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;P.s</li>
            <li>It has a very high hold</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t mat my hair but holds it in place very well.</li>
            <li>Consort Hair spray seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t find it locally, buy it here in bulk from Amazon and make the shipping charge worth it..., buy it here in bulk from Amazon and make the shipping charge worth it...</li>
            <li>good product for men holds fine  hair like mine in place,not stiff or sticky.also a lot cheaper than other stores.</li>
            <li>Decent smell and seems to hold well.  </li>
            <li>I started using Consort many years ago as a young man when I actually had enough hair that it seemed a reasonable purchase.  </li>
            <li>Have used this product for years and would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>only exception to Consort is its scented formula only being available in a spray.  </li>
            <li>I prefer a pump over an aerosol, since I feel most aerosols end up being wasted all over your face and bathroom as much as what actually gets on your hair.  </li>
            <li>Just noticed that while unscented product was described and ordered - scented product received was received, six cans, four full and two empty are now going in the trash.</li>
            <li>Works well - my only complaint is that there is not a \\&quot;super hold\\&quot; version as my hair doesn&#x27;t stay put that easily.</li>
            <li>I thought that meant legit, extra hold( 6 ) but its more or less a medium hold.</li>
            <li>whatever, at least in my experince, very light spray no Sticky at all</li>
            <li>To be clear, this hair spray does do the job.</li>
            <li>Beyond the fact that Consort advertises itself as a mens hair spray, I see nothing in its ingredients or makeup beyond its rather masculine scent that singles it out in that sense.  </li>
            <li>i have used this brand for about 25 years now and i am completely satisfied.i</li>
            <li>It smells like old spice cologne.  </li>
            <li>the only problem with the spray is making sure to avoid going to bed with the hair spray still in the hair because due to movement &amp; bed it will not only cause itchiness, but also break lines of hair.</li>
            <li>If you want your hair to stay put, you will most likely use enough to make it stiff and sticky.</li>
            <li>The hold meter on this specific brand goes all the way up to extreme hold( 10 ), which is probably more or less what i was looking for.</li>

            <li> I use this product everyday prior to purchasing at Amazon one can was in a liquid stage and did not spray one</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t spray that on a skunk, and certainly not on my head</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Husband has used it for years and won&#x27;t use any other brand.  </li>
            <li> receipt the bottom of the box had liquid marks on it and upon opening it was discovered that due to packaging two protective lids had come off of cans causing discharge of the contents within the box - quite messy.</li>
            <li> Thin hair flies aloft and hovers above our heads even in the gentlest breeze.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, a few things need to be said.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few truly scentless hairsprays that I have found.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately for some reason Consort seems to offer only their unscented version in a pump.  </li>
            <li> The scent is way way way excessive, and obnoxious.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately this being an nonreturnable item, I&#x27;m not able to request replacement or refund</li>
            <li> Very disappointing and probably my deterrent to coming back for further orders.</li>
            <li> This spray has a very heavy smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s hard to find unscented hairspray.  </li>
            <li> It has become increasingly difficult to find over the past few years.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunate as I said, but not a deal breaker.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m out $9 because I ordered two :(</li>
            <li> It is absolutely terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> What can one say about hair spray.  It has a fine, even mist and holds really great.  Been using Consort for years.</li>
            <li> I started using Consort many years ago as a young man when I actually had enough hair that it seemed a reasonable purchase.  Even though I get a lot of snickers from my friends when they learn I still buy a hair spray with my fast disappearing hair line, I always are able to convince them that with thinning hair, its even more convenient and makes more sense to use a hair spray.  Thin hair flies aloft and hovers above our heads even in the gentlest breeze. Meaning that we walk around in public on a gusty day appearing even balder and funnier looking than we already are.  Also, hair spray adds a little volume to thin hair giving it a little fuller appearance, and aids in better looking grooming in my opinion.  Beyond the fact that Consort advertises itself as a mens hair spray, I see nothing in its ingredients or makeup beyond its rather masculine scent that singles it out in that sense.  Consort really does smell nice.  A scent that I think most men will enjoy and find complimentary. Not overpowering, but definitely with an after shave type flavor to it.  As for its holding ability, I have never seen any major difference in holding power with any hair spray, and Consorts extra hold does the job exceptionally well.  Your hair can be combed out after it dries, and still get the benefit of its thickening and holding power for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only exception to Consort is its scented formula only being available in a spray.  I prefer a pump over an aerosol, since I feel most aerosols end up being wasted all over your face and bathroom as much as what actually gets on your hair.  A pump is much more environmentally friendly, as well as easier to use.  But unfortunately for some reason Consort seems to offer only their unscented version in a pump.  And as mentioned before, I happen to very much like Consorts scent.  Unfortunate as I said, but not a deal breaker.  Consort is a very good, and very manly scented hair spray that I highly recommend.  If you can&#x27;t find it locally, buy it here in bulk from Amazon and make the shipping charge worth it..., buy it here in bulk from Amazon and make the shipping charge worth it...</li>
            <li> I have used this hair Spray for Years, and I Love it, and the Price is right. Try it you will like it.</li>
            <li> I feel like the title is misleading as it says extra hold. I thought that meant legit, extra hold( 6 ) but its more or less a medium hold. The hold meter on this specific brand goes all the way up to extreme hold( 10 ), which is probably more or less what i was looking for. it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy which is good. It has a smell that im not a big fan of, tends to be really strong, I want a hairspray that doesn&#x27;t smell. you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The scent is way way way excessive, and obnoxious.  I wouldn&#x27;t spray that on a skunk, and certainly not on my head</li>
            <li> Leaves no trace in hair yet holds well. Helps with frizziness and control and has no odor. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Ordered two (2); received only one !</li>
            <li> Best men&#x27;s hairspray out there.  Husband has used it for years and won&#x27;t use any other brand.  Best value as well.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this hair spray. Doesn&#x27;t mat my hair but holds it in place very well. Shipping costs are a bit pricy but I would recommend the product to anyone that needs hair spray,</li>
            <li> To be clear, this hair spray does do the job. If you spray it on, or in, your hair it will stay that way. This seems particularly true if your hair is wet/damp when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, a few things need to be said. This product IS stiff, and it IS sticky - depending on how much you use. If you want your hair to stay put, you will most likely use enough to make it stiff and sticky.</li>
            <li> My husband used this years ago and was happy to see it&#x27;s still around.</li>
            <li> I would have given it five stars, but the price doubled.  But I still buy it through prime.</li>
            <li> 5 stars better than sexy hair or tresemme whatever, at least in my experince, very light spray no Sticky at all</li>
            <li> The spray is great for lots of different reasons, such as keeping hair in place, washes off nicely, easy &amp; quick to use, no hair damage, nicely on thick &amp; wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;P.s the only problem with the spray is making sure to avoid going to bed with the hair spray still in the hair because due to movement &amp; bed it will not only cause itchiness, but also break lines of hair.</li>
            <li> Decent smell and seems to hold well.  I use it lightly after I&#x27;ve already fixed my hair with another product.</li>
            <li> i have used this brand for about 25 years now and i am completely satisfied.i prefer the unsented but this works great.</li>
            <li> I ordered unscented but did not receive that and now have a case of unusable spray as the return policy says I can&#x27;t return them. Very disappointing and probably my deterrent to coming back for further orders.</li>
            <li> Ordered six cans, all received however only four cans were usable after washing the cans. Packing consisted of the six cans being placed, on their sides in a box too big for them with a bit of packing paper on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On receipt the bottom of the box had liquid marks on it and upon opening it was discovered that due to packaging two protective lids had come off of cans causing discharge of the contents within the box - quite messy. I did report this via Amazon packing feedback so possibly others will not have this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this being an nonreturnable item, I&#x27;m not able to request replacement or refund so this is not an economical way to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual product I&#x27;d give it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Just noticed that while unscented product was described and ordered - scented product received was received, six cans, four full and two empty are now going in the trash. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product from Amazon. Amazon does a great job on most products I&#x27;ve bought but this one is a total bust with no recourse.</li>
            <li> I thought I ordered unscented for my Hubby. This has a definite scent. Unscented is much better. I def holds, tho.</li>
            <li> my husband has used Consort Hair Spray for men for years and I&#x27;m sure he will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Consort Hair spray seems to work very well. I wish the container was smaller for travel purposes. I tried to kill flies with it but don&#x27;t think it worked.</li>
            <li> good product for men holds fine  hair like mine in place,not stiff or sticky.also a lot cheaper than other stores.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair spray.</li>
            <li> Great Product and wonderful fragrance!!</li>
            <li> Bd looking product because it is putting poison on your hair.  I tried this and it made my hair an unusual hard feeling.  I will no way recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday prior to purchasing at Amazon one can was in a liquid stage and did not spray one was half full one had the cover missing. and started to use it and it is not the same product no extra hold</li>
            <li> Consort Hair Spray for Men is not sticky and holds my hair in place. I&#x27;ve been using it for over thirty years and will not use another hair spray. I choose the cented hair spray, the blind ladies think I&#x27;m handsome because my hair smells good. Please don&#x27;t tell them differently.</li>
            <li> Great product and very easy to spray on.  Have used this product for years and would highly recommend it.  Stay away from the non-aerosol version of this product.  It drips, it leaks.  It is absolutely terrible!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product and I bought another one</li>
            <li> Good stuff, \\&quot;barbershop\\&quot; smell that smells a little like Clubman. Works well - my only complaint is that there is not a \\&quot;super hold\\&quot; version as my hair doesn&#x27;t stay put that easily.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this hair spray and has for years. It has become increasingly difficult to find over the past few years.  It has always been available at Amazon; ergo we buy! No scent, right amount of hold.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few truly scentless hairsprays that I have found. It smells like hairspray for about 10 seconds and then quickly dissipates. It has a very high hold and I cannot recommend this product enough.</li>
            <li> Perfect hair spray for men.  The very best I have ever used.  Smells good too...and added bonus.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> NOTICED I WAS ABOUT OUT OF CONSORT HAIR SPRAY AND CKECKED IT OUT HERE ON AMAZON AND FOUND THE BEST BUY WAS FOR A  4 CANS PACK OF CONSORT HAIR SPRAY.I HAVE BEEN USING CONSORT HAIR SPRAY FOR ABOUT 40 YEARS AND HAVE ABOUT DECIDED I LIKE USING IT...</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s hard to find unscented hairspray.  This spray has a very heavy smell. It smells like old spice cologne.  Also, amazon will not accept returns even though it was ordered with prime, since it is \\&quot;flamable &amp; or hazardous\\&quot; even though there is no seal of any kind on the bottles so they are just as dangerous returned as they are shipped.  If you are looking for unscented stay away.  These are going in the garbage can for me and I&#x27;m out $9 because I ordered two :(</li>
            <li> Good price. Good quality</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and was everything I wanted.</li>
