            <li>GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t take the sting, get something that feels good and does nothing.</li>
            <li>Good service.</li>
            <li>It has many uses in the home as well as being a good astringent for the face.</li>
            <li>While the product I&#x27;m sure is good, I have 1 star because I never received said product.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use this longer than it takes me to find the real, original, zippy stuff.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s why I Love it</li>
            <li>Appreciate the refill size, as I use this every day and twice a day or more.</li>
            <li>Many uses for skin.  </li>
            <li>We like the product, but many stores are selling store brand versions that we don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li>just started using but, seems okay</li>
            <li>This original Sea Breeze is exactly what I remember from many years ago, and I was very glad to find it in this gallon size.</li>
            <li>great so glad to have these inexpensive and delivered quick  thanks so much</li>
            <li>Cheap, but the original formula with peppermint extract is nicer.</li>
            <li>This did not seem to be the original formula.</li>
            <li>For those writing this is not the original, I beg to differ.</li>
            <li>Stick with the Original formulation.</li>
            <li>Have done this for many years so the big bottle is handy.  </li>
            <li>The smell seemed right, and the color, and it was cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve long been a fan of the original formula Sea Breeze, which had a mighty bite and a clean smell and no residue.</li>
            <li>Love this I just wish I could buy it in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper to buy Seabreeze by the gallon!  </li>
            <li>and I really enjoy it because it&#x27;s not harsh to my skin and it kills germs.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Fast dlivery, three days.</li>
            <li>Thrilled to find such a big container.</li>
            <li>Purchasing it by the gallon and refilling the empty small bottle is so much more cost effective.</li>
            <li>They were willing to give me my money back if I spent more money for postage.</li>
            <li>I live out of the country and can&#x27;t purchase this where I live.</li>
            <li>I have used this as a skin cleanser since I was a teenager and have maintained use due to its immediate and long-term benefits of clear and clean skin.</li>
            <li>I had been buying this at different stores and the cost was just so high.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a cheap watered down imitation that isn&#x27;t even remotely what it claims to be.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sea-Breeze for years and was happy to find it in the gallon size.</li>
            <li> YES, i received this as NEEDED for my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long been a fan of the original formula Sea Breeze, which had a mighty bite and a clean smell and no residue. This did not seem to be the original formula.

            <li> I live out of the country and can&#x27;t purchase this where I live. Thrilled to find such a big container. Hope it lasts awhile!</li>
            <li> great product and seller</li>
            <li> Love this I just wish I could buy it in a bigger bottle. Awesome shopping experience. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It works, and it can sting if you have any paper cuts, etc, which is why it works.  If you can&#x27;t take the sting, get something that feels good and does nothing.</li>
            <li> For those writing this is not the original, I beg to differ. I have been a licensed hairdresser since 1970 and this is the same Sea Breeze we used back then. Great for removing grime from your face.</li>
            <li> Used in Pedicures, does a great job!</li>

            <li> Recieved in a soaking wet box because the lid was not on and it spilled out over everything.</li>
            <li> what can I say.. You can you use Sea Breeze for just about anything and that&#x27;s why I Love it</li>
            <li> Appreciate the refill size, as I use this every day and twice a day or more. I have used this as a skin cleanser since I was a teenager and have maintained use due to its immediate and long-term benefits of clear and clean skin. Best cleanser and astringent on the market!</li>

            <li> I used this product for a lot of things and I really enjoy it because it&#x27;s not harsh to my skin and it kills germs.</li>
            <li> Sea Breeze has been a staple in my family for 40 plus years.  Many uses for skin.  Stick with the Original formulation. Several providers found on Amazon.  Fast dlivery, three days.</li>
            <li> We like the product, but many stores are selling store brand versions that we don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> great so glad to have these inexpensive and delivered quick  thanks so much</li>
            <li> We have been Sea Breeze users for years.  It is getting to be so expensive in the small bottles at the stores.  This gallon size is great.  Unfortunately, my adult children see the gallon and come over to refill their small bottles so it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> just started using but, seems okay</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now. I use it as my aftershave. Excellent!</li>
            <li> Thank you it is the way to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this!&lt;br /&gt;It is a cheap watered down imitation that isn&#x27;t even remotely what it claims to be. I don&#x27;t know how these guys can sell on Amazon. Not reputable! They were willing to give me my money back if I spent more money for postage. I just flushed it!</li>
            <li> I pour this in a smaller squeeze bottle and use this on my scalp once a month (use about a cup). I also use a capful to soak my everyday stud earrings every month. Have done this for many years so the big bottle is handy.  Both scalp and piercings doing well!</li>
            <li> WAS JUST WHAT WE WANTED. GREAT PRICE. PACKAGED VERY GOOD</li>
            <li> While the product I&#x27;m sure is good, I have 1 star because I never received said product.</li>
