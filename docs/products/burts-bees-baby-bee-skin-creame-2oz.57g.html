            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>I use this on myself at night and love it.  </li>
            <li>In summary, it&#x27;s an okay product for the body if you don&#x27;t mind the fragrance.</li>
            <li>This stuff works better than anything I have ever used, and I have used a lot of products.</li>
            <li>I am more used to skin cream to be a fine creamy texture.</li>
            <li>The scent of this is very mild.</li>
            <li>My baby works well with this product, small face very slippery, very nourishing, moisturizing good, very good, very satisfied!</li>
            <li>* Almond oil / prunus amygdalus dulcis (13 products including Baby Bee Diaper Ointment, Baby Bee Fragrance Free Shampoo &amp; Wash and Baby Bee Multipurpose Ointment)&lt;br /</li>
            <li>/&gt;See comment section below or google \\&quot;Burt&#x27;s Bees Products: Allergy Alert\\&quot; for detailed information and links.</li>
            <li>* Soybean oil (37 products - baby bee nourishing baby oil, baby bee diaper ointment, baby bee fragrance free and original lotion)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream to anyone having any kind of skin discomfort.</li>
            <li>This was originally given to me as a baby shower gift...</li>
            <li>* milk (6 products, including baby bee getting started kit with buttermilk soap, baby bee original lotion)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked great on my dry hands too.</li>
            <li>It smells good and it keeps my skin moist all day long.</li>
            <li>this cream does not heal even that kind of minor cuts at all!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to say that I&#x27;ve only tried a few creams and burt&#x27;s bee had to be the best.  </li>
            <li>I have Rosacea and sensitive skin that tends to break-out easily.  </li>
            <li>cuz is lighter ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this as a face cream for myself for several years, and love it.  </li>
            <li>It was thicker than I anticipated, however, it was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>The next day she would be ready to play again and her face was all better.  </li>
            <li>a natural moisturizer!!&lt;br /&gt;Any good branded petroleum jelly will work the same way, can literally melt into baby&#x27;s soft skin and help to rehydrate it, any time, any day...</li>
            <li>The complete list is as follows: prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond)</li>
            <li>I have tried many different things and this has worked better than any other cream or lotion that I tried.</li>
            <li>I looked for it in the store, but the only thing I could find was the almond skin creme and didn&#x27;t like how strongly scented it was.</li>
            <li>However, for the whole body I prefer Baby Bee Buttermilk Lotion</li>
            <li>Like most other products I have tried, it irritates her eyes.</li>
            <li>It is very greasy but used lightly I can use it as a face cream and it keeps my skin moist much longer than some other products like Clinique.  </li>
            <li>creme\\&quot; in particular has tree nut, beeswax and soy allergens</li>
            <li>* almond oil is its main ingredient</li>
            <li>This has a nice thick texture without using petroleum which seems to irritate her skin.  </li>
            <li>This creme works very well for my baby girl&#x27;s butt and diaper area in general.</li>
            <li>My daughter, who is 2 years old, loves to go out no matter what the weather is like.  </li>
            <li>This surprises me for Burt&#x27;s Bees because I thought it was supposed to be an all natural brand.</li>
            <li>I used it as an adult creme, not as a baby creme.  </li>
            <li>and since we have begun using this creme on her body, it feels soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>It is possible for these allergens to be absorbed topically and cause severe allergies in some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does have an odd but not totally unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li>It is not in a smooth texture, you see little pockets of liquid and particles of solid mixed up like ... hummus?</li>
            <li>It has different labeling, different ingredients(98.71% natural instead of 100% natural),&lt;br /&gt;different</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m using cloth diapers and it is one of the few things I can use that will completely wash out of the diapers - no strange build up.  </li>
            <li> I thought this cream would heal the minor cuts on baby skin like when he/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not clear</li>

            <li> but i am not very impressed by this cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shocking to see the number of potentially severe allergens in products they advertise as hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find a cream or ointment that works on the eczema but does not make her rub her eyes (the poor girl.)  </li>

            <li> This creme works very well for my baby girl&#x27;s butt and diaper area in general. However, for the whole body I prefer Baby Bee Buttermilk Lotion cuz is lighter ;)</li>
            <li> A little of this cream on his cheeks after a bath and the eczema-like rash is gone.  Also, makes a great diaper cream.  I&#x27;m using cloth diapers and it is one of the few things I can use that will completely wash out of the diapers - no strange build up.  This was originally given to me as a baby shower gift...Mom tested and approved.</li>
            <li> My daughter, who is 2 years old, loves to go out no matter what the weather is like.  Even on those cold and chilly days she would play outside and come home with those rosy red cheeks, all dried up from the cold wind.  I have to say that I&#x27;ve only tried a few creams and burt&#x27;s bee had to be the best.  The next day she would be ready to play again and her face was all better.  A little sticky when applying to the face but it does get the job done.  Love the product.  Going to use it for the twins too.</li>
            <li> I like it, the smell, its effectiveness. Soothing on sore noses, &amp; other sores. it IS a THICK CREAM, can be pore clogging- \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;. but I use it a lot. DIAPER RASH helper too.</li>
            <li> I use this on myself at night and love it.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing and heavy, which I like for my dry skin.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have oily skin, tho.</li>
            <li> I thought this cream would heal the minor cuts on baby skin like when he/she hurts himself/herself with his/her own nails.&lt;br /&gt;But this cream does not heal even that kind of minor cuts at all!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So wondering, what it does actually???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You definitely should not spend $10 for a 2 OZ cream just for a natural moisturizer!!&lt;br /&gt;Any good branded petroleum jelly will work the same way, can literally melt into baby&#x27;s soft skin and help to rehydrate it, any time, any day...</li>
            <li> I just found an allergy alert for Burt&#x27;s Bees products. It&#x27;s shocking to see the number of potentially severe allergens in products they advertise as hypoallergenic. It is possible for these allergens to be absorbed topically and cause severe allergies in some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Bee Skin creme\\&quot; in particular has tree nut, beeswax and soy allergens *** almond oil is its main ingredient *** The complete list is as follows: prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, aqua (water, eau), cera alba (beeswax, cira d&#x27;abeille), aloe barbadensis leaf juice, kaolin, citrus grandis (grapefruit) seed extract, parfum (fragrance), glycerin, tocopherol, glucose, glycine soja (soybean) oil, chondrus crispus (carrageenan), sodium chloride, sodium benzoate, sodium borate, glucose oxidase, lactoperoxidase, limonene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An ingredient search on their site reveals:&lt;br /&gt;* Soybean oil (37 products - baby bee nourishing baby oil, baby bee diaper ointment, baby bee fragrance free and original lotion)&lt;br /&gt;* Almond oil / prunus amygdalus dulcis (13 products including Baby Bee Diaper Ointment, Baby Bee Fragrance Free Shampoo &amp; Wash and Baby Bee Multipurpose Ointment)&lt;br /&gt;* Macadamia nut oil&lt;br /&gt;* pecan shell powder&lt;br /&gt;* wheat germ oil (3 products, including baby bee nourishing baby oil)&lt;br /&gt;* milk (6 products, including baby bee getting started kit with buttermilk soap, baby bee original lotion)&lt;br /&gt;* buttermilk&lt;br /&gt;* dry milk powder&lt;br /&gt;* possibly anacardium (latin name of cashews - it is not listed as an ingredient on product labels but when a search is done on their site using the latin \\&quot;anacardium\\&quot; 34 products come up. It&#x27;s not clear why)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See comment section below or google \\&quot;Burt&#x27;s Bees Products: Allergy Alert\\&quot; for detailed information and links.</li>
            <li> I am not very impressed by this product. It is not in a smooth texture, you see little pockets of liquid and particles of solid mixed up like ... hummus? I am more used to skin cream to be a fine creamy texture. Also it has a hint of plastic smell that i can&#x27;t bear and washed off within an hour of application and unfotunately that smell still lingered for quite a while until i covered it up with the burts bee honey and grape seed hand cream. You can see that i am a burts bee fan but i am not very impressed by this cream. don&#x27;t know how it works to heal the skin, don&#x27;t have the patience to bear the smell.</li>
            <li> To spend such a high price, bought a garbage, completely bad, very bad, pull pull out all</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products that Burts has ever&lt;br /&gt;come out with espically for rashes and bug bites.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for my daughter&#x27;s eczema. This has a nice thick texture without using petroleum which seems to irritate her skin.  However, the product has fragrance in it!  This surprises me for Burt&#x27;s Bees because I thought it was supposed to be an all natural brand. Fragrance is completely unnecessary in a baby product and if I new it was in there I would not have bought this.  If you don&#x27;t mind fragrance, this could be a good product for you.  This didn&#x27;t work well for the eczema which is on her face.  Like most other products I have tried, it irritates her eyes. It is very difficult to find a cream or ointment that works on the eczema but does not make her rub her eyes (the poor girl.)  In summary, it&#x27;s an okay product for the body if you don&#x27;t mind the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a face cream for myself for several years, and love it.  It smells good and it keeps my skin moist all day long.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea and sensitive skin that tends to break-out easily.  I use this as a moisturizer for my face and neck.  I have not had any break-outs using this cream. It is very greasy but used lightly I can use it as a face cream and it keeps my skin moist much longer than some other products like Clinique.  It does have an odd but not totally unpleasant scent. It smells like beeswax but there is another scent that I can&#x27;t describe.  Overall it is the best moisturizer I have found for my over 50 skin.</li>
            <li> This is not the same product i used to use. It has different labeling, different ingredients(98.71% natural instead of 100% natural),&lt;br /&gt;different weight(57g instead of 55g) and different fragrance after all. I am not sure if it is the newly launched version of the product though..</li>
            <li> This product met my expectations.  It was thicker than I anticipated, however, it was exactly what I needed.  I used it as an adult creme, not as a baby creme.  I have dry and sometimes rough skin, and it worked well. It is great on elbows and feet.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I began using this ointment when I was around 400 lbs and was getting skin infections from yeast. This stuff works better than anything I have ever used, and I have used a lot of products. When I worked in a nursing home I had a patient that was incontinent of stool constantly and stayed raw. I suggested this product to her &amp; she told me it changed her life. I highly recommend this cream to anyone having any kind of skin discomfort. I cannot say enough about this product. I always keep 2 jars in the house!</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible. I started putting it on my dry cracked heels because it is so thick and I needed something to get into and soften those deep cracks. I have tried many different things and this has worked better than any other cream or lotion that I tried. It worked great on my dry hands too. I looked for it in the store, but the only thing I could find was the almond skin creme and didn&#x27;t like how strongly scented it was. The scent of this is very mild.</li>
            <li> This creme has done wonders for my children&#x27;s skin. My daughter has very dry skin and since we have begun using this creme on her body, it feels soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom. Very great product.</li>
            <li> My baby works well with this product, small face very slippery, very nourishing, moisturizing good, very good, very satisfied! Would continue using it!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, tall 4 Burts Bees jars of cream had turned rancid and I&#x27;ve not been able to use them.</li>
            <li> Product has changed, can not be used</li>
            <li> my baby likes it so much~~~~it is smoothie, she likes to use every day and night!!! thank you ~~~i will buy it again!</li>
