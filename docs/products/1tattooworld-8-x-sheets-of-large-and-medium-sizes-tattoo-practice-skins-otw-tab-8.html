            <li> It&#x27;s still not quite the same as real skin</li>
            <li> But it is very hard to clean ink off.</li>
            <li> This item arrived first by at least a day.  </li>
            <li> but it will help you out in the long run.</li>
            <li> When I would use a stencil design, it would stay wet, even after a hour of drying.</li>
            <li> they are very weird materiel and very thin and nothing like real skin at all you could not get better at tattooing by using these</li>
            <li> Fake skin is very very rubbery.</li>
            <li> Just like the other reviews state, ink stains this product.</li>
            <li> These practice skins are helpful, and I have found that a stencil will stay on them if you let it dry for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> But for the price, amount and the fast delivery you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> It does not feel like skin and wastes needles.</li>
            <li> the bad thing is when wipping ink it smirrs and hard to clean evn with green soap cant see what im doing..</li>
            <li> Any work done on them will look like crap because the ink smears and stains the whole sheet.</li>
            <li> They smear really bad when tattooing them the only way to help the smearing and help the smearing be cleaned off is putting vasaline  on the skins before tattooing.</li>
            <li> the sheets are so thin that you WILL tattoo into your table or skin if you us it that way.</li>
            <li> they would make you a worse tattoo artist.</li>
            <li> These sythetic skins do not take ink very well, shading is terrible..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even tattoo on it because my needles catch on the rubber and it stinks.</li>
            <li> They came to me incredibly dirty, and not well packed.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> Worst tattoo practice skin on the market!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered a bunch of items from about 7 different sellers, and all at the same time.  This item arrived first by at least a day.  They come as shown in the picture, and not overly packaged.  I will use this seller again.    Charlie</li>
            <li> These are ok. They smear really bad when tattooing them the only way to help the smearing and help the smearing be cleaned off is putting vasaline  on the skins before tattooing.</li>
            <li> Product ships fast and seller is dependable with sending exactly what is shown in the picture. This seller is a good seller. You will recieve exactly what you buy.</li>
            <li> this skim is great now for some people it will take a lil longer for dilivery but it is vary much worth the wait......love it great deal</li>
            <li> 8 x SHEETS OF LARGE AND MEDIUM SIZES TATTOO PRACTICE SKINS is a perfect practice material for tattooing. Will order from again.</li>
            <li> These practice skins are helpful, and I have found that a stencil will stay on them if you let it dry for a few minutes. Just like the other reviews state, ink stains this product. I have tried everything I can think of and nothing will fully clean them.</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted, very useful to practice</li>
            <li> Came on time,great product</li>
            <li> 3 stars thought it would b almost alike to skin its jus rubber could get this product anywere wish I known would of saved money on shipping</li>
            <li> Horrible! This is nothing more than rubber! Tattoo needle doesn&#x27;t penetrate the rubber. I tossed my whole pack in the trash.</li>
            <li> It does not feel like skin and wastes needles. It rubber</li>
            <li> Worst tattoo practice skin on the market!! Do your self a favor and don&#x27;t buy this junk, you can&#x27;t even shade in the tattoo and when you wipe it, the ink gets every where</li>
            <li> Fake skin is very very rubbery. I can&#x27;t even tattoo on it because my needles catch on the rubber and it stinks.</li>
            <li> Great for when you are starting up!</li>
            <li> They came to me incredibly dirty, and not well packed. DO NOT USE ON ANYTHING BUT A TABLE WITH A TOWEL OVER IT!!!! the sheets are so thin that you WILL tattoo into your table or skin if you us it that way. Any work done on them will look like crap because the ink smears and stains the whole sheet. Go buy real pig skin. It&#x27;s still not quite the same as real skin but it will help you out in the long run. And it&#x27;s easy to get it for cheap or even free from the store...</li>
            <li> I guess you can practice on this better than paper. But it is very hard to clean ink off.</li>
            <li> Ordered these cause i thought they would be ok, But i was wrong they are very weird materiel and very thin and nothing like real skin at all you could not get better at tattooing by using these they would make you a worse tattoo artist.</li>
            <li> Looks and feel like real skin haven&#x27;t chance to use the for Tattooing  practice as of yet so I dint onto how it will work</li>
            <li> Exactly as posted n fast shipping</li>
            <li> Returned.  Could not use at all</li>
            <li> the skins were okay they did the job i just didnt get the amount i ordered try filling the orders fully before shipping</li>
            <li> When i first started doing tattoos, this was a great way to practice. I recommend this to any starter tattoo artist.</li>
            <li> I found that these practice skins are to glosses. The only way to keep your desgn on them is by using Sharpie permanent markers. When I would use a stencil design, it would stay wet, even after a hour of drying. But for the price, amount and the fast delivery you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> They just suck. Doesn&#x27;t hold in ink and on top of that they don&#x27;t even allow you to make lines. Its too tacky.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product. It works great and have had no problems with it. Now its just learning how to tattoo!</li>
            <li> Good for practicing but the bad thing is when wipping ink it smirrs and hard to clean evn with green soap cant see what im doing..</li>
            <li> never purchased practice skin b4 but this arrived fast and works great to fix the ink smearing like whats listed in the one star review use a thin layer of vasoline over the area your working on it will keep the work area clean and dab the excess ink thats on the skin don&#x27;t wipe this will cause more smearing hope this was helpfull</li>
            <li> These sythetic skins do not take ink very well, shading is terrible.. also wiping off excess ink is a P.I.T.A. it easily stains</li>
