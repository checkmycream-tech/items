            <li>100% happy customer, quick shipping, product as pictured, highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>Easy to remove too.</li>
            <li>coats nicely and doesn&#x27;t clump very much.  </li>
            <li>This looks like it could really be a fantastic brush...</li>
            <li>, I enjoy them all.</li>
            <li>I will just continue to purchase the FULL size version.  </li>
            <li>Eye became quickly irritated.  </li>
            <li>Great mascara all around, i will definitely stock up will more in the future.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price when compared to the cost of a full tube triple the price....</li>

            <li>Not what it was represented to be, and the tubes pretty dry.  </li>
            <li>I wish it could be little cheaper in price, but its worth it.</li>
            <li>The brush carries so much mascara on it that it is almost impossible to do more than one coat...and that coat sticks lashes together and clumps.</li>
            <li>I have tried several other new products</li>

            <li> I have tried several other new products</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give that dramatic look to your eyes and it runs so easily with water, which is a particular advantage for me as I don&#x27;t like to wear heavy make up for work, but for a party I won&#x27;t consider using this product.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product, so I splurged and put out the money for this mascara and could hardly wait for it to arrive!</li>
            <li> It seems like any other mascara to me.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is it leaves a black pigment under my eyes</li>
            <li> maybe the problem is with the mascara, but the two together just make a mess of my lashes.</li>
            <li> but this item does not do what they say it does  on top if that if you get just a little water on your eyes it will run like crazy Sorry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not clumpy or messy.  </li>
            <li> it makes the eye look wider, lashes fuller and it does feel hard after hours of wear.</li>
            <li> I have very small eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have to say I wasn&#x27;t disappointed with the natural volume it added to my lashes.</li>
            <li> I have thin lashes  and when use This mascara my lashes appear thicker and fuller.  </li>
            <li> This was a serious disappointment as it hardly had any in it.</li>
            <li> It took me like 10 times in order to SHOW I had some on sorry</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I used it and was very disappointed.  </li>

            <li> Best mascara ever. I purchase and try almost every mascara on the market and this one is exceptional! My daughter, daughter in law and 4 girlfriends all use this mascara and we all love it! Eyelashes are longer, fuller and sexy!</li>
            <li> I have thin lashes  and when use This mascara my lashes appear thicker and fuller.  It&#x27;s not clumpy or messy.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Not what it was represented to be, and the tubes pretty dry.  I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the results of this mascara.</li>
            <li> I have very small eyelashes. Whenever I wear this it enhances my appearance.  Very good product for those who wants volume.</li>
            <li> Great mascara all around, i will definitely stock up will more in the future. This product lived up to its name</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the price when compared to the cost of a full tube triple the price.... excellent mascara buy it</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this mascara!!! The only complaint I have is it leaves a black pigment under my eyes but I noticed when I apply powder it doesn&#x27;t happen. Besides that it&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> Comparable to Falsies by Cover Girl. Very easy to apply. Thicker lashes instantly. Easy to remove too. Trial size is a good start.</li>
            <li> I found eye lashes that I didn&#x27;t know I had!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great discovery!!! it makes the eye look wider, lashes fuller and it does feel hard after hours of wear. I love it!!!! I wish it could be little cheaper in price, but its worth it.</li>
            <li> I use this every day mixed with the Butterfly voluminous mascara, even by its self it gives you amazing lashes. I love this product!</li>
            <li> This is BY FAR my new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> This is just ok.  coats nicely and doesn&#x27;t clump very much.  The brush is sort of stumpy but good for a travel size.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product, so I splurged and put out the money for this mascara and could hardly wait for it to arrive! When it arrived, I used it and was very disappointed.  It didn&#x27;t thicken, curl or lengthen any more than the $3 Wet &#x27;n Wild mascara I recently purchased. I didn&#x27;t find the wand anything to write home about, either.  Save your money and buy a good $6-$7 mascara and you&#x27;ll be much happier!!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!  Wish it were waterproof but I still love it!</li>
            <li> The brush carries so much mascara on it that it is almost impossible to do more than one coat...and that coat sticks lashes together and clumps. This looks like it could really be a fantastic brush...maybe the problem is with the mascara, but the two together just make a mess of my lashes. I have been on a mission to find the best mascara for my lashes for over a year, and this is NOT one of the better ones. I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> No packing, no listing of ingedients.  For all I know items could have been purchased  and use by someone prior to my use.  Eye became quickly irritated.  Under the conditions I was unwise to use it.  Wouldn&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> i love this mascara!  if you only like to use one coat, this mascara is for you.</li>
            <li> I saw this advertised on Wendy Williams and I had to have it. I am not as impressed as I thought I would be. It seems like any other mascara to me. I would purchase this again if it was on sale but it didn&#x27;t impress me as a Got to have it item.</li>
            <li> I like it but I did think my lashes would look more vavoom. I can get a better effect with Maybelline masacara.</li>
            <li> It took me like 10 times in order to SHOW I had some on sorry but this item does not do what they say it does  on top if that if you get just a little water on your eyes it will run like crazy Sorry</li>
            <li> Since trying this mascara, I have not been without. It always looks good on me and I can trust that. I have had large tube&#x27;s and mini&#x27;s, I enjoy them all. This is my favorite mascara and I will continue to repurchase. I have tried several other new products but I continue to use this. Nothing comes close.</li>
            <li> i love this mascara. i watched a review on this and ordered it through here and so far i am very happy. delivery was fast and on time. my eyelashes look amazing with just two coats.</li>
            <li> Not too impressed with this mascara.  Too clumpy.</li>
            <li> 100% happy customer, quick shipping, product as pictured, highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Nice they do smear, and they are small</li>

All in all I&#x27;m happy I bought this and I will be restocking soon.</li>
            <li> I will just continue to purchase the FULL size version.  This was a serious disappointment as it hardly had any in it.</li>
            <li> There are other mascaras made by Too Faced that are better.  I like Size Queen better.  It has a better wand.</li>
