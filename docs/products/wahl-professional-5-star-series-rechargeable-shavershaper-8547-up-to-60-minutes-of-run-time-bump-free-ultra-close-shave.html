            <li>I love, love, love this shaver!</li>
            <li>First time buying this item and it was great choose.</li>
            <li>so I searched and found the exact shaver for a great price too.  </li>
            <li>the gold shaver is very light and may be damaged if you travel with it.</li>
            <li>Hold it very lightly almost to the point to fall off your hand.</li>
            <li>I have very light hairs and this shaver will not shave them even after many passes.</li>
            <li>I love the shaver.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Also doesn&#x27;t get the hair under my chin if I go without shaving for more than 1 day.</li>
            <li>Excellent shaver, I was turned on big my barber.</li>
            <li>my husband and son love them</li>
            <li>Cant ask for more.</li>
            <li>but I got a better cut by leeting the razor</li>
            <li>Love it love...</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Love This product.</li>
            <li>Smooth as a baby!</li>
            <li>I am in love with mine</li>
            <li>I read many reviews before I purchased this.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a better model.</li>
            <li>and I used a friends once and love the feel afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have given this to many people for birthday and christmas gifts.  </li>
            <li>Love this shaver...</li>
            <li>but when it does.... theres nothing better</li>
            <li>After that many times my bald head is hurt by the scrapping, or oscillating blades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off let me say this clipper does everything it says it does and more.</li>
            <li>Use it as recommended and you will be thoroughly satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>Great product reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It works well and seems to be a better design than the rotary models I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s made my skin fad s that much better.</li>
            <li>The most I hear they like is the closest shave they get with it.</li>
            <li>I love my 5 Star Series .........</li>
            <li>After using my Andis edgers to get most of the sideburn/beard lined up...these shavers finish it off&lt;br /&gt;giving</li>
            <li>love this, I use it on my head instead of using a razor.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li>better then a razor because you can cut your self..</li>
            <li>and I want to make sure I have a replacement.</li>
            <li>and I Love it.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 more replacement foils and blades for it just incase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many razors....</li>
            <li>Woman will love to rub your face again.</li>
            <li>As a barber student, we have used this shaver many times on clients.</li>
            <li>There are so many shavers out there with gimmicks</li>
            <li>Shaver is okay.</li>
            <li>It cuts so close that you almost surely get bumps.</li>
            <li>You will save a lot more money and time.</li>
            <li>I received this product on time and was very excited to give it to my boyfriend as a just because gift.</li>
            <li>This works pretty good</li>
            <li>but it nicked me up pretty good on 1st use.  </li>
            <li>First electric razor that shaved face as good as a blade.</li>
            <li>I Could feel my face becoming more irritated as well because of the increase in ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, battery life is good.</li>
            <li>worth the purchase!!</li>
            <li>5 star price range which are better more accurate shavers.</li>
            <li>Each was good, but only so good.</li>
            <li>This device lasts and lasts on a charge and is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I love this shaver, it&#x27;s has my face baby smooth.  </li>
            <li>As far as performance on balding on hair, it works GREAT for the exception of loudness</li>
            <li>Most electronics these days that have a rechargeable battery built inside have a charging light built into it as well</li>
            <li>Worked best for me if used every other day..</li>
            <li>Overall they are happy, and I&#x27;ll say, the price was great and the delivery super fast!</li>
            <li>It Cuts Super Close &amp; Very Smooth.</li>
            <li>Quick shaves, no razor burn, very precise.</li>
            <li>It picked up fine hairs that were not caught by razor blade.  </li>
            <li>but if you just plug in to the shaver its fine</li>
            <li>A replacement shield was provided and the razor works fine.</li>
            <li>The item itself works fine</li>
            <li>This is the best shaver for black men.</li>
            <li>but this works just fine when traveling.</li>
            <li>Pretty effective, but I have beard hair that goes every which way, so I give it a pass with my fiveblade afterward and it&#x27;s all clean.</li>
            <li>That was a huge plus!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a comfortable close shave.</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic housing</li>
            <li>When I plug it, the signal light don&#x27;t comes to see if it&#x27;s charging or not.</li>
            <li>Great product but had to replace the the foil cover after only 1 month use.</li>
            <li>Overall great value for the performance of the trim.  </li>
            <li>For those who shave everyday, it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li>No charging light.</li>
            <li>Light weight</li>
            <li>They run smooth without pulling on the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to Braun and Eltron, they cost over $200 and this this is not made as well (cheap plastic case), but I suppose that is what you get for $50.  </li>
            <li>This shaver will get you a smooth to the touch shave.</li>
            <li>#34;gwhiz demonstrates the Wahl 5 star shaver shaper&amp;#34; and it shows you how to use it as to not tear the foil and get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>but they raved about how smooth their skin felt after the barber shaved them</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s because you aren&#x27;t using it correctly this shave will leave your skin smooth</li>
            <li>Without the charging light how is one to know if the shaver is fully charged or if the charger works at all.</li>
            <li>I must see the dock really comes in handy.</li>
            <li>In a few words this is the best, point.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time buying another brand, this one is the best</li>
            <li>Smooth cut with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>My face is smooth and it doesn&#x27;t leave any bumps.</li>
            <li>SMOOTH shave with ZERO</li>
            <li>easy to clean</li>
            <li>Barber since 1990 use this shaver everyday in my shop Great !</li>
            <li>it leaves me baby smooth an irritation free</li>
            <li>Really smooth on the skin</li>
            <li>the charging light and the two piece stand is kinda of wobbly.</li>
            <li>In that light, this has shaver has spared me any, my primary goal for buying it.</li>
            <li>Great for personal use or at the barber shop.</li>
            <li>So after the T-Ouliner I bust out my Wahl 5 Star to smooth the rest of my face out.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this if you want smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>Purchased primarily to serve as head shaver.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver, but it is for a SPECIALIZED use only!</li>
            <li>smooth operation, i like it</li>
            <li>Fantastic shaver.</li>
            <li>No bumps which is awesome but wish it got closer still have to shave with razor after in few spots on my face</li>
            <li>Good product thus far.  </li>
            <li>and, So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>From what I hear if you charge it right out of the box, this screws up your battery life which is probably why many people claim that they can&#x27;t use it as a coordless shaver anymore because it won&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li>it holds a very good charge and is extremely lightweight</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very powerful.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very strong cuts very close to the skin for that bald smooth look.</li>
            <li>Also there is no charging light on the 8547 model shaver that was originally on the 8061 model.</li>
            <li>Clean shave and bump free.</li>
            <li>I have a wahl hair clipper made out of nice high impact plastic.  </li>
            <li>Wish it came with a power light to show that battery is charging and it has a full charge.</li>
            <li>My original rating was 4 stars.</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>I was excited about this item before it arrived.</li>
            <li>and he was excited about it as well.  </li>
            <li>It came in the mail in a matter or days and in its original packaging.</li>
            <li>This is the FIRST electric razor I have ever been able to use on my skin.</li>
            <li>This shaver doesn&#x27;t cut long hair and that&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>and then she used the Wahl Shaver Shaper to clean up all around my beard.</li>
            <li>As he had to be clean shaven for his job, it fits his needs in every waoy.</li>
            <li>clear plastic cover that fits over the shaving head is kind of cheap and doesn&#x27;t click in place.</li>
            <li>Close clean shave.</li>
            <li>Close, clean trim.</li>
            <li>This shaver did not cut as clean as&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned several brands of foil razors but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I was hoping the 5 star would have been the best thing next to a razor for my sensitive skin..</li>
            <li>Then use the Super Shaver and it cuts beneath the skin for a painless smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a loyal amazon customer and just about every product I&#x27;ve purchased in the past has been great!</li>
            <li>Excellent, easy to use and shaves extremely low WOTHOU FACIAL BUMPS!</li>
            <li>Its perfect as expected I love the machine completely everything about it is just right</li>
            <li>Love this, holds a long charge and real smooth.</li>
            <li>This is my first real product review, and I wish that it came with heaps of celebration for an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>They give a better closer shave than the straight razor I use.</li>
            <li>I saw it being used by my barber and figured it was good enough for me if it worked for him.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my son as a Christmas present and he loved it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried most of the high dollar razors &amp; none of them compare to this one!</li>
            <li>Thought I would clear that up for anyone wondering how you would let a razor glide on its own weight in a horizontal postion against your face.</li>
            <li>Additional hair products may need to be used for true bump-free.</li>
            <li>For a shaver that cost this much I expect better packaging and a product that doesn&#x27;t arrive damaged.</li>
            <li>Its a good shaver to replace traditional water shaving.</li>
            <li>I bought my husband one of these razors several years ago from a discount department store and he loved it.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone that wants a Close, Baby Smooth Face/Shave!</li>
            <li>Shaves much closer and better.</li>
            <li>great for personal or professional use!!!!</li>
            <li>I would say its the best shaver for a African American</li>
            <li>Super close shave all around.</li>
            <li>I wanted something quick as an alternative to a razo shave.</li>
            <li>all my bold friends are getting one</li>
            <li>you are looking for a super close shave in minutes</li>
            <li>This tools gets super close</li>
            <li>The Super Shaver gets rid of &amp;#34;STUBS&amp;#34; from close clippers like Andis Styliner or Wahl 5 Star detailer.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would work for me because it speeds up my mornings tremendously.</li>
            <li>When I first started using these clippers my face was super smooth because of how close the razor cut on my face.  </li>
            <li>I use a trimmer first to start and then use this to get that smooth finish.</li>
            <li>The 5 Star has given me a truly bump-free, smooth as eggs, stubble-free shave on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li>I love my new wahl 5star, I think every hair stylist / barber must have.</li>
            <li>It seem to be more new and approved</li>
            <li>fast and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Pretty</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m aware that it works great for other users, but not for me.</li>
            <li>I works great but a few hairs</li>
            <li>In reducing the amount of pressure to the razor and letting it glide over my skin on its own weight I found that not only did it not damage the foil</li>
            <li>After using it I would have to agree, worth the money.</li>
            <li>Better than its predecessor by far.</li>
            <li>Clearly my skin can&#x27;t handle more use from this.</li>
            <li>I never had a razor that kept my beard so fresh.</li>
            <li>This really does a good job shaving my facial hair.</li>
            <li>Powerful motor.</li>
            <li>This shaver gives a very close shave for the most part - however it misses many softer hairs so that I have to use a regular razor to remove them.  </li>
            <li>This one is not cutting like his.</li>
            <li>this 5 star is really worth 5</li>
            <li>Powerful</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone needing that close and easy shave</li>
            <li>It also misses some of the hair deep within the skin but other than that excellent close shave.</li>
            <li>I final bit the bullet and purchased this shaver for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find shaving every other day works best for my skin type</li>
            <li>other than that they&#x27;re good shavers.</li>
            <li>The razor stubble feel is there right after you shave and doesn&#x27;t leave.  </li>
            <li>so I managed to pry the cover off in order to get at the dysfunctional side button and discovered that apparently some cheap plastic part that the button is supposed to press against was broken off, but the top cover is easy to pry off with a good</li>
            <li>Cuts real close, fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The company that filled my order, Forever Young, packaged the product well and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>First off I would like to say that I rarely write reviews for my purchases.</li>
            <li>As usual, Amazon was great about handling the shipping delay and the damage.  </li>
            <li>Who ever packaged the item did not ensure that the items was in the box with a nice tight fit.</li>
            <li>they were suppose to be new with free shipping and handling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to use electric shavers and was skeptic to say the least about trying another one, but the Wahl Shaver Shaper is by far the best darn shaver I have used.</li>
            <li>Clipper are great for African American skin.</li>
            <li>It actually does cut as close as a blade, and I sometimes trim myself up just because it&#x27;s so quick and easy -- probably because this thing has a powerful motor and must have precision blades.</li>
            <li>Works amazing for that tight clean bald fade.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good, fast and sharp shaver, this is the one.</li>
            <li>So my experience is this shaver is good for a quick touch-up in between a traditional razor shave for the times when you only have 30 seconds to be done and out the door.</li>
            <li>All the positive reviews are def right on.</li>
            <li>Great for hard to reach areas on the head and neck.&lt;br /&gt;DEF</li>
            <li>my, my, my...what a disappointment..the thing damn near took my flesh of of my skin the very first day I tried it!</li>
            <li>First week foil breaks apart, bought a replacement part and then the charger goes out</li>
            <li>Cheap clear plastic shaver protector</li>
            <li>but it did work pretty well with shaving my beard.</li>
            <li>WAHL 5 Star is a BASIC Electric Shaver and works if you use the appropriate shaving head.</li>
            <li>Finally I opened the top of the shaver to look inside of it  </li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the shaver...</li>
            <li>The exact date estimated by Amazon and it was packaged as stated in the description.</li>
            <li>I can go over the same hairs and it just does not cut most of the hairs.  </li>
            <li>I first learned of this product years ago at my barbershop.  </li>
            <li>When I first used it on my face to get the littler hairs off my chin and cheek area off, and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Had to go over same spot on neck many times.</li>
            <li>The shaver is the exact item used by my barber.</li>
            <li>The replaceable foil guard broke in the first two weeks.</li>
            <li>recieving the shaver i used it on my face the first day.  </li>
            <li>It is really too early to give a good rating, maybe later on.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered something from Amazon &amp; it was damaged.  </li>
            <li>it WILL break on the first drop</li>
            <li>It gets closer than a straight edge!</li>
            <li>This is my third Wahl shaver over many years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After my first shave I did get bumps</li>
            <li>You need to make sure there is enough charge in it before you start your shave.</li>
            <li>I started shaving my head pretty bald</li>
            <li>Yes if you have curly hair the shave you will love because it&#x27;s beyond razor quality, and it only takes 3 min.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my personal use &amp; love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it after shaving with my clippers, and they really shaves close!</li>
            <li>good battery life&lt;br /&gt;Charging may take a few minutes but ok&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>As a black man with shaving problems this has been a great product so far.</li>
            <li>I have DE shaved as well as straight razor shaved and this shaver has left my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>Very clean shave the only problem is</li>
            <li>They also refunded my extra shipping so, as usual, they were more than fair to work with.    </li>
            <li>I love it stops me from getting bumps and was shipped fast next year</li>
            <li>Extraordinary, it really shaves closer than any machine I have ever had, although it is very, very, very noisy, I can live with it</li>
            <li>(I pressed a button on the side ) and long behold there was more hair as if someone used them just before shipping them to me .</li>
            <li>Definitely a product worth trying if you want a clean, close shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like moving from a lawn tractor to a large combine tractor.  </li>
            <li>It is a large trimmer.  </li>
            <li>However I cannot say that I am completely satisfied with this particular razor as it began to break down rather quickly.</li>
            <li>You can throw down a line and use this to shave the neck and cheeks right over the top of your line up.</li>
            <li>but truthfully I get a much better shave with a generic 3-blade disposable razor for way less the price of this.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend you give this razor a try, i rate it very high.</li>
            <li>The shaver foil that contacts your face is smooth and large enough</li>
            <li>Cut great but a little to low for me..</li>
            <li>I did not get a smooth shave and you can only use it if your hair is fine &amp; very short.</li>
            <li>Great close shave and non irritating.</li>
            <li>This product is very efficient</li>
            <li>It allows you to really define the lines in your beard without a lot of effort.</li>
            <li>As a barber, it&#x27;s become an important tool to have, especially for bald fades.</li>
            <li>Work very well.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really use it for my head instead of my face.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have to go to a barber for a bald head...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Very close shave&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find much of a use for it</li>
            <li>Holds charge really well.  </li>
            <li>Very close to a blade shave.</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>Very close shave.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much too soon to be replacing foils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>After replacing the foil I found that I was applying too much pressure to the razor in an attempt to get a closer cut.</li>
            <li>Much faster, closer shave than my Norelco razors.  </li>
            <li>I was very upset .</li>
            <li>Gets closer than my straight blade.</li>
            <li>very efficient.</li>
            <li>Shaves fast.</li>
            <li>I then used clippers to shave close and straight razor to edge.</li>
            <li>is when I have used a straight razor.</li>
            <li>but it works very well.</li>
            <li>shipping time was poor, product great</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Dont cut and scrape your gentle head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also real noisy.</li>
            <li>I really like that.</li>
            <li>If your beard grows really fast this razor may not be for you.</li>
            <li>Cuts very close like a razor and leaves no bumps.</li>
            <li>But powerful as allget out, I like it so far</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves how close of a shave he gets.</li>
            <li>It really does give you that razor closeness.</li>
            <li>-thanks</li>
            <li>The whole thing vibrates when it&#x27;s on, ready to roll, and roll it does.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put it on the charger straight out of the box.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>Reaplacement screens are reasonably priced .</li>
            <li>They work better than expected.</li>
            <li>I first tried the shaver, the first thing I noticed is how LOUD this shaver is.  </li>
            <li>This gets the hair low enough for the razor to be effective.</li>
            <li>Has excellent power and cuts hair with very minimal irritation in those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>Working better than I expected!  </li>
            <li>Might use a real razor for special occasions, but definitely use this every day.</li>
            <li>it will not cut longer hairs only clean up stubble.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this for anyone doing bald fades or who want a really close shave with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>My other trimmer does get the rest of my leftover whiskers off... and I am left with a nice smooth shave overall...</li>
            <li>It shaves pretty close and so far its the fastest shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Excelent Product, This is the 3rd one i have owened they are very durable ,and last for many years ,they shave well and are made in the USA.</li>
            <li>We are pretty sure this was used and then resold as new, pieces were missing and the screen broke within a month</li>
            <li>husband LOVES his new shaver!</li>
            <li>If hair is parallel to skin, more than likely this shaver will not shave it off.</li>
            <li>Wahl 5 star series workso well beard needs to be very short then cuts super.</li>
            <li>After several years of going to the barbershop and appreciating the super close shave.</li>
            <li>Nothing (besides not shaving) helped, and I tried a LOT of solutions: bump patrol, shaving more frequently, mach XX razors, wet shave.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for a close shave with no pulling of my beard.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I Highly Recommend The Wahl 5 Star Rechargeable Shaver.</li>
            <li>highly recommend before using you</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;My barber uses this shaver so I decided to buy it as well.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I expected a bit of an easier shave but, for the price, it works fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little noisy but aside from that I have no complaints, my clients love it and it is a quality product.</li>
            <li>I just wish the Wahl could handle longer whiskers just a little better...</li>
            <li>It gets almost as close as a straight razor and doesn&#x27;t irritate those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product and I use it at least 3-4 times per week, letting my facial hair sometimes reach a point where a razor would be better.  </li>
            <li>I had a Panasonic and it was great but expensive.</li>
            <li>my white friend finds it useful.</li>
            <li>For my face, I&#x27;ve found this to work better than shaving everyday.</li>
            <li>Pros:  Fast, wide head, shaves super close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I break out sometimes and this made me break out the 2nd time because I didn&#x27;t use it right.</li>
            <li>But the charger was there still looking new and the stand was there with instructions..</li>
            <li>I will return and ask for a new one.</li>
            <li>Battery life is not as promised, I will exchange it for a new one.</li>
            <li>Gets the job done, I use it in barber school and its a clean cut, do not go left to right with it use it up and down or turn it to go left and right.</li>
            <li>This shaver is very loud to my ears.</li>
            <li>Very, very loud....</li>
            <li>very old style Wahl shaver.</li>
            <li>Very loud motor - it wakes my wife in an adjacent room.</li>
            <li>I first opened the shaver, I was amazed at how big the shaver is.</li>
            <li>..use trimmer first before using this product to lower your facial hair</li>
            <li>This thing is loud!  </li>
            <li>It takes ALL STUBBLE COMPLETELY AWAY!</li>
            <li>Way too loud!</li>
            <li>Although they could not replace the damaged part, they did offer a full return refund or partial cash refund.  </li>
            <li>Works well but use smooth up and down strokes or you will get razor bumps.</li>
            <li>Gotta clean it every other day or so.  </li>
            <li>but, for everyday shaving it works fine.    </li>
            <li>but you have to cut it down first with a different shaver the this one for the super close shave.</li>
            <li>However I still have my old shaver that has a trimmer on it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very noisy compared to my last 2 Norelco</li>
            <li>Kinda loud</li>
            <li>Used an old phone charger to have it work again.</li>
            <li>Loud and does provide close shave.</li>
            <li>I have gone back to a straight razor  </li>
            <li>Purchased for 93 year old father.</li>
            <li>This razor is really loud</li>
            <li>WOW is it loud...</li>
            <li>Wow what a shave.</li>
            <li>So you need to make sure you charge it for at least an hour before you use it</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t like the the loud noise the machine makes.</li>
            <li>me that soft as a baby butt</li>
            <li>I must say that I was surprised when they contacted me and sent me another shaver</li>
            <li>I suffered for years with razor bumps and burn...as long as you trim first with an edger</li>
            <li>The I have had so far</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The razor does provide a really close shave and there were less noticeable hair bumps even after the first use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unfortunate that such a good razor only lasted long enough for me to truly love</li>
            <li>razors.&lt;br /&gt;I marked it down based on 1) high price, 2) noise, 3) can&#x27;t use water like the higher end</li>
            <li>it is for the bald heads of African American gentlemen, and it may be very capable for that purpose.</li>
            <li>and this gets down very close and gives an even look..!!</li>
            <li>The battery lasts long and it cuts very close.</li>
            <li>The item was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Watched the video and noticed it seemed to work really well for African American men.</li>
            <li>An to replace the foil is not cheap for it to break that quick.</li>
            <li>Works well, cut down on barber shop time... and saves money, paid for itself already... as advertised.. even came fully charged, use right away.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with the foil and it trims my face so fast im done in 1min.</li>
            <li>We had to return the first shaver due to defects.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t expect this razor to last a really long time but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d dock it 1 star for how loud this puppy gets, but this is truly a fantastic addition to my daily routine and a small price to pay for being bump-free.</li>
            <li>Definitely needed the full two weeks if use prior to getting the shave I expected.</li>
            <li>Last a long time one single full charge.</li>
            <li>: Very noisy, foil didn&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped (4 weeks)</li>
            <li>As long as you use it daily, it works very well.  </li>
            <li>If you wait much longer it won&#x27;t cut hair that is long enough to be pressed against the skin.</li>
            <li>Going back to my old shaver.</li>
            <li>I understand that some parts will wear and tear naturally, but before Wahl came out with this five-star burgundy version of this razor, it seemed to last a lot longer.</li>
            <li>I could barely move my neck for two days..and guess what else??</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only shaved with it for about 5 shaving sessions so far</li>
            <li>Clunky and did a poor job shaving my 2 day beard along my chin and neck (did OK on cheeks).  </li>
            <li>Cleaning is a bit of a pain, but worth the trouble.</li>
            <li>i have bought this product before and was satisfied, it was time for a new one and the one i recently received is extremely loud and uncomfortable to use on my clients.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t charge it until it first dies down.</li>
            <li>You have to shave the hair down First.</li>
            <li>I was already more than halfway through my shave, so I finished despite having half the foil missing from the razor.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is so wide, and with the double blades, it shaves both close and fast.  </li>
            <li>Only issue i have is that it does not actively &#x27;search&#x27; for anything longer than stubble.</li>
            <li>I am African American male with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The first time using it, I had to trim down my facial hair (with my Wahl Detailer).</li>
            <li>Oh remember it does not remove long hairs but works better everyday or ever other day.  </li>
            <li>Before the 5 Star, the only thing that worked good enough was a Wahl Detailer hair trimmer (usually used for shape-ups), but that still left a small amount of stubble that had to be taken care of daily.</li>
            <li>Not very sharp at all, i even bought the replacement blades and external foil, but nothing changed.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t work on whiskers much longer than one thirty second of an inch, so daily or every other day use is mandatory.  </li>
            <li>I get less irritation and the shave is very close.</li>
            <li>little guy is very robust.</li>
            <li>Some were good and some were bad.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, after looking at the good and bad reviews for this shaver, I decided to give it a try...</li>

            <li> Awesome item, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Nice design for holding &amp; charging</li>
            <li> Works great for a clean shave.  </li>

            <li> Great shaver super close.</li>

            <li> Nice close shave, love it.</li>
            <li> Twenty years after I abandoned blades forever this is by far the best shaver I have used.</li>
            <li> gives great shave, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Any who, This is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this shaver!</li>
            <li> First time buying this item and it was great choose.</li>
            <li> so I searched and found the exact shaver for a great price too.  </li>
            <li> the gold shaver is very light and may be damaged if you travel with it.</li>
            <li> Hold it very lightly almost to the point to fall off your hand.</li>
            <li> I have very light hairs and this shaver will not shave them even after many passes.</li>
            <li> I love the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t get the hair under my chin if I go without shaving for more than 1 day.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver, I was turned on big my barber.</li>
            <li> my husband and son love them</li>
            <li> Cant ask for more.</li>
            <li> but I got a better cut by leeting the razor</li>
            <li> Love it love...</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> Love This product.</li>
            <li> Smooth as a baby!</li>
            <li> I am in love with mine</li>
            <li> I read many reviews before I purchased this.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a better model.</li>
            <li> and I used a friends once and love the feel afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have given this to many people for birthday and christmas gifts.  </li>
            <li> Love this shaver...</li>
            <li> but when it does.... theres nothing better</li>
            <li> After that many times my bald head is hurt by the scrapping, or oscillating blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off let me say this clipper does everything it says it does and more.</li>
            <li> Use it as recommended and you will be thoroughly satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this thing.</li>
            <li> Great product reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It works well and seems to be a better design than the rotary models I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s made my skin fad s that much better.</li>
            <li> The most I hear they like is the closest shave they get with it.</li>
            <li> I love my 5 Star Series .........</li>
            <li> After using my Andis edgers to get most of the sideburn/beard lined up...these shavers finish it off&lt;br /&gt;giving</li>
            <li> love this, I use it on my head instead of using a razor.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> better then a razor because you can cut your self..</li>
            <li> and I want to make sure I have a replacement.</li>
            <li> and I Love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 more replacement foils and blades for it just incase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many razors....</li>
            <li> Woman will love to rub your face again.</li>
            <li> As a barber student, we have used this shaver many times on clients.</li>
            <li> There are so many shavers out there with gimmicks</li>
            <li> Shaver is okay.</li>
            <li> It cuts so close that you almost surely get bumps.</li>
            <li> You will save a lot more money and time.</li>
            <li> I received this product on time and was very excited to give it to my boyfriend as a just because gift.</li>
            <li> This works pretty good</li>
            <li> but it nicked me up pretty good on 1st use.  </li>
            <li> First electric razor that shaved face as good as a blade.</li>
            <li> I Could feel my face becoming more irritated as well because of the increase in ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, battery life is good.</li>
            <li> worth the purchase!!</li>
            <li> 5 star price range which are better more accurate shavers.</li>
            <li> Each was good, but only so good.</li>
            <li> This device lasts and lasts on a charge and is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I love this shaver, it&#x27;s has my face baby smooth.  </li>
            <li> As far as performance on balding on hair, it works GREAT for the exception of loudness</li>
            <li> Most electronics these days that have a rechargeable battery built inside have a charging light built into it as well</li>
            <li> Worked best for me if used every other day..</li>
            <li> Overall they are happy, and I&#x27;ll say, the price was great and the delivery super fast!</li>
            <li> It Cuts Super Close &amp; Very Smooth.</li>
            <li> Quick shaves, no razor burn, very precise.</li>
            <li> It picked up fine hairs that were not caught by razor blade.  </li>
            <li> but if you just plug in to the shaver its fine</li>
            <li> A replacement shield was provided and the razor works fine.</li>
            <li> The item itself works fine</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver for black men.</li>
            <li> but this works just fine when traveling.</li>
            <li> Pretty effective, but I have beard hair that goes every which way, so I give it a pass with my fiveblade afterward and it&#x27;s all clean.</li>
            <li> That was a huge plus!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a comfortable close shave.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic housing</li>
            <li> When I plug it, the signal light don&#x27;t comes to see if it&#x27;s charging or not.</li>
            <li> Great product but had to replace the the foil cover after only 1 month use.</li>
            <li> Overall great value for the performance of the trim.  </li>
            <li> For those who shave everyday, it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> No charging light.</li>
            <li> Light weight</li>
            <li> They run smooth without pulling on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to Braun and Eltron, they cost over $200 and this this is not made as well (cheap plastic case), but I suppose that is what you get for $50.  </li>
            <li> This shaver will get you a smooth to the touch shave.</li>
            <li> #34;gwhiz demonstrates the Wahl 5 star shaver shaper&amp;#34; and it shows you how to use it as to not tear the foil and get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> but they raved about how smooth their skin felt after the barber shaved them</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s because you aren&#x27;t using it correctly this shave will leave your skin smooth</li>
            <li> Without the charging light how is one to know if the shaver is fully charged or if the charger works at all.</li>
            <li> I must see the dock really comes in handy.</li>
            <li> In a few words this is the best, point.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time buying another brand, this one is the best</li>
            <li> Smooth cut with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and it doesn&#x27;t leave any bumps.</li>
            <li> SMOOTH shave with ZERO</li>
            <li> easy to clean</li>
            <li> Barber since 1990 use this shaver everyday in my shop Great !</li>
            <li> it leaves me baby smooth an irritation free</li>
            <li> Really smooth on the skin</li>
            <li> the charging light and the two piece stand is kinda of wobbly.</li>
            <li> In that light, this has shaver has spared me any, my primary goal for buying it.</li>
            <li> Great for personal use or at the barber shop.</li>
            <li> So after the T-Ouliner I bust out my Wahl 5 Star to smooth the rest of my face out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you want smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> Purchased primarily to serve as head shaver.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver, but it is for a SPECIALIZED use only!</li>
            <li> smooth operation, i like it</li>
            <li> Fantastic shaver.</li>
            <li> No bumps which is awesome but wish it got closer still have to shave with razor after in few spots on my face</li>
            <li> Good product thus far.  </li>
            <li> and, So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> From what I hear if you charge it right out of the box, this screws up your battery life which is probably why many people claim that they can&#x27;t use it as a coordless shaver anymore because it won&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li> it holds a very good charge and is extremely lightweight</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powerful.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very strong cuts very close to the skin for that bald smooth look.</li>
            <li> Also there is no charging light on the 8547 model shaver that was originally on the 8061 model.</li>
            <li> Clean shave and bump free.</li>
            <li> I have a wahl hair clipper made out of nice high impact plastic.  </li>
            <li> Wish it came with a power light to show that battery is charging and it has a full charge.</li>
            <li> My original rating was 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> I was excited about this item before it arrived.</li>
            <li> and he was excited about it as well.  </li>
            <li> It came in the mail in a matter or days and in its original packaging.</li>
            <li> This is the FIRST electric razor I have ever been able to use on my skin.</li>
            <li> This shaver doesn&#x27;t cut long hair and that&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> and then she used the Wahl Shaver Shaper to clean up all around my beard.</li>
            <li> As he had to be clean shaven for his job, it fits his needs in every waoy.</li>
            <li> clear plastic cover that fits over the shaving head is kind of cheap and doesn&#x27;t click in place.</li>
            <li> Close clean shave.</li>
            <li> Close, clean trim.</li>
            <li> This shaver did not cut as clean as&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several brands of foil razors but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the 5 star would have been the best thing next to a razor for my sensitive skin..</li>
            <li> Then use the Super Shaver and it cuts beneath the skin for a painless smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a loyal amazon customer and just about every product I&#x27;ve purchased in the past has been great!</li>
            <li> Excellent, easy to use and shaves extremely low WOTHOU FACIAL BUMPS!</li>
            <li> Its perfect as expected I love the machine completely everything about it is just right</li>
            <li> Love this, holds a long charge and real smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my first real product review, and I wish that it came with heaps of celebration for an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> They give a better closer shave than the straight razor I use.</li>
            <li> I saw it being used by my barber and figured it was good enough for me if it worked for him.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my son as a Christmas present and he loved it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried most of the high dollar razors &amp; none of them compare to this one!</li>
            <li> Thought I would clear that up for anyone wondering how you would let a razor glide on its own weight in a horizontal postion against your face.</li>
            <li> Additional hair products may need to be used for true bump-free.</li>
            <li> For a shaver that cost this much I expect better packaging and a product that doesn&#x27;t arrive damaged.</li>
            <li> Its a good shaver to replace traditional water shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought my husband one of these razors several years ago from a discount department store and he loved it.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone that wants a Close, Baby Smooth Face/Shave!</li>
            <li> Shaves much closer and better.</li>
            <li> great for personal or professional use!!!!</li>
            <li> I would say its the best shaver for a African American</li>
            <li> Super close shave all around.</li>
            <li> I wanted something quick as an alternative to a razo shave.</li>
            <li> all my bold friends are getting one</li>
            <li> you are looking for a super close shave in minutes</li>
            <li> This tools gets super close</li>
            <li> The Super Shaver gets rid of &amp;#34;STUBS&amp;#34; from close clippers like Andis Styliner or Wahl 5 Star detailer.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would work for me because it speeds up my mornings tremendously.</li>
            <li> When I first started using these clippers my face was super smooth because of how close the razor cut on my face.  </li>
            <li> I use a trimmer first to start and then use this to get that smooth finish.</li>
            <li> The 5 Star has given me a truly bump-free, smooth as eggs, stubble-free shave on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li> I love my new wahl 5star, I think every hair stylist / barber must have.</li>
            <li> It seem to be more new and approved</li>
            <li> fast and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Pretty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m aware that it works great for other users, but not for me.</li>
            <li> I works great but a few hairs</li>
            <li> In reducing the amount of pressure to the razor and letting it glide over my skin on its own weight I found that not only did it not damage the foil</li>
            <li> After using it I would have to agree, worth the money.</li>
            <li> Better than its predecessor by far.</li>
            <li> Clearly my skin can&#x27;t handle more use from this.</li>
            <li> I never had a razor that kept my beard so fresh.</li>
            <li> This really does a good job shaving my facial hair.</li>
            <li> Powerful motor.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a very close shave for the most part - however it misses many softer hairs so that I have to use a regular razor to remove them.  </li>
            <li> This one is not cutting like his.</li>
            <li> this 5 star is really worth 5</li>
            <li> Powerful</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone needing that close and easy shave</li>
            <li> It also misses some of the hair deep within the skin but other than that excellent close shave.</li>
            <li> I final bit the bullet and purchased this shaver for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find shaving every other day works best for my skin type</li>
            <li> other than that they&#x27;re good shavers.</li>
            <li> The razor stubble feel is there right after you shave and doesn&#x27;t leave.  </li>
            <li> so I managed to pry the cover off in order to get at the dysfunctional side button and discovered that apparently some cheap plastic part that the button is supposed to press against was broken off, but the top cover is easy to pry off with a good</li>
            <li> Cuts real close, fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The company that filled my order, Forever Young, packaged the product well and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> First off I would like to say that I rarely write reviews for my purchases.</li>
            <li> As usual, Amazon was great about handling the shipping delay and the damage.  </li>
            <li> Who ever packaged the item did not ensure that the items was in the box with a nice tight fit.</li>
            <li> they were suppose to be new with free shipping and handling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to use electric shavers and was skeptic to say the least about trying another one, but the Wahl Shaver Shaper is by far the best darn shaver I have used.</li>
            <li> Clipper are great for African American skin.</li>
            <li> It actually does cut as close as a blade, and I sometimes trim myself up just because it&#x27;s so quick and easy -- probably because this thing has a powerful motor and must have precision blades.</li>
            <li> Works amazing for that tight clean bald fade.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good, fast and sharp shaver, this is the one.</li>
            <li> So my experience is this shaver is good for a quick touch-up in between a traditional razor shave for the times when you only have 30 seconds to be done and out the door.</li>
            <li> All the positive reviews are def right on.</li>
            <li> Great for hard to reach areas on the head and neck.&lt;br /&gt;DEF</li>
            <li> my, my, my...what a disappointment..the thing damn near took my flesh of of my skin the very first day I tried it!</li>
            <li> First week foil breaks apart, bought a replacement part and then the charger goes out</li>
            <li> Cheap clear plastic shaver protector</li>
            <li> but it did work pretty well with shaving my beard.</li>
            <li> WAHL 5 Star is a BASIC Electric Shaver and works if you use the appropriate shaving head.</li>
            <li> Finally I opened the top of the shaver to look inside of it  </li>
            <li> but overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the shaver...</li>
            <li> The exact date estimated by Amazon and it was packaged as stated in the description.</li>
            <li> I can go over the same hairs and it just does not cut most of the hairs.  </li>
            <li> I first learned of this product years ago at my barbershop.  </li>
            <li> When I first used it on my face to get the littler hairs off my chin and cheek area off, and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Had to go over same spot on neck many times.</li>
            <li> The shaver is the exact item used by my barber.</li>
            <li> The replaceable foil guard broke in the first two weeks.</li>
            <li> recieving the shaver i used it on my face the first day.  </li>
            <li> It is really too early to give a good rating, maybe later on.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered something from Amazon &amp; it was damaged.  </li>
            <li> it WILL break on the first drop</li>
            <li> It gets closer than a straight edge!</li>
            <li> This is my third Wahl shaver over many years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After my first shave I did get bumps</li>
            <li> You need to make sure there is enough charge in it before you start your shave.</li>
            <li> I started shaving my head pretty bald</li>
            <li> Yes if you have curly hair the shave you will love because it&#x27;s beyond razor quality, and it only takes 3 min.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my personal use &amp; love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it after shaving with my clippers, and they really shaves close!</li>
            <li> good battery life&lt;br /&gt;Charging may take a few minutes but ok&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> As a black man with shaving problems this has been a great product so far.</li>
            <li> I have DE shaved as well as straight razor shaved and this shaver has left my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> Very clean shave the only problem is</li>
            <li> They also refunded my extra shipping so, as usual, they were more than fair to work with.    </li>
            <li> I love it stops me from getting bumps and was shipped fast next year</li>
            <li> Extraordinary, it really shaves closer than any machine I have ever had, although it is very, very, very noisy, I can live with it</li>
            <li> (I pressed a button on the side ) and long behold there was more hair as if someone used them just before shipping them to me .</li>
            <li> Definitely a product worth trying if you want a clean, close shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like moving from a lawn tractor to a large combine tractor.  </li>
            <li> It is a large trimmer.  </li>
            <li> However I cannot say that I am completely satisfied with this particular razor as it began to break down rather quickly.</li>
            <li> You can throw down a line and use this to shave the neck and cheeks right over the top of your line up.</li>
            <li> but truthfully I get a much better shave with a generic 3-blade disposable razor for way less the price of this.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend you give this razor a try, i rate it very high.</li>
            <li> The shaver foil that contacts your face is smooth and large enough</li>
            <li> Cut great but a little to low for me..</li>
            <li> I did not get a smooth shave and you can only use it if your hair is fine &amp; very short.</li>
            <li> Great close shave and non irritating.</li>
            <li> This product is very efficient</li>
            <li> It allows you to really define the lines in your beard without a lot of effort.</li>
            <li> As a barber, it&#x27;s become an important tool to have, especially for bald fades.</li>
            <li> Work very well.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really use it for my head instead of my face.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have to go to a barber for a bald head...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very close shave&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find much of a use for it</li>
            <li> Holds charge really well.  </li>
            <li> Very close to a blade shave.</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> Very close shave.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much too soon to be replacing foils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> After replacing the foil I found that I was applying too much pressure to the razor in an attempt to get a closer cut.</li>
            <li> Much faster, closer shave than my Norelco razors.  </li>
            <li> I was very upset .</li>
            <li> Gets closer than my straight blade.</li>
            <li> very efficient.</li>
            <li> Shaves fast.</li>
            <li> I then used clippers to shave close and straight razor to edge.</li>
            <li> is when I have used a straight razor.</li>
            <li> but it works very well.</li>
            <li> shipping time was poor, product great</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Dont cut and scrape your gentle head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also real noisy.</li>
            <li> I really like that.</li>
            <li> If your beard grows really fast this razor may not be for you.</li>
            <li> Cuts very close like a razor and leaves no bumps.</li>
            <li> But powerful as allget out, I like it so far</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves how close of a shave he gets.</li>
            <li> It really does give you that razor closeness.</li>
            <li> -thanks</li>
            <li> The whole thing vibrates when it&#x27;s on, ready to roll, and roll it does.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put it on the charger straight out of the box.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> Reaplacement screens are reasonably priced .</li>
            <li> They work better than expected.</li>
            <li> I first tried the shaver, the first thing I noticed is how LOUD this shaver is.  </li>
            <li> This gets the hair low enough for the razor to be effective.</li>
            <li> Has excellent power and cuts hair with very minimal irritation in those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> Working better than I expected!  </li>
            <li> Might use a real razor for special occasions, but definitely use this every day.</li>
            <li> it will not cut longer hairs only clean up stubble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this for anyone doing bald fades or who want a really close shave with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> My other trimmer does get the rest of my leftover whiskers off... and I am left with a nice smooth shave overall...</li>
            <li> It shaves pretty close and so far its the fastest shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Excelent Product, This is the 3rd one i have owened they are very durable ,and last for many years ,they shave well and are made in the USA.</li>
            <li> We are pretty sure this was used and then resold as new, pieces were missing and the screen broke within a month</li>
            <li> husband LOVES his new shaver!</li>
            <li> If hair is parallel to skin, more than likely this shaver will not shave it off.</li>
            <li> Wahl 5 star series workso well beard needs to be very short then cuts super.</li>
            <li> After several years of going to the barbershop and appreciating the super close shave.</li>
            <li> Nothing (besides not shaving) helped, and I tried a LOT of solutions: bump patrol, shaving more frequently, mach XX razors, wet shave.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for a close shave with no pulling of my beard.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I Highly Recommend The Wahl 5 Star Rechargeable Shaver.</li>
            <li> highly recommend before using you</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;My barber uses this shaver so I decided to buy it as well.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I expected a bit of an easier shave but, for the price, it works fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy but aside from that I have no complaints, my clients love it and it is a quality product.</li>
            <li> I just wish the Wahl could handle longer whiskers just a little better...</li>
            <li> It gets almost as close as a straight razor and doesn&#x27;t irritate those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product and I use it at least 3-4 times per week, letting my facial hair sometimes reach a point where a razor would be better.  </li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic and it was great but expensive.</li>
            <li> my white friend finds it useful.</li>
            <li> For my face, I&#x27;ve found this to work better than shaving everyday.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Fast, wide head, shaves super close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I break out sometimes and this made me break out the 2nd time because I didn&#x27;t use it right.</li>
            <li> But the charger was there still looking new and the stand was there with instructions..</li>
            <li> I will return and ask for a new one.</li>
            <li> Battery life is not as promised, I will exchange it for a new one.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, I use it in barber school and its a clean cut, do not go left to right with it use it up and down or turn it to go left and right.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very loud to my ears.</li>
            <li> Very, very loud....</li>
            <li> very old style Wahl shaver.</li>
            <li> Very loud motor - it wakes my wife in an adjacent room.</li>
            <li> I first opened the shaver, I was amazed at how big the shaver is.</li>
            <li> ..use trimmer first before using this product to lower your facial hair</li>
            <li> This thing is loud!  </li>
            <li> It takes ALL STUBBLE COMPLETELY AWAY!</li>
            <li> Way too loud!</li>
            <li> Although they could not replace the damaged part, they did offer a full return refund or partial cash refund.  </li>
            <li> Works well but use smooth up and down strokes or you will get razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Gotta clean it every other day or so.  </li>
            <li> but, for everyday shaving it works fine.    </li>
            <li> but you have to cut it down first with a different shaver the this one for the super close shave.</li>
            <li> However I still have my old shaver that has a trimmer on it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very noisy compared to my last 2 Norelco</li>
            <li> Kinda loud</li>
            <li> Used an old phone charger to have it work again.</li>
            <li> Loud and does provide close shave.</li>
            <li> I have gone back to a straight razor  </li>
            <li> Purchased for 93 year old father.</li>
            <li> This razor is really loud</li>
            <li> WOW is it loud...</li>
            <li> Wow what a shave.</li>
            <li> So you need to make sure you charge it for at least an hour before you use it</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t like the the loud noise the machine makes.</li>
            <li> me that soft as a baby butt</li>
            <li> I must say that I was surprised when they contacted me and sent me another shaver</li>
            <li> I suffered for years with razor bumps and burn...as long as you trim first with an edger</li>
            <li> The I have had so far</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The razor does provide a really close shave and there were less noticeable hair bumps even after the first use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that such a good razor only lasted long enough for me to truly love</li>
            <li> razors.&lt;br /&gt;I marked it down based on 1) high price, 2) noise, 3) can&#x27;t use water like the higher end</li>
            <li> it is for the bald heads of African American gentlemen, and it may be very capable for that purpose.</li>
            <li> and this gets down very close and gives an even look..!!</li>
            <li> The battery lasts long and it cuts very close.</li>
            <li> The item was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Watched the video and noticed it seemed to work really well for African American men.</li>
            <li> An to replace the foil is not cheap for it to break that quick.</li>
            <li> Works well, cut down on barber shop time... and saves money, paid for itself already... as advertised.. even came fully charged, use right away.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with the foil and it trims my face so fast im done in 1min.</li>
            <li> We had to return the first shaver due to defects.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t expect this razor to last a really long time but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d dock it 1 star for how loud this puppy gets, but this is truly a fantastic addition to my daily routine and a small price to pay for being bump-free.</li>
            <li> Definitely needed the full two weeks if use prior to getting the shave I expected.</li>
            <li> Last a long time one single full charge.</li>
            <li> : Very noisy, foil didn&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped (4 weeks)</li>
            <li> As long as you use it daily, it works very well.  </li>
            <li> If you wait much longer it won&#x27;t cut hair that is long enough to be pressed against the skin.</li>
            <li> Going back to my old shaver.</li>
            <li> I understand that some parts will wear and tear naturally, but before Wahl came out with this five-star burgundy version of this razor, it seemed to last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I could barely move my neck for two days..and guess what else??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only shaved with it for about 5 shaving sessions so far</li>
            <li> Clunky and did a poor job shaving my 2 day beard along my chin and neck (did OK on cheeks).  </li>
            <li> Cleaning is a bit of a pain, but worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> i have bought this product before and was satisfied, it was time for a new one and the one i recently received is extremely loud and uncomfortable to use on my clients.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t charge it until it first dies down.</li>
            <li> You have to shave the hair down First.</li>
            <li> I was already more than halfway through my shave, so I finished despite having half the foil missing from the razor.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is so wide, and with the double blades, it shaves both close and fast.  </li>
            <li> Only issue i have is that it does not actively &#x27;search&#x27; for anything longer than stubble.</li>
            <li> I am African American male with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The first time using it, I had to trim down my facial hair (with my Wahl Detailer).</li>
            <li> Oh remember it does not remove long hairs but works better everyday or ever other day.  </li>
            <li> Before the 5 Star, the only thing that worked good enough was a Wahl Detailer hair trimmer (usually used for shape-ups), but that still left a small amount of stubble that had to be taken care of daily.</li>
            <li> Not very sharp at all, i even bought the replacement blades and external foil, but nothing changed.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t work on whiskers much longer than one thirty second of an inch, so daily or every other day use is mandatory.  </li>
            <li> I get less irritation and the shave is very close.</li>
            <li> little guy is very robust.</li>
            <li> Some were good and some were bad.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, after looking at the good and bad reviews for this shaver, I decided to give it a try...</li>
            <li> the other is these little puppies are loud!!!!!</li>
            <li> First I cut my head down with regular hair clippers, then I take it all the way down with my WAHL Clippers.  </li>
            <li> This is because for me personally, I am a bald guy, a young black American.</li>
            <li> Will not work well if your facial hair is two long</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with the wahl 5 star shaver is the noise, it&#x27;s a little loud.</li>
            <li> A little loud, but it is what it is.</li>
            <li> It is really hard to tell how much time you can use it.</li>
            <li> First few times might make a little razor burn on the neck part.</li>
            <li> May cut a little to close for African American males - sometimes it feels like bumps are growing when the hair begins to grow back.</li>
            <li> The chord is only for charging the battery, it is not powerful enough to run the machine.</li>
            <li> Does not take long to fill up, so watch for leakage.  </li>
            <li> However, I appreciate that this shaver is so wide, and with the double blades, it&#x27;s like cleaning up your beard with a combine tractor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black male with curly facial hair, and I&#x27;ve been plagued with razor bumps ever since I started shaving.</li>
            <li> If you are an everyday shaver, it may work for you as your facial hair will never get long enough to miss the cut.</li>
            <li> NO it was not the same as the other models.</li>
            <li> It is a little loud (92db on my app, about like a food processor it says) and lacks the solid feel of my previous model, the 4000 system.  </li>
            <li> Then I pat my face to get some of the water off then air dry.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately I had an extra one but still that was disappointing.</li>
            <li> It seems like a waste of money and even I think that the only reason I know about this shaver is because I am a barber and my boss uses this same shaver</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace an old foil shaver where the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold the charge past a couple of shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> with my different scandanavian descent beard, it is clearly not useful, as it does not have a side clipper.  </li>
            <li> But after the first week of using the electric shaver my fiance noticed that my ingrown hairs were getting worse.  </li>
            <li> I think I fell victim to marketing.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package everything was loose.  </li>
            <li> Mine came loose in its box resulting in a damaged screen foil.  </li>
            <li> but I am going to try to superglue the foil back down to the blade cover and see if it holds.  </li>
            <li> Takes forever to shave down longer facial hairs</li>
            <li> I would suggest to cut any existing facial hair down in order to get that close cut you are looking for.  </li>
            <li> It only shaves the hair that is a zero guard or less.</li>
            <li> even if i put it on a wall electrical outlet while uiing, the battery only lasss for less than 5minutes.</li>
            <li> Not as expected,poor quality shaving make  a big noise, second week after using it the front gold metal brook and cant using it no more.</li>
            <li> This makes only the second WAHL I have owned in the past 15 years.  </li>
            <li> I am a black male and I was concerned about bumps, and that hasn&#x27;t been a problem at all</li>
            <li> Strong motor and close cutting.</li>
            <li> , I felt a little &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; after using this shaver in comparison to my last shaver.  </li>
            <li> Works well as long as you use everyday or every other day (cuts stubble only)</li>
            <li> Crazy smooth and in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still having skin irritation from it and the shave is not very close.</li>
            <li> also noticed that the plastic housing is not the quality that I expected from a wahl product.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as expected</li>
            <li> By using this shaver a few times in between a regular blade razor, you will get a &amp;#34;babies bottom&amp;#34; closer shave with the blade razor.</li>
            <li> Be careful which vendor you buy from.  </li>
            <li> a close shave don&#x27;t get me wrong, but unless you want to dish out $15+ a month on razors, they just aren’t worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Minimal bumping...</li>
            <li> Was a total waste of the money.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t figured out how to clip the base of the trimmer to the actual razor , it just sits on top.</li>
            <li> This is the only one I found for my thick facial hair to get a razor shave without the razor.</li>
            <li> The adjustment instructions are not good enough, for me, but the shave is almost getting close enough after 5 attempts.</li>
            <li> I expect this electric razor will perform just as well since it&#x27;s the exact same model; however, when mine arrived and I was reading through the instructions, I noticed that the side button that&#x27;s supposed to release the cover the cutting foils are attached to didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used it every other day to shave my head.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> I also feel that there are other electric shavers in the</li>
            <li> It gives an extremely close shave and no razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day after</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what my next step should be.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought however, it could be due to operator error.</li>
            <li> Too sharp.</li>
            <li> As mentioned by other reviewers, this model lacks the trimmer,</li>
            <li> /&gt;@ Shaves extremely close</li>
            <li> I tried other shavers before.</li>
            <li> Been using it a few weeks, maybe it just my hair type or growing pattern, but I still have quite a few whiskers left on my face after using the Wahl...</li>
            <li> But you pay later, I bumped on the back of the neck behind the ear and on the side of the head.</li>
            <li> definitely don&#x27;t need to press hard either</li>
            <li> domestic and imported parts\\&quot; so they deserve at least some homegrown support.</li>
            <li> I had gotten tired of buying razors almost monthly and none of them lasting as long as I would want them too.  </li>
            <li> This shaver does the job very well and at this price you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> When the on button faced down it did not work.</li>
            <li> my wife can hear it down stairs in my 3000sq house...</li>
            <li> After three year of using the Whal 5 star shave/shaper I have to say hands down  </li>
            <li> DO NOT EVER let it fall down...</li>
            <li> Some say use everyday or every other day to get your face use to the product.</li>
            <li> And the gold foil will streak your skin black if it heats up while using with humidity.</li>
            <li> I hope it helps my black friends, but I just cannot make it work for me..</li>
            <li> This shaver does not have a pop-up trimmer as the previous models had.</li>
            <li> it also had wiskers in the package making it just a totally disappointed purchase and pretty gross, wouldn&#x27;t purchase again</li>
            <li> I am a black man and bumps</li>
            <li> a black man they have not broke me out yet...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very loud and useless.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a little louder and warmer my the grip than the series before it.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t shave everyday, I let the hairs come out of the skin a little bit, then I shave.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to men that have tough facial hair to remove.  </li>
            <li> On a personal note, I am caucasion with a very thick beard.</li>
            <li> When I finally opened the product two days later I realized the box was a little dirty</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press too hard against the skin and go slow from multiple directions.</li>
            <li> Have had this shaver for a few months now.</li>
            <li> but I always find a few of the finer hairs after a shave.</li>
            <li> They send me a poor quality or 2nd grade shaver.</li>
            <li> it would stay on for a few seconds, the shave was not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I decided to buy one and use it everyday because I&#x27;m required to....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> That being said waiting a few days and it wont trim the longer hairs.</li>
            <li> poor quality for American made.</li>
            <li> if the battery is dead and you need to use it, it doesn&#x27;t work when it&#x27;s plugged into the chord.</li>
            <li> Will not shave close is used everyday.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday.....</li>
            <li> My hair is curly, so when I use this shaver in approximately 2.5 to 3 days if I allow my hair to somewhat grow back, I break out in bumps!</li>
            <li> Worked well for a few uses then the foil broke.</li>
            <li> If you have to shave everyday and you don&#x27;t want to use razors, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> But, it does cause irritation after a few days.  </li>
            <li> I wrote a bad review about this product without giving this company a chance to make it right</li>
            <li> You have to repeatedly go over areas and half the time it cuts nothing not sure if its the product or my shaver is malfunctioned</li>
            <li> So my beard is very thin and so far I like this shaver.</li>
            <li> Other savers just don&#x27;t come close to getting my thick stubborn hairs.  </li>
            <li> Shaving head is stiff to get on and off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that cost cutting has eliminated the niceties ...too bad because I, for one one would  not mind paying a little more for all that was removed, although the pop-up trimmer never really worked without pulling hairs</li>
            <li> Once I took it out of the box I just started using it and after 5 shaves it hasn&#x27;t died down in the least yet.</li>
            <li> but I found it a little bit hard to get it to trim the curved areas of my neck because of the size.  </li>
            <li> Little slow in delivery, otherwise, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Handling time was a little bit slow  , about 4 days.  </li>
            <li> You better of buying the worst and cheapest razor then buying this.</li>
            <li> useless on my beard which i keep very low and neat.</li>
            <li> He was not satisfied so the product was returned.</li>
            <li> No more irritation bye</li>
            <li> Not pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a believer, and I&#x27;ve got no more bumps.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with the item.</li>
            <li> Had a very heavy beard.</li>
            <li> The lack of a trimmer makes it difficult to get rid of the really long hairs or do any sideburns cleanup.  </li>
            <li> I try to removed the head cover, it was very stiff.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press too hard as Foul will tear.  </li>
            <li> I notice if you press the shaver hard against your face, the hair is cut too close causing ingrown hairs and razor bumps.</li>
            <li> My husband complained that  it wasn&#x27;t a close shave.  </li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is the noise.</li>
            <li> I seen where others have complained about battery life.  </li>
            <li> This unit will stay charge for at least three cuts.  </li>
            <li> It cuts my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I use my Andis T-Outliner to edge my goatee up and take off the thick stuff.</li>
            <li> I was unable to charge it any longer and when the company was contacted, they said is passed due selling policy return.</li>
            <li> Everyone that wrote a bad review obviously is using this shaver incorrectly.</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> The foil is rather weak.  </li>
            <li> a terrible choice for me, with the initial problem being extremely deceptive advertisement.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, a month and a half after my purchase, the product failed.  </li>
            <li> my beard to tough for it</li>
            <li> Since i gota the shaver, the foil has broken twice.</li>
            <li> I am not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Not happy with you guys on this one.</li>
            <li> Poor.</li>
            <li> and my face was getting worse using it.  </li>
            <li> The item was poorly packaged.</li>
            <li> I bumped up worse after using this shaver.</li>
            <li> I received the shaver in 5 days but it was broken, the side button that removes the foil was stuck so i could not take it off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;@ Broken after two months</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> For those saying it won&#x27;t cut their hair, I can tell you this is completely false, they just don&#x27;t know how to use it.</li>
            <li> Poor function, the unit is difficult to turn On</li>
            <li> I am so angry and confused.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been less than two months and broke already. ...:(</li>
            <li> Those hideous razor bumps reared their ugly little heads all over my neck!</li>
            <li> Did not do the job - sorry</li>
            <li> and once you turned on difficult to turn Off, it keeps turning itself On in the charger.</li>
            <li> Misses some hair, as it grows at weird angle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid of damaging the cutting blades just trying to remove and replace the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged it overnight, however it keeps cutting out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Afterward I wash my face with cold water to close my pores.</li>
            <li> Now, the bad news.</li>
            <li> My barber uses one of this bad boys.</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed.</li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t meet my expectations</li>
            <li> This thing is AWESOME! I was getting my hair cut and she asked me if I wanted her to trim my beard. So, she trimmed my beard and then she used the Wahl Shaver Shaper to clean up all around my beard. The neat thing about this is, it WILL NOT cut your beard/goatee/mustache. It only shaves the hair that is a zero guard or less. I bought one immediately! I run this thing all over my beard, it defines the lines so well. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A BEARD TRIMMER. IT IS NOT DESIGNED FOR THAT. IT IS A SHAPER... It allows you to really define the lines in your beard without a lot of effort. WORKS GREAT! If you are an everyday shaver, it may work for you as your facial hair will never get long enough to miss the cut. This is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever seen from an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I use it for in between blade shaves when I need a touch up to get me by. It is a comfortable close shave. I saw it being used by my barber and figured it was good enough for me if it worked for him.</li>
            <li> As a barber, it&#x27;s become an important tool to have, especially for bald fades.</li>
            <li> First week foil breaks apart, bought a replacement part and then the charger goes out</li>
            <li> I had to return mine..didn&#x27;t work as good as same product barber had his had shaved closer.</li>
            <li> Cuts real close, fast and easy to use. May cut a little to close for African American males - sometimes it feels like bumps are growing when the hair begins to grow back. It also misses some of the hair deep within the skin but other than that excellent close shave.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy having a great shave. Is an awesome shaver. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Work very well. Nice close shave.</li>
            <li> The adapter that came with the unit does not work, as a result I had to purchase a different adapter for the unit.</li>
            <li> This works pretty good but I always find a few of the finer hairs after a shave. Also doesn&#x27;t get the hair under my chin if I go without shaving for more than 1 day. Otherwise, great shaver.</li>
            <li> Perfect, i love this shaver. Delivery was fast</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver, I was turned on big my barber. I would say its the best shaver for a African American</li>
            <li> Since I can&#x27;t use a regular razor, I&#x27;ve been searching for years for something that gives a closer shave than clippers, and doesn&#x27;t cause razor bumps.  At last!!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great Shaver!!</li>
            <li> Did not do the job - sorry</li>
            <li> I really use it for my head instead of my face.  I really don&#x27;t have to go to a barber for a bald head...First I cut my head down with regular hair clippers, then I take it all the way down with my WAHL Clippers.  What nice bald head it produces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;317-892-9311</li>
            <li> Quality product-works well!</li>
            <li> my husband and son love them</li>
            <li> Great shaver for a bald head.  Don&#x27;t press too hard as Foul will tear.  Does not take long to fill up, so watch for leakage.  Hold a charge great.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Did not meet my needs. Item arrived with hair guards damaged. When I tried to use the shaver it pulled the hairs on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I returned item immediately.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my son as a Christmas present and he loved it.  As he had to be clean shaven for his job, it fits his needs in every waoy.</li>
            <li> Little slow in delivery, otherwise, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Extraordinary, it really shaves closer than any machine I have ever had, although it is very, very, very noisy, I can live with it, I like the way it shaves, I recomend it</li>
            <li> I was referred to the shaver for Fathers Day therefore I made the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;My husband LOVES his new shaver!</li>
            <li> This is a lemon, does not work. even if i put it on a wall electrical outlet while uiing, the battery only lasss for less than 5minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace an old foil shaver where the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold the charge past a couple of shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the shaver, I was amazed at how big the shaver is. It&#x27;s much bigger than it looks. Definitely not a travel shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that the plastic housing is not the quality that I expected from a wahl product. I have a wahl hair clipper made out of nice high impact plastic.  This plastic feels like it&#x27;s been recycled or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I try to removed the head cover, it was very stiff.  I&#x27;m afraid of damaging the cutting blades just trying to remove and replace the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clear plastic cover that fits over the shaving head is kind of cheap and doesn&#x27;t click in place. It just sort of &amp;#34;rests&amp;#34; on the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried the shaver, the first thing I noticed is how LOUD this shaver is.  You might be worried about waking up the rest of the house using this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, now the good parts.  The shaver is so wide, and with the double blades, it shaves both close and fast.  The lack of a trimmer makes it difficult to get rid of the really long hairs or do any sideburns cleanup.  However I still have my old shaver that has a trimmer on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is so close, I felt a little &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; after using this shaver in comparison to my last shaver.  However, I appreciate that this shaver is so wide, and with the double blades, it&#x27;s like cleaning up your beard with a combine tractor.  You can literally shave your entire face in under 60 seconds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- Very close shave&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s so big, you can shave yourself in under 60 seconds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap plastic housing&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap clear plastic shaver protector&lt;br /&gt;- Shaving head is stiff to get on and off&lt;br /&gt;- LOUD&lt;br /&gt;- Oversized for travel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m going to keep it because I like the close shave and speed of it.  It&#x27;s like moving from a lawn tractor to a large combine tractor.  The thing just cuts three inch close swaths with every stroke!</li>
            <li> great for personal or professional use!!!! My husband is a barber and he has 2. One for the business and one for himself. Close clean shave. Cant ask for more.</li>
            <li> This shaver works very well, and I am very happy with it and the price.</li>
            <li> Awesome machine a plusss will reccomend to anyone and i always wanted one and i finally got it. So u should get one yourself</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find much of a use for it but it did work pretty well with shaving my beard.</li>
            <li> WAHL 5 Star is a BASIC Electric Shaver and works if you use the appropriate shaving head.</li>
            <li> They send me a poor quality or 2nd grade shaver. When I plug it, the signal light don&#x27;t comes to see if it&#x27;s charging or not. When I use the base, it doesn&#x27;t charge at all.</li>
            <li> Holds charge really well.  Cuts close by the sideburns..beard area not so well.  I would have to shave with a razor and finish with this electric razor.  Looks nice but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Poor function, the unit is difficult to turn On and once you turned on difficult to turn Off, it keeps turning itself On in the charger.</li>
            <li> The worst product that I ever bought on line, I want to return it buy it did not come with the return label. Dont buy it !!! You better of buying the worst and cheapest razor then buying this.</li>
            <li> Great product but had to replace the the foil cover after only 1 month use. Used it every other day to shave my head.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how the next couple replacement goes</li>
            <li> Closest shave I have received from an electric. Very close to a blade shave. I have tried most of the high dollar razors &amp; none of them compare to this one!</li>
            <li> Handling time was a little bit slow  , about 4 days.  But item came as described.  It is a large trimmer.  Works very well but I found it a little bit hard to get it to trim the curved areas of my neck because of the size.  Overall great value for the performance of the trim.  Very close shave.  I haven&#x27;t figured out how to clip the base of the trimmer to the actual razor , it just sits on top. And the gold foil will streak your skin black if it heats up while using with humidity.</li>
            <li> Excellent, easy to use and shaves extremely low WOTHOU FACIAL BUMPS! Must shave every  2 days.  Will not work well if your facial hair is two long..use trimmer first before using this product to lower your facial hair</li>
            <li> It worked great for 3 months and then it just died!!!!!!!  Wahl needs to make a better product!</li>
            <li> I got the shaver today and it already broke. Almost cut my face. Not recommended. Sending it back.   Placed the order yesterday and the eta was Tuesday but it arrived today. Thanks again for the fast shipping. 2 stars for shipping.</li>
            <li> The item was exactly what I expected.  I love this shaver, it&#x27;s has my face baby smooth.  I would recommend to anyone.  The same on my barber has.</li>
            <li> Strong motor and close cutting. The foil is rather weak.  I have had the shaver only a couple of weeks and the foil has already come off and has to be replaced.  It could possibly be from the vibrating strength of the motor but I am going to try to superglue the foil back down to the blade cover and see if it holds.  It&#x27;s much too soon to be replacing foils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Turns out that the damage to the foil was user error. After replacing the foil I found that I was applying too much pressure to the razor in an attempt to get a closer cut. This caused the foil to break from the plastic head. In reducing the amount of pressure to the razor and letting it glide over my skin on its own weight I found that not only did it not damage the foil but I got a better cut by leeting the razor do its job of pulling the hairs into it rather than me trying to force the head to my skin.  By the way, I use this to shave my head not my face.  Thought I would clear that up for anyone wondering how you would let a razor glide on its own weight in a horizontal postion against your face. My original rating was 4 stars. I now give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The only shaver I have ever used</li>
            <li> Super close shave all around. Only issue i have is that it does not actively &#x27;search&#x27; for anything longer than stubble. If hair is parallel to skin, more than likely this shaver will not shave it off. For those who shave everyday, it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Pros:  Fast, wide head, shaves super close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Very noisy, foil didn&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped (4 weeks) but I shave my face and head daily.</li>
            <li> Great smooth cut. FYI don&#x27;t put pressure in your throat or face. It will burn you. Hold it very lightly almost to the point to fall off your hand. It&#x27;s very powerful. It cuts my thick hair. Last a long time one single full charge.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Just as advertised!! I have already recommended  it to friends!  Will purchase again if an upgrade comes about.</li>
            <li> As long as you use it daily, it works very well.  Much faster, closer shave than my Norelco razors.  A bit pricey for something powered by  ni-cad batteries. Charge lasts a couple of weeks, maybe longer.  Gotta clean it every other day or so.  Won&#x27;t work on whiskers much longer than one thirty second of an inch, so daily or every other day use is mandatory.  Very noisy compared to my last 2 Norelco razors.&lt;br /&gt;I marked it down based on 1) high price, 2) noise, 3) can&#x27;t use water like the higher end Norelco rotaries, and 4) Wahl packaging left it all jumbled up and in pieces.  After re-assembling it, it worked as intended.</li>
            <li> I am a barber and I purchased this to see what it was all about, I&#x27;ve heard and seen online that it was a quality trimmer that gets close. After using it I would have to agree, worth the money. You have to use this after using a regular trimmer- it will not cut longer hairs only clean up stubble. It gets almost as close as a straight razor and doesn&#x27;t irritate those with sensitive skin. It&#x27;s a little noisy but aside from that I have no complaints, my clients love it and it is a quality product.</li>
            <li> Discovered this shaver via my barber in 2008, I have been using it ever since. Hair bumps no longer and issue.</li>
            <li> My barber uses this all the time and I needed something between cuts.  Other savers just don&#x27;t come close to getting my thick stubborn hairs.  This shaver provided the close shave I wanted!  I travel with them and just bought another pair for the home!</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of use the battery died suddenly. I recharged it thinking that would help. When it presumably was charged it only worked when the on button faced horizontally upward. When the on button faced down it did not work.</li>
            <li> I received this product on time and was very excited to give it to my boyfriend as a just because gift. When I finally opened the product two days later I realized the box was a little dirty but I figured it fell or something of that sort. No big deal .. But when I opened the white box it came in i seen hair shaving all on it. I was very upset . next I looked at the shavers and seen the gold foil on the shaver were damaged and brokers in two different areas.  I knew for a fact that the shavers shouldn&#x27;t look like that.  Finally I opened the top of the shaver to look inside of it  (I pressed a button on the side ) and long behold there was more hair as if someone used them just before shipping them to me . they were suppose to be new with free shipping and handling.  I want my money back and I will order from another vendor.. I forgot to mention that there the cleaning brush was not in the box as well .. But the charger was there still looking new and the stand was there with instructions.. Hope this helps .. I am so angry and confused.</li>
            <li> I never thought that I would ever use an electric razor that would cut so close.  It&#x27;s amazing!  Best I&#x27;ve come across</li>
            <li> I works great but a few hairs it just doesn&#x27;t cut. Like the hairs in your swirl if you have one</li>
            <li> Good product thus far.  Has excellent power and cuts hair with very minimal irritation in those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> Works great. No charging light. Light weight</li>
            <li> Works great. A little loud, but it is what it is. Gets closer than my straight blade. Works perfect on my skin fades.</li>
            <li> the best wahl clipper  thank</li>
            <li> Been using it a few weeks, maybe it just my hair type or growing pattern, but I still have quite a few whiskers left on my face after using the Wahl... My other trimmer does get the rest of my leftover whiskers off... and I am left with a nice smooth shave overall... I just wish the Wahl could handle longer whiskers just a little better... but overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the shaver...</li>
            <li> Its perfect as expected I love the machine completely everything about it is just right I have no problems with it whatsoever</li>
            <li> I love my new wahl 5star, I think every hair stylist / barber must have. very efficient. Love it love...</li>
            <li> i have bought this product before and was satisfied, it was time for a new one and the one i recently received is extremely loud and uncomfortable to use on my clients. I will return and ask for a new one. As far as performance on balding on hair, it works GREAT for the exception of loudness</li>
            <li> First time buying this item and it was great choose. Close, clean trim. My barber uses this on my neck and suggested the item to me, very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I recieved the Wahl 5 star two days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged it overnight, however it keeps cutting out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when it would stay on for a few seconds, the shave was not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this ASAP.</li>
            <li> I expected a bit of an easier shave but, for the price, it works fine.  I get a close shave but I have to go over my face several times.</li>
            <li> my only complaints is that the shavers bumped my head up in two area&#x27;s. but that may have been an era on my behalf shaving against the hair grain. the other is these little puppies are loud!!!!! other than that they&#x27;re good shavers.</li>
            <li> Wahl 5 star series workso well beard needs to be very short then cuts super.</li>
            <li> Work as great as described! All the positive reviews are def right on. I highly recommend this for anyone needing that close and easy shave</li>
            <li> Clearly the best balding barber tool that is&lt;br /&gt; on the market.  Better than its predecessor by far. Well worth it!</li>
            <li> This shaver is very loud to my ears. It does not shave close enough in my opinion. I also feel that there are other electric shavers in the&lt;br /&gt;WAHL 5 star price range which are better more accurate shavers. The quality of this shavers concerns me as well. I would not buy this shaver again... I&#x27;m aware that it works great for other users, but not for me.</li>
            <li> Do Not buy!!!!  Since i gota the shaver, the foil has broken twice. The second time i used it, the foil broke, and then When i Put replacement, i only used it twice and it broke again.  Supposed to last about 6 months from info i obtained.</li>
            <li> Love them. Quality is good. Works amazing for that tight clean bald fade. They run smooth without pulling on the skin. Kinda loud but you can get over that with the quality it brings to the a haircut or shave</li>
            <li> Excellent product and great delivery</li>
            <li> Everybody needs something different but this shaver was not for me, maybe it will work for you.  Clunky and did a poor job shaving my 2 day beard along my chin and neck (did OK on cheeks).  Hoped to use this for travelling but it nicked me up pretty good on 1st use.  I&#x27;m used to Braun and Eltron, they cost over $200 and this this is not made as well (cheap plastic case), but I suppose that is what you get for $50.  Still looking for an inexpensive travel shaver.</li>
            <li> Worked well. Shaves fast. But ...The Charger broke while using abroad. Used an old phone charger to have it work again. Also the charger and the shaver do not have any indicator of the battery charging and the level charged. It is really hard to tell how much time you can use it. Does not have the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this item before it arrived. I purchased it for my son as a gift and he was excited about it as well.  However, it stopped working after he used it one time. It won&#x27;t recharge at all. It simply stopped working. I haven&#x27;t returned it yet, but I plan on returning it soon. I hope the return process won&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> NO it was not the same as the other models.</li>
            <li> Great product...does what it is designed to do. This shaver will get you a smooth to the touch shave. I like that for my clients that like a bald head.The only problem I have with the wahl 5 star shaver is the noise, it&#x27;s a little loud.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with this product. It shaves me quite closely. Just what I needed that I can&#x27;t shave with a razor.</li>
            <li> Not as expected,poor quality shaving make  a big noise, second week after using it the front gold metal brook and cant using it no more.</li>
            <li> My shaver did not charge,  I think both the shaver &amp; charger were defective.  I had to ship it back . Still waiting on my refund</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get as close as I thought and I do get razor bumps when  I use it. Can&#x27;t use it regularly.</li>
            <li> This makes only the second WAHL I have owned in the past 15 years.  This is a fantastic product and I use it at least 3-4 times per week, letting my facial hair sometimes reach a point where a razor would be better.  This device lasts and lasts on a charge and is very easy to clean.  Highly recommended for a close shave with no pulling of my beard.</li>
            <li> Does not work well...  Takes forever to shave down longer facial hairs</li>
            <li> Good product. Just have to cut hair close before using. Good shave after prep.</li>
            <li> Brought this shaver from Sally&#x27;s and return it as we&#x27;ll. even the clerk mention her husband didn&#x27;t like it. Loud and does provide close shave. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, I use it in barber school and its a clean cut, do not go left to right with it use it up and down or turn it to go left and right. It will not cause bumping when used properly.</li>
            <li> Love This product. Clean shave and bump free.</li>
            <li> First electric razor that shaved face as good as a blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to say that I&#x27;m truly impressed! The product arrived on time! The exact date estimated by Amazon and it was packaged as stated in the description. I&#x27;ve used it twice and it works perfect! Smooth as a baby! Now if only everything worked so well! Keep up the Good work!</li>
            <li> Please, stay away from this. It&#x27;s very loud and useless. It&#x27;s does not shave, period!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great shaver the best product out there I am in love with mine so glade that I purshed</li>
            <li> It does not cut my face hairs at all.  I can go over the same hairs and it just does not cut most of the hairs.  I have gone back to a straight razor  Maybe I should have gotten a more expensive unit.  Would not recommend this model.</li>
            <li> Shaver works great, shipping just sucked, but all in all I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> So my barber used this on me once and I was hooked because I&#x27;ve never had a closer shave with no bumps. I decided to buy one and use it everyday because I&#x27;m required to....My skin went to hell!! I had ingrown hairs for miles. I stopped and went back to the regular blades. I didn&#x27;t think this would happen especially since it never happened before. Clearly my skin can&#x27;t handle more use from this. I think each person might react differently to it so just be cautious when you purchase it.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews before I purchased this. Some were good and some were bad. 1st it was cheaper then ANY store online or retail and it&#x27;s a better model. It came in the mail in a matter or days and in its original packaging. That was a huge plus!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate writing reviews but here goes. As a black man with shaving problems this has been a great product so far. My barber use it on me and I used a friends once and love the feel afterwards. I break out sometimes and this made me break out the 2nd time because I didn&#x27;t use it right. Some say use everyday or every other day to get your face use to the product. Up to you to see what works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face with a good face scrub while in the shower. Then I pat my face to get some of the water off then air dry.  I then used clippers to shave close and straight razor to edge. I then use the 5 star. Afterward I wash my face with cold water to close my pores. Go to Youtube and put in &amp;#34;gwhiz demonstrates the Wahl 5 star shaver shaper&amp;#34; and it shows you how to use it as to not tear the foil and get a smooth shave. Just a thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten tips on skin care from others that wrote about the 5 star and from youtube because as men we don&#x27;t always take care of our face when we shave or or we don&#x27;t shave correctly. Oh remember it does not remove long hairs but works better everyday or ever other day.  hope this helps as others has helped me.</li>
            <li> I first learned of this product years ago at my barbershop.  After shaving with my blade razor, I went back over my face with this.  It picked up fine hairs that were not caught by razor blade.  I have given this to many people for birthday and christmas gifts.  You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My sons barber shaved them with this they are bi racial they don&#x27;t get razor bumps but they raved about how smooth their skin felt after the barber shaved them so I searched and found the exact shaver for a great price too.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I am not happy at all. I have yet to receive what&lt;br /&gt;purchased. Not happy with you guys on this one.</li>
            <li> I believe I ordered this shaver from te &amp;#34;beauty supply store&amp;#34; and it took close to 3 weeks to get it. When I first used it on my face to get the littler hairs off my chin and cheek area off, and it didn&#x27;t work. Then I was advises by my friend that I had to use a clipper on my face, then run the walh shaver to get the stubbles off. I did and my face and the back of my neck broke out in bumps.the only time this has happened to me is when I have used a straight razor. So yeah, now I have a shaver I can&#x27;t return, whoomp, whoomp. Ive read and have been advised by my feiends that the shaver is great, but i guess my skin isnt in agreement.</li>
            <li> Works well but use smooth up and down strokes or you will get razor bumps. I use it daily and, So far so good.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of people having problems with this shaver it&#x27;s because you aren&#x27;t using it correctly this shave will leave your skin smooth but you have to cut it down first with a different shaver the this one for the super close shave. It seems like a waste of money and even I think that the only reason I know about this shaver is because I am a barber and my boss uses this same shaver</li>
            <li> The Best saber is amazing</li>
            <li> Poor. No close shave at all. Had to go over same spot on neck many times. I returned it. Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> This thing makes your face very smooth!!!! No bumps at all. It stays charged for days. Its a must have!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted something quick as an alternative to a razo shave. This device does the job. I get less irritation and the shave is very close. I would deffintly recomend for shaving your head.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem like it charges while in the stand but if you just plug in to the shaver its fine</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy mine off amazon but it works very well. I had on a white shirt and shaved in the car and not one hair was on the shirt. I am a black male and I was concerned about bumps, and that hasn&#x27;t been a problem at all</li>
            <li> Love this shaver...only wish it included a trimmer.</li>
            <li> shipping time was poor, product great</li>
            <li> Works great! Additional hair products may need to be used for true bump-free.</li>
            <li> When I first started using these clippers my face was super smooth because of how close the razor cut on my face.  I was loving these clippers.  But after the first week of using the electric shaver my fiance noticed that my ingrown hairs were getting worse.  I Could feel my face becoming more irritated as well because of the increase in ingrown hairs I was experiencing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using the Shaver for over a month and my face was getting worse using it.  I had the package it up and send it back to Wahl.  The shaver was a great concept but it was not what my face wanted.</li>
            <li> perfect. no complain at all. if i have too, i&#x27;ll buy it again. Thanks</li>
            <li> We had to return the first shaver due to defects.  The second one also seemed defective--the shields were bent on each.  A replacement shield was provided and the razor works fine.</li>
            <li> hair must be low for this to work. but when it does.... theres nothing better</li>
            <li> Very, very loud....sending this back.</li>
            <li> My barber recommended this to me for shaving my face, life changer. I have not had irritated skin from shaving in months and I no longer have to worry about using a razor to get close enough to skin!!</li>
            <li> this thing cut me and leaves my head sore from the friction. Not very sharp at all, i even bought the replacement blades and external foil, but nothing changed. useless on my beard which i keep very low and neat. i have to pass it over the same patch of hair like 15 time to get results. After that many times my bald head is hurt by the scrapping, or oscillating blades. Dont cut and scrape your gentle head.</li>
            <li> Purchased for 93 year old father. He has always used Wahl savers. Had a very heavy beard. This shaver did not cut as clean as&lt;br /&gt;the very old style Wahl shaver. He was not satisfied so the product was returned. I was happy with the way the return was handled.</li>
            <li> The item was poorly packaged. The shaver, charging stand, and charging wire were not secured inside the box that when opened all the pieces were tossed around inside. I noticed this left the shaver with some scratches which worries me since this could possibly have damaged the shaver. I read some reviews on this product and noticed another customer had the same issue with the packaging as well.&lt;br /&gt;  Also there is no charging light on the 8547 model shaver that was originally on the 8061 model. Without the charging light how is one to know if the shaver is fully charged or if the charger works at all. Most electronics these days that have a rechargeable battery built inside have a charging light built into it as well which makes me wonder why in the world would they remove it from the newer models.&lt;br /&gt;  Aside from these issues, the shaver works as described. It gives an extremely close shave and no razor bumps. But I do plan on returning this product. For a shaver that cost this much I expect better packaging and a product that doesn&#x27;t arrive damaged.</li>
            <li> Excellent Electric Shaver... The Best One I&#x27;ve Every Owed... It Cuts Super Close &amp; Very Smooth. I Highly Recommend The Wahl 5 Star Rechargeable Shaver.</li>
            <li> My husband complained that  it wasn&#x27;t a close shave.  I asked him to continue to use it , The shave is suppose to improve&lt;br /&gt;with use.</li>
            <li> Works well, cut down on barber shop time... and saves money, paid for itself already... as advertised.. even came fully charged, use right away.</li>
            <li> I bumped up worse after using this shaver. It&#x27;s also real noisy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;miss returning 2 out of 3 that I purchased as gifts. I very disappointed with this product. They don&#x27;t work! The stubble has to just began to peak through the hair follicles for this device to work. Otherwise any hair longer and the shaver doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as expected</li>
            <li> a terrible choice for me, with the initial problem being extremely deceptive advertisement.  it is for the bald heads of African American gentlemen, and it may be very capable for that purpose. why would that not be translated in the description?  with my different scandanavian descent beard, it is clearly not useful, as it does not have a side clipper.  one would think that if no side clipper was included, maybe such helpful info would be relayed in the description.. I hope it helps my black friends, but I just cannot make it work for me.. would feel company (or amazon) should be penalized for not advising of their grossly inaccurate description..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several brands of foil razors but this one is by far the best. Charge lasts for weeks and shaves close. Lots of power.</li>
            <li> So my beard is very thin and so far I like this shaver. It shaves pretty close and so far its the fastest shaver I have ever used. I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with the foil and it trims my face so fast im done in 1min. I really like that. That being said waiting a few days and it wont trim the longer hairs. If your beard grows really fast this razor may not be for you. My biggest complaint is the noise. This razor is really loud my wife can hear it down stairs in my 3000sq house... WOW is it loud... I like the charging stand a lot.. I really don&#x27;t expect this razor to last a really long time but so far I like it. Hopefully I will see a couple years use out of it.</li>
            <li> It seem to be more new and approved</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Cuts very close like a razor and leaves no bumps. No more irritation bye bye razor, hello 5 star shaver.</li>
            <li> The shaver is the exact item used by my barber. It does an excellent job of getting that close shave without irritation. I use a trimmer first to start and then use this to get that smooth finish. I use it every other day after and I&#x27;ve had no razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Its a good shaver to replace traditional water shaving. i recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product. I had purchased the one without the charger dock and as a Barber I must see the dock really comes in handy.</li>
            <li> Really good I love it stops me from getting bumps and was shipped fast next year all my bold friends are getting one</li>
            <li> In a few words this is the best, point. Don&#x27;t waste your time buying another brand, this one is the best</li>
            <li> This thing is loud!  But powerful as allget out, I like it so far</li>
            <li> Great shaver.  Smooth cut with no irritation.  Leaves skin feeling smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> I bought my husband one of these razors several years ago from a discount department store and he loved it.The razor does provide a really close shave and there were less noticeable hair bumps even after the first use. However I cannot say that I am completely satisfied with this particular razor as it began to break down rather quickly. The battery does not hold a very good charge after the first month of use. The replaceable foil guard broke in the first two weeks. I understand that some parts will wear and tear naturally, but before Wahl came out with this five-star burgundy version of this razor, it seemed to last a lot longer. I don&#x27;t recommend this product at the time.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My face is smooth and it doesn&#x27;t leave any bumps.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.!  After using it about three times the hair on your face gets cut closer and closer.  By using this shaver a few times in between a regular blade razor, you will get a &amp;#34;babies bottom&amp;#34; closer shave with the blade razor. Best shaver I ever owned.  Recommended by my lady barber.</li>
            <li> The best way to use this shaver is to use it as soon as stubble appears. If you wait much longer it won&#x27;t cut hair that is long enough to be pressed against the skin. Don&#x27;t press too hard against the skin and go slow from multiple directions.</li>
            <li> my beard to tough for it</li>
            <li> Great Shaver and Excellent Well Made Product! I recommend it to anyone that wants a Close, Baby Smooth Face/Shave! AWESOME!!</li>
            <li> First off I would like to say that I rarely write reviews for my purchases. I&#x27;m a loyal amazon customer and just about every product I&#x27;ve purchased in the past has been great! HOWEVER, after looking at the good and bad reviews for this shaver, I decided to give it a try...my, my, my...what a disappointment..the thing damn near took my flesh of of my skin the very first day I tried it! I could barely move my neck for two days..and guess what else?? Those hideous razor bumps reared their ugly little heads all over my neck! Keep in mind that I have not had bumps like that in years! I have always used my oster edging clippers to shave. I was hoping the 5 star would have been the best thing next to a razor for my sensitive skin..no! It gets one star for me for the color of the device.</li>
            <li> THIS SHAVER IS LEGIT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off let me say this clipper does everything it says it does and more. Everyone that wrote a bad review obviously is using this shaver incorrectly. This shaver is very specific on what it is used for and how it is used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend before using you watch the Gwhiz how to video on youtube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon recieving the shaver i used it on my face the first day.  SMOOTH shave with ZERO irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day i shaved my entire head. Wow what a shave. Crazy smooth and in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a super close shave in minutes this is for you. Remember it shaves SHORT hair only. Use it as recommended and you will be thoroughly satisfied.</li>
            <li> A great head shaver&lt;br /&gt;Very fast and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good battery life&lt;br /&gt;Charging may take a few minutes but ok&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to clean</li>
            <li> Love this thing. Works pretty well, battery life is good. Misses some hair, as it grows at weird angle. Four stars though.</li>
            <li> I did not get a smooth shave and you can only use it if your hair is fine &amp; very short.</li>
            <li> great price for great product!</li>
            <li> My hunny loves this shaver!!! It does not leave bumps in his face frm shaving with a razor..... Great product!!</li>
            <li> Nice close shave, love it.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. It is really too early to give a good rating, maybe later on.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted this shaver for Xmas. His barber used it on him. It works great!</li>
            <li> Unsatisfied, the shaver leaves patches</li>
            <li> I am African American male with very sensitive skin. I have DE shaved as well as straight razor shaved and this shaver has left my skin very smooth. It provides a close shave and leaves me without any bumps. I would recommend for anyone searching for a close shave without worrying about cuts, nicks, or razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I never got to use it.  It arrived with the gold foil cracked.  My barber, who recommended it to me, told me not to use it.  It would definitely cut me if I did.  I have no idea if it works well or not - since I never got to use it.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered something from Amazon &amp; it was damaged.  I&#x27;m not sure what my next step should be.</li>
            <li> Pretty effective, but I have beard hair that goes every which way, so I give it a pass with my fiveblade afterward and it&#x27;s all clean.</li>
            <li> No good. Shield over blade peeled off.  Returned for refund.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband. He absolutely loves how close of a shave he gets. Great product reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Only lacks a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Barber since 1990 use this shaver everyday in my shop Great !</li>
            <li> the foil had a hole in it in 6 months scratched my face. poor quality for American made.</li>
            <li> very good shaver.Better than i thought!</li>
            <li> After three year of using the Whal 5 star shave/shaper I have to say hands down  it is the best I&#x27;v ever used...it leaves me baby smooth an irritation free</li>
            <li> Husband loves it. Close shave with no bumps.</li>
            <li> Works well as long as you use everyday or every other day (cuts stubble only)</li>
            <li> In the manual it mentions that you have to train your beard to allow this shaver to give you the best performance.&lt;br /&gt;so i have had this for three weeks now and i still get a sub standard cut.&lt;br /&gt;I  using another razor for a close cut. My barber uses this and it works for him. Go figure.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver available. Designed for ethnic hair to prevent bumps and shave close. I purchased as a barber for clients. You can throw down a line and use this to shave the neck and cheeks right over the top of your line up. It will only catch the shortest of hairs. Cleaning is a bit of a pain, but worth the trouble. On a personal note, I am caucasion with a very thick beard. This is the FIRST electric razor I have ever been able to use on my skin. Razor close with no ingrown hairs or bumps. I now have one at home and one at the shop.</li>
            <li> Close shave with no razor bumps</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. Disappointed. I think I fell victim to marketing. It gets one star b/c my white friend finds it useful. Did not cut close at all. Save your money</li>
            <li> After several years of going to the barbershop and appreciating the super close shave. - I final bit the bullet and purchased this shaver for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find shaving every other day works best for my skin type but, I still spend time preping prior to using the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#WorthWildInvestment</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my skin buy this device gave me horriable razor rash and bumps- after two weeks I cant use it anymore</li>
            <li> I chose this model because my barber uses it.  It works well and seems to be a better design than the rotary models I&#x27;ve tried.  The company that filled my order, Forever Young, packaged the product well and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> it dose not shave properly</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with my shaver sharpener it makes a lot of noise when you turn it on and when you&#x27;re shaving it is not a quite shaver and after TWO OR THREE  shave I didn&#x27;t get the close shave anymore VERY VERY disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> This shaver does not have a pop-up trimmer as the previous models had.It is just a shaver.</li>
            <li> Definitely needed the full two weeks if use prior to getting the shave I expected. Once through that break in period, its been a life saver. Quick shaves, no razor burn, very precise. Might use a real razor for special occasions, but definitely use this every day.</li>
            <li> Leaves allot of hair&#x27;s and cuts</li>
            <li> Awesome item, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I have ever used. I use it to shave my head and face. I&#x27;m not one to use electric shavers and was skeptic to say the least about trying another one, but the Wahl Shaver Shaper is by far the best darn shaver I have used. It really does give you that razor closeness.</li>
            <li> Best shave4 out there great power</li>
            <li> The item pricing was good. My son was recommended by a friend to try this item.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought however, it could be due to operator error. Its a solid device. It holds a charge for quite some time. Just didn&#x27;t shave as close as I thought.</li>
            <li> Why 4 and not 5 stars, WELL&lt;br /&gt;when it works,, ITS FREEKIN AWESOME!!!&lt;br /&gt;however DO NOT EVER let it fall down... it WILL break on the first drop</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best. Work perfect no bumps no irritations. I like it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful barbering tool. Really smooth on the skin and it&#x27;s made my skin fad s that much better. However i don&#x27;t like that it only stays charged for an hour whether it&#x27;s being used or not. if the battery is dead and you need to use it, it doesn&#x27;t work when it&#x27;s plugged into the chord. The chord is only for charging the battery, it is not powerful enough to run the machine. So you need to make sure you charge it for at least an hour before you use it cause if it dies then you&#x27;re screwed</li>
            <li> Purchased this item from amazon.com which arrived on time and functioned as described.  This item was well packaged.  I reccommend this item to others.  I like this item for price and quality reasons.  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> My son bought one and I order one for my husband for Christmas, they are very happy with them. The most I hear they like is the closest shave they get with it. They don&#x27;t like the the loud noise the machine makes. Overall they are happy, and I&#x27;ll say, the price was great and the delivery super fast!</li>
            <li> I love my 5 Star Series ......... Closest shave ever</li>
            <li> Clipper are great for African American skin. I never had a razor that kept my beard so fresh. A must Buy.</li>
            <li> Too sharp. Still gives me bumps. Too close a shave.</li>
            <li> As good as advertised</li>
            <li> The item itself works fine this review is based on the packaging.  When I opened the package everything was loose.  Who ever packaged the item did not ensure that the items was in the box with a nice tight fit. The shaver head blade also was chipped. Fortunately I had an extra one but still that was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Battery life is not as promised, I will exchange it for a new one.</li>
            <li> We are pretty sure this was used and then resold as new, pieces were missing and the screen broke within a month it also had wiskers in the package making it just a totally disappointed purchase and pretty gross, wouldn&#x27;t purchase again</li>
            <li> Will not shave close is used everyday. When used on beard the foil didn&#x27;t last 2 weeks.Worked best for me if used every other day..</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this shaver! I&#x27;m a barber and use this for the bottom edges of bald fades. It gets closer than a straight edge! I&#x27;d highly recommend this for anyone doing bald fades or who want a really close shave with an electric shaver. I&#x27;ve never used it on anyone&#x27;s face so I couldn&#x27;t speak to that.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to men that have tough facial hair to remove.  Especially men of color.  This really does a good job shaving my facial hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut like my barber&#x27;s Wahl 5 stars. I&#x27;m going to take them to my barber and let him have a look at them. The charge last forever.</li>
            <li> These Shavers are awesome ! After using my Andis edgers to get most of the sideburn/beard lined up...these shavers finish it off&lt;br /&gt;giving me that soft as a baby butt feel....definitely don&#x27;t need to press hard either, just let the shaver do the work....Great buy</li>
            <li> Working better than I expected!  Shave is closer than  my razor was!</li>
            <li> This is my third Wahl shaver over many years.  They usually last about 10 year, give or take. As mentioned by other reviewers, this model lacks the trimmer, the charging light and the two piece stand is kinda of wobbly. It is a little loud (92db on my app, about like a food processor it says) and lacks the solid feel of my previous model, the 4000 system.  Only comes with a teensy cleaning brush, screen cover, charging cord and stand.  I&#x27;m guessing that cost cutting has eliminated the niceties ...too bad because I, for one one would  not mind paying a little more for all that was removed, although the pop-up trimmer never really worked without pulling hairs (ouch). All that being said I will continue to buy similar Wahl products because they work.  The shaver screen is a bit fragile but, guys it&#x27;s not an air hammer! The shaver foil that contacts your face is smooth and large enough that it doesn&#x27;t take fifty passes over the same spot to remove stubble.  I don&#x27;t know how it works on balding heads or floor length beard removal since I have had neither experience but, for everyday shaving it works fine.    Now, the bad news. Be careful which vendor you buy from.  Mine came loose in its box resulting in a damaged screen foil.  It also took 12 days to arrive even after paying extra for std delivery.  As usual, Amazon was great about handling the shipping delay and the damage.  Although they could not replace the damaged part, they did offer a full return refund or partial cash refund.  They also refunded my extra shipping so, as usual, they were more than fair to work with.    This Wahl shaver is still made in the USA according to their box although, it does say \\&quot;of domestic and imported parts\\&quot; so they deserve at least some homegrown support.</li>
            <li> This was the second shaver to actually  go out on me. The shaver  was working  great then until it died  out.</li>
            <li> Great shaver super close. Must by for my dad.</li>
            <li> This shaver works great. I would suggest to cut any existing facial hair down in order to get that close cut you are looking for.  I seen where others have complained about battery life.  This unit will stay charge for at least three cuts.  I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Great shaved. Powerful motor.</li>
            <li> Not pleased with this item. You have to repeatedly go over areas and half the time it cuts nothing not sure if its the product or my shaver is malfunctioned</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product</li>
            <li> Excellent razor.  Prior to this razor I had never found an electric razor that actually shaved me.  The Wahl razor not only shaves me is shaves me close as a blade.</li>
            <li> I wrote a bad review about this product without giving this company a chance to make it right I apologize for that I must say that I was surprised when they contacted me and sent me another shaver so I want everyone to know they deserved a 5 star rating and their shaver as well -thanks p.s. I will shop again with yall</li>
            <li> This shaver is a little louder and warmer my the grip than the series before it. The adjustment instructions are not good enough, for me, but the shave is almost getting close enough after 5 attempts. I am a black man and bumps are my biggest problem with shaving. In that light, this has shaver has spared me any, my primary goal for buying it. I would still reccomend it. I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift and after one shave I was immediately sold!  I had gotten tired of buying razors almost monthly and none of them lasting as long as I would want them too.  They do a close shave don&#x27;t get me wrong, but unless you want to dish out $15+ a month on razors, they just aren’t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first shave I did get bumps but then read that I wasn&#x27;t supposed to press this shaver too close while my face got used to it.  Shave #2 was a lot more successful.  Definitely a product worth trying if you want a clean, close shave.</li>
            <li> I started out with a Norelco, ages ago. From there I went to a Braun, and a Panasonic. Each was good, but only so good. I learned about the Wahl during a hair cut. I shave the back of my neck each day, while shaving. My barber could take this out and shave me closer--much closer. It&#x27;s the foil. It&#x27;s very thin. My shave times have been cut in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little guy is very robust. The whole thing vibrates when it&#x27;s on, ready to roll, and roll it does. Twenty years after I abandoned blades forever this is by far the best shaver I have used. It&#x27;s really, really good.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good, fast and sharp shaver, this is the one. Great for personal use or at the barber shop. A must for your barber kit.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a very close shave for the most part - however it misses many softer hairs so that I have to use a regular razor to remove them.  I wish I could give this feedback to Wahl and I wish I had bought something else.</li>
            <li> My barber has this shaver. The one he has shaves me closer than any electric shaver I&#x27;ve used. This one is not cutting like his. It skips some spots on my face. If it cut like the one my barber uses it would have 5 Stars</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver for black men. No razor bumps. This is what my barber uses. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> This tools gets super close shave!&lt;br /&gt;I love this, I use it on my head instead of using a razor.&lt;br /&gt;Much better then a razor because you can cut your self..</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he thought  it would get him a close shave and it dose but not as close as he thought.</li>
            <li> These shaver is great. I use them after I shave my head with the clippers.  Its feels like I used a razor... I use them everyday..... on my head and my face.... im a black man they have not broke me out yet...</li>
            <li> Minimal bumping...I started using it to replace my razor. I can&#x27;t complain with the results. Very Satisfied. Only problem I have is the shaver won&#x27;t run when plugged in. You need to make sure there is enough charge in it before you start your shave.</li>
            <li> gives great shave, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It gave me razo bumps and doesn&#x27;t shave close .</li>
            <li> bought one and then bought one for my brother. He loved it</li>
            <li> My barber demonstrated this shaver to me and I was amazed that it shaved me as close as a razor. I expect this electric razor will perform just as well since it&#x27;s the exact same model; however, when mine arrived and I was reading through the instructions, I noticed that the side button that&#x27;s supposed to release the cover the cutting foils are attached to didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could have returned the unit I suppose, but I had already destroyed the packaging in order to remove the shaver and didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning it so I managed to pry the cover off in order to get at the dysfunctional side button and discovered that apparently some cheap plastic part that the button is supposed to press against was broken off, but the top cover is easy to pry off with a good [[ASIN:B000KI9UNA Dexter-Russell (S137PCP) - 4\\&quot; Galveston-Style Oyster Knife - Sani-Safe Series]] so I plan to make do. It is an excellent shaver however, so I&#x27;ve given it four stars.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I&#x27;ve been using this shaver now for almost a month and I am truly amazed. It actually does cut as close as a blade, and I sometimes trim myself up just because it&#x27;s so quick and easy -- probably because this thing has a powerful motor and must have precision blades. I&#x27;ve just purchased a second Wahl shaver because I&#x27;ve learned from experience that all things break no matter how well made and I want to make sure I have a replacement. Upgraded my rating to five stars. Good shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and it met his expectations. It provides a close shave with no bumps. We would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I received the shaver in 5 days but it was broken, the side button that removes the foil was stuck so i could not take it off.Also, when i turned it on it didnt turn on i had to push the button in that was the only way it worked so im definitely going to return it</li>
            <li> This Wahl 5 Star Shaved is GOOD GOOD! I use my Andis T-Outliner to edge my goatee up and take off the thick stuff. This shaver doesn&#x27;t cut long hair and that&#x27;s great. So after the T-Ouliner I bust out my Wahl 5 Star to smooth the rest of my face out. It takes ALL STUBBLE COMPLETELY AWAY! I&#x27;ve only shaved with it for about 5 shaving sessions so far and I Love it. I ordered 2 more replacement foils and blades for it just incase. The foil that came with it hasn&#x27;t broke or been destroyed yet despite some reviews. I HAVEN&#x27;T HAD TO CHARGE MINE YET EITHER!!!! Once I took it out of the box I just started using it and after 5 shaves it hasn&#x27;t died down in the least yet. From what I hear if you charge it right out of the box, this screws up your battery life which is probably why many people claim that they can&#x27;t use it as a coordless shaver anymore because it won&#x27;t hold a charge. Don&#x27;t charge it until it first dies down. Don&#x27;t put it on the charger straight out of the box. Now I don&#x27;t shave everyday, I let the hairs come out of the skin a little bit, then I shave. For my face, I&#x27;ve found this to work better than shaving everyday. Her in about a week I&#x27;m going to order another one for a back-up. You need backups for everything working out here in Afghanistan. LOL! Any who, This is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m African American by the way. I&#x27;ve used many razors....MANY! Nothing else comes close!</li>
            <li> Turned on to this device by my barber...I suffered for years with razor bumps and burn...as long as you trim first with an edger this thing takes care of all stubble! Woman will love to rub your face again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you want smooth skin.  The razor stubble feel is there right after you shave and doesn&#x27;t leave.  It&#x27;s good if you need to look presentable and don&#x27;t have the facilities for close shave.  The quality is good and battery never gave me any issues.  I still have this in my bathroom but don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> this 5 star is really worth 5***** stars I luv it it&#x27;s very strong cuts very close to the skin for that bald smooth look.</li>
            <li> Damaged in 2 months . I was unable to charge it any longer and when the company was contacted, they said is passed due selling policy return.</li>
            <li> The shaver works well</li>
            <li> Very good shaver...I started shaving my head pretty bald and this gets down very close and gives an even look..!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d dock it 1 star for how loud this puppy gets, but this is truly a fantastic addition to my daily routine and a small price to pay for being bump-free. I&#x27;m a black male with curly facial hair, and I&#x27;ve been plagued with razor bumps ever since I started shaving. Nothing (besides not shaving) helped, and I tried a LOT of solutions: bump patrol, shaving more frequently, mach XX razors, wet shave. Before the 5 Star, the only thing that worked good enough was a Wahl Detailer hair trimmer (usually used for shape-ups), but that still left a small amount of stubble that had to be taken care of daily. The 5 Star has given me a truly bump-free, smooth as eggs, stubble-free shave on a consistent basis. The first time using it, I had to trim down my facial hair (with my Wahl Detailer). This gets the hair low enough for the razor to be effective. After that initial day using the Detailer, I put it away and never used it for my face again. The 5 Star is amazing and was 100% what I was looking for. I&#x27;m a believer, and I&#x27;ve got no more bumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of electric shaver&#x27;s but this works just fine when traveling. Thank you</li>
            <li> Works GREAT best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned or used. This shaver has made shaving/grooming a breeze....</li>
            <li> Purchased primarily to serve as head shaver. Provides close shave. Does not however limit razor bumps/irritation</li>
            <li> This is my first real product review, and I wish that it came with heaps of celebration for an amazing product.  The Wahl 5 Star started out as its name indicates.  Unfortunately, a month and a half after my purchase, the product failed.  It was my fourth or fifth time using the razor when the gold foil tore from the inside and started flapping against the motor.  I was already more than halfway through my shave, so I finished despite having half the foil missing from the razor.  It&#x27;s unfortunate that such a good razor only lasted long enough for me to truly love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;@ Powerful&lt;br /&gt;@ Shaves extremely close&lt;br /&gt;@ Minimizes bumps related to shaving&lt;br /&gt;@ Nice design for holding &amp; charging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD:&lt;br /&gt;@ Loud&lt;br /&gt;@ Broken after two months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all I have. I can only recommend this product because a friend of mine still uses his.  Maybe I got a dud.  Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the results of this shaver.  I&#x27;ve had to replace the foil once, but still works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do the the intending job</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver, but it is for a SPECIALIZED use only! For those saying it won&#x27;t cut their hair, I can tell you this is completely false, they just don&#x27;t know how to use it. The Super Shaver gets rid of &amp;#34;STUBS&amp;#34; from close clippers like Andis Styliner or Wahl 5 Star detailer. You have to shave the hair down First. Then use the Super Shaver and it cuts beneath the skin for a painless smooth shave. However, you&#x27;re probably wondering why I gave it a 2 star rating. This is because for me personally, I am a bald guy, a young black American. My hair is curly, so when I use this shaver in approximately 2.5 to 3 days if I allow my hair to somewhat grow back, I break out in bumps! Yes if you have curly hair the shave you will love because it&#x27;s beyond razor quality, and it only takes 3 min. But you pay later, I bumped on the back of the neck behind the ear and on the side of the head. I was hoping this would work for me because it speeds up my mornings tremendously. But I guess I have to keep looking.</li>
            <li> smooth operation, i like it</li>
            <li> My husband is very satisfied with the shavers he likes the holder for the shaver</li>
            <li> Fantastic shaver. The I have had so far</li>
            <li> As a barber student, we have used this shaver many times on clients. I bought it for my personal use &amp; love it. I wear my head shaved &amp; this shaver gets the job done for me. Great choice..</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Best electric that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Excelent Product, This is the 3rd one i have owened they are very durable ,and last for many years ,they shave well and are made in the USA. Reaplacement screens are reasonably priced . I would recommend you give this razor a try, i rate it very high.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it guys, we hate shaving every day.  This shaver does the job very well and at this price you can&#x27;t go wrong.  There are so many shavers out there with gimmicks but there&#x27;s no need for them.</li>
            <li> Came by mail, my husband opened it.. But it never work and so we had to return it😩</li>
            <li> Love it and great price.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with the item. It&#x27;s been less than two months and broke already. ...:(</li>
            <li> Very loud motor - it wakes my wife in an adjacent room. In the morning, my wife asked me if I was going to shave, I already had! I purchased &amp;#34;pre shave&amp;#34; to lubricate my beard and cause hairs to stand up but it still didn&#x27;t cut the hairs. I have very light hairs and this shaver will not shave them even after many passes. For now I am going to use a safety razor. I had a Panasonic and it was great but expensive. Later I will probably spring for another one.Don&#x27;t buy this product!</li>
            <li> It doesnt cut that close to the scalp as I need. Leaves stubble. it holds a very good charge and is extremely lightweight</li>
            <li> Everything its said to be.</li>
            <li> Works as it is designed to do. The battery lasts long and it cuts very close. You can&#x27;t beat the price either</li>
            <li> Shaver is okay. No bumps which is awesome but wish it got closer still have to shave with razor after in few spots on my face</li>
            <li> I think this WAHL clipper works best when you have no time to put on shaving cream and rinse.  I notice if you press the shaver hard against your face, the hair is cut too close causing ingrown hairs and razor bumps. After using the shaver I find I still need to use a razor afterwards to get a cleaner close shave.  I wouldn&#x27;t tell you don&#x27;t buy this shaver but truthfully I get a much better shave with a generic 3-blade disposable razor for way less the price of this.  So my experience is this shaver is good for a quick touch-up in between a traditional razor shave for the times when you only have 30 seconds to be done and out the door.</li>
            <li> Works well. Touch up on neck or face&lt;br /&gt;Used after clipper cut around edges</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a crappy shaver. Broke only after 3 months. In addition it doesn&#x27;t shave as close. Needed it to shave my head. I got the Remington F5-5800 instead. Shaves much closer and better.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;SMOOTH&amp;#34; IT DOES THE JOB</li>
            <li> just like I hoped  I have had 4 of these shavers and they are the best</li>
            <li> Poor quality. Was a total waste of the money.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this if you suffer from razor bumps in any capacity. It cuts so close that you almost surely get bumps. It does nothing to help. I never write reviews but this was a nightmare.</li>
            <li> My husband love it!!!</li>
            <li> Has worked fine and I am happy that I made the purchased based on what my barber recommend. Wish I had purchased this years ago.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I have sensitive skin. Works great for prevention of razor burn.</li>
            <li> Worked well for a few uses then the foil broke. An to replace the foil is not cheap for it to break that quick.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done with ease. No issues with it yet</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver. If you have to shave everyday and you don&#x27;t want to use razors, this is the way to go. First few times might make a little razor burn on the neck part. Just be gentle and in few days you won&#x27;t be seeing anymore burns on your neck as well. I got this machine as a gift and I especially wanted this one. My barber uses one of this bad boys. Don&#x27;t mind the price. You will save a lot more money and time. So far so good. I tried other shavers before. This is the only one I found for my thick facial hair to get a razor shave without the razor. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great for a clean shave.  But, it does cause irritation after a few days.  Must rely on bump stop products to hopefully do their job.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;My barber uses this shaver so I decided to buy it as well.&lt;br /&gt;Very close shave, just amazing.</li>
            <li> The best shaver i ever used. No bull shaver shaver gets close and no stubble .</li>
            <li> No complaints about razors. They work better than expected.</li>
            <li> Way too loud! Vibrates like heck and actually doesn&#x27;t shave that well. Cannot recommend.</li>
            <li> Watched the video and noticed it seemed to work really well for African American men. I&#x27;ve used it after shaving with my clippers, and they really shaves close!</li>
