            <li>The container is a nice plastic and compact.</li>
            <li>All I can say is try at your own risk.</li>
            <li>Good product for an easy face refresher or cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Makes your face look great after one use but 24 pads run out way too quick..</li>
            <li>I use one side in AM and the other in PM, works great and fits in perfectly with my anti-aging skin routine!</li>
            <li>this line of products is by far the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>wow it makes your skin look wonderful</li>
            <li>I use a pad more than one time.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>

            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND HAVE ORDERED IT MANY TIMES BEFORE FROM ANOTHER VENDOR.  </li>
            <li>Love love love these.</li>
            <li>After two weeks, my skin looks better than ever.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love all of the Alpha Hydrox products.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than it has in years.</li>
            <li>I have had any of the issues that many women have when using at home acid peels.</li>
            <li>I wish there were more pads included like maybe 54 pads?</li>
            <li>Really love all alpha hydrox products.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love this company&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyway, love the AHA 14% swipes.  </li>
            <li>This is okay.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It seems like I&#x27;ve always had a problem with acne and now aging skin on top of it.  </li>
            <li>I love these pads.</li>
            <li>Not too powerful for me, but my skin is fairly tolerant of strong products.  </li>
            <li>This is a great way to keep your skin looking young.</li>
            <li>Will be easy to carry in the lightweight jar with twist on lid while traveling.</li>
            <li>This product is strong, but boy does it work.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel strong nor did I see any difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it was too strong or something because I do use their (i.e. Alpha Hydrox) 10% cream without any problems.</li>
            <li>At first I thought 24 pads suck, which it does, but the product is so effective.</li>
            <li>Helps with my acne and fights fine lines.</li>
            <li>The pores on my nose and chin have gotten huge</li>
            <li>and it helps keeps my skin smooth.....</li>
            <li>significantly Improved the texture and tone of my skin</li>
            <li>Love love love this especially in combo with the night wrinkle cream in the tub.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try to remember to update when I&#x27;ve been using it longer, but I was so excited to already be seeing some results</li>
            <li>It does sting in the begining but its worth it!</li>
            <li>get them, they help, your face feels clean.</li>
            <li>Great to weekly exfoliate scaly rough patches.  </li>
            <li>yet - it&#x27;s pretty strong (but</li>
            <li>Product works extremely well, good when you don&#x27;t have time to do a full faced 50 percent glycolic peel, this is quick and easy to do before bed.</li>
            <li>This has a high concentration (14%) of AHA compared to most products you can find.  </li>
            <li>These are great little pads -</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft my hubby can&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
            <li>For the price, its worth it.</li>
            <li>Its sooooo worth it.</li>
            <li>I switched to the 14% swipes and voila, success.</li>
            <li>Right away, my face is smoother.  </li>
            <li>in the morning they came right out.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these wipes and entire product line for anyone who wants to smooth their skin and fight fine lines :)</li>
            <li>price is much less than the more famous brand that goes for something like $80.</li>
            <li>But in a very short time it will have a smooth clean glow to it.</li>
            <li>I keep going back to this line, and love these swipes.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased 2 more since my initial purchase ...</li>
            <li>I purchased these swipes at a local Harmon and when I needed more I was told they no longer sell the swipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that it does not come packed with more than 24 wipes.</li>
            <li>I like how the pad have dimples that if you work in a circular motion, they will open your pores and deposit more product.</li>
            <li>Works really fast!</li>
            <li>Other products go on nicely over this product.</li>
            <li>The pads are kind of..well, very rough.</li>
            <li>Like nuclear sallow pale, I glow in the dark, lol!!!</li>
            <li>For an occasional-I&#x27;m-in-a-jam-and-need-something solution, these are fine, but I would not use them daily.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using daily as they will dry your skin out and u absolutely must wear a good sunscreen ...</li>
            <li>she has too much keratin blocking her hair follicles on her arms</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS AWESOME...VERY FAST AND EFFICIENT.  </li>
            <li>I really do believe the damage this has done to my face is permanent and there is nothing I can do for it now -</li>
            <li>I use the whole line and it takes about a month to six weeks to see a difference but let me tell you it works on the wrinkles and firming the skin on your face.  </li>
            <li>I feel like they are really minimizing my blackheads and preventing breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I get these injections maybe once or twice  a year max because they&#x27;re very costly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>item as described thanks</li>
            <li>They were packaged well and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Also worked really well for exfoliating pre and post wax-</li>
            <li>My pores are much smaller, and some of the fine lines on my forehead are completely gone!</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old and have a problem with mild adult acne which I never had before.</li>
            <li>to an hour, i figure better safe than sorry.</li>
            <li>I am thinking this particular bottle was sitting at some beauty/hair shop...dried out....and the owner decided to put water in it and sell them online.</li>
            <li>I generally have really good skin, I am 40 and don&#x27;t have many lines but just recently developed some this past two years due to stress</li>
            <li>highly recommend these swipes.  </li>
            <li>The wipes have just the right amount of serum on them and do not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>skin is not exactly scar prone or sensitive either, like most i&#x27;ve suffered from acne but only had one small boxscar before this, please look into these types of products further before deciding to try them - it could very well be the best decision you will ever make, i&#x27;m only 26</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t clear if you&#x27;re  suppose to rinse it off after a certain amount of time.</li>
            <li>I use these when I&#x27;m out and can not wash my face like normal.  </li>
            <li>I found that most of the time I really didn&#x27;t need to use an entire swipe, so I eventually cut them all in half and that was really a cost saver.</li>
            <li>The pores on my nose look smaller, and some tiny blackheads up on my forehead and chin that I have been fighting with for months came out easily.  </li>
            <li>I already feel like my pores are becoming less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really had high hopes for this product, but I really do believe that it was the cause of my face breaking out where I had patches of bumps on different areas of my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the 12% alpha hydrox cream product for about 10 years and it stopped being as effective on my skin the last few months.  </li>
            <li>aha make u very sensitive to the sun ...</li>
            <li>They are a little intense, similar to Stridex pads, but I feel like they work even better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m someone with really sensitive skin, and this product works wonders!</li>
            <li>Just be careful for the decent amount of acid in these wipes if your skin is super sensitive.  </li>
            <li>The price might seem a little high, but I think they are worth it if you really want to shrink your blackheads.  </li>
            <li>At first anything \\&quot;hidden\\&quot; under your skin may come out and your skin may look worse than better.</li>
            <li>They are super wet,</li>
            <li>I have super oily skin with minimal sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>Im 27 with moderate acne, large pores and acne scaring, and after repeated use saw refined pores,</li>
            <li>This, along with my DIY Vitamin C (on face, neck &amp; hands twice daily) and also the Alpha Hydrox AHA Souffle 12% are so helpful getting my skin to look a little more youthful and &amp;#34;glowy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>They help remove the top dull layer of skin.</li>
            <li>So my face is about 92% clear.</li>
            <li>But beware, you do need to avoid sun exposure and make sure you are wearing at least a 15 spf when stepping out.</li>
            <li>This seems to work well so far.</li>
            <li>but I personally don&#x27;t care for the swipes as much as the soufflé for lotion.  </li>
            <li>I completely stopped retin a micro and not a cyst.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m closing in on 50 years old.  </li>
            <li>, I have fairly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on many forums talking to others who have had similar damage, not only from AHA but from Retin-A and other chemicals as well</li>
            <li>I hope long term use will help with some fine lines and rough skin patches.</li>
            <li>I used these wipes while I was pregnant because the alpha hydroxy acid was safer to use than other topical acne treatments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything at one time or another from drugstore brands to the most expensive from the dermatologist and these really work.</li>
            <li>They are as good as the expensive ones by Dr. Gross that I bought at Sephora for 10x the price.</li>
            <li>I first started using these every 3 days, then every other, and now I use it every night.</li>
            <li>Get your skin used to glycolic acid products first, and some other high-end, fairly strong products (they don&#x27;t have to be expensive - especially when you&#x27;re doing your homework using the Amazon reviews - tons of useful info</li>
            <li>Half a wipe seems to be just the right amount for my face.</li>
            <li>I generally need to use two</li>
            <li>My only complaints are that its rather sticky after you put it on and the directions aren&#x27;t as clear as i would like.</li>
            <li>Since my skin is sensitive I only leave on for 15 minutes and then shower.  </li>
            <li>One pad barely does my face.</li>
            <li>When I first started using this, my skin broke out slightly, but i continued to use it.</li>
            <li>And the pads (&amp;#34;swipes&amp;#34;) which are similar to oxy pads were VERY wet.</li>
            <li>It seals well so that the wipes do not dry out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few weeks I started noticing huge pores, and vertical scars all over my face - about 2-3 cm long and 1 cm wide, I can&#x27;t begin to describe the psychological damage this has done, and the impact it has made to my self</li>
            <li>So I am african american and had so much acne and numerous numerous dark spots on my face.</li>

            <li> Right away, my face is smoother.  </li>
            <li> in the morning they came right out.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these wipes and entire product line for anyone who wants to smooth their skin and fight fine lines :)</li>
            <li> price is much less than the more famous brand that goes for something like $80.</li>
            <li> But in a very short time it will have a smooth clean glow to it.</li>
            <li> I keep going back to this line, and love these swipes.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 more since my initial purchase ...</li>
            <li> I purchased these swipes at a local Harmon and when I needed more I was told they no longer sell the swipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that it does not come packed with more than 24 wipes.</li>
            <li> I like how the pad have dimples that if you work in a circular motion, they will open your pores and deposit more product.</li>
            <li> Works really fast!</li>
            <li> Other products go on nicely over this product.</li>
            <li> The pads are kind of..well, very rough.</li>
            <li> Like nuclear sallow pale, I glow in the dark, lol!!!</li>
            <li> For an occasional-I&#x27;m-in-a-jam-and-need-something solution, these are fine, but I would not use them daily.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using daily as they will dry your skin out and u absolutely must wear a good sunscreen ...</li>
            <li> she has too much keratin blocking her hair follicles on her arms</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS AWESOME...VERY FAST AND EFFICIENT.  </li>
            <li> I really do believe the damage this has done to my face is permanent and there is nothing I can do for it now -</li>
            <li> I use the whole line and it takes about a month to six weeks to see a difference but let me tell you it works on the wrinkles and firming the skin on your face.  </li>
            <li> I feel like they are really minimizing my blackheads and preventing breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I get these injections maybe once or twice  a year max because they&#x27;re very costly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> item as described thanks</li>
            <li> They were packaged well and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Also worked really well for exfoliating pre and post wax-</li>
            <li> My pores are much smaller, and some of the fine lines on my forehead are completely gone!</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old and have a problem with mild adult acne which I never had before.</li>
            <li> to an hour, i figure better safe than sorry.</li>
            <li> I am thinking this particular bottle was sitting at some beauty/hair shop...dried out....and the owner decided to put water in it and sell them online.</li>
            <li> I generally have really good skin, I am 40 and don&#x27;t have many lines but just recently developed some this past two years due to stress</li>
            <li> highly recommend these swipes.  </li>
            <li> The wipes have just the right amount of serum on them and do not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> skin is not exactly scar prone or sensitive either, like most i&#x27;ve suffered from acne but only had one small boxscar before this, please look into these types of products further before deciding to try them - it could very well be the best decision you will ever make, i&#x27;m only 26</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t clear if you&#x27;re  suppose to rinse it off after a certain amount of time.</li>
            <li> I use these when I&#x27;m out and can not wash my face like normal.  </li>
            <li> I found that most of the time I really didn&#x27;t need to use an entire swipe, so I eventually cut them all in half and that was really a cost saver.</li>
            <li> The pores on my nose look smaller, and some tiny blackheads up on my forehead and chin that I have been fighting with for months came out easily.  </li>
            <li> I already feel like my pores are becoming less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this product, but I really do believe that it was the cause of my face breaking out where I had patches of bumps on different areas of my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the 12% alpha hydrox cream product for about 10 years and it stopped being as effective on my skin the last few months.  </li>
            <li> aha make u very sensitive to the sun ...</li>
            <li> They are a little intense, similar to Stridex pads, but I feel like they work even better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone with really sensitive skin, and this product works wonders!</li>
            <li> Just be careful for the decent amount of acid in these wipes if your skin is super sensitive.  </li>
            <li> The price might seem a little high, but I think they are worth it if you really want to shrink your blackheads.  </li>
            <li> At first anything \\&quot;hidden\\&quot; under your skin may come out and your skin may look worse than better.</li>
            <li> They are super wet,</li>
            <li> I have super oily skin with minimal sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> Im 27 with moderate acne, large pores and acne scaring, and after repeated use saw refined pores,</li>
            <li> This, along with my DIY Vitamin C (on face, neck &amp; hands twice daily) and also the Alpha Hydrox AHA Souffle 12% are so helpful getting my skin to look a little more youthful and &amp;#34;glowy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> They help remove the top dull layer of skin.</li>
            <li> So my face is about 92% clear.</li>
            <li> But beware, you do need to avoid sun exposure and make sure you are wearing at least a 15 spf when stepping out.</li>
            <li> This seems to work well so far.</li>
            <li> but I personally don&#x27;t care for the swipes as much as the soufflé for lotion.  </li>
            <li> I completely stopped retin a micro and not a cyst.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m closing in on 50 years old.  </li>
            <li> , I have fairly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on many forums talking to others who have had similar damage, not only from AHA but from Retin-A and other chemicals as well</li>
            <li> I hope long term use will help with some fine lines and rough skin patches.</li>
            <li> I used these wipes while I was pregnant because the alpha hydroxy acid was safer to use than other topical acne treatments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything at one time or another from drugstore brands to the most expensive from the dermatologist and these really work.</li>
            <li> They are as good as the expensive ones by Dr. Gross that I bought at Sephora for 10x the price.</li>
            <li> I first started using these every 3 days, then every other, and now I use it every night.</li>
            <li> Get your skin used to glycolic acid products first, and some other high-end, fairly strong products (they don&#x27;t have to be expensive - especially when you&#x27;re doing your homework using the Amazon reviews - tons of useful info</li>
            <li> Half a wipe seems to be just the right amount for my face.</li>
            <li> I generally need to use two</li>
            <li> My only complaints are that its rather sticky after you put it on and the directions aren&#x27;t as clear as i would like.</li>
            <li> Since my skin is sensitive I only leave on for 15 minutes and then shower.  </li>
            <li> One pad barely does my face.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this, my skin broke out slightly, but i continued to use it.</li>
            <li> And the pads (&amp;#34;swipes&amp;#34;) which are similar to oxy pads were VERY wet.</li>
            <li> It seals well so that the wipes do not dry out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few weeks I started noticing huge pores, and vertical scars all over my face - about 2-3 cm long and 1 cm wide, I can&#x27;t begin to describe the psychological damage this has done, and the impact it has made to my self</li>
            <li> So I am african american and had so much acne and numerous numerous dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of continuous use it gave similar results to a mild peel from dermatologist, but with much less irritation.</li>
            <li> never really had much of a skin problem to begin with, mostly black heads on my nose and some sun spots (which is why I used them on my entire face)</li>
            <li> The little container looked open...and very old.</li>
            <li> If your face is very sensitive, it can cause some redness, but you can wash it off after a few minutes if  you want.</li>
            <li> Product left my skin very dry...</li>
            <li> They did tingle / slightly sting, but they left me with smoother, younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> mentioned in other reviews, the pads are fully saturated with solution, which totally makes it possible to use half a pad each time, which makes the jar last twice as long!</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a week, so I can&#x27;t testify to it&#x27;s effectiveness other than I can tell its working by the sensation after application.</li>
            <li> the review that said they were dry must have gotten a &amp;#34;bad batch&amp;#34; or something.</li>
            <li> These wipes break up the oil and dry up the pimples exfoliate and help with hyper pigmentation ....</li>
            <li> I was concerned that this product would dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I will check back in a few weeks to let you know  if there are bigger results.</li>
            <li> If you have dark spots, clogged pores definitely definitely use this product.</li>
            <li> I also cut them in half to make them last longer.</li>
            <li> I cut them in half and use that, so they&#x27;ll last even longer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to cut them in half to make them last longer.</li>
            <li> I took others advice and cut the swipes in half to make them last longer.</li>
            <li> I cut them in half to make them last longer.</li>
            <li> It stings a little after you use it, so I apply moisturizer after ten minutes.</li>
            <li> My face is a little itchy at night, but nothing some extra lotion can&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> Almost too wet.</li>
            <li> Careful to use sunscreen while using this treatment.</li>
            <li> The pads are not very moist at all.</li>
            <li> Worked as well as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m careful to use them at night, every other day, so I&#x27;m not having any reaction ... yet.</li>
            <li> Those little black pores that show up on my nose but never seem to disappear are finally gone!</li>
            <li> A slight tingle in previous reviews actually means a slight &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s tolerable.</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews on this type of product and they say to rinse after a specified amount of time.</li>
            <li> I use this prouduct at night every other day after washing my face.</li>
            <li> Each of the pads is very saturated, and there&#x27;s only 24 in a tub, so I&#x27;ve been cutting them in half to use at a time.  </li>
            <li> I followed other reviewers advice and cut the pads in half-</li>
            <li> My acne is gone and 70% of the dark spots are gone.</li>
            <li> Have occasional Botox (prefer Dysport lately tho -</li>
            <li> They were expensive, but I cut the pads in half to save money since they are really saturated with the product.</li>
            <li> Half does the job for me.</li>
            <li> Have used this product previously; HOWEVER this was NOT SEALED.  </li>
            <li> All previous purchases of this product regardless of where I purchased have been sealed.  </li>
            <li> WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE MY PREVIOUS REVIEW.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since I was a teenager, which has caused slight scarring and hyper pigmentation on my face.</li>
            <li> I use the face wash as described followed by the moisturizing aha wrinkle cream and a swipe which I cut in half.  </li>
            <li> less breakouts.  </li>
            <li> they were plenty to work with even in half.  </li>
            <li> I took the advise of a few of these reviewers and cut them in half.</li>
            <li> It tingles a little when you use them, but I have not had any peeling or redness from them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll skip the usual stuff about what AHA does for your skin since you can research that elsewhere or read any of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I skipped a few nights when it made my face burn a little.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday because it stings a little when I put it on.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about everything over the years from expensive department store products to natural products.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll just lay off it for a while and start again in may be a few weeks.</li>
            <li> In my humble opinion of course.</li>
            <li> ( But I always rinse after 15 minutes and apply a heavy night cream afterwards.)</li>
            <li> you can feel it working to get rid of dead skin on face and neck</li>
            <li> In fact, I reccommend cutting them in half so that they last twice as long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference in dryness at all, just less visible pores!</li>
            <li> The pads are exfoliating and can sometimes be sharp if I push too hard.  </li>
            <li> my face got soooo pale.</li>
            <li> so she gets little pimple looking bumps, and it has helped!</li>
            <li> I can usually use a pad 3 times.  </li>
            <li> IT WAS TOTALLY MY FAULT FOR BEING UNDER THE WRONG IMPRESSION.  </li>
            <li> I usually skip the wipe if I just shaved.</li>
            <li> At least take the hair out.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not too late to save yours.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have any negative reaction to it tho.</li>
            <li> The wipes are a thick patterned cloth that hold the moisture.</li>
            <li> but it made me break out in little red bumps sporadically:(</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been quite a while, sorry for the late update.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong trying these out.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I WAS TOTALLY WRONG.....</li>
            <li> It leaves a weird feeling (or maybe a film?)</li>
            <li> They are almost impossible to find.</li>
            <li> I have not had any bad reactions.</li>
            <li> SO DISGUSTING.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> significantly Improved the texture and tone of my skin but it made me break out in little red bumps sporadically:(</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old and have a problem with mild adult acne which I never had before. I first started using these every 3 days, then every other, and now I use it every night. I use a pad more than one time. After I wash my face I apply the pad and then I rub it in with my fingers. I can usually use a pad 3 times.  At first anything \\&quot;hidden\\&quot; under your skin may come out and your skin may look worse than better. But in a very short time it will have a smooth clean glow to it. Love this product. It&#x27;s the 4th time I&#x27;m ordering it.</li>
            <li> I am 57 and I have been using this line, and these swipes for several years. My skin glows when I use these. They help remove the top dull layer of skin. It tingles a little when you use them, but I have not had any peeling or redness from them. I have tried just about everything over the years from expensive department store products to natural products. I keep going back to this line, and love these swipes. They are as good as the expensive ones by Dr. Gross that I bought at Sephora for 10x the price. You can&#x27;t go wrong trying these out.</li>
            <li> Product is good, however I prefer the cream moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. I found out about it from the Skin Care Addiction subreddit. It stings a little after you use it, so I apply moisturizer after ten minutes. Your mileage may vary depending.</li>
            <li> I cut into quarters and find that it is ample to cover my face. A slight tingle in previous reviews actually means a slight &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s tolerable. Just keep something around to fan your face with for about 20 seconds. Other products go on nicely over this product. I have not had any bad reactions. I have only used it for a week, so I can&#x27;t testify to it&#x27;s effectiveness other than I can tell its working by the sensation after application.</li>
            <li> What a difference this has made on my skin. Noticeably fewer blackheads and smaller pores after one month of using these at night. I skipped a few nights when it made my face burn a little. I also cut them in half to make them last longer.</li>
            <li> I have only has these for two days and I can already see a difference.  The melasma on my forehead has lightened with only two uses. The pores on my nose look smaller, and some tiny blackheads up on my forehead and chin that I have been fighting with for months came out easily.  I hope long term use will help with some fine lines and rough skin patches. I generally have really good skin, I am 40 and don&#x27;t have many lines but just recently developed some this past two years due to stress I think. The pores on my nose and chin have gotten huge but I think these pads will help. They are super wet, the review that said they were dry must have gotten a &amp;#34;bad batch&amp;#34; or something. I took the advise of a few of these reviewers and cut them in half. Half does the job for me. I will check back in a few weeks to let you know  if there are bigger results. I also got the toner, souffle, and the silk lotion with spf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been quite a while, sorry for the late update. These pads are excellent. But beware, you do need to avoid sun exposure and make sure you are wearing at least a 15 spf when stepping out. my face got soooo pale. Like nuclear sallow pale, I glow in the dark, lol!!! But my melasma has faded to almost nothing. My pores are much smaller, and some of the fine lines on my forehead are completely gone! My skin is so soft my hubby can&#x27;t stop touching it. My daughter has been using this on her arms because she has keratosis (i think thats what the doc said!) she has too much keratin blocking her hair follicles on her arms so she gets little pimple looking bumps, and it has helped! So I will remain faithful to this product, I&#x27;ll just lay off it for a while and start again in may be a few weeks.</li>
            <li> get them, they help, your face feels clean. In my humble opinion of course.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for over a year now ....... I use several different products on a daily basis..... these swipes are great I use them 3 -4 days a week and it helps keeps my skin smooth.....</li>
            <li> These are great little pads - I cut them in half and use that, so they&#x27;ll last even longer.  Leaves my face feeling smooth and soft.  Grat buy!</li>
            <li> Product works extremely well, good when you don&#x27;t have time to do a full faced 50 percent glycolic peel, this is quick and easy to do before bed.</li>
            <li> I used these wipes while I was pregnant because the alpha hydroxy acid was safer to use than other topical acne treatments. They did a good job of keeping my hormonal acne in check without over drying my skin. I found that most of the time I really didn&#x27;t need to use an entire swipe, so I eventually cut them all in half and that was really a cost saver.</li>
            <li> Those little black pores that show up on my nose but never seem to disappear are finally gone! I love this stuff. They were expensive, but I cut the pads in half to save money since they are really saturated with the product. I use it three times a week and haven&#x27;t noticed any dryness. My face is a little itchy at night, but nothing some extra lotion can&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> This seems to work well so far. My only complaints are that its rather sticky after you put it on and the directions aren&#x27;t as clear as i would like. It isn&#x27;t clear if you&#x27;re  suppose to rinse it off after a certain amount of time. I have read other reviews on this type of product and they say to rinse after a specified amount of time. I leave it on for 30 min. to an hour, i figure better safe than sorry. I also rinse off because i don&#x27;t like the sticky residue it leaves. For the price, its worth it.</li>
            <li> These swipes worked great! They did tingle / slightly sting, but they left me with smoother, younger looking skin. I bought some for my daughter and they helped with her acne flare ups as well as enlarged pores. I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> This product is just ok. I believe you can find something better to spend money on. I like the line however</li>
            <li> I cannot find these anywhere in my shopping area.  They work well, price is much less than the more famous brand that goes for something like $80.</li>
            <li> Good product for an easy face refresher or cleaner.  Not too powerful for me, but my skin is fairly tolerant of strong products.  Will be easy to carry in the lightweight jar with twist on lid while traveling.</li>
            <li> recently ordered &amp; rec&#x27;d alpha hydrox swipes.  Have used this product previously; HOWEVER this was NOT SEALED.  All previous purchases of this product regardless of where I purchased have been sealed.  I am hesitant to use this on my face because of not having product seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE MY PREVIOUS REVIEW.  IN ALL FAIRNESS I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND HAVE ORDERED IT MANY TIMES BEFORE FROM ANOTHER VENDOR.  I HAD BEEN UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE PRODUCT HAD A SEAL ON THE CONTAINER. HOWEVER, I WAS TOTALLY WRONG.....IN PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT FROM ANOTHER VENDOR, THE ITEM WAS NOT SEALED.  THEREFORE, I WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE MY REVIEW OF THIS VENDOR.  THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS AWESOME...VERY FAST AND EFFICIENT.  IT WAS TOTALLY MY FAULT FOR BEING UNDER THE WRONG IMPRESSION.  THEREFORE, I RATE THIS VENDOR 4 THUMBS UP!!</li>
            <li> I use one side in AM and the other in PM, works great and fits in perfectly with my anti-aging skin routine!</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 more since my initial purchase ... I am black/Asian mix and my skin tends to be oily and acne prone. These wipes break up the oil and dry up the pimples exfoliate and help with hyper pigmentation .... I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using daily as they will dry your skin out and u absolutely must wear a good sunscreen ... aha make u very sensitive to the sun ...</li>
            <li> Love love love these. They are great. I purchased these swipes at a local Harmon and when I needed more I was told they no longer sell the swipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered them from Amazon. The little container looked open...and very old. I opened it. There was a piece of hair in it. And the pads (&amp;#34;swipes&amp;#34;) which are similar to oxy pads were VERY wet. Almost too wet. I am thinking this particular bottle was sitting at some beauty/hair shop...dried out....and the owner decided to put water in it and sell them online. At least take the hair out. Gross. RETURNED THEM. SO DISGUSTING.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working yet. I&#x27;ve used about 10 different times. I don&#x27;t use it everyday because it stings a little when I put it on.</li>
            <li> I really like these swipes and definitely see a noticeable difference in my skin after a a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I&#x27;ve had acne since I was a teenager, which has caused slight scarring and hyper pigmentation on my face. When I first started using this, my skin broke out slightly, but i continued to use it. After two weeks, my skin looks better than ever. My only gripe is that it does not come packed with more than 24 wipes. I&#x27;ve had to cut them in half to make them last longer. Otherwise, fantastic! Would recommended to anyone!</li>
            <li> Helps with my acne and fights fine lines. Smooths skin. Great price too!!!  Highly recommend these wipes and entire product line for anyone who wants to smooth their skin and fight fine lines :)</li>
            <li> I started using these about 6 months ago, and my life has been a nightmare since..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks I started noticing huge pores, and vertical scars all over my face - about 2-3 cm long and 1 cm wide, I can&#x27;t begin to describe the psychological damage this has done, and the impact it has made to my self esteem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never really had much of a skin problem to begin with, mostly black heads on my nose and some sun spots (which is why I used them on my entire face) and I would give anything to have the skin I had then back. I&#x27;ve been on many forums talking to others who have had similar damage, not only from AHA but from Retin-A and other chemicals as well, i&#x27;ve tried writing the company that makes these and asking them if there is anything they can suggest but they won&#x27;t reply to my email(s). I really do believe the damage this has done to my face is permanent and there is nothing I can do for it now - the best I can do is give you the warning I has I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is not exactly scar prone or sensitive either, like most i&#x27;ve suffered from acne but only had one small boxscar before this, please look into these types of products further before deciding to try them - it could very well be the best decision you will ever make, i&#x27;m only 26 and i&#x27;ve ruined my skin, it&#x27;s not too late to save yours.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Alpha Hydrox products. My skin looks better than it has in years. I took others advice and cut the swipes in half to make them last longer.</li>
            <li> I use these when I&#x27;m out and can not wash my face like normal.  It leaves a weird feeling (or maybe a film?) on my face.  The pads are exfoliating and can sometimes be sharp if I push too hard.  For an occasional-I&#x27;m-in-a-jam-and-need-something solution, these are fine, but I would not use them daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone with really sensitive skin, and this product works wonders! I&#x27;ve use dozens of skin lighteners and exfoliating scrubs to try and get ride of my acne scars. And these wipes are perfect! I have had any of the issues that many women have when using at home acid peels. The wipes have just the right amount of serum on them and do not dry out my skin. ( But I always rinse after 15 minutes and apply a heavy night cream afterwards.)</li>
            <li> This is a great way to keep your skin looking young. I actually leave it on for 10 minutes longer then they suggest and it turns out great. Just make sure that you use a toner afterwords and a good moisturizer. You will love the results!</li>
            <li> Makes your face look great after one use but 24 pads run out way too quick.. I wish there were more pads included like maybe 54 pads?</li>
            <li> I love these! However, beware that AHA doesn&#x27;t work immediately and can cause some breakouts in the being. You will need to use these for a couple of months before you get desired results.</li>
            <li> Really love all alpha hydrox products. I&#x27;ve tried everything at one time or another from drugstore brands to the most expensive from the dermatologist and these really work.</li>
            <li> This product is strong, but boy does it work.  Each of the pads is very saturated, and there&#x27;s only 24 in a tub, so I&#x27;ve been cutting them in half to use at a time.  There&#x27;s still plenty of liquid to go around.  Right away, my face is smoother.  It&#x27;s definitely reduced the appearance of sebaceous filaments, which is the reason I purchased it.  If your face is very sensitive, it can cause some redness, but you can wash it off after a few minutes if  you want.</li>
            <li> Great to weekly exfoliate scaly rough patches.  Since my skin is sensitive I only leave on for 15 minutes and then shower.  This has a high concentration (14%) of AHA compared to most products you can find.  After a few weeks of continuous use it gave similar results to a mild peel from dermatologist, but with much less irritation. Careful to use sunscreen while using this treatment.</li>
            <li> works great you can feel it working to get rid of dead skin on face and neck</li>
            <li> okay but I personally don&#x27;t care for the swipes as much as the soufflé for lotion.  But I do like Alpha Hydrox products!</li>
            <li> These are great face wipes.  I don&#x27;t use them every day because of the formula.  I use in combination with the Hydrox cleanser and have used for about 6-8 months now.  I think the overall tone of my skin has improved since using these.  Great also to exfoliate and remove additional makeup.  Just be careful for the decent amount of acid in these wipes if your skin is super sensitive.  I have super oily skin with minimal sensitivity.  Good product and I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> The pads are not very moist at all. One pad barely does my face. I generally need to use two so I can do my neck, arms, and face. The pads are kind of..well, very rough.</li>
            <li> this line of products is by far the best I have ever used.  I use the whole line and it takes about a month to six weeks to see a difference but let me tell you it works on the wrinkles and firming the skin on your face.  try using it on your hands also.  buy the soufflé to use with the wipes at night...wow it makes your skin look wonderful</li>
            <li> These are really great.  I feel like they are really minimizing my blackheads and preventing breakouts.  They are a little intense, similar to Stridex pads, but I feel like they work even better.  The price might seem a little high, but I think they are worth it if you really want to shrink your blackheads.  I cut them in half to make them last longer.</li>
            <li> Love love love this especially in combo with the night wrinkle cream in the tub. They don&#x27;t tell you it works wonders for cystic acne. I completely stopped retin a micro and not a cyst. I use the face wash as described followed by the moisturizing aha wrinkle cream and a swipe which I cut in half.  A life saver!!</li>
            <li> So I am african american and had so much acne and numerous numerous dark spots on my face. I puchased this product, the soap, and the 12% cream souffle in teh beginning of April. My acne is gone and 70% of the dark spots are gone. I use this prouduct at night every other day after washing my face. It is awesome. At first I thought 24 pads suck, which it does, but the product is so effective. I like how the pad have dimples that if you work in a circular motion, they will open your pores and deposit more product. If this product can get rid of my spots, it can get rid of anyone spots and tone your skin. Its amazing. I love this company&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;05/24/2013: So my face is about 92% clear. This product is amazing. If you have dark spots, clogged pores definitely definitely use this product. Its sooooo worth it. I will definitely purchase this again. During the month of May I actually used it twice a week, and it still worked. Remember dont over do it and use it every day, your face will be red. Trust me I know because I tried it during one week in April.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m closing in on 50 years old.  I have pretty good skin, take very good care of it.  Have occasional Botox (prefer Dysport lately tho - just seems a bit more effective, but Botox is definitely awesome as well) -  I get these injections maybe once or twice  a year max because they&#x27;re very costly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Anyway, love the AHA 14% swipes.  I can FEEL the product working, so I know it&#x27;s helping.  This, along with my DIY Vitamin C (on face, neck &amp; hands twice daily) and also the Alpha Hydrox AHA Souffle 12% are so helpful getting my skin to look a little more youthful and &amp;#34;glowy&amp;#34;.  I can&#x27;t use both Alpha Hydrox products twice daily yet - it&#x27;s pretty strong (but GREAT product!) especially the 24 count Swipes @ 14%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest working your way up to the 14% swipes.  Get your skin used to glycolic acid products first, and some other high-end, fairly strong products (they don&#x27;t have to be expensive - especially when you&#x27;re doing your homework using the Amazon reviews - tons of useful info here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these swipes.  To make them last longer, I use just one side per application, then place the swipe back in the jar, with the used side up.  This way I get twice the use and it works perfectly!  Excellent product(s)!</li>
            <li> item as described thanks</li>
            <li> Works really fast! After 2 uses I&#x27;m already seeing smoother, clearer skin. They were packaged well and the shipping was fast. I&#x27;m careful to use them at night, every other day, so I&#x27;m not having any reaction ... yet.</li>
            <li> I bought these based on a recommendation from a friend. When I began reading the reviews, I knew I would try them. I&#x27;ve only been using the swipes for a couple of weeks, only on my nose and chin. I already feel like my pores are becoming less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned in other reviews, the pads are fully saturated with solution, which totally makes it possible to use half a pad each time, which makes the jar last twice as long! Bonus!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to add this product to my skin care routine. I&#x27;ll try to remember to update when I&#x27;ve been using it longer, but I was so excited to already be seeing some results, I wanted to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have fairly sensitive skin. I was concerned that this product would dry out my skin. Not the case. I don&#x27;t see any difference in dryness at all, just less visible pores!</li>
            <li> This is okay. Doesn&#x27;t feel strong nor did I see any difference in my skin.  Didn&#x27;t have any negative reaction to it tho.</li>
            <li> The texture of my skin has improved.  I love this product.  I&#x27;ve suffered with acne for years. It does sting in the begining but its worth it! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Product left my skin very dry... Waist of money as I could not return items.</li>
            <li> It seems like I&#x27;ve always had a problem with acne and now aging skin on top of it.  I&#x27;ve used the 12% alpha hydrox cream product for about 10 years and it stopped being as effective on my skin the last few months.  I switched to the 14% swipes and voila, success. No breakouts and lots of compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ll skip the usual stuff about what AHA does for your skin since you can research that elsewhere or read any of the other reviews. The container is a nice plastic and compact. It seals well so that the wipes do not dry out. The wipes are a thick patterned cloth that hold the moisture. In fact, I reccommend cutting them in half so that they last twice as long. Half a wipe seems to be just the right amount for my face. If you have a cut or have just shaved (I&#x27;m a dude) they do sting a bit. I usually skip the wipe if I just shaved.</li>
            <li> Worked as well as expected. No miracles, but i did notice an improvement in skin tone and texture, especially pores.  Im 27 with moderate acne, large pores and acne scaring, and after repeated use saw refined pores, less breakouts.  I followed other reviewers advice and cut the pads in half- they were plenty to work with even in half.  Also worked really well for exfoliating pre and post wax- used at night over ingrown hairs and in the morning they came right out.</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this product, but I really do believe that it was the cause of my face breaking out where I had patches of bumps on different areas of my face. Maybe it was too strong or something because I do use their (i.e. Alpha Hydrox) 10% cream without any problems. I also didn&#x27;t like the fact that the company (Derm Store) made me pay for the shipping to return the product. I guess I am just not used to that when I order from Amazon.... All I can say is try at your own risk.</li>
            <li> The product works well.</li>
            <li> I love these pads. They are almost impossible to find. They do everything they are supposed to. My face has smaller pores,less oil,less acne and smoother skin. I also use it on the back of my hands and in the morning my hands look and feel smoother.</li>
            <li> This stuff clears up blackheads faster than you can say blackheads be gone!</li>
