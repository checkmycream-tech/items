            <li>If strong scents don&#x27;t bother you, this is a wonderful product that does what it advertises.</li>
            <li>A wonderful product, simply perfect for people with sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>My skin still feels good</li>

            <li>and the SPF is a good inclusion.  </li>
            <li>it keeps my skin in a good shape</li>
            <li>I was very happy with the quick shipping.</li>
            <li>and I found the scent to be very pleasant in a clean, unisex kind of way.  </li>
            <li>Love this face lotion!</li>
            <li>Love how it smells!</li>
            <li>Best for hot summer time...</li>
            <li>I will stick with Avalon Organics Lavender products because they are amazing.</li>
            <li>As my skin looked amazing, I didn&#x27;t care, but it is something to consider.  </li>
            <li>and I really liked it.</li>
            <li>This is a product I provided to my wife and she liked it a lot.  </li>
            <li>She tells me that one of the things she really liked about this lotion was the nice spring-like smell.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion, though, is practically perfect.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have fragrance sensitivity problems, I think it is probably quite a nice product.  </li>
            <li>I liked the feel of this product on my face and neck and did not find the scent overpowering</li>
            <li>While it did absorb nicely, and did not leave a greasy feel</li>
            <li>My skin felt nicely moisturized without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love it!</li>
            <li>She also noted that it wasn&#x27;t sticky and absorbed very nicely.  </li>
            <li>The chamomile fragrance is very light.  </li>
            <li>Super light and works great.</li>
            <li>The lotion has a lovely consistency, very smooth and creamy between my fingers.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is the best lotion for anyone with rosacea or red blotches.</li>
            <li>This has become my favorite moisturizer ever.</li>
            <li>Well, nothing&#x27;s going to do that, and most of those products contain chemicals that irritate my skin more than they soften it.</li>
            <li>The pump works flawlessly, delivering just enough in one squirt for my face, and in two squirts for face and neck.</li>
            <li>I put it on in the morning and it felt ok under makeup.</li>
            <li>Since I know that many people prefer that feel, for them this would be a five star product.  </li>
            <li>I was quite pleased with this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I started using this lotion very sceptically, but I am pleased to report that it did help a great deal with my skin&#x27;s dryness, redness, and itching.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s treated my skin better than any number of fancy department-store brands.</li>
            <li>It is an okay moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Love this face lotion.</li>
            <li>, it looked better, WITHOUT ANY eruptions.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I have allergies and rub at my nose a lot, causing red, itchy skin under my nose, and this is the best lotion I have ever used to make the itchiness go away without causing pimples.  </li>
            <li>So light and working well!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this Neutrogena lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>My pores clog pretty easily so if yours don&#x27;t this may be a great product.</li>
            <li>This Neutrogena lotion has a somewhat better consistency and seems to rub into my skin more easily and evenly.  </li>
            <li>This Neutrogena product has it all -- it softens, moistens, and, most important, soothes.</li>
            <li>I love the formula and the light fragrance.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion is a pleasant, light moisturizer for the face and neck.  </li>
            <li>It really is soothing, does not feel oily, and has a light, pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>What I love most is that it dries quickly</li>
            <li>OH ... and one last quick note ... it smells great!</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the SPF 15 protection for when I am out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;A great product for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found it easy to use every morning, no problem.  </li>
            <li>The lotion dispenses easily from the bottle via the pump.  </li>
            <li>The lotion spreads easily on your face.  </li>
            <li>It works without greasiness and is easy on skin that is prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too greasy, and it absorbs easily.</li>
            <li>An additional note: I have purchased this product from a legitimate retailer and it does not have a strong fragrance as indicated in a couple reviews.</li>
            <li>I put it on my hands, particularly on my knuckles, and my skin feels good.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the pump bottle; one pump is a good amount for the face, and it twists easily to lock it for packing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance was quite strong and I found it stings a bit on application.  </li>
            <li>I would have seen the fine print, if I had the box in my hand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t have to strong of a scent and moisturizes</li>
            <li>For the most part, I&#x27;m loyal to Neutrogena skin care products.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge reduction in redness, but this is also a genetic issue</li>
            <li>One thing you should know before purchasing is that it does have a light scent.  </li>
            <li>Still, this product did greatly improve my skin, so four stars overall for me.</li>
            <li>Plus, I got free 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li>When I checked the price (I received a test bottle for free)</li>
            <li>One thing I particularly liked about the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing lotion was that it did not cause blemishes because it does not contain fragrance.</li>
            <li>I pitched a fit and then gave it to my daughter.</li>
            <li>lotion feels heavier than the cream, but compared to others, leaves my face feeling light and fresh and moisturized!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, soothing, lasts a while, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, has a very light scent, hasn&#x27;t caused any acne flare-ups, and the SPF 15 is a great bonus.  </li>
            <li>I think the seller should pay for the return cost because the item is not as described and taking bottles out of the original packaging is an unsafe practice that Amazon should discourage.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any significant \\&quot;moisture barrier\\&quot; after a couple of weeks use.  </li>
            <li>For the record, while the fragrance seemed perfumy on first application, on closer inspection it smells more like it may containe eucalyptus oil.  </li>
            <li>For those that generally don&#x27;t have reactions this lotion would probably be a good option.  </li>
            <li>so I usually don&#x27;t like moisturizers, but this moisturizer is the best!</li>
            <li>It never causes me to breakout and makes my skin feel fresh and dewy!</li>
            <li>Made makeup more tolerable when applied first.</li>
            <li>I decided that it might just be my skin adjusting to a new moisturizer, but the truth is, if its a good product for your skin, you&#x27;ll know right away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, not greasy, and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Your face will feel clean, moisturized and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I believe I have found the right one for me!</li>
            <li>The SPF 15 protection is cool, but I wouldn&#x27;t use this as sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I really should have known better buying this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avobenzone absorbs the full spectrum of UVA rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Octinoxate absorbs UV-A and UV-B rays.</li>
            <li>However it is a good size bottle and will last a while.  </li>
            <li>Products from Neutrogena are typically excellent doing what they&#x27;re supposed to do with a minimal amount of fussy chemicals and additives - this facial lotion is no exception and quite adequate for most people&#x27;s day to day needs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since repurchased this multiple times because even though this lotion isn&#x27;t perfect, it has worked better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried for my needs.  </li>
            <li>It has a light, clean scent (almost Noxema-ish, but a much, much lighter version).  </li>
            <li>This is my new default product -- I love it.</li>
            <li>skin is often very sensitive to lotion, but I love the way this one feels.</li>
            <li>The lotion is just the right weight for me to use during the day this mild winter season.</li>
            <li>I tend to start sneezing when I&#x27;m around strong perfumes or strong scents in general and the scent of this lotion</li>
            <li>since I&#x27;ve read they provide more complete protection.</li>
            <li>After application it seems well absorbed without leaving a greasy residue or visible sheen.</li>
            <li>Tried to purchase again, and the price has gone up significantly (still much cheaper than retail) and still worth it.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena products figure pretty prominently in my ongoing search for just the right facial lotion -- the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion SPF 15 is the latest entry.  </li>
            <li>This size lasts a LONG time (6 months or more!)</li>
            <li>A less greasy and scent free version would be nice.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist is always getting on my case and telling me to use SPF 15 on my face every single day; with this product, I may actually be able to comply!  </li>
            <li>The label reads as though it is great for sensitive skin, not particularly!</li>
            <li>I am very suspicious of the contents and question if the bottles really contain the original product.  </li>
            <li>Biggest drawback is that I wish it were available in a higher SPF, my skin is very sensitive to sunlight and a higher SPF of 30 is recommended by my dermatologist, so I won&#x27;t be a repeat user.</li>
            <li>It seems the older I get, the more sensitive my skin gets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this lotion a dozen times and it&#x27;s worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>Smooth, soft, and moisturized, but without that gnarly cologne scent that after-shaves have.</li>
            <li>Get yourself a bottle of SPF 50 (and even higher) by Neutrogena</li>
            <li>I have drying, aging skin, so have tried most of the moisturizing products that claim to \\&quot;defy\\&quot; aging or turn back the clock.</li>
            <li>I had to immediately go wash my hands after testing the first application on the back of my hand because the fragrance was so overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>have yet to be able to actually use it on my face or neck, where it is intended to be used.  </li>
            <li>I used this on the back of my hand and not my face which I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>There needs to be more studies performed in order to gain definitive answers as to the safety of octinoxate, but I&#x27;d advise you to use caution, especially if you&#x27;re pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Regular sunscreen or most &amp;#34; sensitive&amp;#34</li>
            <li>With many lotions they cause my face to turn red</li>
            <li>Moreover, this lotion leaves your face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those looking for a gentle moisturizer, this is the one for you!</li>
            <li>I really need to stick to the right routine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the lightest moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used - you barely have to rub it into the skin, it absorbs so easily, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or scent.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena®&#x27;s Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion with SPF 15 is a very light moisturizer for daily use.</li>
            <li>This is a nice clean fresh product for dry skin, especially around the face.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this lotion smoothed right on with no irritation or redness, particularly rare for a product containing sunblock.  </li>
            <li>It also holds in plenty of moisture, which I&#x27;m experienced with since I constantly have to re-apply weaker moisturizers in these bitter Chicago winters.</li>
            <li>My skin feels like it can still breathe after applying and feels super soft!</li>
            <li>This lotion worked very well to not only block out sun damage, but seemed to keep the skin soft and nice when the winds blew on her face.  </li>
            <li>I usually have to apply 2-3 times a day in order to keep my skin soft and hydrated, but it is otherwise a great product.  </li>
            <li>And it certainly does the trick.</li>
            <li>I believe it said something likely mildly fragranced or something!</li>
            <li>I liked that it didn&#x27;t sting even a little, when I used it on sun-</li>
            <li>I like to use a light daily moisturizer with SPF under makeup, and I really like this lotion for that use.</li>
            <li>It has a lightly pleasant scent that is clean and citrusy, almost faintly like Lever 2000.</li>
            <li>The Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion is similar to the moisturizer in that it&#x27;s light, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy after you apply it.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll really be protected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin really hydrated and doesn&#x27;t cause any redness or breakouts.</li>
            <li>Really soothes the skin.</li>
            <li>I would not consider this ultra gentle.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel very hydrated when i use it.  </li>
            <li>It does soothe, but sometimes when I really need moisturizing this doesn&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
            <li>And some days after a really strenous workout this stings my pores too.  </li>
            <li>It really is quite gentle as well -</li>
            <li>; sunscreens irritate my face so much that I look</li>
            <li>I also use the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle face wash.  </li>
            <li>The price is also reasonable.</li>
            <li>I use this &amp;#34;Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing&amp;#34; after using my acne medication that drys my skin</li>
            <li>Neutrogena&#x27;s Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion with SPF 15 is a non-greasy, scentless moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This one didn&#x27;t, although I can&#x27;t really use it every day because of the scent and my allergies.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands; only a few have done a good job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again and would really suggest they try testing their products on the people they are marketing them for.</li>
            <li>one, the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion with SPF15 is a little thicker and doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin right away (probably because of the spf properties) but it has all been smoothed in it feels light and makes my skin feel super soft.  </li>
            <li>It really is gentle and not heavy on the skin, and seems to do exactly what it advertises to do.  </li>
            <li>This is a huge plus because who wants to wait around for her lotion to dry before she goes on with the rest of her beauty routine?  </li>
            <li>If you are someone who is sensitive to frangrance or chamomile, you will want to steer clear of this product, since it is mildly fragranced for some reason and contains chamomile, which is supposed to be soothing.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is very airy and light, yet left my skin feeling completely moisturized.</li>
            <li>I bought on a whim due to the extremely low price, and was very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I think it is pretty comparable to Olay Complete</li>
            <li>I took a week off of my normal moisturizer to try Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t forsee myself trying a new moisturizer any time soon if ever!</li>
            <li>Seems to be a good moisturizer which does not irritate the skin and apparently is free of artificial fragrances and dyes.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion absorbed so well and totally that I couldn&#x27;t tell I had it on.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that this still isn&#x27;t potent enough to use just once a day.  </li>
            <li>As background, I am middle aged, have fair, slightly oily skin and the winter here in New England has been pretty mild this year.  </li>
            <li>My previous facial moisturizer was the Clean &amp; Clear brand with salicylic acid and it was tingly and refreshing</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is good for daily application in someone who doesn&#x27;t require maximal moisturization, but it is probably not quite enough for someone who has very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Too bad, it&#x27;s the best one they&#x27;ve made that I can remember.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, I managed to get the normally $17 moisturizer for $5 with a bunch of coupons at CVS.</li>
            <li>First of all, the feel is somewhere between milky and creamy... not as heavy as a night cream nor as runny as some light daytime moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how something that should be so gentle makes my face hurt when it needs soothing the most.</li>
            <li>I normally use a Lubriderm lotion that also has an SPF 15 rating.  </li>
            <li>I really love using it for my everyday routine.</li>
            <li>The scent is a little strong, but not too bothersome because it fades fast.</li>
            <li>It delivers refreshing moisture to dry faces, whether they are wind burned, from the sun, or just from daily life.</li>
            <li>I am very fragrance sensitive and have sensitive skin as well, so I am usually very careful about reading the fine print on lotions before I order them.  </li>
            <li>a gentle hypoallergenic fragrance uniquely developed for sensitive skin.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you are one that struggles with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>First off, I have rosacea, second</li>
            <li>The only thing that keeps me from giving this product a higher rating is that it has a barely noticeable perfume-y scent that I don&#x27;t really like.</li>
            <li>The main drawback I see is that I really like some antioxidants vitamins (like C and E) in my facial moisturizer</li>
            <li>During this time this product has proven to be perfectly serviceable to a 30-something male and I appreciated the ease of application, the Non-Comedogenic properties, the SPF 15 protection and the fact that it kept my skin moisturized even during some cold, dry Winter days.  </li>
            <li>These products are hard to find in my area and the Amazon price seems comparable to what I paid when I was able to find it in the store.  </li>
            <li>As much as any other mild facial lotion, I suppose, but chamomile and scent might make it not so soothing for some people.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and when it comes to moisturizer and sunscreen I go with Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soothing on my skin, but of course that doesn&#x27;t guarantee how it works on all sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I guess it just depends on how sensitive your skin is.</li>
            <li>It disappears into my skin, leaving it glowing but far from greasy.</li>
            <li>I have very slightly sensitive skin and did not notice any irritation.</li>
            <li>I assume I wanted to try the Neutrogena sensitive lotion because I had been traveling and read a lot of magazines that had the ad for it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used products that aren&#x27;t made for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>B000052YOX Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, Sensitive Skin, 4 Ounce]].</li>
            <li>At any rate, if you&#x27;re a male and do not want to use a cosmetic with a very feminine scent, you won&#x27;t want to use this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month now and have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li>but I keep coming back to this because it is so gentle and soothing on my skin.</li>
            <li>This did not help my sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have an extremely sensitive face.</li>
            <li>My skin is SO SENSITIVE  to lotions &amp; creams,</li>
            <li>THIS LOTION moisturized &amp; made my skin feel soft</li>
            <li>Whenever there&#x27;s a scent to a face lotion I get nervous that it&#x27;s going to cause irritation to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have a combination of oily and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product is really the opposite of \\&quot;soothing.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The two bottles arrived in a padded envelope without the original boxes and the tops were covered with 2\\&quot; funky green tape.  </li>
            <li>Works to calm down my sensitive skin and redness while protecting me from the sun with SPF 15.</li>
            <li>and post-natal rats exposed to a high dosage had lowered testosterone levels and smaller testes and prostates.</li>
            <li>This is a rather light skin lotion: it isn&#x27;t a heavy duty facial moisturizer, but it seems to do the trick.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin or are sensitive to fragrances then I would recommend you look for something different.</li>
            <li>, I have a lot of red blotchy areas, plus until I can rid of the acne completely, I doubt I&#x27;ll be redness-free!</li>
            <li>I have tried several other brands and believe Neutrogena is the right one for</li>
            <li>I wish this product was available locally as it was in the past.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s barely noticeable in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like my face to be scented, and especially not my face lotion, since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am approaching 30 years old.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin on my face, particularly in the winter, so I use a daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Sadly, however, the Neutrogena lotion has a very strong floral fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It also helped clear my skin up a bit because I am so sensitive to other things.  </li>
            <li>But I do like soft, moist skin rather than crackly, dry skin, so I keep trying.</li>
            <li>otherwise one mistake could cause me days of dry, insanely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne prone, AND dry skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on previous experience with the Olay products I have used for years (which carry most of the same claims) I made the bad leap in logic of assuming that a product with these claims would also be fragrance free.  </li>

            <li> If strong scents don&#x27;t bother you, this is a wonderful product that does what it advertises.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product, simply perfect for people with sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> My skin still feels good</li>
            <li> It has a good creamy feel and applies well.</li>
            <li> and the SPF is a good inclusion.  </li>
            <li> it keeps my skin in a good shape</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the quick shipping.</li>
            <li> and I found the scent to be very pleasant in a clean, unisex kind of way.  </li>
            <li> Love this face lotion!</li>
            <li> Love how it smells!</li>
            <li> Best for hot summer time...</li>
            <li> I will stick with Avalon Organics Lavender products because they are amazing.</li>
            <li> As my skin looked amazing, I didn&#x27;t care, but it is something to consider.  </li>
            <li> and I really liked it.</li>
            <li> This is a product I provided to my wife and she liked it a lot.  </li>
            <li> She tells me that one of the things she really liked about this lotion was the nice spring-like smell.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion, though, is practically perfect.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have fragrance sensitivity problems, I think it is probably quite a nice product.  </li>
            <li> I liked the feel of this product on my face and neck and did not find the scent overpowering</li>
            <li> While it did absorb nicely, and did not leave a greasy feel</li>
            <li> My skin felt nicely moisturized without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love it!</li>
            <li> She also noted that it wasn&#x27;t sticky and absorbed very nicely.  </li>
            <li> The chamomile fragrance is very light.  </li>
            <li> Super light and works great.</li>
            <li> The lotion has a lovely consistency, very smooth and creamy between my fingers.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is the best lotion for anyone with rosacea or red blotches.</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite moisturizer ever.</li>
            <li> Well, nothing&#x27;s going to do that, and most of those products contain chemicals that irritate my skin more than they soften it.</li>
            <li> The pump works flawlessly, delivering just enough in one squirt for my face, and in two squirts for face and neck.</li>
            <li> I put it on in the morning and it felt ok under makeup.</li>
            <li> Since I know that many people prefer that feel, for them this would be a five star product.  </li>
            <li> I was quite pleased with this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I started using this lotion very sceptically, but I am pleased to report that it did help a great deal with my skin&#x27;s dryness, redness, and itching.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s treated my skin better than any number of fancy department-store brands.</li>
            <li> It is an okay moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Love this face lotion.</li>
            <li> , it looked better, WITHOUT ANY eruptions.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I have allergies and rub at my nose a lot, causing red, itchy skin under my nose, and this is the best lotion I have ever used to make the itchiness go away without causing pimples.  </li>
            <li> So light and working well!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this Neutrogena lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> My pores clog pretty easily so if yours don&#x27;t this may be a great product.</li>
            <li> This Neutrogena lotion has a somewhat better consistency and seems to rub into my skin more easily and evenly.  </li>
            <li> This Neutrogena product has it all -- it softens, moistens, and, most important, soothes.</li>
            <li> I love the formula and the light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion is a pleasant, light moisturizer for the face and neck.  </li>
            <li> It really is soothing, does not feel oily, and has a light, pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> What I love most is that it dries quickly</li>
            <li> OH ... and one last quick note ... it smells great!</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the SPF 15 protection for when I am out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;A great product for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found it easy to use every morning, no problem.  </li>
            <li> The lotion dispenses easily from the bottle via the pump.  </li>
            <li> The lotion spreads easily on your face.  </li>
            <li> It works without greasiness and is easy on skin that is prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too greasy, and it absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> An additional note: I have purchased this product from a legitimate retailer and it does not have a strong fragrance as indicated in a couple reviews.</li>
            <li> I put it on my hands, particularly on my knuckles, and my skin feels good.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the pump bottle; one pump is a good amount for the face, and it twists easily to lock it for packing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance was quite strong and I found it stings a bit on application.  </li>
            <li> I would have seen the fine print, if I had the box in my hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t have to strong of a scent and moisturizes</li>
            <li> For the most part, I&#x27;m loyal to Neutrogena skin care products.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge reduction in redness, but this is also a genetic issue</li>
            <li> One thing you should know before purchasing is that it does have a light scent.  </li>
            <li> Still, this product did greatly improve my skin, so four stars overall for me.</li>
            <li> Plus, I got free 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li> When I checked the price (I received a test bottle for free)</li>
            <li> One thing I particularly liked about the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing lotion was that it did not cause blemishes because it does not contain fragrance.</li>
            <li> I pitched a fit and then gave it to my daughter.</li>
            <li> lotion feels heavier than the cream, but compared to others, leaves my face feeling light and fresh and moisturized!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, soothing, lasts a while, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, has a very light scent, hasn&#x27;t caused any acne flare-ups, and the SPF 15 is a great bonus.  </li>
            <li> I think the seller should pay for the return cost because the item is not as described and taking bottles out of the original packaging is an unsafe practice that Amazon should discourage.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any significant \\&quot;moisture barrier\\&quot; after a couple of weeks use.  </li>
            <li> For the record, while the fragrance seemed perfumy on first application, on closer inspection it smells more like it may containe eucalyptus oil.  </li>
            <li> For those that generally don&#x27;t have reactions this lotion would probably be a good option.  </li>
            <li> so I usually don&#x27;t like moisturizers, but this moisturizer is the best!</li>
            <li> It never causes me to breakout and makes my skin feel fresh and dewy!</li>
            <li> Made makeup more tolerable when applied first.</li>
            <li> I decided that it might just be my skin adjusting to a new moisturizer, but the truth is, if its a good product for your skin, you&#x27;ll know right away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, not greasy, and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> Your face will feel clean, moisturized and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I believe I have found the right one for me!</li>
            <li> The SPF 15 protection is cool, but I wouldn&#x27;t use this as sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I really should have known better buying this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avobenzone absorbs the full spectrum of UVA rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Octinoxate absorbs UV-A and UV-B rays.</li>
            <li> However it is a good size bottle and will last a while.  </li>
            <li> Products from Neutrogena are typically excellent doing what they&#x27;re supposed to do with a minimal amount of fussy chemicals and additives - this facial lotion is no exception and quite adequate for most people&#x27;s day to day needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since repurchased this multiple times because even though this lotion isn&#x27;t perfect, it has worked better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried for my needs.  </li>
            <li> It has a light, clean scent (almost Noxema-ish, but a much, much lighter version).  </li>
            <li> This is my new default product -- I love it.</li>
            <li> skin is often very sensitive to lotion, but I love the way this one feels.</li>
            <li> The lotion is just the right weight for me to use during the day this mild winter season.</li>
            <li> I tend to start sneezing when I&#x27;m around strong perfumes or strong scents in general and the scent of this lotion</li>
            <li> since I&#x27;ve read they provide more complete protection.</li>
            <li> After application it seems well absorbed without leaving a greasy residue or visible sheen.</li>
            <li> Tried to purchase again, and the price has gone up significantly (still much cheaper than retail) and still worth it.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena products figure pretty prominently in my ongoing search for just the right facial lotion -- the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion SPF 15 is the latest entry.  </li>
            <li> This size lasts a LONG time (6 months or more!)</li>
            <li> A less greasy and scent free version would be nice.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist is always getting on my case and telling me to use SPF 15 on my face every single day; with this product, I may actually be able to comply!  </li>
            <li> The label reads as though it is great for sensitive skin, not particularly!</li>
            <li> I am very suspicious of the contents and question if the bottles really contain the original product.  </li>
            <li> Biggest drawback is that I wish it were available in a higher SPF, my skin is very sensitive to sunlight and a higher SPF of 30 is recommended by my dermatologist, so I won&#x27;t be a repeat user.</li>
            <li> It seems the older I get, the more sensitive my skin gets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion a dozen times and it&#x27;s worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> Smooth, soft, and moisturized, but without that gnarly cologne scent that after-shaves have.</li>
            <li> Get yourself a bottle of SPF 50 (and even higher) by Neutrogena</li>
            <li> I have drying, aging skin, so have tried most of the moisturizing products that claim to \\&quot;defy\\&quot; aging or turn back the clock.</li>
            <li> I had to immediately go wash my hands after testing the first application on the back of my hand because the fragrance was so overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> have yet to be able to actually use it on my face or neck, where it is intended to be used.  </li>
            <li> I used this on the back of my hand and not my face which I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> There needs to be more studies performed in order to gain definitive answers as to the safety of octinoxate, but I&#x27;d advise you to use caution, especially if you&#x27;re pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Regular sunscreen or most &amp;#34; sensitive&amp;#34</li>
            <li> With many lotions they cause my face to turn red</li>
            <li> Moreover, this lotion leaves your face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those looking for a gentle moisturizer, this is the one for you!</li>
            <li> I really need to stick to the right routine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the lightest moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used - you barely have to rub it into the skin, it absorbs so easily, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or scent.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena®&#x27;s Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion with SPF 15 is a very light moisturizer for daily use.</li>
            <li> This is a nice clean fresh product for dry skin, especially around the face.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this lotion smoothed right on with no irritation or redness, particularly rare for a product containing sunblock.  </li>
            <li> It also holds in plenty of moisture, which I&#x27;m experienced with since I constantly have to re-apply weaker moisturizers in these bitter Chicago winters.</li>
            <li> My skin feels like it can still breathe after applying and feels super soft!</li>
            <li> This lotion worked very well to not only block out sun damage, but seemed to keep the skin soft and nice when the winds blew on her face.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to apply 2-3 times a day in order to keep my skin soft and hydrated, but it is otherwise a great product.  </li>
            <li> And it certainly does the trick.</li>
            <li> I believe it said something likely mildly fragranced or something!</li>
            <li> I liked that it didn&#x27;t sting even a little, when I used it on sun-</li>
            <li> I like to use a light daily moisturizer with SPF under makeup, and I really like this lotion for that use.</li>
            <li> It has a lightly pleasant scent that is clean and citrusy, almost faintly like Lever 2000.</li>
            <li> The Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion is similar to the moisturizer in that it&#x27;s light, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy after you apply it.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll really be protected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin really hydrated and doesn&#x27;t cause any redness or breakouts.</li>
            <li> Really soothes the skin.</li>
            <li> I would not consider this ultra gentle.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel very hydrated when i use it.  </li>
            <li> It does soothe, but sometimes when I really need moisturizing this doesn&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
            <li> And some days after a really strenous workout this stings my pores too.  </li>
            <li> It really is quite gentle as well -</li>
            <li> ; sunscreens irritate my face so much that I look</li>
            <li> I also use the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle face wash.  </li>
            <li> The price is also reasonable.</li>
            <li> I use this &amp;#34;Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing&amp;#34; after using my acne medication that drys my skin</li>
            <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion with SPF 15 is a non-greasy, scentless moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t, although I can&#x27;t really use it every day because of the scent and my allergies.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands; only a few have done a good job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again and would really suggest they try testing their products on the people they are marketing them for.</li>
            <li> one, the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion with SPF15 is a little thicker and doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin right away (probably because of the spf properties) but it has all been smoothed in it feels light and makes my skin feel super soft.  </li>
            <li> It really is gentle and not heavy on the skin, and seems to do exactly what it advertises to do.  </li>
            <li> This is a huge plus because who wants to wait around for her lotion to dry before she goes on with the rest of her beauty routine?  </li>
            <li> If you are someone who is sensitive to frangrance or chamomile, you will want to steer clear of this product, since it is mildly fragranced for some reason and contains chamomile, which is supposed to be soothing.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is very airy and light, yet left my skin feeling completely moisturized.</li>
            <li> I bought on a whim due to the extremely low price, and was very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I think it is pretty comparable to Olay Complete</li>
            <li> I took a week off of my normal moisturizer to try Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t forsee myself trying a new moisturizer any time soon if ever!</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good moisturizer which does not irritate the skin and apparently is free of artificial fragrances and dyes.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion absorbed so well and totally that I couldn&#x27;t tell I had it on.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that this still isn&#x27;t potent enough to use just once a day.  </li>
            <li> As background, I am middle aged, have fair, slightly oily skin and the winter here in New England has been pretty mild this year.  </li>
            <li> My previous facial moisturizer was the Clean &amp; Clear brand with salicylic acid and it was tingly and refreshing</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is good for daily application in someone who doesn&#x27;t require maximal moisturization, but it is probably not quite enough for someone who has very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, it&#x27;s the best one they&#x27;ve made that I can remember.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I managed to get the normally $17 moisturizer for $5 with a bunch of coupons at CVS.</li>
            <li> First of all, the feel is somewhere between milky and creamy... not as heavy as a night cream nor as runny as some light daytime moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how something that should be so gentle makes my face hurt when it needs soothing the most.</li>
            <li> I normally use a Lubriderm lotion that also has an SPF 15 rating.  </li>
            <li> I really love using it for my everyday routine.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little strong, but not too bothersome because it fades fast.</li>
            <li> It delivers refreshing moisture to dry faces, whether they are wind burned, from the sun, or just from daily life.</li>
            <li> I am very fragrance sensitive and have sensitive skin as well, so I am usually very careful about reading the fine print on lotions before I order them.  </li>
            <li> a gentle hypoallergenic fragrance uniquely developed for sensitive skin.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you are one that struggles with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> First off, I have rosacea, second</li>
            <li> The only thing that keeps me from giving this product a higher rating is that it has a barely noticeable perfume-y scent that I don&#x27;t really like.</li>
            <li> The main drawback I see is that I really like some antioxidants vitamins (like C and E) in my facial moisturizer</li>
            <li> During this time this product has proven to be perfectly serviceable to a 30-something male and I appreciated the ease of application, the Non-Comedogenic properties, the SPF 15 protection and the fact that it kept my skin moisturized even during some cold, dry Winter days.  </li>
            <li> These products are hard to find in my area and the Amazon price seems comparable to what I paid when I was able to find it in the store.  </li>
            <li> As much as any other mild facial lotion, I suppose, but chamomile and scent might make it not so soothing for some people.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and when it comes to moisturizer and sunscreen I go with Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soothing on my skin, but of course that doesn&#x27;t guarantee how it works on all sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I guess it just depends on how sensitive your skin is.</li>
            <li> It disappears into my skin, leaving it glowing but far from greasy.</li>
            <li> I have very slightly sensitive skin and did not notice any irritation.</li>
            <li> I assume I wanted to try the Neutrogena sensitive lotion because I had been traveling and read a lot of magazines that had the ad for it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used products that aren&#x27;t made for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> B000052YOX Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, Sensitive Skin, 4 Ounce]].</li>
            <li> At any rate, if you&#x27;re a male and do not want to use a cosmetic with a very feminine scent, you won&#x27;t want to use this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month now and have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> but I keep coming back to this because it is so gentle and soothing on my skin.</li>
            <li> This did not help my sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely sensitive face.</li>
            <li> My skin is SO SENSITIVE  to lotions &amp; creams,</li>
            <li> THIS LOTION moisturized &amp; made my skin feel soft</li>
            <li> Whenever there&#x27;s a scent to a face lotion I get nervous that it&#x27;s going to cause irritation to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have a combination of oily and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product is really the opposite of \\&quot;soothing.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The two bottles arrived in a padded envelope without the original boxes and the tops were covered with 2\\&quot; funky green tape.  </li>
            <li> Works to calm down my sensitive skin and redness while protecting me from the sun with SPF 15.</li>
            <li> and post-natal rats exposed to a high dosage had lowered testosterone levels and smaller testes and prostates.</li>
            <li> This is a rather light skin lotion: it isn&#x27;t a heavy duty facial moisturizer, but it seems to do the trick.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin or are sensitive to fragrances then I would recommend you look for something different.</li>
            <li> , I have a lot of red blotchy areas, plus until I can rid of the acne completely, I doubt I&#x27;ll be redness-free!</li>
            <li> I have tried several other brands and believe Neutrogena is the right one for</li>
            <li> I wish this product was available locally as it was in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s barely noticeable in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like my face to be scented, and especially not my face lotion, since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am approaching 30 years old.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin on my face, particularly in the winter, so I use a daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, however, the Neutrogena lotion has a very strong floral fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It also helped clear my skin up a bit because I am so sensitive to other things.  </li>
            <li> But I do like soft, moist skin rather than crackly, dry skin, so I keep trying.</li>
            <li> otherwise one mistake could cause me days of dry, insanely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne prone, AND dry skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on previous experience with the Olay products I have used for years (which carry most of the same claims) I made the bad leap in logic of assuming that a product with these claims would also be fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I got caught up in all the pretty advertising and only positive reviews online.</li>
            <li> Given its low viscosity, small amounts can cover a large area.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting some on my arms especially every morning for the past couple of weeks, and my skin feels so much</li>
            <li> For the past 10 days I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena&#x27;s Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion as my daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> And because of the acne, I use topical medicines that dry my skin even further.  </li>
            <li> winter my skin gets dry, especially on my hands.</li>
            <li> Immediately my skin was truly less sensitive and softer.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a face lotion, but my teen age son uses to combat dry skin on his arms and legs.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Facial Cleanser, Pink Grapefruit, 6 Ounce]] religiously,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit unclear as to whether it&#x27;s supposed to reduce redness from various causes, or simply not cause redness from irritation as other lotions might.</li>
            <li> Even after several hours working outside my skin no longer has that dry feeling and any windburn seems to be minimal.</li>
            <li> Of note, a study on lab animals suggests that octinoxate might have undesired effects, such as estrogenic properties and effects on other hormones, such as thyroid hormone.</li>
            <li> Sometimes a cold wind can have a more damaging effect on her skin than the sun.  </li>
            <li> It felt like the lotion never fully absorbed, leaving behind an oily residue.</li>
            <li> I have sebborheic dermatitis on my forehead in the wintertime and dry, sensitive skin all year round</li>
            <li> Helped lessen facial irritation due to eczema.</li>
            <li> Living in Colorado, where the air is always incredibly dry, my dry skin has always been even dryer.  </li>
            <li> (my hands stay dry and cracked in the winter)</li>
            <li> This lotion made my skin really dry.</li>
            <li> that even when my skin is REALLY DRY, I KNOW I will &amp;</li>
            <li> What would keep someone from refilling empty bottles from an expensive product with something cheaper and selling it as the original?  </li>
            <li> Last year I had problems in the windy weather and the winter weather with my skin feeling dry and tight.</li>
            <li> My face is very dry</li>
            <li> Then a couple hours later my skin started to feel really tight, and got tighter as the day went on.</li>
            <li> I think one can always trust Neutogena products to be careful to one&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> My skin was just as dry as usual daily after working out or after washing.  </li>
            <li> Where we live has some very harsh winters with the sun beating off the snow and heavy winds blowing across the fields.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am chemically sensitive when is comes to artificial fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This is really not a good product for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;m through shaving, I lotion up, including on my neck, and I never notice any irritation other than the razor burn I can never seem to avoid.</li>
            <li> and they usually don&#x27;t make my forehead red.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not at the point where I need help with aging, just looking to balance and protect and hopefully help with the redness due to the acne and sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars, only because I&#x27;m not sure if it fully reduces redness.</li>
            <li> We live Colorado and winter is tough on his skin.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of problems with redness and itching of my skin, and very few things seem to actually help like they promise they will.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are the three active ingredients listed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Octisalate is a UVB absorber and an emollient.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that with the SPF 15 rating, I feel like I&#x27;m wasting it if I use it in the evening.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the scent.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product is very misleading.</li>
            <li> I get both types ... the quick to head plus the deep hard painful ones.</li>
            <li> It was not very strong or overpowering, but</li>
            <li> I would describe the scent as a typical sunscreen scent.  </li>
            <li> It also has a slightly floral scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My one slight complaint might be staying power--I prefer a moisturizer that leaves my skin feeling hydrated for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I did a quick search on the active ingredients, and was a bit disappointed to find out that one of the ingredients might be harmful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s maybe just a little creamier.</li>
            <li> I mix a dollop of it with a little liquid foundation in the palm of my hand and apply it to my face with a makeup sponge.  </li>
            <li> I was a little surprised at how expensive it is.</li>
            <li> And the lotion is not at all heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> and I started breaking out a few days after using it.</li>
            <li> makes me sneeze for a few minutes after I put it on.  </li>
            <li> If you are the type who can&#x27;t handle going into dried flower or candle shops, you will probably be bothered by this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have tried a few of Neutrogena&#x27;s moisturizers, but found others to be heavy and thick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s a bit of a scent, which I usually avoid in products if I can, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the alcohol or sunscreen</li>
            <li> (I was too lazy to send it</li>
            <li> If you read the small print on the side of the box, there is fragrance in it.</li>
            <li> Whenever I&#x27;m done shaving, my face is usually dry and sticky (weird combination), so applying the lotion afterwards has made a difference.</li>
            <li> This is disappointing to me, not only because the lotion is now unusable to me but because I am not able to write as thorough a review as I would like.  </li>
            <li> I was in a parade and got a little bit or wind burn, this lotion stung like crazy on my face.  </li>
            <li> This was not a good product for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed the production of oil has reduced and the dry painful areas are gone!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my acne has actually decreased since I&#x27;ve been using it</li>
            <li> It makes for a frustrating combination because I need something that won&#x27;t cause breakouts or irritation, but that will also keep me sufficiently moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Greasy and irritating, it went in the trash.</li>
            <li> The smell is irritating, it made my sinuses go haywire...</li>
            <li> I have insane sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Silly of me</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it also clogged my pores</li>
            <li> I will give mine away to a friend since I am unable to use it.iend since I am unable to use it.</li>
            <li> And I usually use Neutrogrena moisturizer as well, though I use this one: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad that I can&#x27;t buy it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> When I received the lotion in the mail, I was disappointed to notice that the lotion has solidified and won&#x27;t come out of the pump.</li>
            <li> I put this lotion on and it burned like crazy!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using a lot of lotion, though, because I hate feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I also generally hate the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> When I received the lotion in the mail, I was disappointed to notice that the lotion has solidified and won&#x27;t come out of the pump.</li>
            <li> The two bottles arrived in a padded envelope without the original boxes and the tops were covered with 2\\&quot; funky green tape.  I am very suspicious of the contents and question if the bottles really contain the original product.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy bottles in the store in this condition, and I definitely won&#x27;t use the contents of these 2 bottles.  The seller is saying I need to pay for return shipping.  I think the seller should pay for the return cost because the item is not as described and taking bottles out of the original packaging is an unsafe practice that Amazon should discourage.  What would keep someone from refilling empty bottles from an expensive product with something cheaper and selling it as the original?  An additional note: I have purchased this product from a legitimate retailer and it does not have a strong fragrance as indicated in a couple reviews.</li>
            <li> Love this face lotion!</li>
            <li> This product has been discontinued by Neutrogena- Dealster is selling bottles with no expiration date on the bottom-  you do not know if you are using a bottle years out of date for your sun protection. I am sending my 3 back. I reported this to Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> My previous facial moisturizer was the Clean &amp; Clear brand with salicylic acid and it was tingly and refreshing and I really liked it. It also didn&#x27;t have any SPF protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one, the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion with SPF15 is a little thicker and doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin right away (probably because of the spf properties) but it has all been smoothed in it feels light and makes my skin feel super soft.  I don&#x27;t remember seeing if it had any acne fighting properties but my acne has actually decreased since I&#x27;ve been using it so whatever is in it has been working wonderfully. I&#x27;m really happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This is a product I provided to my wife and she liked it a lot.  She tells me that one of the things she really liked about this lotion was the nice spring-like smell.  She also noted that it wasn&#x27;t sticky and absorbed very nicely.  Where we live has some very harsh winters with the sun beating off the snow and heavy winds blowing across the fields.  This lotion worked very well to not only block out sun damage, but seemed to keep the skin soft and nice when the winds blew on her face.  Sometimes a cold wind can have a more damaging effect on her skin than the sun.  I was impressed with this product and my wife really liked it.... so, as they say, if mama is happy... daddy is happy,and this lotion made us both happy.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and when it comes to moisturizer and sunscreen I go with Neutrogena. Every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In winter my skin gets dry, especially on my hands. I&#x27;ve used this lotion a dozen times and it&#x27;s worked pretty well. I put it on my hands, particularly on my knuckles, and my skin feels good. I don&#x27;t have any further analysis than that. For my face, I&#x27;ve actually used the lotion as an after-shave. Whenever I&#x27;m done shaving, my face is usually dry and sticky (weird combination), so applying the lotion afterwards has made a difference. Smooth, soft, and moisturized, but without that gnarly cologne scent that after-shaves have. Once I&#x27;m through shaving, I lotion up, including on my neck, and I never notice any irritation other than the razor burn I can never seem to avoid. My skin still feels good though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a bit of a scent, which I usually avoid in products if I can, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming. It&#x27;s barely noticeable in my opinion. The SPF 15 protection is cool, but I wouldn&#x27;t use this as sunscreen. Get yourself a bottle of SPF 50 (and even higher) by Neutrogena and you&#x27;ll really be protected.</li>
            <li> I wish this product was available locally as it was in the past. This lotion is the best lotion for anyone with rosacea or red blotches. It evens out my skin tone everytime. I will never be without this product and pray that Neutrogena does not change it.</li>
            <li> Living in Colorado, where the air is always incredibly dry, my dry skin has always been even dryer.  I don&#x27;t like using a lot of lotion, though, because I hate feeling greasy. I also generally hate the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion, though, is practically perfect. The scent is light and fresh.  And the lotion is not at all heavy or greasy.  I&#x27;ve been putting some on my arms especially every morning for the past couple of weeks, and my skin feels so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that with the SPF 15 rating, I feel like I&#x27;m wasting it if I use it in the evening.  Silly of me, I know.</li>
            <li> I like to use a light daily moisturizer with SPF under makeup, and I really like this lotion for that use. It moisturizes my combination skin well without being oily or greasy. It has a good creamy feel and applies well. I particularly like the pump bottle; one pump is a good amount for the face, and it twists easily to lock it for packing. I can only trust that it actually has the UVA/UVB protection specified.  I&#x27;m a bit unclear as to whether it&#x27;s supposed to reduce redness from various causes, or simply not cause redness from irritation as other lotions might. I did have a bit of redness this winter and I believe switching to this lotion has diminished that. It&#x27;s soothing on my skin, but of course that doesn&#x27;t guarantee how it works on all sensitive skin.  The main drawback I see is that I really like some antioxidants vitamins (like C and E) in my facial moisturizer since I&#x27;ve read they provide more complete protection. I can&#x27;t see any indication that this one contains any, so for that reason (and also influenced by price) I will likely return to the similar product I was using before.</li>
            <li> My pores clog pretty easily so if yours don&#x27;t this may be a great product. It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t have to strong of a scent and moisturizes well but unfortunately it also clogged my pores and I started breaking out a few days after using it. If that hadn&#x27;t of happened then I would happily recommend the product. I guess it just depends on how sensitive your skin is.</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite moisturizer ever. I have drying, aging skin, so have tried most of the moisturizing products that claim to \\&quot;defy\\&quot; aging or turn back the clock. Well, nothing&#x27;s going to do that, and most of those products contain chemicals that irritate my skin more than they soften it. But I do like soft, moist skin rather than crackly, dry skin, so I keep trying. This Neutrogena product has it all -- it softens, moistens, and, most important, soothes. The redness and irritation I used to have as a given on my skin has disappeared since I started using this product. The pump works flawlessly, delivering just enough in one squirt for my face, and in two squirts for face and neck. It disappears into my skin, leaving it glowing but far from greasy. This is my new default product -- I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about moisturizers.  Most of them are too perfumey, too greasy, too expensive, and aggravate my acne.  This product from Neutrogena is one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve found.  It&#x27;s light, soothing, lasts a while, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, has a very light scent, hasn&#x27;t caused any acne flare-ups, and the SPF 15 is a great bonus.  My dermatologist is always getting on my case and telling me to use SPF 15 on my face every single day; with this product, I may actually be able to comply!  Also, I&#x27;m a guy and I found the scent to be very pleasant in a clean, unisex kind of way.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion.  It&#x27;s light, not greasy, and absorbs quickly.  I liked that it didn&#x27;t sting even a little, when I used it on sun- and wind-exposed skin after a day of skiing.  It has a light, clean scent (almost Noxema-ish, but a much, much lighter version).  I think it is pretty comparable to Olay Complete All Day Moisturizer, which I&#x27;ve used for years.  It&#x27;s maybe just a little creamier.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena®&#x27;s Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion with SPF 15 is a very light moisturizer for daily use. The lotion is very airy and light, yet left my skin feeling completely moisturized. The chamomile fragrance is very light.  I didn&#x27;t notice any significant \\&quot;moisture barrier\\&quot; after a couple of weeks use.  My skin was just as dry as usual daily after working out or after washing.  I have very slightly sensitive skin and did not notice any irritation. Biggest drawback is that I wish it were available in a higher SPF, my skin is very sensitive to sunlight and a higher SPF of 30 is recommended by my dermatologist, so I won&#x27;t be a repeat user.</li>
            <li> This lotion works great.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my hands every evening (my hands stay dry and cracked in the winter) and I can definitely tell a difference.  My only complaint is the scent.  It&#x27;s a bit too strong for me.  I tend to start sneezing when I&#x27;m around strong perfumes or strong scents in general and the scent of this lotion makes me sneeze for a few minutes after I put it on.  If strong scents don&#x27;t bother you, this is a wonderful product that does what it advertises.</li>
            <li> I am very fragrance sensitive and have sensitive skin as well, so I am usually very careful about reading the fine print on lotions before I order them.  The wording on this lotion had me fooled...but it&#x27;s still my fault that I assumed something that I didn&#x27;t see.  Here are the claims on the packaging:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultra gentle&lt;br /&gt;Dermatologist recommended&lt;br /&gt;Allergy tested&lt;br /&gt;Non-comedogenic&lt;br /&gt;SPF 15 (UVA/UVB protection)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on previous experience with the Olay products I have used for years (which carry most of the same claims) I made the bad leap in logic of assuming that a product with these claims would also be fragrance free.  Wrong!  On the side of the box (something you don&#x27;t get to see when ordering online) is the following statement:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Contains a gentle hypoallergenic fragrance uniquely developed for sensitive skin.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GENTLE???  I had to immediately go wash my hands after testing the first application on the back of my hand because the fragrance was so overwhelming.  To write this review, I used it on my hand again, but left it on a while to see if the fragrance dissipated or ceased to bother me.  Nope...still bothered me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to be able to actually use it on my face or neck, where it is intended to be used.  This is disappointing to me, not only because the lotion is now unusable to me but because I am not able to write as thorough a review as I would like.  For the record, while the fragrance seemed perfumy on first application, on closer inspection it smells more like it may containe eucalyptus oil.  If you are the type who can&#x27;t handle going into dried flower or candle shops, you will probably be bothered by this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can tell you (aside from the product&#x27;s claims and the fragrance) is that the bottle is 4.0 fluid ounces and comes with a pump.  The lotion has a lovely consistency, very smooth and creamy between my fingers.  If you don&#x27;t have fragrance sensitivity problems, I think it is probably quite a nice product.  I will give mine away to a friend since I am unable to use it.iend since I am unable to use it.</li>
            <li> And this one s no exception. I use this before heading out to the golf course or anytime I am going to be spending time outside. I know it is not sunscreen but the SPF 15 is sufficient for my skin. Last year I had problems in the windy weather and the winter weather with my skin feeling dry and tight. I no longer worry about that. Even after several hours working outside my skin no longer has that dry feeling and any windburn seems to be minimal.</li>
            <li> I really should have known better buying this product. I have insane sensitive skin. First off, I have rosacea, second, I use Retin A. I really need to stick to the right routine otherwise one mistake could cause me days of dry, insanely sensitive skin. Ive been using Avalon Organics Lavender Moisturizer and its been really great. Keeps my skin really hydrated and doesn&#x27;t cause any redness or breakouts. I assume I wanted to try the Neutrogena sensitive lotion because I had been traveling and read a lot of magazines that had the ad for it. Anyhow, I managed to get the normally $17 moisturizer for $5 with a bunch of coupons at CVS. This lotion made my skin really dry. I put it on in the morning and it felt ok under makeup. Then a couple hours later my skin started to feel really tight, and got tighter as the day went on. I decided that it might just be my skin adjusting to a new moisturizer, but the truth is, if its a good product for your skin, you&#x27;ll know right away. This was not a good product for me. Unfortunately I got caught up in all the pretty advertising and only positive reviews online. I will stick with Avalon Organics Lavender products because they are amazing.</li>
            <li> Really soothes the skin. Love how it smells!</li>
            <li> A wonderful product, simply perfect for people with sensitive skin!  This size lasts a LONG time (6 months or more!) and I&#x27;ve found it easy to use every morning, no problem.  It really is gentle and not heavy on the skin, and seems to do exactly what it advertises to do.  I think one can always trust Neutogena products to be careful to one&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion is a pleasant, light moisturizer for the face and neck.  The lotion dispenses easily from the bottle via the pump.  It has a lightly pleasant scent that is clean and citrusy, almost faintly like Lever 2000. The lotion spreads easily on your face.  Given its low viscosity, small amounts can cover a large area.  This is a rather light skin lotion: it isn&#x27;t a heavy duty facial moisturizer, but it seems to do the trick.  After application it seems well absorbed without leaving a greasy residue or visible sheen. This is good for daily application in someone who doesn&#x27;t require maximal moisturization, but it is probably not quite enough for someone who has very dry skin.  As an added bonus, it has SPF 15 UVA/UVB protection.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena products figure pretty prominently in my ongoing search for just the right facial lotion -- the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion SPF 15 is the latest entry.  As background, I am middle aged, have fair, slightly oily skin and the winter here in New England has been pretty mild this year.  I liked the feel of this product on my face and neck and did not find the scent overpowering and the SPF is a good inclusion.  If you are someone who is sensitive to frangrance or chamomile, you will want to steer clear of this product, since it is mildly fragranced for some reason and contains chamomile, which is supposed to be soothing.  The lotion is just the right weight for me to use during the day this mild winter season. I mix a dollop of it with a little liquid foundation in the palm of my hand and apply it to my face with a makeup sponge.  Is it soothing?  As much as any other mild facial lotion, I suppose, but chamomile and scent might make it not so soothing for some people.</li>
            <li> This is a nice clean fresh product for dry skin, especially around the face. It delivers refreshing moisture to dry faces, whether they are wind burned, from the sun, or just from daily life. Your face will feel clean, moisturized and refreshed. It works without greasiness and is easy on skin that is prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am chemically sensitive when is comes to artificial fragrance.  I used this on the back of my hand and not my face which I&#x27;m glad I did.  The fragrance was quite strong and I found it stings a bit on application.  While it did absorb nicely, and did not leave a greasy feel I would not consider this ultra gentle.  For those that generally don&#x27;t have reactions this lotion would probably be a good option.  If you have sensitive skin or are sensitive to fragrances then I would recommend you look for something different.</li>
            <li> I took a week off of my normal moisturizer to try Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion. First of all, the feel is somewhere between milky and creamy... not as heavy as a night cream nor as runny as some light daytime moisturizers.  The unscentedness is pleasant, no mystery smells lingering from the ingredients as in some unscented products.  I have very sensitive skin, and this lotion smoothed right on with no irritation or redness, particularly rare for a product containing sunblock.  My skin felt nicely moisturized without being greasy.  My one slight complaint might be staying power--I prefer a moisturizer that leaves my skin feeling hydrated for a long time.  Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion absorbed so well and totally that I couldn&#x27;t tell I had it on.  Since I know that many people prefer that feel, for them this would be a five star product.  For myself, I&#x27;ll stick with my regular moisturizer but use this on those sunny days.  Four stars. ****</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product because it made the area on my forehead somewhat red and its supposed to eliminate redness!  I have sensitive skin but I&#x27;ve used products that aren&#x27;t made for sensitive skin and they usually don&#x27;t make my forehead red.</li>
            <li> I was quite pleased with this lotion.  I have a lot of problems with redness and itching of my skin, and very few things seem to actually help like they promise they will.  I started using this lotion very sceptically, but I am pleased to report that it did help a great deal with my skin&#x27;s dryness, redness, and itching.  It does what it promises.  One thing you should know before purchasing is that it does have a light scent.  I would describe the scent as a typical sunscreen scent.  It was not very strong or overpowering, but definitely there, so if you have problems using scented products, this may not be for you.  Also, the lotion left my skin feeling a bit greasy to the touch.  As my skin looked amazing, I didn&#x27;t care, but it is something to consider.  A less greasy and scent free version would be nice.  Still, this product did greatly improve my skin, so four stars overall for me.</li>
            <li> For the most part, I&#x27;m loyal to Neutrogena skin care products. I use this face wash [[ASIN:B001EUQBRQ Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Facial Cleanser, Pink Grapefruit, 6 Ounce]] religiously, and it&#x27;s treated my skin better than any number of fancy department-store brands. And I usually use Neutrogrena moisturizer as well, though I use this one: [[ASIN:B000052YOX Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, Sensitive Skin, 4 Ounce]]. The Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion is similar to the moisturizer in that it&#x27;s light, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy after you apply it. It also holds in plenty of moisture, which I&#x27;m experienced with since I constantly have to re-apply weaker moisturizers in these bitter Chicago winters. It gets the job done. The only thing that keeps me from giving this product a higher rating is that it has a barely noticeable perfume-y scent that I don&#x27;t really like. I don&#x27;t like my face to be scented, and especially not my face lotion, since I have sensitive skin. If it were scent-less (and there&#x27;s no mention of scent on the packaging, but trust me, it&#x27;s there), I&#x27;d give it a 4. All in all, it&#x27;ll get the job done, but if you don&#x27;t like scented facial lotions, this one isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good moisturizer which does not irritate the skin and apparently is free of artificial fragrances and dyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months now.  It is an okay moisturizer.  I don&#x27;t feel very hydrated when i use it.  It does soothe, but sometimes when I really need moisturizing this doesn&#x27;t cut it.  I was in a parade and got a little bit or wind burn, this lotion stung like crazy on my face.  And some days after a really strenous workout this stings my pores too.  I&#x27;m not sure how something that should be so gentle makes my face hurt when it needs soothing the most.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin on my face, particularly in the winter, so I use a daily moisturizer.  I normally use a Lubriderm lotion that also has an SPF 15 rating.  This Neutrogena lotion has a somewhat better consistency and seems to rub into my skin more easily and evenly.  Sadly, however, the Neutrogena lotion has a very strong floral fragrance.  I didn&#x27;t notice anything in the product description that indicated this was a women&#x27;s product, but now that I view it again I suppose the phrase \\&quot;can be used under make up\\&quot; is perhaps intended to convey this.  At any rate, if you&#x27;re a male and do not want to use a cosmetic with a very feminine scent, you won&#x27;t want to use this product.</li>
            <li> For the past 10 days I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena&#x27;s Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion as my daily moisturizer.  During this time I spent most of my daylight hours indoors in an office setting with approximately 1-2 hours outdoors in sunshine going on walks, running errands, etc.  During this time this product has proven to be perfectly serviceable to a 30-something male and I appreciated the ease of application, the Non-Comedogenic properties, the SPF 15 protection and the fact that it kept my skin moisturized even during some cold, dry Winter days.  Products from Neutrogena are typically excellent doing what they&#x27;re supposed to do with a minimal amount of fussy chemicals and additives - this facial lotion is no exception and quite adequate for most people&#x27;s day to day needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month now and have no complaints so far. It&#x27;s the lightest moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used - you barely have to rub it into the skin, it absorbs so easily, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or scent. It really is quite gentle as well - I have sebborheic dermatitis on my forehead in the wintertime and dry, sensitive skin all year round and it hasn&#x27;t irritated me. I use it in conjuncton with Aveeno&#x27;s Baby moisturizer for eczema-prone skin and have had no problems. Definitely recommend, even at the somewhat steep price.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne prone, AND dry skin.  And because of the acne, I use topical medicines that dry my skin even further.  It makes for a frustrating combination because I need something that won&#x27;t cause breakouts or irritation, but that will also keep me sufficiently moisturized.  This lotion is wonderful because it succeeds at doing all three.  What I love most is that it dries quickly so I can put on makeup primer and foundation almost immediately afterwards.  This is a huge plus because who wants to wait around for her lotion to dry before she goes on with the rest of her beauty routine?  The only downside is that this still isn&#x27;t potent enough to use just once a day.  I usually have to apply 2-3 times a day in order to keep my skin soft and hydrated, but it is otherwise a great product.  I&#x27;ve since repurchased this multiple times because even though this lotion isn&#x27;t perfect, it has worked better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried for my needs.  I&#x27;ve tried more expensive brands but I keep coming back to this because it is so gentle and soothing on my skin.</li>
            <li> I did a quick search on the active ingredients, and was a bit disappointed to find out that one of the ingredients might be harmful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the three active ingredients listed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Octisalate is a UVB absorber and an emollient. It also has a slightly floral scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avobenzone absorbs the full spectrum of UVA rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Octinoxate absorbs UV-A and UV-B rays. It also reduces the appearance of scars. Of note, a study on lab animals suggests that octinoxate might have undesired effects, such as estrogenic properties and effects on other hormones, such as thyroid hormone. A 2011 study found that pre- and post-natal rats exposed to a high dosage had lowered testosterone levels and smaller testes and prostates. They also had lowered motor activity levels, but spatial learning ability was improved. There needs to be more studies performed in order to gain definitive answers as to the safety of octinoxate, but I&#x27;d advise you to use caution, especially if you&#x27;re pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reference: Axelstad, M et al. (2011). \\&quot;Effects of pre- and postnatal exposure to the UV-filter octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC) on the reproductive, auditory and neurological development of rat offspring\\&quot;. Toxicology and applied pharmacology 250 (3): 278-90. DOI:10.1016/j.taap.2010.10.031. PMID 21059369</li>
            <li> This did not help my sensitive acne prone skin. Greasy and irritating, it went in the trash. Unfortunately this product is very misleading.</li>
            <li> Love this face lotion. I have an extremely sensitive face. Regular sunscreen or most &amp;#34; sensitive&amp;#34; sunscreens irritate my face so much that I look sun burned. It is wonderfully soothing.</li>
            <li> Super light and works great. Best for hot summer time...</li>
            <li> This is the best Neutrogena moisturizer with SPF that I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s not too greasy, and it absorbs easily. The scent is a little strong, but not too bothersome because it fades fast.</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion!! My skin is SO SENSITIVE  to lotions &amp; creams, that even when my skin is REALLY DRY, I KNOW I will &amp;#34;break out&amp;#34; if I use ANYTHING! THIS LOTION moisturized &amp; made my skin feel soft, it looked better, WITHOUT ANY eruptions. I was amazed &amp; delighted! NOW, I CANNOT FIND IT FOR SALE ANYWHERE?!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this moisturizer.  I have allergies and rub at my nose a lot, causing red, itchy skin under my nose, and this is the best lotion I have ever used to make the itchiness go away without causing pimples.  I also use the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle face wash.  It&#x27;s great, too.  These products are hard to find in my area and the Amazon price seems comparable to what I paid when I was able to find it in the store.  Plus, I got free 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime.  You can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> So light and working well! I really love using it for my everyday routine. The price is also reasonable. Recommend it to any skin types.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at CVS and it is no longer in drugstores. Too bad, it&#x27;s the best one they&#x27;ve made that I can remember.</li>
            <li> I ordered the product 2 days ago, and it already arrived. I was very happy with the quick shipping. The product is priced great. It&#x27;s a steal. (This product sells for $19.99 in stores!) Works to calm down my sensitive skin and redness while protecting me from the sun with SPF 15.</li>
            <li> I use this &amp;#34;Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing&amp;#34; after using my acne medication that drys my skin&lt;br /&gt;and it keeps my skin in a good shape</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used for my skin.  Immediately my skin was truly less sensitive and softer.  It also helped clear my skin up a bit because I am so sensitive to other things.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s Ultra Gentle Soothing Lotion with SPF 15 is a non-greasy, scentless moisturizer. I know it&#x27;s a face lotion, but my teen age son uses to combat dry skin on his arms and legs. It works wonderfuly. We live Colorado and winter is tough on his skin.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and being scentless it&#x27;s perfect for him. When I checked the price (I received a test bottle for free) I was a little surprised at how expensive it is. However it is a good size bottle and will last a while.  And it certainly does the trick.</li>
            <li> Whenever there&#x27;s a scent to a face lotion I get nervous that it&#x27;s going to cause irritation to my sensitive skin. This one didn&#x27;t, although I can&#x27;t really use it every day because of the scent and my allergies. I like that it comes with SPF 15 but I&#x27;d prefer it to have 30, so I could use it as a replacement for my facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My face is very dry and I need to use a moisturizer every morning and evening. I have tried many different brands; only a few have done a good job of moisturizing. One thing I particularly liked about the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Soothing lotion was that it did not cause blemishes because it does not contain fragrance. I also enjoy the SPF 15 protection for when I am out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;A great product for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> It seems the older I get, the more sensitive my skin gets. So when I had a chance to try this facial lotion, I jumped at it. With many lotions they cause my face to turn red and  burn a bit; however, with the Neutrogena lotion that did not happen. Moreover, this lotion leaves your face feeling soft and smooth. I highly recommend this if you are one that struggles with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this Neutrogena lotion. I&#x27;m so sad that I can&#x27;t buy it in stores anymore. I love the formula and the light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin so I usually don&#x27;t like moisturizers, but this moisturizer is the best! It absorbs into your skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. It never causes me to breakout and makes my skin feel fresh and dewy! Love, Love, Love it!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Neutrogena. I have tried several other brands and believe Neutrogena is the right one for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am approaching 30 years old. I have a combination of oily and sensitive skin. I also have acne that is genetic related which worsens with stress. I get both types ... the quick to head plus the deep hard painful ones. I figured after turning 21 I&#x27;d be done with battling acne ... but have found I am not alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few of Neutrogena&#x27;s moisturizers, but found others to be heavy and thick. It felt like the lotion never fully absorbed, leaving behind an oily residue. I&#x27;m not at the point where I need help with aging, just looking to balance and protect and hopefully help with the redness due to the acne and sensitivity. I believe I have found the right one for me! I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for about 2 month&#x27;s now. I use both the lotion and cream ... I use the lotion in the morning because I want the spf protection and I use the cream at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion feels heavier than the cream, but compared to others, leaves my face feeling light and fresh and moisturized! I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge reduction in redness, but this is also a genetic issue, I have a lot of red blotchy areas, plus until I can rid of the acne completely, I doubt I&#x27;ll be redness-free! My skin feels like it can still breathe after applying and feels super soft! And I think it&#x27;s finally balanced! I&#x27;ve noticed the production of oil has reduced and the dry painful areas are gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those looking for a gentle moisturizer, this is the one for you! I gave it 4 stars, only because I&#x27;m not sure if it fully reduces redness. I don&#x27;t forsee myself trying a new moisturizer any time soon if ever! OH ... and one last quick note ... it smells great!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the alcohol or sunscreen but the fact is this stuff stings! Never had that feeling before with sunblock or regular facial lotions. This is really not a good product for people with sensitive skin. This product is really the opposite of \\&quot;soothing.\\&quot; I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again and would really suggest they try testing their products on the people they are marketing them for.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I bought on a whim due to the extremely low price, and was very pleased with the product. My lotion was actually expired, but the seller offered to exchange it (I was too lazy to send it back)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is often very sensitive to lotion, but I love the way this one feels. My skin drinks it up! Tried to purchase again, and the price has gone up significantly (still much cheaper than retail) and still worth it.</li>
            <li> I have allergies to sunscreen and this is the only product I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause my face to break out in a rash.  Use it daily.</li>
            <li> I put this lotion on and it burned like crazy! If you have skin issues, you know what I am talking about. The label reads as though it is great for sensitive skin, not particularly! If you read the small print on the side of the box, there is fragrance in it. I believe it said something likely mildly fragranced or something! I pitched a fit and then gave it to my daughter. I won&#x27;t be buying anything over the internet skin related anymore. I would have seen the fine print, if I had the box in my hand.</li>
            <li> Best lotion for sensitive/dry skin!</li>
            <li> Helped lessen facial irritation due to eczema. Made makeup more tolerable when applied first. The sunscreen in it can irritate eyes if you have allergies.</li>
            <li> The smell is irritating, it made my sinuses go haywire...it was like smelling Tommy Hilfiger cologne...all of which clogs my sinuses instantly. Plus, it wasn&#x27;t at all soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have found for allergy prone skin and/or skin with rosacea.  It really is soothing, does not feel oily, and has a light, pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> This product is neither too runny nor too sticky, and I like having a combination of moderate sun protection and moisturizer in one lotion. Two thumbs up!</li>
