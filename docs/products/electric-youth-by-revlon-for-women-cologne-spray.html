            <li>I was so thrilled to find it on here.</li>
            <li>It smelled better in the 80&#x27;s</li>
            <li>She was SOO excited!  </li>
            <li>This made a great gift for a life-long friend, brought back memories of the eighties ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li>is the original</li>
            <li>Loved this perfume when I was younger...</li>
            <li>I was 16 and my first paying job was a Cashier at a department store called &amp;#34;Ames&amp;#34; and since Debbie Gibson was a big Pop Sensation,  I bought the perfume and loved it</li>
            <li>I remember how excited I was when this fragrance first came outâ€¦</li>
            <li>It has almost an afterthought of a nice smell, what this smelled like but not enough to make it worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>to me it doesnt smell like the one I had in jr high..</li>
            <li>I used to wear it when I was in High School and</li>
            <li>It smells very old.</li>
            <li>maybe I&#x27;m getting old</li>
            <li>I knew it would be gamble to purchase such an old scent</li>
            <li>I think this was pink back in the 90s when it first came out,  its amber now.  </li>
            <li>but if it&#x27;s stored correctly it would have at least the slightest of original scent.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s likely just my memory but the color was a bit lighter, the fragrance was a bit smoother but the base of it is still there.</li>
            <li> I hated it.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> never in my life was the scent this horrific.</li>

            <li> Cologne had foul aroma. Trash!</li>
            <li> I remember how excited I was when this fragrance first came outâ€¦ I was 16 and my first paying job was a Cashier at a department store called &amp;#34;Ames&amp;#34; and since Debbie Gibson was a big Pop Sensation,  I bought the perfume and loved itâ€¦  26 years later and I wanted a couple 80s fragrances so I got this one and what a flash back I encountered!!!...</li>
            <li> Oldie but a goodie.giving it as a gift</li>
            <li> to me it doesnt smell like the one I had in jr high.. It comes close but for some reason it doesnt smell the same.. maybe I&#x27;m getting old</li>
            <li> Brought back memories</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it would smell like it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think someone has a stock of this perfume from the 80s and is selling it now.... It smells very old. It has almost an afterthought of a nice smell, what this smelled like but not enough to make it worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I used this scent for years.I was so thrilled to find it on here.I knew it would be gamble to purchase such an old scent but if it&#x27;s stored correctly it would have at least the slightest of original scent.This one was not and does not.It smells AWFUL.I hate that you can not return perfume on amazon because this would be going back for sure.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Smelled old and stale. I hated it. Smelled nothing like it did when I was younger</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!! I wore it a lot of years ago and still love the smell!! Thank You!!</li>
            <li> It smelled better in the 80&#x27;s</li>
            <li> My daughter has become a fan of Debbie Gibson.  For Christmas, I bought her this along with a couple Debbie Gibson CD&#x27;s.  She was SOO excited!  It definitely has a sort of 80&#x27;s retro smell.  Not at all unpleasant but definitely different than colognes that are popular these days.</li>
            <li> I always loved this perfume.  I will always buy from seller.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for a friend that used to get this perfume as a kid &amp; it was a big surprise! She loved it! She said it smelled the same as she had remembered.</li>
            <li> Loved this perfume when I was younger...I can&#x27;t believe they still sell it!</li>
            <li> no way does not smell the  same gonna order the one by Debbie Gibson hope is the original</li>
            <li> This was a perfume I wore when it was endorsed by Debbie Gibson. It&#x27;s likely just my memory but the color was a bit lighter, the fragrance was a bit smoother but the base of it is still there.</li>
            <li> it smelled medicinal and not even close to the way the perfume is supposed to smell. I used to wear it when I was in High School and never in my life was the scent this horrific.</li>
            <li> I think this was pink back in the 90s when it first came out,  its amber now.  Smell is a little off....or my memory is? Possible, it has been a while! After a few minutes it mellows out to what i remember it smelling like. So happy i found this! Youth: revisited...Check!</li>
            <li> This made a great gift for a life-long friend, brought back memories of the eighties ðŸ˜‰</li>
