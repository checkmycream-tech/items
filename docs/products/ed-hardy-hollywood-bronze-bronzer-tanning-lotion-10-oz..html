            <li>It gives your skin a nice glimmery appearance and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I just started tanning again after having my baby and this lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li>Simply amazing.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice glow.</li>
            <li>I liked the consistency and applied evenly.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product good start up tanning lotion for myself my boyfriend</li>
            <li>Nice smell as well.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and doesn&#x27;t smell like you just got out of a tanning bed</li>
            <li>Feels silky and smells nice.</li>
            <li>I liked this product.</li>
            <li>I really liked this lotion.</li>
            <li>Leaves stains on your clothes, doesn&#x27;t even get you a nice skin color</li>
            <li>Smells nice, too.</li>
            <li>The scent it nice</li>
            <li>then I know it has some nice bronzers in it.</li>
            <li>.. smell nice</li>
            <li>Smelled nice, went on smooth/even, and the bronzers gave a nice glow that wasn&#x27;t orange and had a just a hint of shimmer.</li>
            <li>It has a nice sparkle to it but doesnt look like your covered in glitter.  </li>
            <li>Nothing extremely special but the price for this lotion was great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing, gets you nice color and and smells good, it also gives you a light sparkle.</li>
            <li>The perfume smell of this is VERY strong, but the bronzer in this works reeeeeally well.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more for sure!</li>
            <li>I have ever used smells amazing and works QUICK!!</li>
            <li>It gives you a nice glow till you can work up your tan :)</li>
            <li>This product I am sure will be amazing.</li>
            <li>But once smells not so strong love the color glow you get!</li>
            <li>This lotion smells amazing and gives a nice rich color.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing not to strong.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, not too strong but it&#x27;s not like the Ed Hardy Perfume.</li>
            <li>(the good thing is just make sure you rub it off quick after you get out of the tanning bed</li>
            <li>which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin feel because it&#x27;s silicone based.</li>
            <li>I will order more at this price</li>
            <li>Immediate bronzers help you feel satisfied after just one session.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not a horrible smell.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s performance is better than nothing.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure there are better products.</li>
            <li>Worked ok.</li>
            <li>I felt that I tanned better without the potion</li>
            <li>More like a floral type smell.</li>
            <li>Definitely gives me great color, no orange streakiness at all!</li>
            <li>I been tanning for year&#x27;s and have used many many lotions ..</li>
            <li>I will be sticking with this lotion love love it ..</li>
            <li>It is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Body shots is my favorite</li>
            <li>But for me its body shots until Ed Hardy makes a bronzer/tingle to top it.</li>
            <li>Love the price also.</li>
            <li>Great for getting some color fast.</li>
            <li>Make sure to exfoliate after each use.</li>
            <li>Ladies, you dont know how important that it!</li>
            <li>Im sure you already know this if you have looked into the description</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you can get a rash from anything you try, i&#x27;m allergic to neosporin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy another bottle to make sure I have plenty on hand.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I love the smell</li>
            <li>i just sent in an order for 3 more.  </li>
            <li>Love it and would recommend this product to all my Friends that are tanners.</li>
            <li>love tanning,</li>
            <li>:) I like the shimmer a lot, it is just something I did not expect.</li>
            <li>but it was better than nothing at the time and</li>
            <li>I love Ed Hardy products for tanning</li>
            <li>Its really light!</li>
            <li>Another one i love.</li>
            <li>For sure would by again.</li>
            <li>excellent lotion - makes skin feel soft and smooth...</li>
            <li>I love this product  </li>
            <li>and it is a better bronzer</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>No awful after tanning session smell.</li>
            <li>It DOES streak, it has a funny smell after tanning (not that pleasant before, either) and</li>
            <li>On top of that this is the first lotion I have found that smells really good before AND after tanning.</li>
            <li>Light, not greasy, nice fragrance but not too strong.  </li>
            <li>The bronzers are pretty good.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned but tanning with a nice red/brown color that looks like a natural sun tan for me.</li>
            <li>After about 2 wks, I started to develop a great natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Good consistency and works very well.</li>
            <li>So, all in all this lotion is worth the $$ and it smells really nice too.</li>
            <li>And I tan easily.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t burn easily, but I don&#x27;t tan easily either</li>
            <li>The smell is really strong though.</li>
            <li>It has the bronzing like it states but it has a strong perfume smell..</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much and very easy to apply - goes on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I am very fair skin (blonde hair, blue eyes) and this works great for me.  </li>
            <li>More like a sugary sweet type.</li>
            <li>Anyways, this has a bit of glimmer to it and my skin looked and felt pretty nice.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for the average tanner.</li>
            <li>I started in a 10 min bed at 5 mins for 2 weeks and then within a week more, I was at the full 10 mins.</li>
            <li>Its not too dark to where i look unaturally tan, its perfect!</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price, but not my favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I tan pretty easy, this just seemed like I had to stay on top of my tanning more</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful as well but tends to have a slight odor after tanning.</li>
            <li>It arrived in the mail quickly and I&#x27;ve been using it every since!</li>
            <li>, the shipping was quick!</li>
            <li>Not only is this an amazing and effective bronzer</li>
            <li>It smells great and definitely helps the tanning process along.  </li>
            <li>It does go on smoothly with no streaks</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t fantastic.</li>
            <li>great color noticed I was darker by second day of using the lotion .</li>
            <li>but this product works great, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>but it worked just as well as the cheap one I bought at sally&#x27;s beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>Seems good so far.  </li>
            <li>My skin smells good all day even after tanning and is so soft.</li>
            <li>, I am caucasian and part french, but I don&#x27;t have nice olive skin, I have something kind of inbetween.</li>
            <li>Clearly, you can see by all the comments that this is a good lotion.</li>
            <li>Definitely my new favorite lotion!</li>
            <li>My husband went tanning before vacation last year &amp; he liked using it as well!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been tanning for many years, tried a million lotions &amp; this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>The smell is okay, pretty sweet scented.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have that stinky burnt smell, just a clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>The Lotion is great :) It gives you a golden glow,&lt;br /&gt;Def wash your hands after its applied, the palms will look a little golden but overall good product :)</li>
            <li>I used all types of tanning lotions &amp; this one has by far been my favorite!</li>
            <li>Nothing special</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nothing really special.</li>
            <li>I will NOT be purchasing again though, there wasn&#x27;t anything too special about it.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li>I like pink lol.</li>
            <li>Fast service and one of the better lotions for the price.</li>
            <li>and then outside in the sun works good too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a musky but sweet smell.</li>
            <li>Only thing Ed Hardy is good for is clothes and perfume.</li>
            <li>Love this really helps with your tan</li>
            <li>Was not a bad product for the price.</li>
            <li>Im pretty pale, so using this when i go tanning works perfectly!</li>
            <li>Other than that its a great lotion.</li>
            <li>Before buying this product I read the reviews decided to purchase it due to the great ratings.</li>
            <li>Either way this is a great bronzer and a wonderful edition to a base tan.</li>
            <li>I have used so so many different lotions, this one is top</li>
            <li>It really gives your skin a great deep golden brown.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty light skinned</li>
            <li>Noticed a darker tan the first day!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really have a bronzed, which is fine with me</li>
            <li>thinking about ordering a few more....plus great price -</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a nice bronze color tan.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin when it comes to using most products.</li>
            <li>I love the way that my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li>starting with items that cater to the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; kind of customers.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>got here sooner than expected, &amp; for such a great deal!</li>
            <li>Overall it was nice for the price, worth a try.</li>
            <li>i might try that kind next.</li>
            <li>it gives you a really nice tan, and the bronzer in it gives the tan look while your actual tan has time to develop.</li>
            <li>I agree this help moisten then skin from peeling, smells very nice and it does seem to promote a very dark Tan.</li>
            <li>Have tried other lotions but still love this the most.</li>
            <li>It has a light smell, and actually smells pretty good as far as tanning lotion goes.</li>
            <li>it gets me so dark - and i&#x27;m someone that doesn&#x27;t tan very easily!</li>
            <li>which also works great but its more expensive</li>
            <li>It was a very fast delivery and nothing against the seller at all.</li>
            <li>ordered multiple times from my new friends at Thee Tan Man and extremely satisfied EVERY time!</li>
            <li>With this lotion I am finally tan, brown not orange:) I could see a difference even after one usage.</li>
            <li>haha!</li>
            <li>I love the scent, my color seems to last longer as well.</li>
            <li>But overall ok</li>
            <li>Smell could be a tiny bit better</li>
            <li>But works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Used this lotion for several applications but just didn&#x27;t like it mostly because of the bronzer in it</li>
            <li>I paid $65 dollars for my first bottle of lotion in March.</li>
            <li>The bronzing in this really works!</li>
            <li>Received it on the exact day I was promised.</li>
            <li>&amp; so I literally had to tan everyday to keep it looking good.</li>
            <li>Have only used once so far, but love the smell!</li>
            <li>I am fair (blonde hair &amp; blue eyes).</li>
            <li>The bronzer is ok but what I really like is the scent left after tanning.</li>
            <li>and I like to get a natural tan outside in the sun, but it does smell nice.</li>
            <li>Found bronzer to have a nice dark and even tone.</li>
            <li>Amazon always has it for less than $15, It also smells really nice.</li>
            <li>but I always make sure I&#x27;m mostly dry before I put on my clothes)</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>I really like the color this gave me without being orange at all.</li>
            <li>Shipping speed was fast as well.</li>
            <li>I really like that this doesn&#x27;t have the burnt smell allot of the lotions have</li>
            <li>I would suggest tanning in the morning and just using the lotion as your perfume, haha.</li>
            <li>I had been using Swedish Beauty intensifier and wasn&#x27;t really seeing a difference in color.</li>
            <li>it wasnt very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, what really got my curiosity going about it was that it says it targets anti-aging and firming.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want that for me, so I was very hesitant.</li>
            <li>And it really does give you that Hollywood tan...not an orange tan.</li>
            <li>This really seemed to work well.&lt;br /&gt;I’m</li>
            <li>so if you rub it in too much as it dries the bronzer residue beads up and rubs off.</li>
            <li>it was a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>the salon I go to wants around $50</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really tried it in the tanning bed since it&#x27;s summer time</li>
            <li>Love the aroma, goes on easy, I darken quickly, it&#x27;s not greasy and helps my tan last longer.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars as i have used other lotions that have gotten me darker, but this one did a good job too.</li>
            <li>This lotion is okay, but I prefer to use other lotions over this one.</li>
            <li>Glad I found a lotion that doesn&#x27;t smell too strong and actually can be noticed after a few days of tanning..</li>
            <li>The first day it left my skin a little burned but the next day it was beautiful.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely purchase it again in the near future for a nice color.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and have been tanning to build my base tan with a light bronzer.</li>
            <li>I think it had a nice light scent that was slightly musky, slightly vanilla.</li>
            <li>The only thing I noticed and a heads up for anyone else who isn&#x27;t sure, Don&#x27;t wear white when using this product.</li>
            <li>Price was decent</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly care for the smell and it does nothing to mask the &amp;#34;i</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have only used a few applications, but so far it doesn&#x27;t do much more than lightly tint my skin.  </li>
            <li>Recommend and highly recommend vendor as well.</li>
            <li>ED HARDY lotion may not have worked for you, but i always have a bottle in my tanning arsenal &amp; i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Charged me 6.50 for a little packet of this, so I am glad to see it on here for 20 bucks.</li>
            <li>It works very well and natural as a Bronze r too ...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally tan</li>
            <li>The only downsides is make sure your skin is almost dry before you put on your clothes (I&#x27;ve never had it stain my clothes</li>
            <li>but I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>if your looking to try something new, this is it.</li>
            <li>I have an extremely light complextion, but after using this product only twice I can definitely see my skin beginning to bronze.</li>
            <li>Love that it gave me a little bronze color after tanning each time with it!</li>
            <li>Very natural looking tan for a bronzer.</li>
            <li>I could tell that it was working within the first week (by the 3rd day).</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell flowery like other lotions that are clearly aimed more for female users.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that I consider a down fall to it is that you have to make sure you rub your hands thoroughly after you apply, or else in between your fingers</li>
            <li>will give me a good base tan and set the stage for something strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different tanning lotions before &amp; will never use a different kind as long as this one is made!</li>
            <li>It has a natural bronzer in it, so not only do you tan fast naturally, but your using a bronzer as well!</li>
            <li>Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was it didn&#x27;t last very long, but it is definitely worth the price I paid!!</li>
            <li>After tanning, my skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>The only downfall is once I&#x27;m done tanning, I really do smell like it</li>
            <li>I just bought old lady smelling lotion.</li>
            <li>The smell is different from anything I have ever used, but I do really like that too.</li>
            <li>Smells so good and enhances my color without looking fake.</li>
            <li>To get your base tan this one is by far the best !</li>
            <li>but I am certainly not very dark.</li>
            <li>and a little goes a long way, and it has shimmer tint in it :)</li>
            <li>Used a little spot remover and it came right out though!</li>
            <li>I usually do not tan on the first day (even with other tanning lotions that I&#x27;ve tried) but</li>
            <li>It was very dark when put on and streaked even when putting on using circular motions, Once done,it wiped off with a rag and after about 6 hours, got in the shower and came right off!</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s a major difference!</li>
            <li>Super dark bronzer!</li>
            <li>I chose this product because the price was reasonably low and I am new to using indoor tanning beds.</li>
            <li>I am in love with the smell and texture - it doesnt make you smell weird after and is very neutral smelling.</li>
            <li>Bought my first bottle last year, paid 3X as much at the salon recently ran out and was trying other lotions... just ended up taking the risk of buy lotion from internet.</li>
            <li>Got dark after first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this lotion now 4 times and can barely even tell.</li>
            <li>well but barely helped me tan.</li>
            <li>but you can barely see it.</li>
            <li>Maybe when you search for lotions in the future you should start by bringing wipes to the tanning bed with you, read the description listed as \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; to get an idea of what it might smell like &amp; tell your friend to purchase lotions from the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; section.</li>
            <li>It smells good but it drives me crazy at times.</li>
            <li>For a high end lotion, it&#x27;s not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I saw results within the first few visits.</li>
            <li>A good starting point that doesn&#x27;t have bad smell and doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy to me.</li>

            <li> i promise you will be happy &amp; praise the tanning gods for finally giving you \\&quot;THE GREATEST TANNING LOTION OF ALL TIME.\\&quot; Happy Tanning &amp; thanks ED HARDY!!!!</li>
            <li> It gives your skin a nice glimmery appearance and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I just started tanning again after having my baby and this lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I liked the consistency and applied evenly.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product good start up tanning lotion for myself my boyfriend</li>
            <li> Nice smell as well.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and doesn&#x27;t smell like you just got out of a tanning bed</li>
            <li> Feels silky and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I liked this product.</li>
            <li> I really liked this lotion.</li>
            <li> Leaves stains on your clothes, doesn&#x27;t even get you a nice skin color</li>
            <li> Smells nice, too.</li>
            <li> The scent it nice</li>
            <li> then I know it has some nice bronzers in it.</li>
            <li> .. smell nice</li>
            <li> Smelled nice, went on smooth/even, and the bronzers gave a nice glow that wasn&#x27;t orange and had a just a hint of shimmer.</li>
            <li> It has a nice sparkle to it but doesnt look like your covered in glitter.  </li>
            <li> Nothing extremely special but the price for this lotion was great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing, gets you nice color and and smells good, it also gives you a light sparkle.</li>
            <li> The perfume smell of this is VERY strong, but the bronzer in this works reeeeeally well.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy more for sure!</li>
            <li> I have ever used smells amazing and works QUICK!!</li>
            <li> It gives you a nice glow till you can work up your tan :)</li>
            <li> This product I am sure will be amazing.</li>
            <li> But once smells not so strong love the color glow you get!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells amazing and gives a nice rich color.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing not to strong.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice, not too strong but it&#x27;s not like the Ed Hardy Perfume.</li>
            <li> (the good thing is just make sure you rub it off quick after you get out of the tanning bed</li>
            <li> which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin feel because it&#x27;s silicone based.</li>
            <li> I will order more at this price</li>
            <li> Immediate bronzers help you feel satisfied after just one session.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not a horrible smell.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s performance is better than nothing.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure there are better products.</li>
            <li> Worked ok.</li>
            <li> I felt that I tanned better without the potion</li>
            <li> More like a floral type smell.</li>
            <li> Definitely gives me great color, no orange streakiness at all!</li>
            <li> I been tanning for year&#x27;s and have used many many lotions ..</li>
            <li> I will be sticking with this lotion love love it ..</li>
            <li> It is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Body shots is my favorite</li>
            <li> But for me its body shots until Ed Hardy makes a bronzer/tingle to top it.</li>
            <li> Love the price also.</li>
            <li> Great for getting some color fast.</li>
            <li> Make sure to exfoliate after each use.</li>
            <li> Ladies, you dont know how important that it!</li>
            <li> Im sure you already know this if you have looked into the description</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you can get a rash from anything you try, i&#x27;m allergic to neosporin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy another bottle to make sure I have plenty on hand.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and I love the smell</li>
            <li> i just sent in an order for 3 more.  </li>
            <li> Love it and would recommend this product to all my Friends that are tanners.</li>
            <li> love tanning,</li>
            <li> :) I like the shimmer a lot, it is just something I did not expect.</li>
            <li> but it was better than nothing at the time and</li>
            <li> I love Ed Hardy products for tanning</li>
            <li> Its really light!</li>
            <li> Another one i love.</li>
            <li> For sure would by again.</li>
            <li> excellent lotion - makes skin feel soft and smooth...</li>
            <li> I love this product  </li>
            <li> and it is a better bronzer</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> No awful after tanning session smell.</li>
            <li> It DOES streak, it has a funny smell after tanning (not that pleasant before, either) and</li>
            <li> On top of that this is the first lotion I have found that smells really good before AND after tanning.</li>
            <li> Light, not greasy, nice fragrance but not too strong.  </li>
            <li> The bronzers are pretty good.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned but tanning with a nice red/brown color that looks like a natural sun tan for me.</li>
            <li> After about 2 wks, I started to develop a great natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Good consistency and works very well.</li>
            <li> So, all in all this lotion is worth the $$ and it smells really nice too.</li>
            <li> And I tan easily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t burn easily, but I don&#x27;t tan easily either</li>
            <li> The smell is really strong though.</li>
            <li> It has the bronzing like it states but it has a strong perfume smell..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much and very easy to apply - goes on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I am very fair skin (blonde hair, blue eyes) and this works great for me.  </li>
            <li> More like a sugary sweet type.</li>
            <li> Anyways, this has a bit of glimmer to it and my skin looked and felt pretty nice.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for the average tanner.</li>
            <li> I started in a 10 min bed at 5 mins for 2 weeks and then within a week more, I was at the full 10 mins.</li>
            <li> Its not too dark to where i look unaturally tan, its perfect!</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price, but not my favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I tan pretty easy, this just seemed like I had to stay on top of my tanning more</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful as well but tends to have a slight odor after tanning.</li>
            <li> It arrived in the mail quickly and I&#x27;ve been using it every since!</li>
            <li> , the shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> Not only is this an amazing and effective bronzer</li>
            <li> It smells great and definitely helps the tanning process along.  </li>
            <li> It does go on smoothly with no streaks</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t fantastic.</li>
            <li> great color noticed I was darker by second day of using the lotion .</li>
            <li> but this product works great, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> but it worked just as well as the cheap one I bought at sally&#x27;s beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Seems good so far.  </li>
            <li> My skin smells good all day even after tanning and is so soft.</li>
            <li> , I am caucasian and part french, but I don&#x27;t have nice olive skin, I have something kind of inbetween.</li>
            <li> Clearly, you can see by all the comments that this is a good lotion.</li>
            <li> Definitely my new favorite lotion!</li>
            <li> My husband went tanning before vacation last year &amp; he liked using it as well!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been tanning for many years, tried a million lotions &amp; this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> The smell is okay, pretty sweet scented.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have that stinky burnt smell, just a clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> The Lotion is great :) It gives you a golden glow,&lt;br /&gt;Def wash your hands after its applied, the palms will look a little golden but overall good product :)</li>
            <li> I used all types of tanning lotions &amp; this one has by far been my favorite!</li>
            <li> Nothing special</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nothing really special.</li>
            <li> I will NOT be purchasing again though, there wasn&#x27;t anything too special about it.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li> I like pink lol.</li>
            <li> Fast service and one of the better lotions for the price.</li>
            <li> and then outside in the sun works good too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a musky but sweet smell.</li>
            <li> Only thing Ed Hardy is good for is clothes and perfume.</li>
            <li> Love this really helps with your tan</li>
            <li> Was not a bad product for the price.</li>
            <li> Im pretty pale, so using this when i go tanning works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Other than that its a great lotion.</li>
            <li> Before buying this product I read the reviews decided to purchase it due to the great ratings.</li>
            <li> Either way this is a great bronzer and a wonderful edition to a base tan.</li>
            <li> I have used so so many different lotions, this one is top</li>
            <li> It really gives your skin a great deep golden brown.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty light skinned</li>
            <li> Noticed a darker tan the first day!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really have a bronzed, which is fine with me</li>
            <li> thinking about ordering a few more....plus great price -</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a nice bronze color tan.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin when it comes to using most products.</li>
            <li> I love the way that my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li> starting with items that cater to the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; kind of customers.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> got here sooner than expected, &amp; for such a great deal!</li>
            <li> Overall it was nice for the price, worth a try.</li>
            <li> i might try that kind next.</li>
            <li> it gives you a really nice tan, and the bronzer in it gives the tan look while your actual tan has time to develop.</li>
            <li> I agree this help moisten then skin from peeling, smells very nice and it does seem to promote a very dark Tan.</li>
            <li> Have tried other lotions but still love this the most.</li>
            <li> It has a light smell, and actually smells pretty good as far as tanning lotion goes.</li>
            <li> it gets me so dark - and i&#x27;m someone that doesn&#x27;t tan very easily!</li>
            <li> which also works great but its more expensive</li>
            <li> It was a very fast delivery and nothing against the seller at all.</li>
            <li> ordered multiple times from my new friends at Thee Tan Man and extremely satisfied EVERY time!</li>
            <li> With this lotion I am finally tan, brown not orange:) I could see a difference even after one usage.</li>
            <li> haha!</li>
            <li> I love the scent, my color seems to last longer as well.</li>
            <li> But overall ok</li>
            <li> Smell could be a tiny bit better</li>
            <li> But works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Used this lotion for several applications but just didn&#x27;t like it mostly because of the bronzer in it</li>
            <li> I paid $65 dollars for my first bottle of lotion in March.</li>
            <li> The bronzing in this really works!</li>
            <li> Received it on the exact day I was promised.</li>
            <li> &amp; so I literally had to tan everyday to keep it looking good.</li>
            <li> Have only used once so far, but love the smell!</li>
            <li> I am fair (blonde hair &amp; blue eyes).</li>
            <li> The bronzer is ok but what I really like is the scent left after tanning.</li>
            <li> and I like to get a natural tan outside in the sun, but it does smell nice.</li>
            <li> Found bronzer to have a nice dark and even tone.</li>
            <li> Amazon always has it for less than $15, It also smells really nice.</li>
            <li> but I always make sure I&#x27;m mostly dry before I put on my clothes)</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> I really like the color this gave me without being orange at all.</li>
            <li> Shipping speed was fast as well.</li>
            <li> I really like that this doesn&#x27;t have the burnt smell allot of the lotions have</li>
            <li> I would suggest tanning in the morning and just using the lotion as your perfume, haha.</li>
            <li> I had been using Swedish Beauty intensifier and wasn&#x27;t really seeing a difference in color.</li>
            <li> it wasnt very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, what really got my curiosity going about it was that it says it targets anti-aging and firming.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want that for me, so I was very hesitant.</li>
            <li> And it really does give you that Hollywood tan...not an orange tan.</li>
            <li> This really seemed to work well.&lt;br /&gt;I’m</li>
            <li> so if you rub it in too much as it dries the bronzer residue beads up and rubs off.</li>
            <li> it was a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> the salon I go to wants around $50</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really tried it in the tanning bed since it&#x27;s summer time</li>
            <li> Love the aroma, goes on easy, I darken quickly, it&#x27;s not greasy and helps my tan last longer.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars as i have used other lotions that have gotten me darker, but this one did a good job too.</li>
            <li> This lotion is okay, but I prefer to use other lotions over this one.</li>
            <li> Glad I found a lotion that doesn&#x27;t smell too strong and actually can be noticed after a few days of tanning..</li>
            <li> The first day it left my skin a little burned but the next day it was beautiful.</li>
            <li> and I will definitely purchase it again in the near future for a nice color.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and have been tanning to build my base tan with a light bronzer.</li>
            <li> I think it had a nice light scent that was slightly musky, slightly vanilla.</li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed and a heads up for anyone else who isn&#x27;t sure, Don&#x27;t wear white when using this product.</li>
            <li> Price was decent</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly care for the smell and it does nothing to mask the &amp;#34;i</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have only used a few applications, but so far it doesn&#x27;t do much more than lightly tint my skin.  </li>
            <li> Recommend and highly recommend vendor as well.</li>
            <li> ED HARDY lotion may not have worked for you, but i always have a bottle in my tanning arsenal &amp; i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Charged me 6.50 for a little packet of this, so I am glad to see it on here for 20 bucks.</li>
            <li> It works very well and natural as a Bronze r too ...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally tan</li>
            <li> The only downsides is make sure your skin is almost dry before you put on your clothes (I&#x27;ve never had it stain my clothes</li>
            <li> but I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> if your looking to try something new, this is it.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely light complextion, but after using this product only twice I can definitely see my skin beginning to bronze.</li>
            <li> Love that it gave me a little bronze color after tanning each time with it!</li>
            <li> Very natural looking tan for a bronzer.</li>
            <li> I could tell that it was working within the first week (by the 3rd day).</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell flowery like other lotions that are clearly aimed more for female users.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that I consider a down fall to it is that you have to make sure you rub your hands thoroughly after you apply, or else in between your fingers</li>
            <li> will give me a good base tan and set the stage for something strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different tanning lotions before &amp; will never use a different kind as long as this one is made!</li>
            <li> It has a natural bronzer in it, so not only do you tan fast naturally, but your using a bronzer as well!</li>
            <li> Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was it didn&#x27;t last very long, but it is definitely worth the price I paid!!</li>
            <li> After tanning, my skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> The only downfall is once I&#x27;m done tanning, I really do smell like it</li>
            <li> I just bought old lady smelling lotion.</li>
            <li> The smell is different from anything I have ever used, but I do really like that too.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and enhances my color without looking fake.</li>
            <li> To get your base tan this one is by far the best !</li>
            <li> but I am certainly not very dark.</li>
            <li> and a little goes a long way, and it has shimmer tint in it :)</li>
            <li> Used a little spot remover and it came right out though!</li>
            <li> I usually do not tan on the first day (even with other tanning lotions that I&#x27;ve tried) but</li>
            <li> It was very dark when put on and streaked even when putting on using circular motions, Once done,it wiped off with a rag and after about 6 hours, got in the shower and came right off!</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s a major difference!</li>
            <li> Super dark bronzer!</li>
            <li> I chose this product because the price was reasonably low and I am new to using indoor tanning beds.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the smell and texture - it doesnt make you smell weird after and is very neutral smelling.</li>
            <li> Bought my first bottle last year, paid 3X as much at the salon recently ran out and was trying other lotions... just ended up taking the risk of buy lotion from internet.</li>
            <li> Got dark after first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion now 4 times and can barely even tell.</li>
            <li> well but barely helped me tan.</li>
            <li> but you can barely see it.</li>
            <li> Maybe when you search for lotions in the future you should start by bringing wipes to the tanning bed with you, read the description listed as \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; to get an idea of what it might smell like &amp; tell your friend to purchase lotions from the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; section.</li>
            <li> It smells good but it drives me crazy at times.</li>
            <li> For a high end lotion, it&#x27;s not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I saw results within the first few visits.</li>
            <li> A good starting point that doesn&#x27;t have bad smell and doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy to me.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a bad smell but gives you a great dark color.</li>
            <li> Before I started using this I was using designer skin products (queen lotion) which worked great, but spending 30+ dollars every month (at least!) was expensive for me.</li>
            <li> I still apply a regular lotion 2-3 times a day so my skin doesn&#x27;t dry or flake.</li>
            <li> I live in St. Louis and it&#x27;s been 100 degrees everyday for like 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> It remains on your skin long after applying and tanning, unlike some that wear off - leaving your skin feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> I still had a little on my hands and put my shirt back on and found that it left tan marks on my shirt.</li>
            <li> I learned to not be so cheap with myself, at least in this case I did not win with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Especially if you tan on your lunch break everyday.</li>
            <li> nice color to start with in spring and do a couple tans just to get a base</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit watery but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stain hands like other bronzers.</li>
            <li> Would not purchase again due to smell but just not my taste.</li>
            <li> I dont know about these other people, but this lotion sucked for me.  </li>
            <li> Not like other tanning lotions ive used..</li>
            <li> but you get orange hands if not washed or wiped off but other than that</li>
            <li> With this I had to go EVERY SINGLE DAY!!!</li>
            <li> It usually takes me forever to tan, and with this lotion it doesn&#x27;t take long at all.</li>
            <li> This made me really dark.</li>
            <li> Not the typical coconut smell.</li>
            <li> Than Black and this Ed Hardy Hollywood Bronze are AWESOME!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin has a harder time getting a brownish color to it and instead usually turns orange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tanned for most of my life and usually get the base tan and go 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking to get a strong base tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any bronzing but does have a little shimmer to it.</li>
            <li> The bronzer wasn&#x27;t as dark as I thought it would be!</li>
            <li> I did notice that I had a little spot on my shirt from it.</li>
            <li> It seemed runny and doesnt get me very dark.</li>
            <li> The scent is not overpowering and the bronzer starts to work within a few applications,no orangey residue or staining..</li>
            <li> But after a few times using I wasn&#x27;t getting any darker.</li>
            <li> After tanning i have had quite a few people chasing me around...</li>
            <li> The smell is not fabulous either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was also delivered within a few days of ordering.</li>
            <li> There was no streaking or odd smell to it!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not even half way gone!</li>
            <li> Smells pretty bad out of the bottle but improves a little after tanning.</li>
            <li> but after you get out of the tanning bed you smell pretty bad.</li>
            <li> It did have decent bronzers, instant color, but the reason I hated to use this lotion was it has a residue that does not fully absorb into your skin</li>
            <li> not sure if I just didn&#x27;t read the description thoroughl or not.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t my favorite but isn&#x27;t terrible either, I think for the price I paid</li>
            <li> And being a very pale girl, needed all the bronzing help I can get.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who wants to tan, but doesn&#x27;t want that nasty coconut smell on them all day long.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get me crazy dark</li>
            <li> Worse</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a fake, or maybe the product just sucks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great at moisturizing your skin though, I have to use lotion 6 times a day otherwise my stomach and legs look ashy.</li>
            <li> I hate it for whoever said they tried this lotion &amp; basically said the opposite of everything i said &amp; that someone you know got a rash from it.</li>
            <li> That was dumb!</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t bad, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Kinda weird to describe.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try a few different cheaper products, all of which I HATED, they didn&#x27;t work and smelt horrible.</li>
            <li> Drives me crazy.</li>
            <li> But, I think it&#x27;s because I was sweating so bad.</li>
            <li> did not work well was disappointed</li>
            <li> and it takes me FOREVER to get a base tan.</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The worst tanning lotion I have ever bought.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Lotion helps with a great bronze tan.  Lotion smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy.Great price for the size of lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion is okay, but I prefer to use other lotions over this one. Was not a bad product for the price.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF! it gets me so dark - and i&#x27;m someone that doesn&#x27;t tan very easily! Im also a spaz when it comed to applying it and i never get streaky!</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and have been tanning to build my base tan with a light bronzer. I was looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t make me look orange or streak and this was it! I love this bronzer and will use it from now on! It really gives your skin a great deep golden brown.  I love how it makes my skin feel because it&#x27;s silicone based. Order this and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This lotion has a bad smell but gives you a great dark color.Fast service.I will order more at this price</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money and I will definitely purchase it again in the near future for a nice color.</li>
            <li> Seems good so far.  Doesn&#x27;t really have a bronzed, which is fine with me but others may want it. Smells good and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion. Love the color! The smell is really strong though. It smells good but it drives me crazy at times. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a nice bronze color tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product! I have extremely sensitive skin when it comes to using most products. I&#x27;ve even tried organic bronzers and broke out in rashes. Not with this! There was no streaking or odd smell to it! It&#x27;s wonderful!  The only thing I noticed and a heads up for anyone else who isn&#x27;t sure, Don&#x27;t wear white when using this product. I still had a little on my hands and put my shirt back on and found that it left tan marks on my shirt. Used a little spot remover and it came right out though!</li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion is great. Not the typical coconut smell. More like a sugary sweet type. The bronzers are pretty good. Nothing extremely special but the price for this lotion was great. I will buy it again probably.</li>
            <li> Fast service and one of the better lotions for the price. I would definitely try it out if you haven&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Great lotion! Smells good and gives a good tan!</li>
            <li> Gives a nice glow. The first day it left my skin a little burned but the next day it was beautiful. The smell is amazing and leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion.  Doesn&#x27;t take much and very easy to apply - goes on very smoothly.  I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now and can notice a remarkable difference in color.  After tanning, my skin feels so soft.  It remains on your skin long after applying and tanning, unlike some that wear off - leaving your skin feeling dry.  The smell is not overpowering, and quite pleasant.  Great product for the price!  I will be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> Used once. No difference buy local</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty light skinned and it takes me FOREVER to get a base tan. I had been tanning for a bit, got this lotion and used it twice and there&#x27;s a major difference! I love it!</li>
            <li> Smells good going on and after. It gives you a nice glow till you can work up your tan :)</li>
            <li> did not work well was disappointed</li>
            <li> I love everything about this tanning lotion!  It smells great and definitely helps the tanning process along.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to tan, but doesn&#x27;t want that nasty coconut smell on them all day long.</li>
            <li> I really like the color this gave me without being orange at all.</li>
            <li> Probably one of the best tanning lotions I have used! Noticed a darker tan the first day!  Highly recommend. Great price with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally tan well but this product helped. I liked the consistency and applied evenly. I will purchase again. Shipping speed was fast as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for about 3 weeks and am tanner than I have ever been using a indoor tanning bed. It usually takes me forever to tan, and with this lotion it doesn&#x27;t take long at all. I saw results within the first few visits. It has a light smell, and actually smells pretty good as far as tanning lotion goes. I definitely reccomend this lotion.</li>
            <li> Hope it works as Great as it Smells....</li>
            <li> Works good. But when I got the package the lotion had spilled all over the inside of the package. Not too happy about this.</li>
            <li> Light, not greasy, nice fragrance but not too strong.  I&#x27;m fair skinned but tanning with a nice red/brown color that looks like a natural sun tan for me. Great price!</li>
            <li> I used this in the Tanning Bed and then I used it on my Cruise to Mexico.  I agree this help moisten then skin from peeling, smells very nice and it does seem to promote a very dark Tan. It works very well and natural as a Bronze r too ...</li>
            <li> this product is only used for tanning beds and not for cosmetic purposes. not sure if I just didn&#x27;t read the description thoroughl or not. also, they will not accept refunds.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this, I was expecting a tanning \\&quot;lotion\\&quot;. I got this tanning catalyzer instead that you use after you tan. It doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture either. Mine has a pump and is white, the only thing that is the same is that it&#x27;s Ed Hardy.</li>
            <li> This lotion will leave your skin gleaming! It has a natural bronzer in it, so not only do you tan fast naturally, but your using a bronzer as well! It gives your skin a nice glimmery appearance and it smells amazing. The only thing that I consider a down fall to it is that you have to make sure you rub your hands thoroughly after you apply, or else in between your fingers you&#x27;ll have streaks of brown. Other than that its a great lotion.</li>
            <li> Broke out on hives!! Turn you orange and broke me out in hives. Worse Ed Hardy I have ever tryed the others have been great!</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than what it said it would. Also smells awesomeeeeeee can&#x27;t wait to see how it works will write a review about that in two to three days</li>
            <li> Best tanner I have ever purchased!!! The scent is not overpowering and the bronzer starts to work within a few applications,no orangey residue or staining..</li>
            <li> I tried this lotion about 6 months ago for indoor tanning. My skin has a harder time getting a brownish color to it and instead usually turns orange. With this lotion I am finally tan, brown not orange:) I could see a difference even after one usage. Smells wonderful as well but tends to have a slight odor after tanning. Hope they keep this in stock through amazon, I love this stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> Loved this lotion. It gave me a great color and a really good smell. It doesn&#x27;t stain hands like other bronzers.</li>
            <li> Bought my first bottle last year, paid 3X as much at the salon recently ran out and was trying other lotions... just ended up taking the risk of buy lotion from internet. ordered 2 bottles case i run out and its discontinued. Gives great bronzing effect, never steaks never get orange palms or orangie anything. Immediate bronzers help you feel satisfied after just one session. Also great for tan-toos, get great prints while using this lotion.</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Love it!</li>
            <li> I am very fair skin (blonde hair, blue eyes) and this works great for me.  Used to buy Spellbound which also works great but its more expensive so I tried this.  Saw results in just a couple days.  Will definitly buy again.</li>
            <li> The Lotion is great :) It gives you a golden glow,&lt;br /&gt;Def wash your hands after its applied, the palms will look a little golden but overall good product :)</li>
            <li> It seemed runny and doesnt get me very dark. Maybe I got a fake, or maybe the product just sucks. Im getting something else next time!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product good start up tanning lotion for myself my boyfriend I believe likes it as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different tanning lotions before &amp; will never use a different kind as long as this one is made! I am fair (blonde hair &amp; blue eyes). Very natural looking tan for a bronzer. Nice smell as well. My husband went tanning before vacation last year &amp; he liked using it as well!</li>
            <li> I love the way that my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li> Got dark after first use. But after a few times using I wasn&#x27;t getting any darker. I only tan about 3 to 4 days a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion now 4 times and can barely even tell. Nothing special and I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion for a great price! I bought this as my starter lotion to start in the tanning beds. After about 2 wks, I started to develop a great natural looking tan. I have been using it about 2 months now and my tan is great, but the lotion is almost gone! I would buy this again! The only downfall is once I&#x27;m done tanning, I really do smell like it haha! But it&#x27;s not a horrible smell.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, my color seems to last longer as well. NO BURNT COCONUT SMELL. Love this! This product also doesn&#x27;t seem like it streaks your skin which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> I really like that this doesn&#x27;t have the burnt smell allot of the lotions have after you tan, however, I&#x27;m only giving it three stars for its tanning part....I tan pretty easy, this just seemed like I had to stay on top of my tanning more</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion works well but it def has a lot of bronzer in it &amp; so I literally had to tan everyday to keep it looking good. I&#x27;ve tanned for most of my life and usually get the base tan and go 2-3 times a week. With this I had to go EVERY SINGLE DAY!!!</li>
            <li> I just started tanning again after having my baby and this lotion is amazing. Smells so good and enhances my color without looking fake. My skin smells good all day even after tanning and is so soft.</li>
            <li> As a bronzer I was not overly impressed.  I have only used a few applications, but so far it doesn&#x27;t do much more than lightly tint my skin.  The smell is nice and doesn&#x27;t smell like you just got out of a tanning bed so that is a plus and it&#x27;s performance is better than nothing.  It does go on smoothly with no streaks but I&#x27;m sure there are better products.</li>
            <li> I almost finished up my bottle of ed hardy Hollywood bronze and decided to purchase another bottle. I received it in time but when I opened it to smell it, it was a completely different smell than my last ed hardy bottle. I put a dime size amount on my forearm and there wasn&#x27;t ANY sign of a bronzer And thought, oh great I just bought old lady smelling lotion. The three stars is for the customer service I had to contact to get my money back.</li>
            <li> too bronzy. Smelled good though. received before the date they said. don&#x27;t like the way it feels after I&#x27;ve tanned.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells!!!</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good. I am keeping my great tan with it. Downside is it&#x27;s runny and greasy. But overall ok</li>
            <li> Worked ok. Wasn&#x27;t fantastic. Moisturized well but barely helped me tan. And I tan easily. I felt that I tanned better without the potion</li>
            <li> Love it!!!  This is an amazing tanning product!!  I will definitely purchase this product again.  It arrived in the mail quickly and I&#x27;ve been using it every since!</li>
            <li> This product smells good when you put it in but after you get out of the tanning bed you smell pretty bad. Would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> The perfume smell of this is VERY strong, but the bronzer in this works reeeeeally well. I would suggest tanning in the morning and just using the lotion as your perfume, haha.</li>
            <li> Works well. Haven&#x27;t noticed any bronzing but does have a little shimmer to it. Smells pretty bad out of the bottle but improves a little after tanning. Not what I would call &amp;#34;candy kiss&amp;#34; scented. More like a floral type smell. Would not purchase again due to smell but just not my taste.</li>
            <li> Found bronzer to have a nice dark and even tone. Will be especially good for those who prefer lotion to silicone. Recommend and highly recommend vendor as well.</li>
            <li> Have tried other lotions but still love this the most. Good consistency and works very well. Smell could be a tiny bit better but I would buy again regardless.</li>
            <li> The worst tanning lotion I have ever bought. The bronzer beaded up and wiped off as soon as I got out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I work in a tanning salon and try tons of different lotions. For the price, this lotion is great! It does have a shimmer to it but you can barely see it. Definitely gives me great color, no orange streakiness at all! Smells great too!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Feels silky and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Im on my 3rd bottle of this lotion ...I been tanning for year&#x27;s and have used many many lotions ..This lotion is the best ...great color noticed I was darker by second day of using the lotion . I will be sticking with this lotion love love it ..</li>
            <li> what a beautiful glow for this lotion, the sparkle is nice and as well the smell is quite yummy. After tanning i have had quite a few people chasing me around... Either way this is a great bronzer and a wonderful edition to a base tan.</li>
            <li> I liked this product. The bronzer wasn&#x27;t as dark as I thought it would be! But works pretty well. Although the smell was not so pleasent.</li>
            <li> Have only used once so far, but love the smell! I think this will be a great lotion!</li>
            <li> I used this product for over a month. While I did tan it just wasn&#x27;t that great in my opinion. The smell is not fabulous either. Will go with something else next time.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin so building and keeping a tan can be a task. I&#x27;ve found using this twice or three times a week will give me a good base tan and set the stage for something strong. A good starting point that doesn&#x27;t have bad smell and doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy to me.</li>
            <li> I always order this from Amazon. My gym charges $28 for the same bottle. Amazon always has it for less than $15, It also smells really nice. It is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I really liked this lotion. I think it had a nice light scent that was slightly musky, slightly vanilla. I tried a sample packet of this at the salon today when they didn&#x27;t have the lotion I was looking for. Charged me 6.50 for a little packet of this, so I am glad to see it on here for 20 bucks. I don&#x27;t burn easily, but I don&#x27;t tan easily either, I am caucasian and part french, but I don&#x27;t have nice olive skin, I have something kind of inbetween. Anyways, this has a bit of glimmer to it and my skin looked and felt pretty nice.</li>
            <li> Used this lotion for several applications but just didn&#x27;t like it mostly because of the bronzer in it and how it stains your clothes. Stains do wash out in laundry but this product is not for me.</li>
            <li> this is a good bronzer lotion for those who don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on salon lotions but still want to get good results. It&#x27;s a bit watery but a little goes a long way. The scent isn&#x27;t my favorite but isn&#x27;t terrible either, I think for the price I paid I just can&#x27;t complain regardless when there are $160 tanning lotions  being sold at salons that don&#x27;t do anything more than a $50 lotion would do!</li>
            <li> Price was decent that&#x27;s why I got it. I guess you get what you pay for. Leaves stains on your clothes, doesn&#x27;t even get you a nice skin color, I feel like I haven&#x27;t even tanned. I learned to not be so cheap with myself, at least in this case I did not win with the purchase.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with this, works perfect for my wife and myself. nice color to start with in spring and do a couple tans just to get a base and then outside in the sun works good too.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for over 6 yrs. I used all types of tanning lotions &amp; this one has by far been my favorite! The smell is amazing not to strong. I see instant result even the tanning cashier said I looked tan when I came out. Although do not wear white after using this product it will stain your clothing.  I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> All I buy is Ed Hardy. Body shots is my favorite but I wanted to try something new. This is an excellent product for the average tanner. But for me its body shots until Ed Hardy makes a bronzer/tingle to top it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! I love it! Love the price also. I will be definitely be ordering this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Great for getting some color fast. Make sure to exfoliate after each use. Smells nice, too.</li>
            <li> This is some good stuff !!! Tans well</li>
            <li> Not only is this an amazing and effective bronzer but it also has a shimmer effect! On top of that this is the first lotion I have found that smells really good before AND after tanning. Ladies, you dont know how important that it! Especially if you tan on your lunch break everyday. Im sure you already know this if you have looked into the description but it is an anti-aging and firming lotion as well. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Loved this lotion! Smells great and works good too! Love that it gave me a little bronze color after tanning each time with it! Will Oder again and would recommend it to anyone else. Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was it didn&#x27;t last very long, but it is definitely worth the price I paid!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It doesn&#x27;t streak and it smells great before and after tanning. It&#x27;s not great at moisturizing your skin though, I have to use lotion 6 times a day otherwise my stomach and legs look ashy. And I tan about 3-4 a week. It does give great color though and it&#x27;s not orange at all. Definitely my new favorite lotion!</li>
            <li> ordered multiple times from my new friends at Thee Tan Man and extremely satisfied EVERY time! I work at a gym/tan salon and own my own bed, I wouldnt go anywhere but here!</li>
            <li> I bought this tanning lotion because I was needing something that had a bronzer in it. I had been using Swedish Beauty intensifier and wasn&#x27;t really seeing a difference in color. I must have been in a plateau or something. This made me really dark. I even took a shower about 1 hour after I tanned and it didn&#x27;t come off. I did notice that I had a little spot on my shirt from it. But, I think it&#x27;s because I was sweating so bad. I live in St. Louis and it&#x27;s been 100 degrees everyday for like 2 weeks! So, all in all this lotion is worth the $$ and it smells really nice too. It&#x27;s like a musky but sweet smell. Kinda weird to describe. The price is EXCELLENT compared to the salons. I paid $65 dollars for my first bottle of lotion in March. That was dumb! I will only buy on Amazon from now on! OOh and a little goes a long way, and it has shimmer tint in it :)</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been tanning for many years, tried a million lotions &amp; this is by far my favorite. please don&#x27;t discontinue or take it away. this lotion gives you the best color, smells great, goes on like silk, doesn&#x27;t streak, &amp; i love the price. i&#x27;ve ordered several bottles &amp; continue to use this as my staple tanning supply. KUDOS to the maker&#x27;s of this product...finally, a lotion that has it all &amp; doesn&#x27;t hurt my wallet!!!! if your looking to try something new, this is it. i promise you will be happy &amp; praise the tanning gods for finally giving you \\&quot;THE GREATEST TANNING LOTION OF ALL TIME.\\&quot; Happy Tanning &amp; thanks ED HARDY!!!! I hate it for whoever said they tried this lotion &amp; basically said the opposite of everything i said &amp; that someone you know got a rash from it. Clearly, you can see by all the comments that this is a good lotion. Lotions do streak if there not put on properly &amp; not everyone has the same taste in a scent for their lotion. I&#x27;m sure you can get a rash from anything you try, i&#x27;m allergic to neosporin. Maybe when you search for lotions in the future you should start by bringing wipes to the tanning bed with you, read the description listed as \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; to get an idea of what it might smell like &amp; tell your friend to purchase lotions from the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; section. I can&#x27;t help but to disagree with you on this one. ED HARDY lotion may not have worked for you, but i always have a bottle in my tanning arsenal &amp; i highly recommend it. Maybe ED HARDY should expand instead of keeping to clothes &amp; perfume.....starting with items that cater to the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; kind of customers.</li>
            <li> I dont know about these other people, but this lotion sucked for me.  It DOES streak, it has a funny smell after tanning (not that pleasant before, either) and it wasnt very moisturizing.  Also, my friend used it and she got a rash all over.  I&#x27;d reccomend anything from designer skin. Only thing Ed Hardy is good for is clothes and perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product maybe 4 times and it&#x27;s nothing really special. The smell is okay, pretty sweet scented. There&#x27;s shimmer but it&#x27;s not overpowering. It doesn&#x27;t get me crazy dark but I am tanner. For a high end lotion, it&#x27;s not very moisturizing. I still apply a regular lotion 2-3 times a day so my skin doesn&#x27;t dry or flake. The product isn&#x27;t bad, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a nice smell and good coloring and no streaking. I will definitely be buying this lotion again!</li>
            <li> Very good lotion with bronzers and a light shimmer to it. Smells great before and even after tanning. recommended!! awesome!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion can tell a difference after one tan!! I have fair skin and it works and feels great</li>
            <li> This lotion smells amazing and gives a nice rich color. I&#x27;m going to buy another bottle to make sure I have plenty on hand.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I was searching to find a tanning lotion to begin tanning. I didn&#x27;t know which was best so I just started looking through, reading the products and some reviews about them. I happened to come across this one because of the color...I like pink lol. Anyways, what really got my curiosity going about it was that it says it targets anti-aging and firming. I see a lot of tanners that start looking &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; (as in they get wrinkly) after tanning a while and I didn&#x27;t want that for me, so I was very hesitant. But with this lotion it has me looking younger than what I am. I am 26 and was looking like I was in my 30s , but now I have had people say that I look 21-22. And it really does give you that Hollywood tan...not an orange tan. I started in a 10 min bed at 5 mins for 2 weeks and then within a week more, I was at the full 10 mins. I could tell that it was working within the first week (by the 3rd day). I would recommend this to anyone who tans, especially fair skin people(like me).</li>
            <li> I started tanning for a trip to Oahu, HI. And being a very pale girl, needed all the bronzing help I can get. This really seemed to work well.&lt;br /&gt;I’m still tanned, and also can’t wait to go back to Hawaii. I would definitely buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;It was also delivered within a few days of ordering.</li>
            <li> Love this really helps with your tan</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion last summer and I had the best tan I have ever had in my life! Smells great too! I plan to buy more for sure!</li>
            <li> It has the bronzing like it states but it has a strong perfume smell.. Not like other tanning lotions ive used.. But once smells not so strong love the color glow you get!</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion looks great! I was seeing results within a couple weeks. I have been tanning for about a month and it&#x27;s not even half way gone!</li>
            <li> Before buying this product I read the reviews decided to purchase it due to the great ratings. I usually do not tan on the first day (even with other tanning lotions that I&#x27;ve tried) but with this lotion I noticed a big difference. I was actually tan, people even noticed it. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> It was a very fast delivery and nothing against the seller at all. The lotion just was not for me. It was very dark when put on and streaked even when putting on using circular motions, Once done,it wiped off with a rag and after about 6 hours, got in the shower and came right off! Not the product for me</li>
            <li> I love it and I love the smell but you get orange hands if not washed or wiped off but other than that its great!</li>
            <li> Great results for the price.  Doesn&#x27;t smell flowery like other lotions that are clearly aimed more for female users.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> To get your base tan this one is by far the best ! The scent it nice, you don&#x27;t turn orange. Simply amazing.</li>
            <li> Great product, works perfect!</li>
            <li> I gave this lotion to a friend because I couldn&#x27;t stand it compared to my Designer Skin lotions. The scent is nice, not too strong but it&#x27;s not like the Ed Hardy Perfume. It did have decent bronzers, instant color, but the reason I hated to use this lotion was it has a residue that does not fully absorb into your skin so if you rub it in too much as it dries the bronzer residue beads up and rubs off. Drives me crazy.</li>
            <li> I use a tanning salon often and have bought lotions for $100+ that don&#x27;t perform like this product.  This a truly great product.  Stock up...I bought one to try and am &amp;#34;very&amp;#34; happy, yherefore i just sent in an order for 3 more.  Try it.....and you will be so amazed that you will stock up too!</li>
            <li> Best bronzed I have ever used smells amazing and works QUICK!! Love it and would recommend this product to all my Friends that are tanners. Leaves your skin so smooth!!</li>
            <li> I have used so so many different lotions, this one is top notch!!&lt;br /&gt;-Darker Than Black and this Ed Hardy Hollywood Bronze are AWESOME!!&lt;br /&gt;I love tanning, but I am certainly not very dark. When I do tan, I like my quality lotion to leave my hands bronzed... then I know it has some nice bronzers in it. This one does the trick... one thing to be mindful of, try not to wear light/white clothing after tanning with it. Also, it has a shimmer to it. :) I like the shimmer a lot, it is just something I did not expect. The smell is different from anything I have ever used, but I do really like that too. I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I really thought it was waste my money but it was better than nothing at the time and it was a reasonable price.  but I won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Great price! Works good and smells great! Does not irritate skin either!</li>
            <li> I love Ed Hardy products for tanning and I like to save money. This product I am sure will be amazing. I can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> The bronzer is ok but what I really like is the scent left after tanning. You don&#x27;t have that stinky burnt smell, just a clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great! It smells amazing! Its not greasy and oily! Its really light! I love it! Im pretty pale, so using this when i go tanning works perfectly! Its not too dark to where i look unaturally tan, its perfect!</li>
            <li> Before I started using this I was using designer skin products (queen lotion) which worked great, but spending 30+ dollars every month (at least!) was expensive for me. So I decided to try a few different cheaper products, all of which I HATED, they didn&#x27;t work and smelt horrible. But this stuff works great! It&#x27;s moisturizing, gets you nice color and and smells good, it also gives you a light sparkle. The only downsides is make sure your skin is almost dry before you put on your clothes (I&#x27;ve never had it stain my clothes but I always make sure I&#x27;m mostly dry before I put on my clothes) another is make sure you rub it in we&#x27;ll, I&#x27;ve had some discoloration around my ankles when I didn&#x27;t rub it in perfect (the good thing is just make sure you rub it off quick after you get out of the tanning bed and it goes away) but this product works great, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> This lotions feels great and helps get you a great color. This bronzer does not stain my hands, does not streak and smells good.</li>
            <li> Another one i love. Just a reminder to wipe hands off because it would discolor alittle bit. For sure would by again.</li>
            <li> I loved this bronzer. I&#x27;ve worked for tanning salons over the last 6 years and tried all kinds of lotions. This gives good color fast and has a very pleasant smell. Great guy for the money!! WIll def repurchase this.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any help with this tanning lotion.. smell nice but it worked just as well as the cheap one I bought at sally&#x27;s beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> The bronzing in this really works! Glad I found a lotion that doesn&#x27;t smell too strong and actually can be noticed after a few days of tanning.. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Received it on the exact day I was promised.</li>
            <li> Have not used th tanning lotion yet b ut others have I do know that it has a good smell</li>
            <li> excellent lotion - makes skin feel soft and smooth...thinking about ordering a few more....plus great price - the salon I go to wants around $50</li>
            <li> I love this product  will buy it again.</li>
            <li> got here sooner than expected, &amp; for such a great deal!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really tried it in the tanning bed since it&#x27;s summer time and I like to get a natural tan outside in the sun, but it does smell nice.</li>
            <li> Smelled nice, went on smooth/even, and the bronzers gave a nice glow that wasn&#x27;t orange and had a just a hint of shimmer. Overall it was nice for the price, worth a try. I will NOT be purchasing again though, there wasn&#x27;t anything too special about it.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price, but not my favorite tanning lotion. I probably won&#x27;t buy again. My brother got Pauly D lotion and it is a better bronzer...i might try that kind next. But, for the price, this stuff works ok. I don&#x27;t particularly care for the smell and it does nothing to mask the &amp;#34;i just got done tanning&amp;#34; smell after you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> Super dark bronzer! I love it! and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Good product, would buy again</li>
            <li> I have been using this tanning lotion for 3 years now.  It works great.  I recommend buying it online because it is 35.00 in the salon.  It has a nice sparkle to it but doesnt look like your covered in glitter.  it gives you a really nice tan, and the bronzer in it gives the tan look while your actual tan has time to develop. I never use anything different since I started using this.</li>
            <li> This smells so good to me!!  I got it in like two days!&lt;br /&gt;Its probably the best lotion I&#x27;ve ordered!</li>
            <li> Bought this hoping it would be okay and found it to be very good. Love the aroma, goes on easy, I darken quickly, it&#x27;s not greasy and helps my tan last longer. This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the smell and texture - it doesnt make you smell weird after and is very neutral smelling. Would be great for a girl or a guy. I only gave it 4 stars as i have used other lotions that have gotten me darker, but this one did a good job too.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because the price was reasonably low and I am new to using indoor tanning beds. I have an extremely light complextion, but after using this product only twice I can definitely see my skin beginning to bronze. It leaves no oily texture on your skin and doesn&#x27;t streak. It smells great, as well! I would recommend this product to anyone looking to get a strong base tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the shipping was quick! I received the item two days before my estimated arrival time. Happy tanning!</li>
            <li> This is some of the best smelling tanning lotion I have ever used. No awful after tanning session smell. Amazing!</li>
