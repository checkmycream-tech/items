            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>I bought a tube of it..and liked it so well</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s their standard is pleasant without being too saccharine, while the pomegranate smells absolutely delicious.</li>
            <li>It smells great and most importantly</li>
            <li>This one is a good one, as it does not stay greasy and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>Although it smells delicious and is all natural, I didn&#x27;t find that it gave me the sunscreen protection I needed.</li>
            <li>This feels good on my skin, and any odor disappears quickly.</li>
            <li>I love that this doesn&#x27;t have any parabens, is 30 SPF and smells like oranges.</li>
            <li>Smells interesting.</li>
            <li>Glad Amazon&lt;</li>
            <li>br /&gt;always has it available!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen is ok.</li>
            <li>The extra moisturizing it provides is just a bonus, as is the Vitamin C.  Excellent product!!!!!!</li>
            <li>kids love the smell.</li>
            <li>I suppose I would have to say it might be better for girls or children because of this</li>
            <li>Okay in the pool, needs reapplied often if swimming (like most sunscreens).</li>
            <li>The kids love the smell.</li>
            <li>All Naked Bee products are the best.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and it smells great.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>However, because my test patch showed no sign of reaction, I decided I would be able to use</li>
            <li>Either way, I will not be able to use this product after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells like cheap cherry candy smell!</li>
            <li>Love this product because I don&#x27;t smell like I have sunscreen on ...</li>
            <li>I love these products and use them all the time.</li>
            <li>and so glad that I did..</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll know for sure then.</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean smell to it..not perfumy type of smell...</li>
            <li>For me, the scent is very much honey and vanilla, not the bright, citrusy orange blossom I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Smells Great, No skin irritation, Grandbaby-safe &amp; they love it!&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing is nice too, I use their facial moisturizer w/Suncreen though for face.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li>It feels smooth and creamy without leaving a residue or sticky feeling where applied, and the moisturizing effect is most noticeable over rougher areas (elbows, knees,</li>
            <li>its really a great natural product.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance and it glides smoothly on skin.</li>
            <li>This product has cured all that and protects from the sun very well, smells good as well.</li>
            <li>We have fair and sensitive skin and The Naked Bee works wonderfully for us.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave a white tint and smells really good!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t get burned (I burn easy)</li>
            <li>It is so strong.</li>
            <li>The product is not greasy but does have a strong scent.  </li>
            <li>Like a lightly scented candle--that is the smell.</li>
            <li>Love all the natural ingredients and it does feel nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to go through a bottle quickly</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, applies smoothly, works well as a primer for under my makeup, and leaves my skin feeling so soft!</li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful--I highly recommend it as a sunscreen not only because the lotion is not greasy and it is easy to rub in, but also because you will want to put this on every day because it smells so good!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d been searching for such a sunscreen that would moisten (winter) and yet not be greasy (summer).&lt;br /&gt;The smell is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>It has a sweet, cloying scent.</li>
            <li>naked bee is always good</li>
            <li>I really want to love this product.</li>
            <li>I was worried the first time I used it because the scent was really strong, but eventually it faded and I didn&#x27;t notice it anymore.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it, the fact that it&#x27;s mostly organic and how it moisturizes your skin, however I tested it in Florida last month by applying it 20 minutes before a 45 minute walk on the beach.</li>
            <li>I prefer this over normal sunscreen except I do have to put more on like every 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Great product, goes on a little bit white, but not nearly as bad as most sunscreens!</li>
            <li>This is it, plus it&#x27;s mostly natural, which is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Sweet smelling, light weight and all natural.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of orange blossoms (i.e. actual orange blossoms, Jo Malone orange blossom cologne...), but the scent of this sunscreen is much too strong and almost sickly-sweet.</li>
            <li>My family and I are very sensitive to perfumes, and although I&#x27;ve gotten used to this one, there are certain family members around whom I won&#x27;t be able to use this lotion.</li>
            <li>I prefer more natural ingredients, and I feel safe and protected wearing Naked Bee.  </li>
            <li>Overall, though, a great product and I would definitely recommend it.  </li>
            <li>It also helps to dispense a smaller and more uniformed quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sunscreen was the reason we purchased this for the first time, but the quality ingredients and skin soothing abilities is why we&#x27;ve purchased it again.  </li>
            <li>Make no mistake, this cream/lotion smells exactly like a perfume, or what you would expect a &#x27;perfumed&#x27; lotion to smell like.</li>
            <li>This product performed as advertised during a week in a Montana hot spell June 27-July 5, 2015.</li>
            <li>They make your skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absorbed by skin instantly leaving nothing but a smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>I can safely wear it anywhere on my body without a rash or stinging, though I am still careful applying it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only complaint is that if it gets into my eyes, it burns - kind of like most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>If I wanted a perfumed lotion, I would have bought one for that very reason.</li>
            <li>haha  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product while on vacation in a very humid location.  </li>
            <li>It bothered me so much while wearing it.</li>
            <li>, it protects our skin very well.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is thick and creamy and feels good to put on.</li>
            <li>Great product not really sure why the title indicates that it can be used as a facial moisturizer as well</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve long liked Naked Bee for their decadent hand creams.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a different daily moisturizer with SPF, something more organic/natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SPF 30 is great for everyday use though a higher SPF level is necessary for long term exposure or areas with intense sunshine.</li>
            <li>I was concerned as I have extremely sensitive skin and am allergic to many other sunscreens on the market today.  </li>
            <li>So shouldn&#x27;t be too disruptive to a normal office day.  </li>
            <li>sunscreen is a bit more expensive than average drugstore brands, but I still get good protection without all the unwanted additives.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I did not use it on my face as the rash looked even worse as it faded.  </li>
            <li>I also really like that it does not leave a white residue or leave my face shinier than normal.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully, soft scent and leaves skin soft and not greasy</li>
            <li>We wanted to get somewhat of a natural sunscreen for my daughter.</li>
            <li>I like natural smells that are not overpowering.</li>
            <li>My wife and daughter both have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>cannot recommend this product to those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I wish I could like this product as I&#x27;ve been reseraching natural sunscreen for ages.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well and my face feels soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li>However, when I first opened it, I just tried a tiny bit on the back of my hand.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Naked Bee sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Use at least a capful for arms, decollete, and facial area; a golf ball size is about right for the whole body on a day to the pool or the beach.</li>
            <li>I am not sure this gives adequate sun protection.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it much, but I like the other aspects of the sunscreen, so</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I wish it were available in unscented.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen/lotion goes on thick, soaks into my skin quickly and leaves it feeling moisturized for the entire day.</li>

            <li> This product performed as advertised during a week in a Montana hot spell June 27-July 5, 2015.</li>
            <li> They make your skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absorbed by skin instantly leaving nothing but a smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> I can safely wear it anywhere on my body without a rash or stinging, though I am still careful applying it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only complaint is that if it gets into my eyes, it burns - kind of like most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> If I wanted a perfumed lotion, I would have bought one for that very reason.</li>
            <li> haha  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product while on vacation in a very humid location.  </li>
            <li> It bothered me so much while wearing it.</li>
            <li> , it protects our skin very well.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is thick and creamy and feels good to put on.</li>
            <li> Great product not really sure why the title indicates that it can be used as a facial moisturizer as well</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve long liked Naked Bee for their decadent hand creams.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a different daily moisturizer with SPF, something more organic/natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SPF 30 is great for everyday use though a higher SPF level is necessary for long term exposure or areas with intense sunshine.</li>
            <li> I was concerned as I have extremely sensitive skin and am allergic to many other sunscreens on the market today.  </li>
            <li> So shouldn&#x27;t be too disruptive to a normal office day.  </li>
            <li> sunscreen is a bit more expensive than average drugstore brands, but I still get good protection without all the unwanted additives.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I did not use it on my face as the rash looked even worse as it faded.  </li>
            <li> I also really like that it does not leave a white residue or leave my face shinier than normal.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully, soft scent and leaves skin soft and not greasy</li>
            <li> We wanted to get somewhat of a natural sunscreen for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I like natural smells that are not overpowering.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter both have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> cannot recommend this product to those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I wish I could like this product as I&#x27;ve been reseraching natural sunscreen for ages.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well and my face feels soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li> However, when I first opened it, I just tried a tiny bit on the back of my hand.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Naked Bee sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Use at least a capful for arms, decollete, and facial area; a golf ball size is about right for the whole body on a day to the pool or the beach.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this gives adequate sun protection.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it much, but I like the other aspects of the sunscreen, so</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish it were available in unscented.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen/lotion goes on thick, soaks into my skin quickly and leaves it feeling moisturized for the entire day.</li>
            <li> I can tell it stays on my skin for a long while, too, because I can smell the scent of the lotion once again when I wash my face later in the evening or shower the next day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to last quite as long as some others, but reapplying is not a major inconvenience.</li>
            <li> I have mixed skin; dry in the winter and oily in the summer.</li>
            <li> Naked Bee produces a line of organic skin products free of fragrances, dyes, harsh chemicals, and other undesirable additions common to sunscreens and lotions elsewhere.</li>
            <li> just got it and ingredients are DIFFERENT than other websites suggest</li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my face as a daily moisturizer with sun protection.</li>
            <li> So I put less on my forehead so that it&#x27;s less likely to get into my eyes after sweating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It no longer includes Retinyl palmitate (vit A), and some other stuff.  </li>
            <li> Some people may not love it (it does have have a smell after all), but I think it&#x27;s only smellable within like 2inch distance of the skin.</li>
            <li> Will continue to order this and other products form this company</li>
            <li> Other products leave rashes on there skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with melanoma, so am very careful to wear sunscreen every day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this (brighter sun) and oil of Olay SPF 15 (less sun) for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was sunburned after walking, on my face and chest and  after a few days there, very tanned, not what I was going for.</li>
            <li> and I must inform a rather usuful upgrade on the bottle; the dispenser now is in the form of a tip which sticks out rather than a dented hole where some sunscreen will be wasted.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the heavy fragrance of this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it left me with a pronounced red rash on my neck and legs that looked like I was badly sunburned</li>
            <li> For sensitive skin that reacts badly to perfumes and aluminum or other compounds, the sunscreen is a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> and I am not sure if the product reacted with my sweat to cause the rash or the ingredients for the scent caused my neck and legs to react.  </li>
            <li> Crazily, when I washed my hands later, I could still smell the cream!</li>
            <li> I use this on my face under Aveeno face tint and powder,  yet it doesn&#x27;t feel thick or clog my pores.  </li>
            <li> I did a test run on a very small patch of skin on my arm in my air-conditioned home before trying it out in the &amp;#34;real world&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The orange blossom sunscreen avoids that unpleasant sunscreen scent that lingers too long.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the added sticker label on the back  said if you will be swimming or sweating use a water proof sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again unless they change the smell factor.</li>
            <li> I had to return it! :(</li>
            <li> But the smell is too awful!</li>

            <li> I love that this doesn&#x27;t have any parabens, is 30 SPF and smells like oranges. It&#x27;s also non greasy!</li>
            <li> I have mixed skin; dry in the winter and oily in the summer. I reside in NY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d been searching for such a sunscreen that would moisten (winter) and yet not be greasy (summer).&lt;br /&gt;The smell is quite pleasant. It&#x27;s absorbed by skin instantly leaving nothing but a smooth skin.  No allergic reaction in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First bottle I purchased lasted all summer, shared by two people and applied every day, sometimes twice.  I have returned to get a second one and I must inform a rather usuful upgrade on the bottle; the dispenser now is in the form of a tip which sticks out rather than a dented hole where some sunscreen will be wasted.  It also helps to dispense a smaller and more uniformed quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m done paying $20+ for 4oz bottles that don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a different daily moisturizer with SPF, something more organic/natural. I have used this product for 2 days, and I think it goes on nice and feels good on my skin... but it smells way too strong!! I could smell it on myself all day, and my husband can&#x27;t stand it. Unfortunately I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again unless they change the smell factor.</li>
            <li> Obviously there&#x27;s no way this just has Honey and Sunflower Seed Oil as Amazon has listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got it and ingredients are DIFFERENT than other websites suggest...seems they&#x27;ve changed ingredients. It no longer includes Retinyl palmitate (vit A), and some other stuff.  Still SPF 30 though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just used it, it absorbs surprisingly well and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or slimy. Smells interesting. Some people may not love it (it does have have a smell after all), but I think it&#x27;s only smellable within like 2inch distance of the skin. So shouldn&#x27;t be too disruptive to a normal office day.  I don&#x27;t like it much, but I like the other aspects of the sunscreen, so I&#x27;ll keep using it for time being.</li>
            <li> Naked Bee produces a line of organic skin products free of fragrances, dyes, harsh chemicals, and other undesirable additions common to sunscreens and lotions elsewhere. For sensitive skin that reacts badly to perfumes and aluminum or other compounds, the sunscreen is a lifesaver. I can safely wear it anywhere on my body without a rash or stinging, though I am still careful applying it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve long liked Naked Bee for their decadent hand creams. The orange blossom scent that&#x27;s their standard is pleasant without being too saccharine, while the pomegranate smells absolutely delicious. The orange blossom sunscreen avoids that unpleasant sunscreen scent that lingers too long. It feels smooth and creamy without leaving a residue or sticky feeling where applied, and the moisturizing effect is most noticeable over rougher areas (elbows, knees, wrists).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPF 30 is great for everyday use though a higher SPF level is necessary for long term exposure or areas with intense sunshine. I reapply this quite a bit in order to keep protected. Use at least a capful for arms, decollete, and facial area; a golf ball size is about right for the whole body on a day to the pool or the beach. Follow the recommended amounts for maximum protection. It&#x27;s easy to go through a bottle quickly this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is a bit more expensive than average drugstore brands, but I still get good protection without all the unwanted additives.</li>
            <li> Great product not really sure why the title indicates that it can be used as a facial moisturizer as well, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend as it might be greasy</li>
            <li> Great product, goes on a little bit white, but not nearly as bad as most sunscreens!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen since I found it.  It has replaced my perfume, and all day&lt;br /&gt;long, people tell me I smell good. It&#x27;s a combined sunscreen, and moisturizer.  Glad Amazon&lt;br /&gt;always has it available!</li>
            <li> great product. Works wonderfully, soft scent and leaves skin soft and not greasy</li>
            <li> Although it smells delicious and is all natural, I didn&#x27;t find that it gave me the sunscreen protection I needed. I definitely burned after only being in the NJ sun for 2 hours(and reapplied after each hour).&lt;br /&gt;I did give it to a friend that uses it and they have no problem with it.</li>
            <li> We wanted to get somewhat of a natural sunscreen for my daughter. This one is a good one, as it does not stay greasy and goes on easily.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works. Smells gorgeous. No chemicals</li>
            <li> This is the best SPF 30 sunscreen I have ever used on my face. They have Naked Bee sunscreen specifically for faces, but I use this instead after comparing ingredients. This sunscreen/lotion goes on thick, soaks into my skin quickly and leaves it feeling moisturized for the entire day. I also really like that it does not leave a white residue or leave my face shinier than normal. The only thing I apply to my face in the morning is Vitamin C Serum and this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint is that if it gets into my eyes, it burns - kind of like most sunscreens. So I put less on my forehead so that it&#x27;s less likely to get into my eyes after sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several types of sunscreen for my face. This is it, plus it&#x27;s mostly natural, which is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen.  It absorbs quickly, smells wonderful and is very effective.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen was the reason we purchased this for the first time, but the quality ingredients and skin soothing abilities is why we&#x27;ve purchased it again.  Useable as a daily skin lotion and benefits from the sunscreen anytime of the year!</li>
            <li> I use this on my face under Aveeno face tint and powder,  yet it doesn&#x27;t feel thick or clog my pores.  The scent is nice too. I&#x27;ve been using this (brighter sun) and oil of Olay SPF 15 (less sun) for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is ok. It smells nice. I was disappointed that the added sticker label on the back  said if you will be swimming or sweating use a water proof sunscreen. Really?</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I recommend.  I prefer more natural ingredients, and I feel safe and protected wearing Naked Bee.  The extra moisturizing it provides is just a bonus, as is the Vitamin C.  Excellent product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Naked Bee sunscreen. It smells great, is not greasy, and does a great job of protecting from sunburn.</li>
            <li> kids love the smell. its really a great natural product. Will continue to order this and other products form this company</li>
            <li> I love this product! It smells amazing, applies smoothly, works well as a primer for under my makeup, and leaves my skin feeling so soft! I have not taken any sun damage either!</li>
            <li> Hi. this is a nice cream. Love all the natural ingredients and it does feel nice on the skin. However, when I first opened it, I just tried a tiny bit on the back of my hand. For the next 3 hours or so, all I could smell was the cream. It is so strong. I like natural smells that are not overpowering. Let me tell you, this cream is. &#x27;Fragrance&#x27; is listed just at the end of the ingredients list. Make no mistake, this cream/lotion smells exactly like a perfume, or what you would expect a &#x27;perfumed&#x27; lotion to smell like. Crazily, when I washed my hands later, I could still smell the cream! If I wanted a perfumed lotion, I would have bought one for that very reason. I&#x27;m sending this cream back because I already wear perfume and don&#x27;t need to knock people out with my smell!!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is awesome!  The scent is wonderful--I highly recommend it as a sunscreen not only because the lotion is not greasy and it is easy to rub in, but also because you will want to put this on every day because it smells so good!  I&#x27;ve had so many compliments on how good I smell and this is just a sunscreen--not a perfume! haha  I suppose I would have to say it might be better for girls or children because of this--it smells like a cross between beeswax and orange blossom.  Like a lightly scented candle--that is the smell. It is not overpowering at all and very pleasant.  I will buy this sunscreen again as well as for gifts--I already have as a matter of fact.</li>
            <li> This product performed as advertised during a week in a Montana hot spell June 27-July 5, 2015.</li>
            <li> Smells Great, No skin irritation, Grandbaby-safe &amp; they love it!&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing is nice too, I use their facial moisturizer w/Suncreen though for face.&lt;br /&gt;Would like it if they could offer a 45 SPF option too...</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen! It rubs in well, smells amazing, protects my skin, and is organic! Great find!!</li>
            <li> A great sunscreen for those worried about sunscreen ingredients. I feel good smearing this on my kids. Nice smell. Okay in the pool, needs reapplied often if swimming (like most sunscreens).</li>
            <li> Nice product without all the junk in it that makes you wonder which is more harmful; the sun or the sunscreen! The kids love the smell. They say it makes them smell like candy. It doesn&#x27;t seem to last quite as long as some others, but reapplying is not a major inconvenience.</li>
            <li> All Naked Bee products are the best. My 61 year-old skin has never looked so good!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the heavy fragrance of this sunscreen. It has a sweet, cloying scent. The sunscreen does provide protection okay but you need to reapply after you&#x27;ve been in the water for much time, or if you&#x27;ve sweated heavily.</li>
            <li> A great sunscreen plus moisturizer. I use it everyday on my face as a daily moisturizer with sun protection.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing and it smells great.  I plan to repurchase.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter both have sensitive skin. Other products leave rashes on there skin. This product has cured all that and protects from the sun very well, smells good as well.</li>
            <li> The bottle I got was the same product, but a different bottle, one that rests on a flip lid.  The sunscreen is great, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the bottle shape.</li>
            <li> I needed a sun screen and chose this because it contains vit. C to help with wrinkles. It is wonderful and smells like an orange. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance and it glides smoothly on skin. Really great sun screen! I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin or face. I prefer this over normal sunscreen except I do have to put more on like every 15 minutes so I don&#x27;t get burned (I burn easy)</li>
            <li> I did a test run on a very small patch of skin on my arm in my air-conditioned home before trying it out in the &amp;#34;real world&amp;#34;.  The product is not greasy but does have a strong scent.  I was concerned as I have extremely sensitive skin and am allergic to many other sunscreens on the market today.  However, because my test patch showed no sign of reaction, I decided I would be able to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product while on vacation in a very humid location.  Unfortunately, it left me with a pronounced red rash on my neck and legs that looked like I was badly sunburned (I was not so it does protect).  I am very glad I did not use it on my face as the rash looked even worse as it faded.  I mention the humidity level because I was sweating and I am not sure if the product reacted with my sweat to cause the rash or the ingredients for the scent caused my neck and legs to react.  Either way, I will not be able to use this product after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this product to those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> naked bee is always good</li>
            <li> smells great and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I wish I could like this product as I&#x27;ve been reseraching natural sunscreen for ages. But the smell is too awful! It smells like cheap cherry candy smell! It bothered me so much while wearing it. I had to return it! :(</li>
            <li> We have fair and sensitive skin and The Naked Bee works wonderfully for us.  It smells great and most importantly, it protects our skin very well.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Doesn&#x27;t leave a white tint and smells really good!</li>
            <li> Sweet smelling, light weight and all natural.</li>
            <li> smells good, works good. Im happy</li>
            <li> Love this product because I don&#x27;t smell like I have sunscreen on ...this is a great product and will buy again</li>
            <li> I love these products and use them all the time. They make your skin feel so soft and smooth. It has a nice clean smell to it..not perfumy type of smell...The sunscreen do not burn your eyes when you apply  it to your face. I had found this cream in a shop while looking around up at the Elk County, PA Museum...I bought a tube of it..and liked it so well..went on line to see where I could buy it online since I didn&#x27;t want to travel almost 2 hours to buy some more...found it on here..and so glad that I did..</li>
            <li> I am going on a cruise for 1 wk starting Sat., I&#x27;ll know for sure then.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with melanoma, so am very careful to wear sunscreen every day.  This feels good on my skin, and any odor disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of orange blossoms (i.e. actual orange blossoms, Jo Malone orange blossom cologne...), but the scent of this sunscreen is much too strong and almost sickly-sweet. For me, the scent is very much honey and vanilla, not the bright, citrusy orange blossom I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I really want to love this product. I love the smell of it, the fact that it&#x27;s mostly organic and how it moisturizes your skin, however I tested it in Florida last month by applying it 20 minutes before a 45 minute walk on the beach. I reapplied it several times a day during the week and sat under an umbrella when I was not in the water. Unfortunately I was sunburned after walking, on my face and chest and  after a few days there, very tanned, not what I was going for. I am not sure this gives adequate sun protection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found a paraben-free moisturizer for my face with SPF in it! I was worried the first time I used it because the scent was really strong, but eventually it faded and I didn&#x27;t notice it anymore. The lotion itself is thick and creamy and feels good to put on. It absorbs well and my face feels soft but not greasy. I can tell it stays on my skin for a long while, too, because I can smell the scent of the lotion once again when I wash my face later in the evening or shower the next day. My only complaint is that I wish it were available in unscented. My family and I are very sensitive to perfumes, and although I&#x27;ve gotten used to this one, there are certain family members around whom I won&#x27;t be able to use this lotion. Overall, though, a great product and I would definitely recommend it.  **please note I&#x27;ve only used this on my face, not as a full-body sunscreen, so I don&#x27;t know how well it functions in that area**</li>
