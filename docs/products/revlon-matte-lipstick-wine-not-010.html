            <li> Sorry, I really was very excited about reviewing this....</li>
            <li> It stays on for a long time and definitely makes a statement.</li>
            <li> Pair with a black liner for complete sexyness</li>
            <li> this product is exactly as expected I would definitely purchase it again in the future!!!</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t stay on long.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I do not regret purchasing it and would definitely buy another one.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this color is that the color is not as dark as the photo.</li>
            <li> ; black liner will definitely make this lipstick shine and POP through....</li>
            <li> Previously, I purchased this same product at Walgreens and the application felt and looked like silk.</li>
            <li> but if you put a moisturising base it can last and look better.</li>
            <li> Hate the word sallow, but this is a nice color with my skin.</li>
            <li> the only problem I had with this particular lipstick was it&#x27;s very dry and after an hour your lips look cracked and weird.</li>
            <li> Other than that this lipstick is the way to go with a matte lip.</li>
            <li> The only negative about this product is not the product itself but the seller.  </li>
            <li> If you like a dark plum lipstick this is the lipstick.</li>
            <li> Mine came slightly bent</li>
            <li> Nice,thick, and dark!</li>
            <li> Has a little shimmer, but still a gorgeou color.</li>
            <li> Can be applied with a brush for a lighter result or made very dark and a gloss added.</li>
            <li> it was dried out.</li>
            <li> My friend has this color and she is pale skin</li>
            <li> I am a dark skin women and Im skeptical when it comes to lipstick</li>
            <li> When I applied THIS it felt as if it had been sitting around for 20 years - very hard.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed why Revlon dis continued this color.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Looks amazing.  Revlon defiantly made a mistake by discontinuing this colour!</li>
            <li> great product i use it daily it my favorite totally worth its value ps. its very creamy and smooth</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick! I have a lot of lines on my lips and this lipstick does not settle into them.  It is also nondrying and most lipsticks are with my lips.  The only negative about this product is not the product itself but the seller.  When my lipstick arrived it was mushed a little at the top against the lid. Other than that this lipstick is the way to go with a matte lip. I&#x27;m sad the discontinued this product in stores.</li>
            <li> It was not the deep burgundy-red I was expecting. It&#x27;s more of a brownish color.</li>
            <li> love love love this lip color. super vampy! it isn&#x27;t the best in terms of staying even but hello? its Revlon</li>
            <li> Great formula, gorgeous darker color without being too vampy or goth. Can be applied with a brush for a lighter result or made very dark and a gloss added. Creme finish.</li>
            <li> Great color! I get compliments all the time when  I wear this lipstick</li>
            <li> This lipstick stays on the whole night and it&#x27;s such a  beautiful color. I am tan skin color and it looks amazing and I had to buy it when I tried it on. My friend has this color and she is pale skin and it looks amazing but I thought it wouldnt look that great on me but I was wrong. Love it... You should def try this.</li>
            <li> So beautiful and classy. Amazing color yet kind of drying since its extremely matte. However, that&#x27;s easily solved with lip balm. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments and its a gorgeous winter color that suits all skin tones.</li>
            <li> Love this color! Not too red and not too brown. Tried so many other brands like Mac or Napoleon but cant find one like this. An all time fave! Really disappointed why Revlon dis continued this color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love the shipping was fast the color is perfect for my skin time I wear it every day and don&#x27;t feel right without it ! I&#x27;ve scratched it up which I was upset because I want none of it to go to waste will buy more if theirs anymore when I run out</li>
            <li> Came as listed. Great value for a pack of 2 and I finally can use this color that they seem to have discontinued in stores!</li>
            <li> Beautiful matte wine color. Compliments all skin tones.</li>
            <li> I love the color...it looks much darker in the picture, it&#x27;s actually a rich, deep burgundy, perfect with some black liner and mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good color for me but it doesn&#x27;t stay on long.  I wish it was longer lasting but the color is nice.</li>
            <li> I ordered this lipstick for my daughter. She is very pleased with Revlon lipstick. It stays on all day. Very popular color, was unable to find it in the stores. Sold out, so ordered online. Packing was good and fast service.</li>
            <li> Pair with a black liner for complete sexyness; black liner will definitely make this lipstick shine and POP through....great buy....</li>
            <li> Which I like.  I&#x27;m ivory/olive skin toned.  Hate the word sallow, but this is a nice color with my skin.</li>
            <li> Glad to have been able to find this lipstick...I enjoy wearing it almost daily.</li>
            <li> If you like a dark plum lipstick this is the lipstick. Great color for the fall. The lipstick reminds me of rebel from Mac..</li>
            <li> Definitely my favorite color ever :)</li>
            <li> nice matte color. re-applied once, wears off fast after eating. but then again its not color stay. impressed so far. will buy more in other colors</li>
            <li> I love love this color plus the matte finish!! I wish I could find more colors with a matte finish!!</li>
            <li> Love the color and feel.  Will definitely be wearing it this fall!</li>
            <li> this is like the perfect lipstick!!! im in love with it!!! i would buy like 100 os theseee!!! its like perfection in a lipstick cause its dark but not black its like the perfect dark red ever!</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this lipstick I took a look at images of women wearing this color and it did not look like a wine color.  But I decided to purchase it anyway.  And to my pleasant surprise it is the exact color that you see.  It is a nice wine color and it is not dry on your lips.</li>
            <li> love it! this product is exactly as expected I would definitely purchase it again in the future!!! a big thanks!</li>
            <li> the only problem I had with this particular lipstick was it&#x27;s very dry and after an hour your lips look cracked and weird. but if you put a moisturising base it can last and look better.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this color is that the color is not as dark as the photo. It comes off more red than the photo gives off the impression of.</li>

            <li> This is the best lipstick...color is on point and it doesn&#x27;t rub off. Fast Shipping too, Will def buy again.</li>
            <li> The color and feel is very good but it won&#x27;t stay on and it bleeds. A lip liner and primer is a necessity with this lipstick. Dupe for MAC diva.</li>
            <li> Nice,thick, and dark! I am a dark skin women and Im skeptical when it comes to lipstick but this is a great color!</li>
            <li> Disappointed. Mine came slightly bent it was dried out. Previously, I purchased this same product at Walgreens and the application felt and looked like silk. When I applied THIS it felt as if it had been sitting around for 20 years - very hard. Not happy at all. I pitched it. Sorry, I really was very excited about reviewing this....</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, was a little dissapointed that it wasn&#x27;t completely matte. Has a little shimmer, but still a gorgeou color.</li>
            <li> My favorite lipstick!!!</li>
            <li> This color is just right to wear daily. The color is not over powering for going to the store,exercising,etc. I wear it with a smile.</li>
            <li> The color of this lip stick is beautiful. It stays on for a long time and definitely makes a statement. The only thing that bothers me is that when you apply the product it can be streaky. Other than that, I do not regret purchasing it and would definitely buy another one.</li>
            <li> Love this so glad to find it!</li>
            <li> I love my order!  Thank you for the quick delivery!</li>
