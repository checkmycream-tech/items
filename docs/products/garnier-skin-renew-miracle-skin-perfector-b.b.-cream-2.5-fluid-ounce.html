            <li>I figured maybe my skin needed to adjust, and after a couple of hours, I still wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s the best BB cream on the market.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful coverage.</li>
            <li>Skin Perfect or\\&quot; as a statement of fact and not just a description of what the company hopes the product will do for you.</li>

            <li>This is great</li>
            <li>This product was a great price.  </li>
            <li>Great deal.</li>
            <li>I have oily/combination skin, and although the product gave me great coverage, it greatly exacerbated the oiliness.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have oily skin, this product might work for you and the price is great.</li>
            <li>It is nice and lightweight, though it helps make skin look flawless.</li>
            <li>, i&#x27;ve heard great things about BB creams.</li>
            <li>She tells me that it works great.  </li>
            <li>and it works great for me as i use it as a primer</li>
            <li>It does a great job with coverage without using any concealer or anything else.</li>
            <li>, my face felt great all day.</li>
            <li>moisturizers\\&quot; go, and I don&#x27;t have a slew of tubes to compare this to, but I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>and the price is great too.</li>
            <li>Works great for my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this Beauty Balm!!</li>
            <li>I love this product!!</li>
            <li>It seems to go on very nice and has a pleasant smell to it.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy some of my own!</li>
            <li>news is that the Medium/Deep tone I bought that matches my skin perfectly gives her a healthy looking glow and blends well on her.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and even smells nice!</li>
            <li>:)) thank you for helping find a perfect shade for my skin and helping the elasticity and color correction of my skin already improve.</li>
            <li>I found out that all I need to do is spread this wonderful cream on my face and neck and in the areas that I want more coverage, to use a concealer.</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m going to buy my own!</li>
            <li>Have used sooooo many liquid makeups and this one is great!</li>
            <li>It feels very pleasant at face as it has very light consistence which gives the feeling of breathing to your skin.</li>
            <li>Has a pleasant smell and noticed a difference in skin within 2 week period.</li>
            <li>, this cream also has a very pleasant smell which is something most liquid foundations lack.</li>
            <li>It is a good product for hide some imperfections in the skin, not like a foundation</li>
            <li>In a lighter color it might be good during the winter months.</li>
            <li>This product provides good coverage.  </li>
            <li>The price is good and she would buy it again.</li>
            <li>It provides good coverage without sinking into the wrinkles and seems to improve skin tone.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels really good when I apply this product.  </li>
            <li>This is a really good product.</li>
            <li>and id smells good</li>
            <li>, I have fairly oily skin on my forehead that I always have to worry about</li>
            <li>Not for Acne prone and oily skin, product has good coverge</li>
            <li>Very light, it works great, perfect for the summer time, i dont recommend it to people with super oily skin since it moisturizes.</li>
            <li>Great cream for the price -- and this version (oily skin) is fragrance free!</li>
            <li>Love this cream, and the price is great.</li>
            <li>It made my skin look really pretty and matte, a lot of people were talking about how oily it feels but it felt perfect on me</li>
            <li>This has been like magic for my face!</li>
            <li>I need more than just a sunscreen!  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a lot more than sun protection!</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>This will be a good makeup for summer though because its very light to wear</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and smells great.</li>
            <li>and it comes a nice amount.</li>
            <li>The color is really nice though...</li>
            <li>I purchased this item because I loved the idea of being able to have a moisturizer, spf, primer and tinted moisturizer all in one product.</li>
            <li>I gave this product a week to honestly see if I liked it.</li>
            <li>It really covers well and will make your complexion flawless!</li>
            <li>This did not blend in as nicely as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>It kind of streaks and seems to cake onto my skin.</li>
            <li>Color matches my skin nicely.</li>
            <li>Ths cream makes my skin look smoother, has good stuff in the cream to enhance it to make it healthier, and truly does help making my skin all the better for it.  </li>
            <li>It went on sooo nice -</li>
            <li>I used a sponge - not cakey at all, nice and even.</li>
            <li>I am kind of known for not wearing makeup</li>
            <li>: kind of a runny product</li>
            <li>Unlike BB Cream, it rubs off very easily, even with setting powder and/or spray.</li>
            <li>The product has a continuous very strong perfume odor to it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty good for humid fl weather!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m flawless and not pale.</li>
            <li>I liked a lot better.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s thee best product as far as \\&quot;tinted</li>
            <li>and this is the best ive found so far.</li>
            <li>Coverage is very light</li>
            <li>BB creams are usually very light and as I have gotten tanner I decided to use the medium/deep version</li>
            <li>The cream seemed to have a nice smell and apply easily non greasy, but I would purchase a lighter shade.</li>
            <li>The result was a very light, flawless, air brushed look all over my face and neck.</li>
            <li>&quot; It&#x27;s more like a tinted moisturizer with sunblock added.</li>
            <li>(if you are okay with heaviness).&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>Nice and light.</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments on the look of my skin.</li>
            <li>and I will buy more.</li>
            <li>Most of the time I&#x27;d just use moisturizer, eyeshadow, and lip gloss or nude lipstick.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy this because most of the reviews I watch on YOUTUBE said that it made their skin oily</li>
            <li>It gives ok coverage.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>okay...</li>
            <li>I really love this one.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing 2 BB creams (this one, and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s) I did a lot of product research, mostly on Amazon and Pinterest.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s BB cream, however, provides more coverage and a lighter feeling.</li>
            <li>This goes on smoothly and blends nicely.</li>
            <li>I noticed that throughout the day, my skin felt even more oily, and I had a nagging desire to just wash everything off my face.</li>
            <li>It sits like a greasy layer on top of the skin and transfers to anything in site - whether it&#x27;s a tissue you blow your nose with,</li>
            <li>I love the idea.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find the medium/deep formula that specifically says \\&quot;oil free\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I love this formula.</li>
            <li>I love-</li>
            <li>Its okay.</li>
            <li>Its not the best and its definitely not for you if you have oily skin!</li>
            <li>Tried this because I do love some of the Garnier Skin products, but this is not&lt;br /&gt;one of them.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite bb cream.</li>
            <li>i love this bb cream</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so glad I ignored</li>
            <li>, I prefer to have a more dewey appearance</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Most of my expectations were exceeded.</li>
            <li>but im satisfied with it</li>
            <li>I am 68 and prefer this product to more pricer products.  </li>
            <li>I applied a generous amount (the size of a quarter on my entire face) and I looked flawless...</li>
            <li>You might get that \\&quot;chalky\\&quot; look many complain of but try another brand.</li>
            <li>so when I need more, I will buy from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The price here is much better.</li>
            <li>This product shipped fast and it  had a great price.</li>
            <li>and i love that.</li>
            <li>omg I got so many zits after using this for a week&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was expecting more coverage.  </li>
            <li>I wish it covered better.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more when this tube is gone.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and have not used a smular product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use foundation any more.</li>
            <li>she love it,  and i am going to buy more,.thanks..</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>It goes on a lot smoother, spreads, and blends much better with a touch of my moisturizer in it.</li>
            <li>But, if you of that &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; variety then you will be more than satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I like it as a primer mostly.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It is moisturizing without clogging my pores and causing more breakouts.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work for most skin colors.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my favorite cream</li>
            <li>i like this item but its more of a tinted moisturizer than a bb cream</li>
            <li>but it did a nice job and smells fantastic</li>
            <li>I also purchased a higher priced Beauty Balm and to be honest, I like this balm better!</li>
            <li>...that this is a pretty good cream.</li>
            <li>Great even natural looking coverage foundation + moisturizer + UV protection + Vitamins.</li>
            <li>Coverage is light (this is NOT a concealer) but does seem to give one a more even appearance.  </li>
            <li>Once it is on it is OK, and it smoothes, covers lightly and provides a bit of a \\&quot;blurred\\&quot; look to spots and scars.</li>
            <li>the &#x27;cheap&#x27; version - how could it be any better?</li>
            <li>It is oily, but I put light powder on top (</li>
            <li>However, I suppose skin types (unlike clothes) are one of those things that doesn&#x27;t easily transfer from one person to another.</li>
            <li>Glides on easy and not oily at all.  </li>
            <li>I was worried about the smell being strong based on reviews from others but have not had an issue.</li>
            <li>It does look very good on the skin (as long as it stays on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I definately update if it breaks me out or makes a huge improvement in my skin, but right now I&#x27;m loving it</li>
            <li>If they made a dark it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>My skin looks nice and pretty.</li>
            <li>This cream felt fine going on, but within two days I had SORE pimples growing on my chin and cheeks- almost like stress pimples.</li>
            <li>Faced BB Cream (which is an excellent product) and decided to try the much less costly Garnier version.</li>
            <li>but it worked just fine for me.</li>
            <li>I am lucky to have nice (blemish-free) skin, so I really use this more so as a tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>oily skin version has no fragrance which made a HUGE difference for me.</li>
            <li>so that is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that is also giving my face a smooth (non-make-up-caked-on-looking) face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is basically tinted moisturizer/sunblock with some mica flakes to reflect light and \\&quot;minimize</li>
            <li>cheap</li>
            <li>I have light brown, combo oily/dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the medium/deep formula and it is just a tad light for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the Light in the winter and the medium/deep in the summer.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t do anything with this, since it was cheap</li>
            <li>It spread in a perfectly smooth even manner over my pre-moistened face and neck.</li>
            <li>I would always find residue of the light reflectors found in the Aveeno on his face), and has not tranferred to any of mine since I reduced the amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never used BB creams before nor have I ever heard of this until I received this product for free to try as a BzzAgent campaign.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically a tinted sunscreen that gives you the converage of a light liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li>My complexion is a sort of caramel colored(Mac-NC45 Make up Forever 170) ; with that said the medium-deep is about a 1/2 shade too light for my preference.</li>
            <li>It can give you a light oil to your face around the nose</li>
            <li>I used the medium/deep and it matched really well and blended nicely.</li>
            <li>how much foundation do you have on\\&quot;!!!</li>
            <li>I very rarely break out anymore, and after using this ONCE, my face was covered in sits.</li>
            <li>I layer on a foundation powder on top and then a matte powder to make sure I don&#x27;t have any shine and this normally works all day to keep the shine away.  </li>
            <li>and my goal is to wear something easy, quick, and double-duty: moisturize, coverage,</li>
            <li>your hand as you brush your hair off your face, a new top that you&#x27;re putting on over your head, or even the seatbelt in your car!</li>
            <li>I used to buy the original BB cream</li>
            <li>I found that it works best if I apply very lightly as an usual tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally wear any kind of concealer/foundation/powder, etc.</li>
            <li>it is because you&#x27;re using it alone or the moisturizer you use under is too rich.</li>
            <li>This is lightweight and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I have a fresh fresh and healthy glow</li>
            <li>I can scar easily too if I don&#x27;t take care of blemishes right away.</li>
            <li>I buy a lot of products through Amazon with my hubby&#x27;s account, so when I saw that Amazon started carrying BB creams, I was super excited.</li>
            <li>This feels great when I first apply it, but the moment I get outside in the summer and my skin begins to oil, it gets greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like it for the most part although for me it doesn&#x27;t really moisturize my skin too well.</li>
            <li>BB Cream gives me full and even coverage and doesn&#x27;t make me look greasy at all.</li>
            <li>was really hoping that this would be a cheaper and more convenient replacement to my Balm Shelter tinted moisturizer with spf; or my Avon MagiX.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t full coverage by any means.  </li>
            <li>Every time I wear this I always get so many compliments on how much my skin is glowing.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>It gives a nice glow and natural warm color to my face, and just makes me look more put together without having a heavy foundation, yet gives a bit more color than a tinted moisturizer that I used before.</li>
            <li>great if you dont have lotion or makeup...more of a sunscreen but does the job to make your face look fresh if you dont have makup or if your skin is dry</li>
            <li>A great thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t make me break out like other products.</li>
            <li>As far as the color goes, unless you are a very fair skinned African-American or Latino, the medium-deep shade is probably not going to be for you unless you&#x27;re using it under your regular makeup.</li>
            <li>My skin got more even, my breakouts are less and my skin feels smoother, but the dewey finish the cream gives is not flattering againts my oily skin, if they make a oil control formula or a oily skin formula, i would definitely buy it :D</li>
            <li>It blends really well and looks really nice, but about noonish I notice that my skin becomes really oily and I am tempted to just wash it off.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and soft for most of the day.</li>
            <li>For example, it gives fairly good coverage with a modest amount of product, and I just really like the idea of a BB cream.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t react well to pollen, and I have a mild blemish issue.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel oily and it acts on her skin quickly...</li>
            <li>oh AND it has spf for my quick drive and sun</li>
            <li>Comes off very easy and smudges off, I hugged my friend and it came off on his jacket, he said \\&quot;wow</li>
            <li>, I did at first think the shade came out too light for me, BUT like some powders and foundations, you have to let it sit and set in your skin a bit.</li>
            <li>It goes on really smooth and covers pretty well in opinion.</li>
            <li>It offers great light coverage and your face is left with a glow.</li>
            <li>It was fantastic for the first 4 hours.</li>
            <li>but this one seems pretty good especially for the price!</li>
            <li>It is very creamy and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I actually think it stands up pretty good</li>
            <li>And I will say my skin does actually look better!</li>
            <li>In fact the more I rub it in, the more it makes my skin look dry</li>
            <li>Even though I am actually a Light to Medium person, I really like this color.  </li>
            <li>I like this BB product and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin -- in fact, it really did tend to smooth out the texture.  </li>
            <li>Overall this product is amazing</li>
            <li>It looked great and didn&#x27;t feel too heavy.</li>
            <li>This is more of a tinted moisturizer that has to be built up to have the same coverage of BB Cream (but then it&#x27;s no longer light application).</li>
            <li>Overall, I would NOT recommend this cream for people with oil-prone skin, or for those looking for any kind of coverage.</li>
            <li>but this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>My skin color has not darkened with the hot summer weather, I have been able to keep using my normal product.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with it so far.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly good skin with only slightly uneven skin tone in some areas, and the Skin Renew was able to give me a near flawless complexion without the three separate products I&#x27;d have had to use to achieve the same look and protection.</li>
            <li>(ashy looking).It was worth a try</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite surprised and pleased at this product...especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>I added a rose Christian Dior lip gloss</li>
            <li>I say for the price, under $20 it is worth the gamble.</li>
            <li>I hope this review will be useful.</li>
            <li>I paid 15 bucks or more in the drugstore for this, so I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised to find I can save by buying with Amazon.</li>
            <li>I liked the product and going to buy another one for the future.</li>
            <li>So I was definitely surprised when I liked it so much.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve gotten comments like, your skin has gotten brighter, more clear,</li>
            <li>Love the way this covers and it looks so natural.  </li>
            <li>The normal skin version had a scent so strong</li>
            <li>It absorbed easily and gave very natural look to the face.</li>
            <li>It melted right off in the</li>
            <li>The tone is just right</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it, and you get more with Garnier than other BB creams at higher prices.</li>
            <li>I went into it expecting it to be more of a tinted moisturizer and was blown away with how better my one half of the face looked even after just an hour of keeping it on (wanted to check for irritation).</li>
            <li>At baseline, I use Anthelios SPF 15 sunscreen/moisturizer and Bare Escentuals powder on top for blush/ mineral veil.</li>
            <li>Worth splurging for a higher end BB....</li>
            <li>So I thought since my completion changes alot this would be good color to apply when im at my darkest, but when I applied it on it was a bit to dark</li>
            <li>I use mostly department store make-up as I don&#x27;t normally trust drug store brands, because I have extremely sensitive skin (mild ecezema on my face)</li>
            <li>I use a pricier Sephora brand as well, but this one is right up there with the higher priced creams in quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The skin around my lips and chin is kind of dry</li>
            <li>, my skin is extremely sensitive so I would&#x27;ve known very quickly if it was going to.</li>
            <li>I am very optimistic and love it so far.</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I had chosed this color because I was hearing alot that this was a very light color for being medium or deep.  </li>
            <li>This my first bb cream</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t pretty.  </li>
            <li>: BB Cream is an all-in-one skin care, light natural looking make-up.</li>
            <li>Overall, the product is okay and does match my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I discovered this works very well as a PRIMER!</li>
            <li>first using the cream, I applied it everywhere: cheeks, nose, forehead, chin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty lightweight</li>
            <li>I have combination skin that leans more towards the oily side, especially on humid days.  </li>
            <li>Tried it two more times just to be sure and it was \\&quot;oil slick city\\&quot; each time.</li>
            <li>and it gives such a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid make-up user</li>
            <li>this is my first time using bb cream</li>
            <li>it goes on natural and light.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and smooth and it does even out my tone.  </li>
            <li>I used Revlon SkinLights Instant Skin Brightener for many years but they discontinued the product.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a foundation that was not heavy on my face,natural looking and gave me a smooth complection</li>
            <li>I have an olive complexion with generally smooth and clear skin.</li>
            <li>I must tell you that I use a light natural oil moisturizer on my skin, then apply the BB cream before foundation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I tried this BB cream</li>
            <li>After that I was pretty hesitant to try</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day even on a hot summer day.</li>
            <li>its ok you can only really smell it while ur applying it.</li>
            <li>There are some positive attributes about this cream.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried BB cream and this product works really well.</li>
            <li>But 3 times a week I do vigorous exercise and on those days I noticed it kind of ran down my face like paint when I would sweat</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps this would be a better product for someone who struggles with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I let it dry then apply some powder on top after about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Nice texture, nice smell, multi-funtion, just a little to dark for me</li>
            <li>I like this particular BB cream very much.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get away with using just a little of it since I am a little darker in the summer, and I loved it.</li>
            <li>play softball and this really has protected my skin from the sun.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very watery and dries very powdery.</li>
            <li>I really like a lot of Garnier hair products, and was hoping for a quality product.</li>
            <li>It makes the whole face one color .</li>
            <li>really like that</li>
            <li>so I tend to stretch them as much as I can.</li>
            <li>and it was way too much.</li>
            <li>so mixing these 2 creams together is what I&#x27;m currently doing, as the L&#x27;Oreal medium is too light for my summer skin, and the Garnier has a bit of a bronze tone in it.</li>
            <li>After using this for a month, I didn&#x27;t notice much improvement of my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works well, but doesn&#x27;t even out my skin tone as much as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li>It has that really sun-screeny feel.</li>
            <li>I love it, it did what I expected to do.</li>
            <li>thanks you</li>
            <li>recently found a version of this product in \\&quot;deep\\&quot; that specifically says oil free.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel matte and stayed that way for much of the day.</li>
            <li>The tint blends very well with skin color-</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much for me, I just put it on as a foundation</li>
            <li>this has absolutely none.</li>
            <li>first day I tried it I used the amount I would normally use for the Aveeno (about a quarter size).</li>
            <li>but I am very picky when it comes to what goes on my face.</li>
            <li>But not my really color..</li>
            <li>With this said, I absolutely adore, adore this cream.</li>
            <li>I was perplexed about finding one that would suit my skin tone since I am a deep milk chocolate brown.</li>
            <li>and I really like the coverage.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit oily but not too much.</li>
            <li>This is very moisturizing and covers up all of my redness.</li>
            <li>so this is just enough to look pulled together hassle free.</li>
            <li>Cost-benefit really pays off.</li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sadly, I do not think that it offered much (to even out the appearance).</li>
            <li>It also made my skin feel greasy and gave it a very shiny appearance.</li>
            <li>So much for the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li>I REALLY wanted to like this product and simplify my skin care routine (sunscreen and coverage).</li>
            <li>If you put some translucent powder on, you are set to go and it lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>so i am very picky with these cover ups.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how much of a difference</li>
            <li>would say B Minerals feels lighter, but Garnier isn&#x27;t too much heavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great beauty secret that I&#x27;ve shared with my friends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not bragging but only wanted to give a fair representation of my skin and why BB Cream make work better or worse for me than others.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Garnier&#x27;s BB cream for several months now and can honestly say that even if I decided to walk outside without makeup, I wouldn&#x27;t walk out without wearing my BB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not cheap, but worth it!!!</li>
            <li>lol A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I tried it on a small area on my chest to make sure it was the product causing it, and sure enough, I broke out there too.</li>
            <li>Feels a little heavier than the higher end products, but blends in much better.</li>
            <li>Well first let me say wow!</li>
            <li>Other than that I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so light, I usually wear just some light powder or no makeup at all</li>
            <li>This is the perfect color for my difficult to match south asian skin - however the downsides certainly outweigh the color match.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, not too heavy, and I don&#x27;t have much color to my 85 year old face, so when there is a special occasdion I apply this.</li>
            <li>usual foundation is Cover Girl TrueBlend liquid foundation which is simply an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Made my normal skin very oily and shiny.</li>
            <li>First of all, wow.</li>
            <li>I did appreciate that it was sheer to medium b/c it is getting warmer and who has time for a face full of makeup when its 80</li>
            <li>Most foundations offer a higher SPF, superior coverage, more colors to choose from, less irritating to my eyes and less shine.</li>
            <li>other than that, on my day to day, regular days; i simply apply this and it feels great.</li>
            <li>have dry, but otherwise problem free skin.</li>
            <li>So on days that I don&#x27;t workout it makes my skin tone noticeably more even, less shiny</li>
            <li>The coverage is very sheer, good to slap on if you need to run out the door in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The last two BB Creams I bought were either to shear of burned my face mildly.</li>
            <li>I did give it to my mother, who is Caucasian with older skin, since I feel that she would benefit from it&#x27;s greasiness.  </li>
            <li>I was a big fan of skin79, as I love Korean BB creams, but I switched to using Origins Vitazing (with the sheer tint).</li>
            <li>Way better, albeit much more expensive.</li>
            <li>This random lady told me in the store when I was looking and said you will love this product so now I can tell you my experience \\&quot; LOVE</li>
            <li>just wanted overall simplicity with this product and quick coverage.</li>
            <li>I would suggest to try this BB cream before spending money on more expensive brands as this does all that it promises and more.</li>
            <li>It provides a decent amount of coverage.</li>
            <li>Need to try a different more universal product.</li>
            <li>I will say its not for everyone, but there definitely needs to be a more wider range of this product for different skin tones.</li>
            <li>I have a drawer full of foundations that offer a higher SPF - and have a full palette of colors to choose from to at least match my skin</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li>and I think I could almost wear this as my main foundation on a normal day.</li>
            <li>However, if I mix this with a little bit of my moisturizer it makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li>I was also happy to see that Garnier&#x27;s $13 dollar option was two ounces as opposed to one and a half ounces, or even less (Smashbox BB Cream).</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because this BB cream in particular is one of my new favorites.</li>
            <li>idk my skin is weird lol).</li>
            <li>But I normally don&#x27;t have oily skin like this.</li>
            <li>day three I dared to put the cream on my eyelids, something that would normally cause my eyes tosting all day with the Aveeno, and to my suprise it did not burn at</li>
            <li>If you are a truly deep girl I suggest you go for the Maybelline Dream Fresh BB cream as that is a lot darker.</li>
            <li>Before this BB cream I tried the Clinique foundation and it dried out my skin even more.</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny bit and it glides on easily.</li>
            <li>Faced&#x27;s Primed and Poreless, skin79 (pink label), Clinique&#x27;s Instant Perfector, and these products offer more of a miracle for my skin than Garnier&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I am african american with a light peanut butter complexion and I purchased the medium/deep.</li>
            <li>Truly love this product...new and different, and covers minimal flaws completely!  </li>
            <li>BUT, in about the second hour of wearing it, my face gets very very shiny and oily.  </li>
            <li>I fell for the advertisement which shows a women putting it under her eyes as a highlighting concealer/moisturizer, even though the package mysteriously avoids saying exactly what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>When I first got it, I applied the same amount as I do the Cover Girl</li>
            <li>I definitely think using a makeup sponge helps so much in applying it - if your getting oily and your just using your hands or a makeup brush use a sponge instead!</li>
            <li>This definitely covered those up enough that I felt good about my skin but didn&#x27;t feel like I had this heavy layer on.</li>
            <li>(Although sometimes when they have those by one get one half off, or free you can save that way also)</li>
            <li>First let me preface this review by saying that everyone should know (any adult) that not every product will produce the same results as it does on someone else.</li>
            <li>I prefer full coverage makeup, so ill be sticking to that for the most part.</li>
            <li>4 hours with Garnier.&lt;br /&gt;Garnier coverage is better than B Minerals, especially when it comes to my dark undereyes,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, that was the only positive I found with this product.</li>
            <li>the following weeks, I resorted back to using Anthelios for my forehead, nose and chin, which are areas that need adequate moisture, and use the BB cream exclusively for my cheeks, where it appears to even out tone well.</li>
            <li>I was looking for light cream with a little tint but not a foundation.</li>
            <li>Sunscreen 15, perfect tone for me in the summer, vit C (stimulates collagen), correction (hac bad acnea on the chin younger) and looks so natural, not powdery or caky.</li>
            <li>Use it everyday, goes on smoothly and covers completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 years old</li>
            <li>and it still does not look natural.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I only wear it when I need to tear myself from the computer and face the real world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>No amount of oil blotting helps and really, the oiliness only goes away after I have removed it from my face.  </li>
            <li>I found it markedly under-moisturizing.</li>
            <li>really considered sending it back because the color did not match my skin at all.</li>
            <li>sent back twice and got back the same color and just gave up and is to light for my skin</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t ready to totally call it a bust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, but I do like my face to look soft and natural, which is why I like the BB creams.</li>
            <li>but her skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s spreads evenly, it&#x27;s natural looking.</li>
            <li>and it turns out to be very oily and low</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;2- Looked natural</li>
            <li>Does not leave an oily feeling and blends real well for Latinas, will totally buy again!!</li>
            <li>It is NOT heavy at all.</li>
            <li>and it is not heavy or caked up.</li>
            <li>only tried it on one side of my face to see how much of a difference it made.</li>
            <li>The only effective anti-aging regimen out there is sun protection; the only trouble is, you won&#x27;t see the result for decades to come.</li>
            <li>and I mean LOVE this BB cream.</li>
            <li>Ever since I started using this, I&#x27;ve had fewer pimples, skin looks less dry and psoriasis episodes have been more scarce.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this for 3 days now and my skin has not reacted negatively to this which is a HUGE plus because I normally would start breaking out in rashes after a day.  </li>
            <li>only problem is that this particular formula is not for oily skin.</li>
            <li>After just two hours, I was shining all over my face and the previously light cream became like a heavy mask on my pores as it mixed with the oil.</li>
            <li>but I suffer from enlarged pores, laugh lines, and slight wrinkles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I seriously laughed out loud and thought I was on crazy pills.</li>
            <li>Although, my skin is sensitive and since I&#x27;m olive-toned, I have slight darkness under my large eyes and some natural rosiness along my lid.</li>
            <li>I am pleased that you only need to use a very small amount.(basically the size of a pea).</li>
            <li>First it was too dark for my skin color</li>
            <li>I still apply Bare Escentuals powders over it, and I find the result</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m of Native American heritage and had no trouble matching my color using the Med-deep that I ordered.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comparison to Bare Minerals:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forehead gets shiny after a couple hours of applying B Minerals-</li>
            <li>However, upon the first couple of uses I discovered that the extra money is well spent for a reason.</li>
            <li>and I doubt that I&#x27;ll find other (more expensive) brands worth the added cost.</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin</li>
            <li>I love that it contains sunscreen, I usually have to change my foundation and pressed powder color to a darker color in the summer time to account for tanning, but after using this product I have not had to change my other products at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually a MAC GIRL, but after trying this one i just couldnt get enough of how light is actually it!</li>
            <li>This product is reasonably priced compared to other makeups/foundations.</li>
            <li>Not as much coverage as some of the other BB creams I&#x27;ve used,</li>
            <li>&quot; and several other magazines; I have combination/oily skin, and don&#x27;t really break out</li>
            <li>I would recommend this cream for daily use (I use this every day)  and recommend this only for medium skin, not dark skin.  </li>
            <li>So much so, that I had to apply a powder to tone down the shine.</li>
            <li>It went onto my skin too thick with a Beautyblender, and was never absorbed; it just sat on top of my skin all day.  </li>
            <li>This product got mostly positive reviews, and a few raves, and for the life of me, I can&#x27;t figure out why.</li>
            <li>It is so much lighter than I am that it looks obvious and odd.</li>
            <li>, I rarely break out and I have very few blemishes; so makeup is only something I use to even me out a tiny bit.</li>
            <li>, It has decent coverage and covered up maybe 80% of my dark circles.</li>
            <li>.. dark but with copper undertones) and this particular item is not for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming this product is not made for darker tone black women because the medium deep seemed like it should be more for Beyonce, NOT Gabrielle Union if you know what I mean.</li>

            <li> Has me looky flawless</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the perfect product for the summer as I&#x27;m concerned!</li>
            <li> Great stuff at affordable price!</li>
            <li> Not for cover up but work beautifully!!</li>
            <li> This is the best drugstore BB for me.</li>
            <li> It perfectly matched my skin tone and does not look foundationy or makeupy at all.</li>
            <li> I figured maybe my skin needed to adjust, and after a couple of hours, I still wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the best BB cream on the market.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful coverage.</li>
            <li> Skin Perfect or\\&quot; as a statement of fact and not just a description of what the company hopes the product will do for you.</li>
            <li> and I looked great!</li>
            <li> After reading tons of reviews I bought this BB thinking it was going to be awesome</li>
            <li> Well the box that the cream came in say it does all these wonderful things</li>
            <li> This is a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed.</li>

            <li> color set just perfect.</li>
            <li> Perfect.</li>
            <li> Even on days I am using just powder foundation, it works great !!</li>
            <li> Best purchase of the year!</li>
            <li> awesome for skin work good,thanks</li>
            <li> The color is perfect for my olive skin.</li>
            <li> Now here&#x27;s the best part: I kid you not, when I washed off the cream</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll love it!!!</li>
            <li> very good product, i give to my mum,  </li>
            <li> My skin feels great and very happy with this product</li>
            <li> Good luck!</li>
            <li> Matched me so good!</li>
            <li> It smells good, and it makes my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> This is great</li>
            <li> This product was a great price.  </li>
            <li> Great deal.</li>
            <li> I have oily/combination skin, and although the product gave me great coverage, it greatly exacerbated the oiliness.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have oily skin, this product might work for you and the price is great.</li>
            <li> It is nice and lightweight, though it helps make skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> , i&#x27;ve heard great things about BB creams.</li>
            <li> She tells me that it works great.  </li>
            <li> and it works great for me as i use it as a primer</li>
            <li> It does a great job with coverage without using any concealer or anything else.</li>
            <li> , my face felt great all day.</li>
            <li> moisturizers\\&quot; go, and I don&#x27;t have a slew of tubes to compare this to, but I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> and the price is great too.</li>
            <li> Works great for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this Beauty Balm!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!</li>
            <li> It seems to go on very nice and has a pleasant smell to it.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy some of my own!</li>
            <li> news is that the Medium/Deep tone I bought that matches my skin perfectly gives her a healthy looking glow and blends well on her.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and even smells nice!</li>
            <li> :)) thank you for helping find a perfect shade for my skin and helping the elasticity and color correction of my skin already improve.</li>
            <li> I found out that all I need to do is spread this wonderful cream on my face and neck and in the areas that I want more coverage, to use a concealer.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m going to buy my own!</li>
            <li> Have used sooooo many liquid makeups and this one is great!</li>
            <li> It feels very pleasant at face as it has very light consistence which gives the feeling of breathing to your skin.</li>
            <li> Has a pleasant smell and noticed a difference in skin within 2 week period.</li>
            <li> , this cream also has a very pleasant smell which is something most liquid foundations lack.</li>
            <li> It is a good product for hide some imperfections in the skin, not like a foundation</li>
            <li> In a lighter color it might be good during the winter months.</li>
            <li> This product provides good coverage.  </li>
            <li> The price is good and she would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It provides good coverage without sinking into the wrinkles and seems to improve skin tone.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels really good when I apply this product.  </li>
            <li> This is a really good product.</li>
            <li> and id smells good</li>
            <li> , I have fairly oily skin on my forehead that I always have to worry about</li>
            <li> Not for Acne prone and oily skin, product has good coverge</li>
            <li> Very light, it works great, perfect for the summer time, i dont recommend it to people with super oily skin since it moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Great cream for the price -- and this version (oily skin) is fragrance free!</li>
            <li> Love this cream, and the price is great.</li>
            <li> It made my skin look really pretty and matte, a lot of people were talking about how oily it feels but it felt perfect on me</li>
            <li> This has been like magic for my face!</li>
            <li> I need more than just a sunscreen!  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a lot more than sun protection!</li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> This will be a good makeup for summer though because its very light to wear</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly and smells great.</li>
            <li> and it comes a nice amount.</li>
            <li> The color is really nice though...</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I loved the idea of being able to have a moisturizer, spf, primer and tinted moisturizer all in one product.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a week to honestly see if I liked it.</li>
            <li> It really covers well and will make your complexion flawless!</li>
            <li> This did not blend in as nicely as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> It kind of streaks and seems to cake onto my skin.</li>
            <li> Color matches my skin nicely.</li>
            <li> Ths cream makes my skin look smoother, has good stuff in the cream to enhance it to make it healthier, and truly does help making my skin all the better for it.  </li>
            <li> It went on sooo nice -</li>
            <li> I used a sponge - not cakey at all, nice and even.</li>
            <li> I am kind of known for not wearing makeup</li>
            <li> : kind of a runny product</li>
            <li> Unlike BB Cream, it rubs off very easily, even with setting powder and/or spray.</li>
            <li> The product has a continuous very strong perfume odor to it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty good for humid fl weather!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m flawless and not pale.</li>
            <li> I liked a lot better.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s thee best product as far as \\&quot;tinted</li>
            <li> and this is the best ive found so far.</li>
            <li> Coverage is very light</li>
            <li> BB creams are usually very light and as I have gotten tanner I decided to use the medium/deep version</li>
            <li> The cream seemed to have a nice smell and apply easily non greasy, but I would purchase a lighter shade.</li>
            <li> The result was a very light, flawless, air brushed look all over my face and neck.</li>
            <li> &quot; It&#x27;s more like a tinted moisturizer with sunblock added.</li>
            <li> (if you are okay with heaviness).&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Nice and light.</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments on the look of my skin.</li>
            <li> and I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Most of the time I&#x27;d just use moisturizer, eyeshadow, and lip gloss or nude lipstick.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this because most of the reviews I watch on YOUTUBE said that it made their skin oily</li>
            <li> It gives ok coverage.</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> okay...</li>
            <li> I really love this one.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing 2 BB creams (this one, and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s) I did a lot of product research, mostly on Amazon and Pinterest.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s BB cream, however, provides more coverage and a lighter feeling.</li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly and blends nicely.</li>
            <li> I noticed that throughout the day, my skin felt even more oily, and I had a nagging desire to just wash everything off my face.</li>
            <li> It sits like a greasy layer on top of the skin and transfers to anything in site - whether it&#x27;s a tissue you blow your nose with,</li>
            <li> I love the idea.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find the medium/deep formula that specifically says \\&quot;oil free\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I love this formula.</li>
            <li> I love-</li>
            <li> Its okay.</li>
            <li> Its not the best and its definitely not for you if you have oily skin!</li>
            <li> Tried this because I do love some of the Garnier Skin products, but this is not&lt;br /&gt;one of them.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bb cream.</li>
            <li> i love this bb cream</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so glad I ignored</li>
            <li> , I prefer to have a more dewey appearance</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Most of my expectations were exceeded.</li>
            <li> but im satisfied with it</li>
            <li> I am 68 and prefer this product to more pricer products.  </li>
            <li> I applied a generous amount (the size of a quarter on my entire face) and I looked flawless...</li>
            <li> You might get that \\&quot;chalky\\&quot; look many complain of but try another brand.</li>
            <li> so when I need more, I will buy from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The price here is much better.</li>
            <li> This product shipped fast and it  had a great price.</li>
            <li> and i love that.</li>
            <li> omg I got so many zits after using this for a week&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was expecting more coverage.  </li>
            <li> I wish it covered better.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more when this tube is gone.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and have not used a smular product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use foundation any more.</li>
            <li> she love it,  and i am going to buy more,.thanks..</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> It goes on a lot smoother, spreads, and blends much better with a touch of my moisturizer in it.</li>
            <li> But, if you of that &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; variety then you will be more than satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I like it as a primer mostly.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing without clogging my pores and causing more breakouts.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for most skin colors.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my favorite cream</li>
            <li> i like this item but its more of a tinted moisturizer than a bb cream</li>
            <li> but it did a nice job and smells fantastic</li>
            <li> I also purchased a higher priced Beauty Balm and to be honest, I like this balm better!</li>
            <li> ...that this is a pretty good cream.</li>
            <li> Great even natural looking coverage foundation + moisturizer + UV protection + Vitamins.</li>
            <li> Coverage is light (this is NOT a concealer) but does seem to give one a more even appearance.  </li>
            <li> Once it is on it is OK, and it smoothes, covers lightly and provides a bit of a \\&quot;blurred\\&quot; look to spots and scars.</li>
            <li> the &#x27;cheap&#x27; version - how could it be any better?</li>
            <li> It is oily, but I put light powder on top (</li>
            <li> However, I suppose skin types (unlike clothes) are one of those things that doesn&#x27;t easily transfer from one person to another.</li>
            <li> Glides on easy and not oily at all.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about the smell being strong based on reviews from others but have not had an issue.</li>
            <li> It does look very good on the skin (as long as it stays on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I definately update if it breaks me out or makes a huge improvement in my skin, but right now I&#x27;m loving it</li>
            <li> If they made a dark it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> My skin looks nice and pretty.</li>
            <li> This cream felt fine going on, but within two days I had SORE pimples growing on my chin and cheeks- almost like stress pimples.</li>
            <li> Faced BB Cream (which is an excellent product) and decided to try the much less costly Garnier version.</li>
            <li> but it worked just fine for me.</li>
            <li> I am lucky to have nice (blemish-free) skin, so I really use this more so as a tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> oily skin version has no fragrance which made a HUGE difference for me.</li>
            <li> so that is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that is also giving my face a smooth (non-make-up-caked-on-looking) face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is basically tinted moisturizer/sunblock with some mica flakes to reflect light and \\&quot;minimize</li>
            <li> cheap</li>
            <li> I have light brown, combo oily/dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the medium/deep formula and it is just a tad light for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the Light in the winter and the medium/deep in the summer.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t do anything with this, since it was cheap</li>
            <li> It spread in a perfectly smooth even manner over my pre-moistened face and neck.</li>
            <li> I would always find residue of the light reflectors found in the Aveeno on his face), and has not tranferred to any of mine since I reduced the amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never used BB creams before nor have I ever heard of this until I received this product for free to try as a BzzAgent campaign.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically a tinted sunscreen that gives you the converage of a light liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li> My complexion is a sort of caramel colored(Mac-NC45 Make up Forever 170) ; with that said the medium-deep is about a 1/2 shade too light for my preference.</li>
            <li> It can give you a light oil to your face around the nose</li>
            <li> I used the medium/deep and it matched really well and blended nicely.</li>
            <li> how much foundation do you have on\\&quot;!!!</li>
            <li> I very rarely break out anymore, and after using this ONCE, my face was covered in sits.</li>
            <li> I layer on a foundation powder on top and then a matte powder to make sure I don&#x27;t have any shine and this normally works all day to keep the shine away.  </li>
            <li> and my goal is to wear something easy, quick, and double-duty: moisturize, coverage,</li>
            <li> your hand as you brush your hair off your face, a new top that you&#x27;re putting on over your head, or even the seatbelt in your car!</li>
            <li> I used to buy the original BB cream</li>
            <li> I found that it works best if I apply very lightly as an usual tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear any kind of concealer/foundation/powder, etc.</li>
            <li> it is because you&#x27;re using it alone or the moisturizer you use under is too rich.</li>
            <li> This is lightweight and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I have a fresh fresh and healthy glow</li>
            <li> I can scar easily too if I don&#x27;t take care of blemishes right away.</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of products through Amazon with my hubby&#x27;s account, so when I saw that Amazon started carrying BB creams, I was super excited.</li>
            <li> This feels great when I first apply it, but the moment I get outside in the summer and my skin begins to oil, it gets greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like it for the most part although for me it doesn&#x27;t really moisturize my skin too well.</li>
            <li> BB Cream gives me full and even coverage and doesn&#x27;t make me look greasy at all.</li>
            <li> was really hoping that this would be a cheaper and more convenient replacement to my Balm Shelter tinted moisturizer with spf; or my Avon MagiX.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t full coverage by any means.  </li>
            <li> Every time I wear this I always get so many compliments on how much my skin is glowing.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad at all.  </li>
            <li> It gives a nice glow and natural warm color to my face, and just makes me look more put together without having a heavy foundation, yet gives a bit more color than a tinted moisturizer that I used before.</li>
            <li> great if you dont have lotion or makeup...more of a sunscreen but does the job to make your face look fresh if you dont have makup or if your skin is dry</li>
            <li> A great thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t make me break out like other products.</li>
            <li> As far as the color goes, unless you are a very fair skinned African-American or Latino, the medium-deep shade is probably not going to be for you unless you&#x27;re using it under your regular makeup.</li>
            <li> My skin got more even, my breakouts are less and my skin feels smoother, but the dewey finish the cream gives is not flattering againts my oily skin, if they make a oil control formula or a oily skin formula, i would definitely buy it :D</li>
            <li> It blends really well and looks really nice, but about noonish I notice that my skin becomes really oily and I am tempted to just wash it off.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and soft for most of the day.</li>
            <li> For example, it gives fairly good coverage with a modest amount of product, and I just really like the idea of a BB cream.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t react well to pollen, and I have a mild blemish issue.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel oily and it acts on her skin quickly...</li>
            <li> oh AND it has spf for my quick drive and sun</li>
            <li> Comes off very easy and smudges off, I hugged my friend and it came off on his jacket, he said \\&quot;wow</li>
            <li> , I did at first think the shade came out too light for me, BUT like some powders and foundations, you have to let it sit and set in your skin a bit.</li>
            <li> It goes on really smooth and covers pretty well in opinion.</li>
            <li> It offers great light coverage and your face is left with a glow.</li>
            <li> It was fantastic for the first 4 hours.</li>
            <li> but this one seems pretty good especially for the price!</li>
            <li> It is very creamy and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I actually think it stands up pretty good</li>
            <li> And I will say my skin does actually look better!</li>
            <li> In fact the more I rub it in, the more it makes my skin look dry</li>
            <li> Even though I am actually a Light to Medium person, I really like this color.  </li>
            <li> I like this BB product and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin -- in fact, it really did tend to smooth out the texture.  </li>
            <li> Overall this product is amazing</li>
            <li> It looked great and didn&#x27;t feel too heavy.</li>
            <li> This is more of a tinted moisturizer that has to be built up to have the same coverage of BB Cream (but then it&#x27;s no longer light application).</li>
            <li> Overall, I would NOT recommend this cream for people with oil-prone skin, or for those looking for any kind of coverage.</li>
            <li> but this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> My skin color has not darkened with the hot summer weather, I have been able to keep using my normal product.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with it so far.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly good skin with only slightly uneven skin tone in some areas, and the Skin Renew was able to give me a near flawless complexion without the three separate products I&#x27;d have had to use to achieve the same look and protection.</li>
            <li> (ashy looking).It was worth a try</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite surprised and pleased at this product...especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> I added a rose Christian Dior lip gloss</li>
            <li> I say for the price, under $20 it is worth the gamble.</li>
            <li> I hope this review will be useful.</li>
            <li> I paid 15 bucks or more in the drugstore for this, so I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised to find I can save by buying with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I liked the product and going to buy another one for the future.</li>
            <li> So I was definitely surprised when I liked it so much.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve gotten comments like, your skin has gotten brighter, more clear,</li>
            <li> Love the way this covers and it looks so natural.  </li>
            <li> The normal skin version had a scent so strong</li>
            <li> It absorbed easily and gave very natural look to the face.</li>
            <li> It melted right off in the</li>
            <li> The tone is just right</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it, and you get more with Garnier than other BB creams at higher prices.</li>
            <li> I went into it expecting it to be more of a tinted moisturizer and was blown away with how better my one half of the face looked even after just an hour of keeping it on (wanted to check for irritation).</li>
            <li> At baseline, I use Anthelios SPF 15 sunscreen/moisturizer and Bare Escentuals powder on top for blush/ mineral veil.</li>
            <li> Worth splurging for a higher end BB....</li>
            <li> So I thought since my completion changes alot this would be good color to apply when im at my darkest, but when I applied it on it was a bit to dark</li>
            <li> I use mostly department store make-up as I don&#x27;t normally trust drug store brands, because I have extremely sensitive skin (mild ecezema on my face)</li>
            <li> I use a pricier Sephora brand as well, but this one is right up there with the higher priced creams in quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The skin around my lips and chin is kind of dry</li>
            <li> , my skin is extremely sensitive so I would&#x27;ve known very quickly if it was going to.</li>
            <li> I am very optimistic and love it so far.</li>
            <li> I like it very much</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I had chosed this color because I was hearing alot that this was a very light color for being medium or deep.  </li>
            <li> This my first bb cream</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t pretty.  </li>
            <li> : BB Cream is an all-in-one skin care, light natural looking make-up.</li>
            <li> Overall, the product is okay and does match my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I discovered this works very well as a PRIMER!</li>
            <li> first using the cream, I applied it everywhere: cheeks, nose, forehead, chin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty lightweight</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that leans more towards the oily side, especially on humid days.  </li>
            <li> Tried it two more times just to be sure and it was \\&quot;oil slick city\\&quot; each time.</li>
            <li> and it gives such a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid make-up user</li>
            <li> this is my first time using bb cream</li>
            <li> it goes on natural and light.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and smooth and it does even out my tone.  </li>
            <li> I used Revlon SkinLights Instant Skin Brightener for many years but they discontinued the product.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a foundation that was not heavy on my face,natural looking and gave me a smooth complection</li>
            <li> I have an olive complexion with generally smooth and clear skin.</li>
            <li> I must tell you that I use a light natural oil moisturizer on my skin, then apply the BB cream before foundation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I tried this BB cream</li>
            <li> After that I was pretty hesitant to try</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day even on a hot summer day.</li>
            <li> its ok you can only really smell it while ur applying it.</li>
            <li> There are some positive attributes about this cream.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried BB cream and this product works really well.</li>
            <li> But 3 times a week I do vigorous exercise and on those days I noticed it kind of ran down my face like paint when I would sweat</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps this would be a better product for someone who struggles with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I let it dry then apply some powder on top after about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Nice texture, nice smell, multi-funtion, just a little to dark for me</li>
            <li> I like this particular BB cream very much.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get away with using just a little of it since I am a little darker in the summer, and I loved it.</li>
            <li> play softball and this really has protected my skin from the sun.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very watery and dries very powdery.</li>
            <li> I really like a lot of Garnier hair products, and was hoping for a quality product.</li>
            <li> It makes the whole face one color .</li>
            <li> really like that</li>
            <li> so I tend to stretch them as much as I can.</li>
            <li> and it was way too much.</li>
            <li> so mixing these 2 creams together is what I&#x27;m currently doing, as the L&#x27;Oreal medium is too light for my summer skin, and the Garnier has a bit of a bronze tone in it.</li>
            <li> After using this for a month, I didn&#x27;t notice much improvement of my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works well, but doesn&#x27;t even out my skin tone as much as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li> It has that really sun-screeny feel.</li>
            <li> I love it, it did what I expected to do.</li>
            <li> thanks you</li>
            <li> recently found a version of this product in \\&quot;deep\\&quot; that specifically says oil free.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel matte and stayed that way for much of the day.</li>
            <li> The tint blends very well with skin color-</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much for me, I just put it on as a foundation</li>
            <li> this has absolutely none.</li>
            <li> first day I tried it I used the amount I would normally use for the Aveeno (about a quarter size).</li>
            <li> but I am very picky when it comes to what goes on my face.</li>
            <li> But not my really color..</li>
            <li> With this said, I absolutely adore, adore this cream.</li>
            <li> I was perplexed about finding one that would suit my skin tone since I am a deep milk chocolate brown.</li>
            <li> and I really like the coverage.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit oily but not too much.</li>
            <li> This is very moisturizing and covers up all of my redness.</li>
            <li> so this is just enough to look pulled together hassle free.</li>
            <li> Cost-benefit really pays off.</li>
            <li> Not so much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly, I do not think that it offered much (to even out the appearance).</li>
            <li> It also made my skin feel greasy and gave it a very shiny appearance.</li>
            <li> So much for the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to like this product and simplify my skin care routine (sunscreen and coverage).</li>
            <li> If you put some translucent powder on, you are set to go and it lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> so i am very picky with these cover ups.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how much of a difference</li>
            <li> would say B Minerals feels lighter, but Garnier isn&#x27;t too much heavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great beauty secret that I&#x27;ve shared with my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not bragging but only wanted to give a fair representation of my skin and why BB Cream make work better or worse for me than others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Garnier&#x27;s BB cream for several months now and can honestly say that even if I decided to walk outside without makeup, I wouldn&#x27;t walk out without wearing my BB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not cheap, but worth it!!!</li>
            <li> lol A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I tried it on a small area on my chest to make sure it was the product causing it, and sure enough, I broke out there too.</li>
            <li> Feels a little heavier than the higher end products, but blends in much better.</li>
            <li> Well first let me say wow!</li>
            <li> Other than that I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so light, I usually wear just some light powder or no makeup at all</li>
            <li> This is the perfect color for my difficult to match south asian skin - however the downsides certainly outweigh the color match.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, not too heavy, and I don&#x27;t have much color to my 85 year old face, so when there is a special occasdion I apply this.</li>
            <li> usual foundation is Cover Girl TrueBlend liquid foundation which is simply an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Made my normal skin very oily and shiny.</li>
            <li> First of all, wow.</li>
            <li> I did appreciate that it was sheer to medium b/c it is getting warmer and who has time for a face full of makeup when its 80</li>
            <li> Most foundations offer a higher SPF, superior coverage, more colors to choose from, less irritating to my eyes and less shine.</li>
            <li> other than that, on my day to day, regular days; i simply apply this and it feels great.</li>
            <li> have dry, but otherwise problem free skin.</li>
            <li> So on days that I don&#x27;t workout it makes my skin tone noticeably more even, less shiny</li>
            <li> The coverage is very sheer, good to slap on if you need to run out the door in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The last two BB Creams I bought were either to shear of burned my face mildly.</li>
            <li> I did give it to my mother, who is Caucasian with older skin, since I feel that she would benefit from it&#x27;s greasiness.  </li>
            <li> I was a big fan of skin79, as I love Korean BB creams, but I switched to using Origins Vitazing (with the sheer tint).</li>
            <li> Way better, albeit much more expensive.</li>
            <li> This random lady told me in the store when I was looking and said you will love this product so now I can tell you my experience \\&quot; LOVE</li>
            <li> just wanted overall simplicity with this product and quick coverage.</li>
            <li> I would suggest to try this BB cream before spending money on more expensive brands as this does all that it promises and more.</li>
            <li> It provides a decent amount of coverage.</li>
            <li> Need to try a different more universal product.</li>
            <li> I will say its not for everyone, but there definitely needs to be a more wider range of this product for different skin tones.</li>
            <li> I have a drawer full of foundations that offer a higher SPF - and have a full palette of colors to choose from to at least match my skin</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> and I think I could almost wear this as my main foundation on a normal day.</li>
            <li> However, if I mix this with a little bit of my moisturizer it makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I was also happy to see that Garnier&#x27;s $13 dollar option was two ounces as opposed to one and a half ounces, or even less (Smashbox BB Cream).</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because this BB cream in particular is one of my new favorites.</li>
            <li> idk my skin is weird lol).</li>
            <li> But I normally don&#x27;t have oily skin like this.</li>
            <li> day three I dared to put the cream on my eyelids, something that would normally cause my eyes tosting all day with the Aveeno, and to my suprise it did not burn at</li>
            <li> If you are a truly deep girl I suggest you go for the Maybelline Dream Fresh BB cream as that is a lot darker.</li>
            <li> Before this BB cream I tried the Clinique foundation and it dried out my skin even more.</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny bit and it glides on easily.</li>
            <li> Faced&#x27;s Primed and Poreless, skin79 (pink label), Clinique&#x27;s Instant Perfector, and these products offer more of a miracle for my skin than Garnier&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I am african american with a light peanut butter complexion and I purchased the medium/deep.</li>
            <li> Truly love this product...new and different, and covers minimal flaws completely!  </li>
            <li> BUT, in about the second hour of wearing it, my face gets very very shiny and oily.  </li>
            <li> I fell for the advertisement which shows a women putting it under her eyes as a highlighting concealer/moisturizer, even though the package mysteriously avoids saying exactly what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> When I first got it, I applied the same amount as I do the Cover Girl</li>
            <li> I definitely think using a makeup sponge helps so much in applying it - if your getting oily and your just using your hands or a makeup brush use a sponge instead!</li>
            <li> This definitely covered those up enough that I felt good about my skin but didn&#x27;t feel like I had this heavy layer on.</li>
            <li> (Although sometimes when they have those by one get one half off, or free you can save that way also)</li>
            <li> First let me preface this review by saying that everyone should know (any adult) that not every product will produce the same results as it does on someone else.</li>
            <li> I prefer full coverage makeup, so ill be sticking to that for the most part.</li>
            <li> 4 hours with Garnier.&lt;br /&gt;Garnier coverage is better than B Minerals, especially when it comes to my dark undereyes,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, that was the only positive I found with this product.</li>
            <li> the following weeks, I resorted back to using Anthelios for my forehead, nose and chin, which are areas that need adequate moisture, and use the BB cream exclusively for my cheeks, where it appears to even out tone well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for light cream with a little tint but not a foundation.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen 15, perfect tone for me in the summer, vit C (stimulates collagen), correction (hac bad acnea on the chin younger) and looks so natural, not powdery or caky.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday, goes on smoothly and covers completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 years old</li>
            <li> and it still does not look natural.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I only wear it when I need to tear myself from the computer and face the real world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> No amount of oil blotting helps and really, the oiliness only goes away after I have removed it from my face.  </li>
            <li> I found it markedly under-moisturizing.</li>
            <li> really considered sending it back because the color did not match my skin at all.</li>
            <li> sent back twice and got back the same color and just gave up and is to light for my skin</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t ready to totally call it a bust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, but I do like my face to look soft and natural, which is why I like the BB creams.</li>
            <li> but her skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s spreads evenly, it&#x27;s natural looking.</li>
            <li> and it turns out to be very oily and low</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;2- Looked natural</li>
            <li> Does not leave an oily feeling and blends real well for Latinas, will totally buy again!!</li>
            <li> It is NOT heavy at all.</li>
            <li> and it is not heavy or caked up.</li>
            <li> only tried it on one side of my face to see how much of a difference it made.</li>
            <li> The only effective anti-aging regimen out there is sun protection; the only trouble is, you won&#x27;t see the result for decades to come.</li>
            <li> and I mean LOVE this BB cream.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using this, I&#x27;ve had fewer pimples, skin looks less dry and psoriasis episodes have been more scarce.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this for 3 days now and my skin has not reacted negatively to this which is a HUGE plus because I normally would start breaking out in rashes after a day.  </li>
            <li> only problem is that this particular formula is not for oily skin.</li>
            <li> After just two hours, I was shining all over my face and the previously light cream became like a heavy mask on my pores as it mixed with the oil.</li>
            <li> but I suffer from enlarged pores, laugh lines, and slight wrinkles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I seriously laughed out loud and thought I was on crazy pills.</li>
            <li> Although, my skin is sensitive and since I&#x27;m olive-toned, I have slight darkness under my large eyes and some natural rosiness along my lid.</li>
            <li> I am pleased that you only need to use a very small amount.(basically the size of a pea).</li>
            <li> First it was too dark for my skin color</li>
            <li> I still apply Bare Escentuals powders over it, and I find the result</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of Native American heritage and had no trouble matching my color using the Med-deep that I ordered.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comparison to Bare Minerals:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forehead gets shiny after a couple hours of applying B Minerals-</li>
            <li> However, upon the first couple of uses I discovered that the extra money is well spent for a reason.</li>
            <li> and I doubt that I&#x27;ll find other (more expensive) brands worth the added cost.</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin</li>
            <li> I love that it contains sunscreen, I usually have to change my foundation and pressed powder color to a darker color in the summer time to account for tanning, but after using this product I have not had to change my other products at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a MAC GIRL, but after trying this one i just couldnt get enough of how light is actually it!</li>
            <li> This product is reasonably priced compared to other makeups/foundations.</li>
            <li> Not as much coverage as some of the other BB creams I&#x27;ve used,</li>
            <li> &quot; and several other magazines; I have combination/oily skin, and don&#x27;t really break out</li>
            <li> I would recommend this cream for daily use (I use this every day)  and recommend this only for medium skin, not dark skin.  </li>
            <li> So much so, that I had to apply a powder to tone down the shine.</li>
            <li> It went onto my skin too thick with a Beautyblender, and was never absorbed; it just sat on top of my skin all day.  </li>
            <li> This product got mostly positive reviews, and a few raves, and for the life of me, I can&#x27;t figure out why.</li>
            <li> It is so much lighter than I am that it looks obvious and odd.</li>
            <li> , I rarely break out and I have very few blemishes; so makeup is only something I use to even me out a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> , It has decent coverage and covered up maybe 80% of my dark circles.</li>
            <li> .. dark but with copper undertones) and this particular item is not for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming this product is not made for darker tone black women because the medium deep seemed like it should be more for Beyonce, NOT Gabrielle Union if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Companies do in fact hope that consumers will have a positive experience with their product and buy it again and again, as well as recommend the product to others; after all there is no better advertisement than \\&quot;word of mouth\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Since I tan in summer, my skin is a little darker than it normally would be,</li>
            <li> For that, I&#x27;m not sure if this item really qualify as a \\&quot;BB Cream.\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used it long enough to judge its repair qualities</li>
            <li> This product should last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> This is my second tube of cream and I will keep buying it as long as Garnier keeps making it.</li>
            <li> and I have dry overall skin and oily in the T zone.</li>
            <li> Not sure why anyone would bother with a sunscreen that only offers 15 SPF and only comes in two colors?</li>
            <li> Normal suncreen is too thick and my regular foundation only has SPF 10.  </li>
            <li> It was a little dark for me and it makes my skin really oily.</li>
            <li> While it even my overall skin tone, it&#x27;s just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I am hooked on this brand because it lasts a long time-</li>
            <li> This cream also goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> but they felt too heavy and un natural.</li>
            <li> As soon as I got out of the store I tried it on my hand and thought I had to take it back as it looked too pink for my skin tone, but after a couple minutes it just kinda blended into my color</li>
            <li> I used the 1st one down until I could barely squeeze anything out.</li>
            <li> it does give lighter skin tone but its wet and doesnt last all day on my skin,i have dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried an Asian BB cream or any other type of BB cream</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin this may help you out?</li>
            <li> but sometimes it can be dry...</li>
            <li> I wonder if my t-zone and dry skin friends can perhaps find some use for it?</li>
            <li> This cream doesn&#x27;t highlight the dry patches in the morning and still maintains its matte finish when it gets oily in the afternoon.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need it unless my skin gets dry.  </li>
            <li> Not patchy in the dry areas.</li>
            <li> The color choices are also limited and the SPF is also a bit lower than I would have liked.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I cannot come up with a single advantage that this product offers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use very little because too much will make u look cakey and &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34; and it can be a little oily.</li>
            <li> which is probably only 3 times a week or less.</li>
            <li> I noticed the next day that one or two small pimples had appeared on my forehead and chin, and though I can&#x27;t entirely fault the cream, I thought it was suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is also very dry in the mornings after I shower and gets oily throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a stay-at-home mom with a very limited budget for makeup and clothes</li>
            <li> I just had a tiny little bit.</li>
            <li> Not very much!</li>
            <li> I intend to splurge on an Estee Lauder BB cream when my finances allow it since they have a wide selection of colors.</li>
            <li> but I do use this on weekends with minimal make up</li>
            <li> So far this is the second BB cream that I have tired and found it to be a lot smoother to apply.</li>
            <li> so it went on extra thick and gross before I realized I only need a small amount.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems a little goes a long way with me.</li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way as well as a bit of trial and error.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way-</li>
            <li> It did not spread and absorb as \\&quot;lotion like\\&quot; as I expected and the result, the dry areas of my face were amplified and the other areas looked like I had on heavy foundation.</li>
            <li> Not BB Cream: firstly, it&#x27;s not a cream...</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I had in mind,</li>
            <li> A lot of sunblocks do, but for one that&#x27;s around $11 for a small tube and only 15 SPF, it&#x27;s a deal breaker.  </li>
            <li> It stays on and doesn&#x27;t run in the heat like other products of this type I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product and Garnier other products.</li>
            <li> and when I first applied it it looked really weird</li>
            <li> I have used other BB creams and tinted moisturizers&lt;</li>
            <li> The one glaring problem is that I also have extremely oil skin.</li>
            <li> It usually looks extra drab to me when I remove my make</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s rather liquidity when you squirt it out so it can get a little messy if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have acne or any other skin issues other than an oily nose that gets blackheads (treated with Biore black head remover).</li>
            <li> But I definitely don&#x27;t have perfect skin, I just had a bad break out that left me with some icky spots and those little zits that are so annoying.</li>
            <li> I almost did not purchase this item due to the negative reviews on Amazon, but with it being on sale for $10 at the local Target and me having a $2 off coupon, I figured for $8 it wouldn&#x27;t be too devestating if the product turned out to be a bust.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not worth the money.</li>
            <li> and it was wayyy to dark for me.  </li>
            <li> I have a dark complexion (halle berry ish</li>
            <li> I have dark combination skin.</li>
            <li> With that being said I purchased this to help with blemishes and dark marks.</li>
            <li> I was getting all these dark spots from sun on my face and bb cream has stopped them and protected me from sun,</li>
            <li> Not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I am more appalled</li>
            <li> Though it says it&#x27;s for all skin types, it is extremely heavy and greasy (so definitely NOT for those with oily skin), the coverage is almost non-existent, and I think it actually makes my skin look worse (way too shiny).</li>
            <li> When things start to heat up and it melts down into your eyes</li>
            <li> I have light/medium brown skin (I&#x27;m black)</li>
            <li> I started with a slightly damp face, a layer of the Garnier Moisture Rescue Gel Cream (which was already part of my night time skin routine), and a PEA SIZE amount of the BB cream.</li>
            <li> I also have slight discoloration.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream without moisturizer and have had slight shine, but no oily skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have bought two bottles because the shipping was half the price of one.</li>
            <li> I used it although it&#x27;s a little too dark for my skin.</li>
            <li> I use maybe a little less than the size of a dime;apply it to my forehead, cheeks chin and neck and blend.</li>
            <li> so I was hesitant to try one, thinking the BB cream and foundation would be too heavy for my slightly oily skin.</li>
            <li> My face still gets a little shiny</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers said, it is cakey and it usually takes about 10-15 minutes before it &amp;#34;settles&amp;#34; on my face</li>
            <li> but I added a little powder compact and</li>
            <li> Well, I have to admit, I should have read the label closer, or done a little research.</li>
            <li> but my skin tone is a little uneven</li>
            <li> This is the closest to the Revlon SkinLights product I have found.&lt;br /&gt;It adds little brightness to my skin and does not look heavy.</li>
            <li> I bought this BB cream because I don&#x27;t like to put too much heavy makeup on my face.</li>
            <li> Commercialized not genuine product.</li>
            <li> It can be applied using a cosmetic round, wedge, stippling or foundation brush.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I decided to look for a tinted moisturizer and after seeing a few commercials decided to give this cream a</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or energy on Garnier.</li>
            <li> I am using it everyday.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t feel too heavy on my combination skin</li>
            <li> What a waste of money...</li>
            <li> I have combo/normal skin, but it didn&#x27;t feel heavy and it doesn&#x27;t make me break</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t stand the heavy makeup feel on my skin and how cakey makeup can look.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few high-end B.B. creams and nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li> and I get a few pimples.</li>
            <li> A friend who&#x27;s a beauty in her mid sixties shared this BB cream secret with me...</li>
            <li> Areas around my nose and forehead that were a little dry were exaggerated with the cream and felt odd and heavy.</li>
            <li> since it contains oil and spf, it feels a little thick.</li>
            <li> Use very little.</li>
            <li> I usually just put a layer of BB Cream</li>
            <li> I strayed from my usual</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is just my skin???</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to wear this three time in the past two week.</li>
            <li> I know this seems a rather simplistic and obvious statement to make  but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I will repurchase.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I would purchase again, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> and I think I found my everyday makeup!</li>
            <li> so therefore i lost my hard earned money.</li>
            <li> And it runs if you workout hard or sweat on your face.</li>
            <li> the negative reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> for the negative reviews I think alot of people took the \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; part of the name a bit too literal and either had pre-existing skin conditions that they did not adjust for when using this product, or just didn&#x27;t use the product correctly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am late to the BB craze; I stumbled upon it by reading an article entitled \\&quot;The 25 Beauty Products</li>
            <li> Garnier uses the cheapest ingredients available, that are terrible for your skin, and charge 12 times what it costs to make.</li>
            <li> This product does its job, however i feel its really thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that it feels thick and sticky to me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cream because I have really bad dark spots on my face, but I don&#x27;t think it is going to help my face, but I have not been using it that long, thank you amazon!</li>
            <li> unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> and I mean ever-</li>
            <li> nothing else in my skin routine changed and as soon as I stopped using it and returned this terrible product, my skin cleared right up!</li>
            <li> It is not too thick nor too thin.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is greasy, has average coverage, but the worst part is that it does not dry on or sink in to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Although it comes out of the tube very thick, it all but disappears on my skin.</li>
            <li> The other thing I did not like was the nasty greasy feel it had, while leaving the appearance of dry areas on my skin (reactions?)</li>
            <li> Anyhow, not happy with this Garnier product.</li>
            <li> and i haven&#x27;t broken out</li>
            <li> i was not happy with that, nor was he,</li>
            <li> I actually went and bought an expensive BB cream by skin79 and was so disappointed</li>
            <li> it doesnt break me out ill wear this with or without foundation</li>
            <li> However, Origins gets expensive at $35 for every 1.7 oz tube.</li>
            <li> I am sorry for lack of self-deprivation</li>
            <li> wrong shade, however, once opeaned i felt it could not be return.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> If you are a darker shade than Beyonce/Caramel/ Latte you will probably be unable to wear this color.</li>
            <li> This product failed to do this for me.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed</li>
            <li> Well was disappointed</li>
            <li> /&gt;SO disappointed.</li>
            <li> It did give my skin a very artificial, orange tone.</li>
            <li> it stings like mad!  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Hate it\\&quot; if you are expecting \\&quot;BB Cream.\\&quot; For this review, I rate it \\&quot;hate it\\&quot; because i was expecting \\&quot;BB Cream\\&quot; not another tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> hate when you can tell I have makeup on, etc.</li>
            <li> deixa a pele radiante e cobre quase todas as inperfeições, substitue a base.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t touch this crap.</li>
            <li> I was completely shocked at how terrible this product is!</li>
            <li> It makes your skin look oily and pasty and it feels terrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a horrible product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is great it doesnt break me out ill wear this with or without foundation but it conceals with be noticeable like regular make up. I use this and age rewind concealer with mac finishing powder . Has me looky flawless</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 years old and I&#x27;ve always use cosmetics. This my first bb cream and it&#x27;s the perfect product for the summer as I&#x27;m concerned! Sunscreen 15, perfect tone for me in the summer, vit C (stimulates collagen), correction (hac bad acnea on the chin younger) and looks so natural, not powdery or caky. Great stuff at affordable price! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I used to buy the original BB cream but I have oily skin and it wasn&#x27;t pretty.  This product helps with that.  My face still gets a little shiny but it&#x27;s not bad at all.  I do recommend to those people with oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I play softball and this really has protected my skin from the sun.</li>
            <li> PROS: Great even natural looking coverage foundation + moisturizer + UV protection + Vitamins. It does look very good on the skin (as long as it stays on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Not BB Cream: firstly, it&#x27;s not a cream... Definitely not \\&quot;BB Cream\\&quot; creamy. It&#x27;s very watery and dries very powdery. For that, I&#x27;m not sure if this item really qualify as a \\&quot;BB Cream.\\&quot; It&#x27;s more like a tinted moisturizer with sunblock added. Although it has some BB cream benefits, it does lacks the creamy coverage and feel. Such as the Missha or SKIN79.&lt;br /&gt;2. The color choices are also limited and the SPF is also a bit lower than I would have liked.&lt;br /&gt;3. Coverage is very light but it&#x27;s definitely build-able to medium coverage (if you are okay with heaviness).&lt;br /&gt;4. Drippy, watery, and dries with a chalky/powdery look.&lt;br /&gt;5. Unlike BB Cream, it rubs off very easily, even with setting powder and/or spray. If wearing a collar shirt (especially white), avoid the neck area or it will rub off to the collar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST APPLICATION: I found that it works best if I apply very lightly as an usual tinted moisturizer. Apply foundation, concealer, etc... on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other thoughts: BB Cream is an all-in-one skin care, light natural looking make-up. This is more of a tinted moisturizer that has to be built up to have the same coverage of BB Cream (but then it&#x27;s no longer light application). Overall, this product is \\&quot;okay\\&quot; to even \\&quot;good\\&quot; if you use it as a tinted moisturizer. \\&quot;Hate it\\&quot; if you are expecting \\&quot;BB Cream.\\&quot; For this review, I rate it \\&quot;hate it\\&quot; because i was expecting \\&quot;BB Cream\\&quot; not another tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product was a great price.  BB Creme by Garnier covered well but was oily and did not last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> 1st time I used BB cream. Nice and light. I have received many compliments on the look of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a MAC GIRL, but after trying this one i just couldnt get enough of how light is actually it! Found a replacement for my foundation!</li>
            <li> The product has a continuous very strong perfume odor to it. Bought it here because it was discontinued in stores. Now I see... smell, why. Not recommended at all.</li>
            <li> This makes my face look as if I covered it with paint.  I don&#x27;t like how it looks on me.  I have tried it two different ways and it still does not look natural.  It just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> great if you dont have lotion or makeup...more of a sunscreen but does the job to make your face look fresh if you dont have makup or if your skin is dry</li>
            <li> This cream was recommended in Oprah magazine last month, and I had been looking for a tinted moisturizer for a while, so I decided to give this a go. I was completely shocked at how terrible this product is! I really like a lot of Garnier hair products, and was hoping for a quality product. This cream felt fine going on, but within two days I had SORE pimples growing on my chin and cheeks- almost like stress pimples. I do not have acne prone skin and was in fact looking for a tinted moisturizer for this reason- I wanted something lightweight to even out my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this product is what caused me to break out- nothing else in my skin routine changed and as soon as I stopped using it and returned this terrible product, my skin cleared right up! Please DO NOT buy this product unless you want your skin to get worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I don&#x27;t know what I am more appalled at- Garnier for making the product, or O magazine for recommending it!</li>
            <li> I like it very much and I will buy more. It makes the whole face one color .</li>
            <li> I bought this BB cream because I don&#x27;t like to put too much heavy makeup on my face. Most of the time I&#x27;d just use moisturizer, eyeshadow, and lip gloss or nude lipstick. I was hesitant to buy this because most of the reviews I watch on YOUTUBE said that it made their skin oily but I could actually wear it all day and do not get oily. I like it for the most part although for me it doesn&#x27;t really moisturize my skin too well. The skin around my lips and chin is kind of dry but then again maybe it&#x27;s just winter. Overall, the product is okay and does match my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Made my normal skin very oily and shiny. not worth the money. Commercialized not genuine product. I&#x27;d try something else. I now use studio 23 lotion spf 15. Not for cover up but work beautifully!! No shine no oil no problems! Good luck!</li>
            <li> A visiting friend was using this and I asked to borrow it, after testing it out, I decided to buy some of my own! I don&#x27;t normally wear any kind of concealer/foundation/powder, etc. I just don&#x27;t like trying to match colors, hate when you can tell I have makeup on, etc. I now wear this everyday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that I feel like I&#x27;m moisturizing and protecting my face (15SPF) in one step that is also giving my face a smooth (non-make-up-caked-on-looking) face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought at Walmart for like $11, so it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I fell for the advertisement which shows a women putting it under her eyes as a highlighting concealer/moisturizer, even though the package mysteriously avoids saying exactly what it is supposed to do.  After inspecting the ingredients, I figured out it is basically tinted moisturizer/sunblock with some mica flakes to reflect light and \\&quot;minimize flaws.\\&quot;  Not exactly what I had in mind, but I thought, what the heck, I might as well use it: put it on my face, including around the eyes, like in the ad (doesn&#x27;t say to avoid your eyes on the package) and went outside.  When things start to heat up and it melts down into your eyes it stings like mad!  A lot of sunblocks do, but for one that&#x27;s around $11 for a small tube and only 15 SPF, it&#x27;s a deal breaker.  Garnier--and you--can do bbetter than BeautyBalm.</li>
            <li> To start off, my skin is what others call, \\&quot;perfect\\&quot;, I rarely break out and I have very few blemishes; so makeup is only something I use to even me out a tiny bit. I don&#x27;t have acne or any other skin issues other than an oily nose that gets blackheads (treated with Biore black head remover). I&#x27;m not bragging but only wanted to give a fair representation of my skin and why BB Cream make work better or worse for me than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wear makeup when I go out which is probably only 3 times a week or less. I work from home and I&#x27;m a stay-at-home mom with a very limited budget for makeup and clothes so I tend to stretch them as much as I can. Therefore, I only wear it when I need to tear myself from the computer and face the real world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My usual foundation is Cover Girl TrueBlend liquid foundation which is simply an amazing product. But, after getting a bottle of the Garnier BB Cream I haven&#x27;t had a reason to use the Cover Girl! I usually just put a layer of BB Cream then I finish it with a TrueBlend pressed powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BB Cream gives me full and even coverage and doesn&#x27;t make me look greasy at all. I&#x27;ve had to experiment with the amount to use and it may vary from person to person. It seems a little goes a long way with me. When I first got it, I applied the same amount as I do the Cover Girl and it was way too much. The BB Cream is thicker so it went on extra thick and gross before I realized I only need a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus to the even coverage, this cream also has a very pleasant smell which is something most liquid foundations lack.</li>
            <li> my skin showed improvement in one week. My skin got more even, my breakouts are less and my skin feels smoother, but the dewey finish the cream gives is not flattering againts my oily skin, if they make a oil control formula or a oily skin formula, i would definitely buy it :D</li>
            <li> It was a little dark for me and it makes my skin really oily. It gives ok coverage. A great thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t make me break out like other products.</li>
            <li> Has a tanning effect covers lines and blemishs. I love the product.</li>
            <li> It is a good product for hide some imperfections in the skin, not like a foundation but it does the work.&lt;br /&gt;Very cheap and it comes a nice amount. Great deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice now.&lt;br /&gt;Its okay...The coverage is very sheer, good to slap on if you need to run out the door in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I discovered this works very well as a PRIMER! I put this on before my foundation and my makeup stayed put (except for my oily nose, nothing can help that) for... 14 hours!</li>
            <li> First it was too dark for my skin color and when I put it on it made my face look greasy.  In a lighter color it might be good during the winter months.</li>
            <li> I strayed from my usual Too Faced BB Cream (which is an excellent product) and decided to try the much less costly Garnier version. I was also happy to see that Garnier&#x27;s $13 dollar option was two ounces as opposed to one and a half ounces, or even less (Smashbox BB Cream). However, upon the first couple of uses I discovered that the extra money is well spent for a reason. I have oily/combination skin, and although the product gave me great coverage, it greatly exacerbated the oiliness. No mattifying primer or powder could fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this would be a better product for someone who struggles with dry skin.</li>
            <li> As soon as I saw Xiaxue do a sponsored video for the brand I had to try it. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. The last two BB Creams I bought were either to shear of burned my face mildly. I really love this one. It did neither.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing 2 BB creams (this one, and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s) I did a lot of product research, mostly on Amazon and Pinterest. This product got mostly positive reviews, and a few raves, and for the life of me, I can&#x27;t figure out why. Though it says it&#x27;s for all skin types, it is extremely heavy and greasy (so definitely NOT for those with oily skin), the coverage is almost non-existent, and I think it actually makes my skin look worse (way too shiny). L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s BB cream, however, provides more coverage and a lighter feeling. Since I tan in summer, my skin is a little darker than it normally would be, so mixing these 2 creams together is what I&#x27;m currently doing, as the L&#x27;Oreal medium is too light for my summer skin, and the Garnier has a bit of a bronze tone in it. Overall, I would NOT recommend this cream for people with oil-prone skin, or for those looking for any kind of coverage.</li>
            <li> I got this awhile back and used it about four times. I didn&#x27;t like it at all from the start, but I was hoping that it would have a lasting effect on my skin. It makes your skin look oily and pasty and it feels terrible. I would not recommend getting this product</li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly and blends nicely. It stays on and doesn&#x27;t run in the heat like other products of this type I&#x27;ve used. Coverage is light (this is NOT a concealer) but does seem to give one a more even appearance.  I&#x27;ve not used it long enough to judge its repair qualities but it doesn&#x27;t settle in wrinkles nor look chalky.</li>
            <li> I have light brown, combo oily/dry skin.  This product provides good coverage.  BUT, in about the second hour of wearing it, my face gets very very shiny and oily.  No amount of oil blotting helps and really, the oiliness only goes away after I have removed it from my face.  After using this for a month, I didn&#x27;t notice much improvement of my skin.  If you don&#x27;t have oily skin, this product might work for you and the price is great.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because I noticed it&#x27;d been getting rave reviews from Marie Claire&#x27;s \\&quot;beauty experts\\&quot; and several other magazines; I have combination/oily skin, and don&#x27;t really break out but my skin tone is a little uneven and I thought I&#x27;d try it. At baseline, I use Anthelios SPF 15 sunscreen/moisturizer and Bare Escentuals powder on top for blush/ mineral veil. It&#x27;s works well, but doesn&#x27;t even out my skin tone as much as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first using the cream, I applied it everywhere: cheeks, nose, forehead, chin. I found it markedly under-moisturizing. Areas around my nose and forehead that were a little dry were exaggerated with the cream and felt odd and heavy. I noticed that throughout the day, my skin felt even more oily, and I had a nagging desire to just wash everything off my face. I noticed the next day that one or two small pimples had appeared on my forehead and chin, and though I can&#x27;t entirely fault the cream, I thought it was suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the following weeks, I resorted back to using Anthelios for my forehead, nose and chin, which are areas that need adequate moisture, and use the BB cream exclusively for my cheeks, where it appears to even out tone well. I still apply Bare Escentuals powders over it, and I find the result pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not everything I hoped it would be, but I do laud Garnier for making it SPF 15. The only effective anti-aging regimen out there is sun protection; the only trouble is, you won&#x27;t see the result for decades to come.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is just my skin??? But I normally don&#x27;t have oily skin like this. It blends really well and looks really nice, but about noonish I notice that my skin becomes really oily and I am tempted to just wash it off. It has that really sun-screeny feel. If you have oily skin stay away! If you have dry skin this may help you out? But it seems to enhance any oiliness you may have! The color is really nice though...</li>
            <li> I love it, it did what I expected to do. I recommend this product and Garnier other products. thanks you</li>
            <li> This is the perfect color for my difficult to match south asian skin - however the downsides certainly outweigh the color match.  This BB cream is greasy, has average coverage, but the worst part is that it does not dry on or sink in to the skin.  It sits like a greasy layer on top of the skin and transfers to anything in site - whether it&#x27;s a tissue you blow your nose with, your hand as you brush your hair off your face, a new top that you&#x27;re putting on over your head, or even the seatbelt in your car!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I loved the idea of being able to have a moisturizer, spf, primer and tinted moisturizer all in one product. I do feel this product delivers...since it contains oil and spf, it feels a little thick. Once it is on it is OK, and it smoothes, covers lightly and provides a bit of a \\&quot;blurred\\&quot; look to spots and scars. I love the idea. I purchased the medium/deep formula and it is just a tad light for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that this particular formula is not for oily skin. This feels great when I first apply it, but the moment I get outside in the summer and my skin begins to oil, it gets greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently found a version of this product in \\&quot;deep\\&quot; that specifically says oil free. I used it although it&#x27;s a little too dark for my skin. I was able to get away with using just a little of it since I am a little darker in the summer, and I loved it. It made my skin feel matte and stayed that way for much of the day. I have not been able to find the medium/deep formula that specifically says \\&quot;oil free\\&quot;. So to get by, I mix the two that I have, but I still look so shiny and greasy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this.  Was disappointed</li>
            <li> Very light, it works great, perfect for the summer time, i dont recommend it to people with super oily skin since it moisturizes. It has also helped with my break-outs!</li>
            <li> Great cream for the price -- and this version (oily skin) is fragrance free! This is the best drugstore BB for me. I use a pricier Sephora brand as well, but this one is right up there with the higher priced creams in quality.&lt;br /&gt;The oily skin version has no fragrance which made a HUGE difference for me. The normal skin version had a scent so strong I couldn&#x27;t bear it.</li>
            <li> I love this formula. It is nice and lightweight, though it helps make skin look flawless. The tint blends very well with skin color- I use the Light in the winter and the medium/deep in the summer.</li>
            <li> First of all, wow. I love-and I mean LOVE this BB cream. I&#x27;ve used tons of different kinda but this is by far my favorite. I received the package today. Very fast shipping. I chose this rating because this BB cream in particular is one of my new favorites. It smells good, and it makes my skin look flawless. There were no problems! I would definitely recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I have light/medium brown skin (I&#x27;m black) and when I first applied it it looked really weird but eventually it matched my skin tone, It has decent coverage and covered up maybe 80% of my dark circles. It&#x27;s pretty lightweight so it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have tons of makeup on you. It made my skin look really pretty and matte, a lot of people were talking about how oily it feels but it felt perfect on me and I have combination skin (but sometimes it can be dry... idk my skin is weird lol). I&#x27;ve never tried an Asian BB cream or any other type of BB cream but this one seems pretty good especially for the price! I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love this Beauty Balm!! I also purchased a higher priced Beauty Balm and to be honest, I like this balm better! It goes on so smoothly and smells great. I love that it contains sunscreen, I usually have to change my foundation and pressed powder color to a darker color in the summer time to account for tanning, but after using this product I have not had to change my other products at all. My skin color has not darkened with the hot summer weather, I have been able to keep using my normal product. This product is great as a base or primer. It can be applied using a cosmetic round, wedge, stippling or foundation brush. I have repurchased and will continue to wear this product!!!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that leans more towards the oily side, especially on humid days.  They didn&#x27;t have the oil control version of this in stock, so I tried this one.  It went onto my skin too thick with a Beautyblender, and was never absorbed; it just sat on top of my skin all day.  I waited 10 minutes after the application to see if it would absorb somewhat, and it never did.  It made me look sweaty, and I had to use copious amounts of my powder to set it and get it to mattify, and then throughout the day it came off onto my hands when I touched my face.&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping that this would be a cheaper and more convenient replacement to my Balm Shelter tinted moisturizer with spf; or my Avon MagiX.  It is not.  I did give it to my mother, who is Caucasian with older skin, since I feel that she would benefit from it&#x27;s greasiness.  She is always saying her skin is dry.&lt;br /&gt;Good news is that the Medium/Deep tone I bought that matches my skin perfectly gives her a healthy looking glow and blends well on her.</li>
            <li> Did NOT like this. really considered sending it back because the color did not match my skin at all. I&#x27;m assuming this product is not made for darker tone black women because the medium deep seemed like it should be more for Beyonce, NOT Gabrielle Union if you know what I mean. I couldn&#x27;t do anything with this, since it was cheap I guess I will find a family member to give it to. Oh Well was disappointed, i&#x27;ve heard great things about BB creams. Does anyone know any brand with one for darker skinned women??</li>
            <li> BB creams are usually very light and as I have gotten tanner I decided to use the medium/deep version and it was wayyy to dark for me.  The cream seemed to have a nice smell and apply easily non greasy, but I would purchase a lighter shade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to wear this three time in the past two week. I&#x27;m of Native American heritage and had no trouble matching my color using the Med-deep that I ordered. However, that was the only positive I found with this product. The fragrance used in the cream made my skin react, both in irritation and in acne break outs. The other thing I did not like was the nasty greasy feel it had, while leaving the appearance of dry areas on my skin (reactions?) Anyhow, not happy with this Garnier product. It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> sent back twice and got back the same color and just gave up and is to light for my skin</li>
            <li> Its okay. Its not the best and its definitely not for you if you have oily skin! It doesn&#x27;t do much for me, I just put it on as a foundation then I put powder over it.</li>
            <li> Although it comes out of the tube very thick, it all but disappears on my skin. I wasn&#x27;t looking for&lt;br /&gt;a lot of coverage, but this has absolutely none. I have used other BB creams and tinted moisturizers&lt;br /&gt;that I liked a lot better. Tried this because I do love some of the Garnier Skin products, but this is not&lt;br /&gt;one of them. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bb cream.</li>
            <li> If you have Orange skin then this is your cream!!  I have yet to see an orange human being. Don&#x27;t bother with this one.</li>
            <li> i love this bb cream and I always re purchase it</li>
            <li> I have only used the BB Cream for about 20 days. I am pleased with it so far.  I am pleased that you only need to use a very small amount.(basically the size of a pea). It is very creamy and easy to apply.  My face feels smooth and soft for most of the day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after seeing a review on it by a trusted blog. However, I suppose skin types (unlike clothes) are one of those things that doesn&#x27;t easily transfer from one person to another. There are some positive attributes about this cream. For example, it gives fairly good coverage with a modest amount of product, and I just really like the idea of a BB cream. I have fairly good skin with only slightly uneven skin tone in some areas, and the Skin Renew was able to give me a near flawless complexion without the three separate products I&#x27;d have had to use to achieve the same look and protection. The one glaring problem is that I also have extremely oil skin. After just two hours, I was shining all over my face and the previously light cream became like a heavy mask on my pores as it mixed with the oil. Tried it two more times just to be sure and it was \\&quot;oil slick city\\&quot; each time. I wonder if my t-zone and dry skin friends can perhaps find some use for it?</li>
            <li> I almost did not purchase this item due to the negative reviews on Amazon, but with it being on sale for $10 at the local Target and me having a $2 off coupon, I figured for $8 it wouldn&#x27;t be too devestating if the product turned out to be a bust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I ignored the negative reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry, but otherwise problem free skin. My morning routine was Aveeno Postively Radiant facial moisturizer SPF 15, Vaseline to keep my skin from drying out during the day, mascara, eye liner, and lip gloss. However, after recently giving birth (sleep deprivation) and heading into the winter months, I wanted a product that would help to eliminate the washed out look I&#x27;ve been sporting. I decided to look for a tinted moisturizer and after seeing a few commercials decided to give this cream a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day I tried it I used the amount I would normally use for the Aveeno (about a quarter size). It did not spread and absorb as \\&quot;lotion like\\&quot; as I expected and the result, the dry areas of my face were amplified and the other areas looked like I had on heavy foundation. The product also smeared off my neck onto the collar of my shirt. Not the look I was going for but I wasn&#x27;t ready to totally call it a bust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On day two I started with a slightly damp face, a layer of the Garnier Moisture Rescue Gel Cream (which was already part of my night time skin routine), and a PEA SIZE amount of the BB cream. It spread in a perfectly smooth even manner over my pre-moistened face and neck. I topped it off with my trusty layer of Vaseline. The result was a very light, flawless, air brushed look all over my face and neck. It perfectly matched my skin tone and does not look foundationy or makeupy at all. I do not like having a matte looking face, I prefer to have a more dewey appearance and I found this product also provided that perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On day three I dared to put the cream on my eyelids, something that would normally cause my eyes tosting all day with the Aveeno, and to my suprise it did not burn at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ultimate test, was my newborn son who&#x27;s face was just clearing up from a contact rash. With our constant face to face contact, his face has not reacted at all with me using this cream and it has never transferred to his clothes or face(whereas I would always find residue of the light reflectors found in the Aveeno on his face), and has not tranferred to any of mine since I reduced the amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the negative reviews I think alot of people took the \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; part of the name a bit too literal and either had pre-existing skin conditions that they did not adjust for when using this product, or just didn&#x27;t use the product correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way as well as a bit of trial and error.</li>
            <li> Made me break out.  Too oily. Worth splurging for a higher end BB....otherwise end up buying stuff to heal blemishes.</li>
            <li> Medium coverage of flaws and it moisturizes the skin at the same time. Corrects imperfections gradually with continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for value and performance.</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of products through Amazon with my hubby&#x27;s account, so when I saw that Amazon started carrying BB creams, I was super excited. I&#x27;m 36 and Asian, and have been told I could pass for my mid-20&#x27;s. I was a big fan of skin79, as I love Korean BB creams, but I switched to using Origins Vitazing (with the sheer tint). However, Origins gets expensive at $35 for every 1.7 oz tube. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, but I do like my face to look soft and natural, which is why I like the BB creams. So when I started reading about what \\&quot;the best\\&quot; over the counter BB creams were in America, I thought I&#x27;d try Garnier&#x27;s. I couldn&#x27;t believe how greasy it felt, and the smell was a bit too flowery for me. I figured maybe my skin needed to adjust, and after a couple of hours, I still wasn&#x27;t impressed. My face looked like I had splattered oil onto it. It&#x27;s a horrible product. I&#x27;ve used Too Faced&#x27;s Primed and Poreless, skin79 (pink label), Clinique&#x27;s Instant Perfector, and these products offer more of a miracle for my skin than Garnier&#x27;s. Don&#x27;t waste your money or energy on Garnier.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife.  She tells me that it works great.  The price is good and she would buy it again.</li>
            <li> So far this is the second BB cream that I have tired and found it to be a lot smoother to apply.</li>
            <li> Hello All,&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in order to try something different as opposed to paying $40 for my current tinted moisturizer. I have a dark complexion (halle berry ish.. dark but with copper undertones) and this particular item is not for me. It is so much lighter than I am that it looks obvious and odd. (ashy looking).It was worth a try but I will stick to Josie Maran&#x27;s tinted moisturer (it rocks!)</li>
            <li> I like this particular BB cream very much.  Even though I am actually a Light to Medium person, I really like this color.  I put on sparingly and blend well and it gives such a healthy glow.  I think it&#x27;s the best BB cream on the market.  Wonderful coverage.</li>
            <li> I have never used BB creams before nor have I ever heard of this until I received this product for free to try as a BzzAgent campaign.  I&#x27;m an avid make-up user but I am very picky when it comes to what goes on my face. I use mostly department store make-up as I don&#x27;t normally trust drug store brands, because I have extremely sensitive skin (mild ecezema on my face), I don&#x27;t react well to pollen, and I have a mild blemish issue.  Anyway, I gave Garnier BB Cream a try and I absolutely love it.  It&#x27;s basically a tinted sunscreen that gives you the converage of a light liquid foundation.  Normal suncreen is too thick and my regular foundation only has SPF 10.  The Garnier BB cream has a SPF 20 so it makes me feel like I&#x27;m actually getting sun protection wearing it.  It blends in well with my skin-tone (I have medium to tan asian skin) and I think I could almost wear this as my main foundation on a normal day. I&#x27;ve worn this for 3 days now and my skin has not reacted negatively to this which is a HUGE plus because I normally would start breaking out in rashes after a day.  My skin is also very dry in the mornings after I shower and gets oily throughout the day.  This cream doesn&#x27;t highlight the dry patches in the morning and still maintains its matte finish when it gets oily in the afternoon.  I&#x27;m quite surprised and pleased at this product...especially for the price.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s rather liquidity when you squirt it out so it can get a little messy if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a week to honestly see if I liked it. I wanted to try a cheaper BB cream to see what the hype is all about before dropping $35-$45 dollars on a product from Sephora. Like other reviewers said, it is cakey and it usually takes about 10-15 minutes before it &amp;#34;settles&amp;#34; on my face and I don&#x27;t look like I should be laying in a casket. This isn&#x27;t full coverage by any means.  I did appreciate that it was sheer to medium b/c it is getting warmer and who has time for a face full of makeup when its 80+ degrees outside? As far as the color goes, unless you are a very fair skinned African-American or Latino, the medium-deep shade is probably not going to be for you unless you&#x27;re using it under your regular makeup. My complexion is a sort of caramel colored(Mac-NC45 Make up Forever 170) ; with that said the medium-deep is about a 1/2 shade too light for my preference. If they made a dark it would be perfect. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Most of my expectations were exceeded. The one thing I must remember to do is rub into my skin well so i won&#x27;t come off.It does make me look younger.</li>
            <li> Gostei muito do BB cream, deixa a pele radiante e cobre quase todas as inperfeições, substitue a base. Agora é so BB Cream todos os dias</li>
            <li> this is my first time using bb cream so i have nothing to compare it to but im satisfied with it and it works great for me as i use it as a primer and i would buy again.It has a citrus like smell thatsome may not like but its ok you can only really smell it while ur applying it.</li>
            <li> I am 68 and prefer this product to more pricer products.  It provides good coverage without sinking into the wrinkles and seems to improve skin tone.</li>
            <li> ...that this is a pretty good cream. It doesn&#x27;t feel oily and it acts on her skin quickly... She noticed some blemishes &amp;#34;disappearing&amp;#34; gradually with use of this cream.</li>
            <li> I have dark combination skin. This product makes my skin noticeably white. It&#x27;s not as moisturizing as i thought. In fact the more I rub it in, the more it makes my skin look dry and I end up washing my face again. While it even my overall skin tone, it&#x27;s just not what I expected. I&#x27;d rather just get a BB cream from an actual Korean brand.</li>
            <li> But not my really color..</li>
            <li> This has no color to it at all.  I thought it was a tinted moisturizer and it is a white cream.  I don&#x27;t need it unless my skin gets dry.  Was hoping to use it instead of make up but cannot.</li>
            <li> I am african american with a light peanut butter complexion and I purchased the medium/deep. I don&#x27;t wear foundation or a lot of make-up period, I like to look like myself and not a walking illusion. With that being said I purchased this to help with blemishes and dark marks. Every time I wear this I always get so many compliments on how much my skin is glowing. It does a great job with coverage without using any concealer or anything else. I use very little because too much will make u look cakey and &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34; and it can be a little oily. I use maybe a little less than the size of a dime;apply it to my forehead, cheeks chin and neck and blend. Sometimes it does make me sweat but I&#x27;m a sweater anyway. Use very little.</li>
            <li> First let me preface this review by saying that everyone should know (any adult) that not every product will produce the same results as it does on someone else. I know this seems a rather simplistic and obvious statement to make  but judging from the comments I think some women looked at \\&quot;Miracle Skin Perfect or\\&quot; as a statement of fact and not just a description of what the company hopes the product will do for you. Companies do in fact hope that consumers will have a positive experience with their product and buy it again and again, as well as recommend the product to others; after all there is no better advertisement than \\&quot;word of mouth\\&quot;. With this said, I absolutely adore, adore this cream. I am late to the BB craze; I stumbled upon it by reading an article entitled \\&quot;The 25 Beauty Products Every Woman Should Own\\&quot;.  I agree with the article&#x27;s author everyone should find a BB cream that suits them. I was perplexed about finding one that would suit my skin tone since I am a deep milk chocolate brown. I get compliments on my skin (in foundation) but I suffer from enlarged pores, laugh lines, and slight wrinkles under my eyes. I also have slight discoloration. I almost exclusively buy my beauty products and fragrance from Amazon but I purchased this from the Rite-Aid in Medium/Deep. I was overjoyed after I looked in the mirror. I applied a generous amount (the size of a quarter on my entire face) and I looked flawless...unbelievable!  I cannot wait to wash my face now and apply it. I added a rose Christian Dior lip gloss and I looked great! I am sorry for lack of self-deprivation but I am amazed, it does what it said it would--for me! I say for the price, under $20 it is worth the gamble. You might get that \\&quot;chalky\\&quot; look many complain of but try another brand. I intend to splurge on an Estee Lauder BB cream when my finances allow it since they have a wide selection of colors. I hope this review will be useful.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It actually looks better than my expensive makeup. it goes on natural and light. My friend had some problems with it but her skin is sensitive. Plus not all products were made for every person. This product is reasonably priced compared to other makeups/foundations. It lasts all day and even smells nice!</li>
            <li> Good product.  I am African-American and I really like the coverage.  I am lucky to have nice (blemish-free) skin, so I really use this more so as a tinted moisturizer.  My skin feels really good when I apply this product.  It moisturizes well and has the added benefit of SPF.  My skin is soft and smooth and it does even out my tone.  I do not apply a moisturizer underneath, FYI.  When I apply this, I use sparingly and blend well.  If I apply a thicker layer, I look like a vampire or ghost - just too ashy! lol A little goes a long way. This product should last me a long time.  I purchased this at a local drug store so when I need more, I will buy from Amazon.  The price here is much better.</li>
            <li> I was looking for light cream with a little tint but not a foundation. I used Revlon SkinLights Instant Skin Brightener for many years but they discontinued the product. I had been looking for a similar product since then. This is the closest to the Revlon SkinLights product I have found.&lt;br /&gt;It adds little brightness to my skin and does not look heavy. It&#x27;s a bit oily but not too much. It&#x27;s spreads evenly, it&#x27;s natural looking. I am using it everyday.</li>
            <li> wrong shade, however, once opeaned i felt it could not be return. so therefore i lost my hard earned money.</li>
            <li> Ufffffff! This has been like magic for my face! I was getting all these dark spots from sun on my face and bb cream has stopped them and protected me from sun, also keeps my face hydrated. This is a really good product.</li>
            <li> BB Creams are all the race now. I figured that I would give in and try one. I like the product for what it is. It seems to go on very nice and has a pleasant smell to it. I prefer full coverage makeup, so ill be sticking to that for the most part. This will be a good makeup for summer though because its very light to wear</li>
            <li> This product shipped fast and it  had a great price. I use this product every day and it makes my skin look so even.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cream because I have really bad dark spots on my face, but I don&#x27;t think it is going to help my face, but I have not been using it that long, thank you amazon!</li>
            <li> My skin feels great and very happy with this product :)) thank you for helping find a perfect shade for my skin and helping the elasticity and color correction of my skin already improve.</li>
            <li> I had chosed this color because I was hearing alot that this was a very light color for being medium or deep.  So I thought since my completion changes alot this would be good color to apply when im at my darkest, but when I applied it on it was a bit to dark even om my skin tone at its darkest.I gave it a 4 star because it did cover and id smells good, im going to purches  a lighter color  and reweiw on that</li>
            <li> I like to put this on if I want to look like I don&#x27;t have makeup on but I&#x27;m flawless and not pale.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed. After reading tons of reviews I bought this BB thinking it was going to be awesome and it turns out to be very oily and low coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not buying it again.</li>
            <li> Not as much coverage as some of the other BB creams I&#x27;ve used, but I do use this on weekends with minimal make up and it covers up everything I need it to!</li>
            <li> This product does its job, however i feel its really thick. It even&#x27;s out my skin tone and gives me a glow and i love that. It&#x27;s just that it feels thick and sticky to me.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this product. It really covers well and will make your complexion flawless! as with any skincare product, your skin may have to adapt to it.. but it worked just fine for me. I used to break out with the cream I used before.</li>
            <li> What I love:&lt;br /&gt;1- Evened out my skin tone&lt;br /&gt;2- Looked natural (I am an olive toned Latina)&lt;br /&gt;3- Didn&#x27;t feel too heavy on my combination skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t love:&lt;br /&gt;1- PIMPLES....omg I got so many zits after using this for a week&lt;br /&gt;2- It melted right off in the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The zit factor alone made me want to toss it. Not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> If you ever break out- and I mean ever- don&#x27;t touch this crap. I very rarely break out anymore, and after using this ONCE, my face was covered in sits. I tried it on a small area on my chest to make sure it was the product causing it, and sure enough, I broke out there too. Garnier uses the cheapest ingredients available, that are terrible for your skin, and charge 12 times what it costs to make. Gross, gross, gross. I bought Too Faced BB instead. Way better, albeit much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more coverage.  I have combination skin and this leaves a greasy layer on skin.  I layer on a foundation powder on top and then a matte powder to make sure I don&#x27;t have any shine and this normally works all day to keep the shine away.  I do like the fact that it has a sunscreen.  I&#x27;m not sure if I will repurchase.  I wish it covered better.  It it did, I&#x27;d have given 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more when this tube is gone.  It is easy to apply, not too heavy, and I don&#x27;t have much color to my 85 year old face, so when there is a special occasdion I apply this.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have not used a smular product. Is there a darker shade aailable? I use it as a moisturizer on my face.</li>
            <li> Feels a little heavier than the higher end products, but blends in much better. I&#x27;ll keep using this and save my money!</li>
            <li> Was looking for a foundation that was not heavy on my face,natural looking and gave me a smooth complection and this did it for me I was amazed by this product.It can give you a light oil to your face around the nose but I added a little powder compact and it did the job, my face felt great all day.This random lady told me in the store when I was looking and said you will love this product so now I can tell you my experience \\&quot; LOVE THIS PRODUCT\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Love this cream, and the price is great. Makes my face feel moist and skin glows with youthful dewy finish.</li>
            <li> I bought assuming it would be the same results as on TV and not even close. I will not buy again. What a waste of money...</li>
            <li> I have an olive complexion with generally smooth and clear skin. Although, my skin is sensitive and since I&#x27;m olive-toned, I have slight darkness under my large eyes and some natural rosiness along my lid. I can scar easily too if I don&#x27;t take care of blemishes right away. All and all, I want to see coverage and my goal is to wear something easy, quick, and double-duty: moisturize, coverage, oh AND it has spf for my quick drive and sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted overall simplicity with this product and quick coverage. I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s thee best product as far as \\&quot;tinted moisturizers\\&quot; go, and I don&#x27;t have a slew of tubes to compare this to, but I am happy with it. I have combo/normal skin, but it didn&#x27;t feel heavy and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I did at first think the shade came out too light for me, BUT like some powders and foundations, you have to let it sit and set in your skin a bit. I&#x27;ve worn this without adding any mineral veils or powders. I would buy this again!! It&#x27;s cheaper than my dept. store foundation, its moisturizer and SPFs your face too!</li>
            <li> Well the box that the cream came in say it does all these wonderful things but, when you read the side of the (tube)cream container it say its just a sunscreen.I need more than just a sunscreen!  I was looking for a lot more than sun protection!</li>
            <li> Truly love this product...new and different, and covers minimal flaws completely!  Use it everyday, goes on smoothly and covers completely.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Does not leave an oily feeling and blends real well for Latinas, will totally buy again!!</li>
            <li> I like this BB product and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin -- in fact, it really did tend to smooth out the texture.  It took about 20 minutes for the color to absorb and blend well with my skin tone out after application.  I&#x27;m now &amp;#34;sold&amp;#34; on BB and I doubt that I&#x27;ll find other (more expensive) brands worth the added cost.</li>
            <li> I never used a BB cream before. I need some extra coverage in some areas so I was hesitant to try one, thinking the BB cream and foundation would be too heavy for my slightly oily skin. I found out that all I need to do is spread this wonderful cream on my face and neck and in the areas that I want more coverage, to use a concealer. I don&#x27;t even use foundation any more. This glow (not oily) lasts throughout the day and doesn&#x27;t get cakey or some foundations will do over time. I am hooked on this brand because it lasts a long time- a little goes a long way- and the price is great too. I would suggest to try this BB cream before spending money on more expensive brands as this does all that it promises and more.</li>
            <li> Skin tone: Medium with olive undertones&lt;br /&gt;Age: 30s&lt;br /&gt;Skin: Combination/Oily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Garnier&#x27;s BB cream for several months now and can honestly say that even if I decided to walk outside without makeup, I wouldn&#x27;t walk out without wearing my BB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this instead of sunscreen, underneath my makeup as a primer. I do not experience oily skin as some noted in their review. I must tell you that I use a light natural oil moisturizer on my skin, then apply the BB cream before foundation. I&#x27;m thinking if you&#x27;re getting oily skin from this it is because you&#x27;re using it alone or the moisturizer you use under is too rich. I&#x27;ve used this cream without moisturizer and have had slight shine, but no oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream creates an even tone and surface to apply makeup. My friends have noted my even tone and commented on it. I&#x27;m impressed. I paid 15 bucks or more in the drugstore for this, so I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised to find I can save by buying with Amazon. (Although sometimes when they have those by one get one half off, or free you can save that way also)</li>
            <li> perfect.  very good product, i give to my mum,  she love it,  and i am going to buy more,.thanks..lol !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I tried this BB cream and i&#x27;m quite satisfied. It feels very pleasant at face as it has very light consistence which gives the feeling of breathing to your skin. It absorbed easily and gave very natural look to the face. color set just perfect. I liked the product and going to buy another one for the future.</li>
            <li> Glides on easy and not oily at all.  Has a pleasant smell and noticed a difference in skin within 2 week period. A must buy for non- foundation wearers.</li>
            <li> This did not blend in as nicely as I would have liked. It kind of streaks and seems to cake onto my skin. However, if I mix this with a little bit of my moisturizer it makes a huge difference! It goes on a lot smoother, spreads, and blends much better with a touch of my moisturizer in it. Color matches my skin nicely. Not sure I would purchase again, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Ths cream makes my skin look smoother, has good stuff in the cream to enhance it to make it healthier, and truly does help making my skin all the better for it.  I even had some &amp;#34;dark spots&amp;#34; on my skin and some have lessened and some have disappeared.  I would recommend this cream for daily use (I use this every day)  and recommend this only for medium skin, not dark skin.  This cream also goes a long way.  I hope this company keeps making this cream.  This is my second tube of cream and I will keep buying it as long as Garnier keeps making it.</li>
            <li> If you are a darker shade than Beyonce/Caramel/ Latte you will probably be unable to wear this color. But, if you of that &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; variety then you will be more than satisfied with the product. It goes on really smooth and covers pretty well in opinion. If you are a truly deep girl I suggest you go for the Maybelline Dream Fresh BB cream as that is a lot darker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 14 and I have dry overall skin and oily in the T zone. I have medium skin tone but I like to be darker without being orange. Othe foundations make me look orange. Before this BB cream I tried the Clinique foundation and it dried out my skin even more. It made my skin orange. This is very moisturizing and covers up all of my redness. Overall this product is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Well first let me say wow! My sister actually bought this and I used it and now I&#x27;m going to buy my own! I actually went and bought an expensive BB cream by skin79 and was so disappointed, it made me so white and went on cakey! After that I was pretty hesitant to try the &#x27;cheap&#x27; version - how could it be any better? So I was definitely surprised when I liked it so much. It went on sooo nice - I used a sponge - not cakey at all, nice and even. Not patchy in the dry areas. Not orange or anything, I have the &#x27;medium/deep&#x27; color. Matched me so good! I like that it&#x27;s so light, I usually wear just some light powder or no makeup at all, I can&#x27;t stand the heavy makeup feel on my skin and how cakey makeup can look. But I definitely don&#x27;t have perfect skin, I just had a bad break out that left me with some icky spots and those little zits that are so annoying. This definitely covered those up enough that I felt good about my skin but didn&#x27;t feel like I had this heavy layer on. I let it dry then apply some powder on top after about 20 minutes. Perfect. My skin looks nice and pretty. I actually think it stands up pretty good, I have fairly oily skin on my forehead that I always have to worry about so I did a &#x27;test&#x27; and waited 6 hours to see how oily it got. Not very much! I just had a tiny little bit. I definitely think using a makeup sponge helps so much in applying it - if your getting oily and your just using your hands or a makeup brush use a sponge instead! I&#x27;ve been using it about a week and i haven&#x27;t broken out, my skin is extremely sensitive so I would&#x27;ve known very quickly if it was going to. And I will say my skin does actually look better! I definately update if it breaks me out or makes a huge improvement in my skin, but right now I&#x27;m loving it and I think I found my everyday makeup!</li>
            <li> This is my second tube. I used the 1st one down until I could barely squeeze anything out. I like it as a primer mostly. Even on days I am using just powder foundation, it works great !!</li>
            <li> The color did not suit my skin complexion.&lt;br /&gt;It looks caky and may be that it is just not my skintone..</li>
            <li> I love this product. It provides a decent amount of coverage. It is NOT heavy at all. Since I have been using it, my acne has cleared a bit. I was worried about the smell being strong based on reviews from others but have not had an issue. It is moisturizing without clogging my pores and causing more breakouts. I am waiting to see how it performs come summer time. I am very optimistic and love it so far. Best purchase of the year!</li>
            <li> I should have bought two bottles because the shipping was half the price of one. Other than that I love this lotion. I don&#x27;t wear make up so this is just enough to look pulled together hassle free.</li>
            <li> Nice texture, nice smell, multi-funtion, just a little to dark for me - I use Mac NC 35 foundation. Cost-benefit really pays off.</li>
            <li> I tried Garnier BB Cream because I am a BzzAgent. I used the medium/deep and it matched really well and blended nicely. But 3 times a week I do vigorous exercise and on those days I noticed it kind of ran down my face like paint when I would sweat and I had to wipe it all off and reapply lotion and SPF. So on days that I don&#x27;t workout it makes my skin tone noticeably more even, less shiny and it is not heavy or caked up. I am kind of known for not wearing makeup so I&#x27;ve gotten comments like, your skin has gotten brighter, more clear, stuff like that and nobody has asked, do you have on makeup? so that is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Price, coverage, lightweight, evens skin tone, and camouflages blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: kind of a runny product so it feels like you are wasting a lot of it. sometimes I use finger tips to apply, sometimes I use a sponge. And it runs if you workout hard or sweat on your face.</li>
            <li> This is lightweight and clean feeling. The tone is just right and I get compliments on looking like I have a fresh fresh and healthy glow</li>
            <li> Well, I have to admit, I should have read the label closer, or done a little research. I mistakenly thought that this product actually worked to correct and even out your skin tone (as some products claim to also do). Not so much. This is tinted sunscreen and nothing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, that being said, I decided to give it a go for what it is - a tinted sunscreen. Not sure why anyone would bother with a sunscreen that only offers 15 SPF and only comes in two colors? I have a drawer full of foundations that offer a higher SPF - and have a full palette of colors to choose from to at least match my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I do not think that it offered much (to even out the appearance). It did give my skin a very artificial, orange tone. It also made my skin feel greasy and gave it a very shiny appearance. So much so, that I had to apply a powder to tone down the shine. So much for the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look. I also had eye irritation that I sometimes get with sunscreens. No, I did not get it in my eyes, just underneath them - and the tears started flowing. Now I have a streaked, orange appearance. Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to foundation. Most foundations offer a higher SPF, superior coverage, more colors to choose from, less irritating to my eyes and less shine. I cannot come up with a single advantage that this product offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO disappointed. I REALLY wanted to like this product and simplify my skin care routine (sunscreen and coverage). This product failed to do this for me.</li>
            <li> It covered, wasn&#x27;t oily and did as promised. I like not having to wear a foundation as this is quicker.</li>
            <li> Not for Acne prone and oily skin, product has good coverge but you look oily all day and shiny. It clogs pores on chin and nose. Comes off very easy and smudges off, I hugged my friend and it came off on his jacket, he said \\&quot;wow how much foundation do you have on\\&quot;!!! i was not happy with that, nor was he, I ruined his jacket for the day. Wont buy again</li>
            <li> I have tried a few high-end B.B. creams and nothing compares to this. It is not too thick nor too thin. It offers great light coverage and your face is left with a glow. If you put some translucent powder on, you are set to go and it lasts the whole day. I have normal to dry skin and I get a few pimples. I also suffer from psoriasis. Ever since I started using this, I&#x27;ve had fewer pimples, skin looks less dry and psoriasis episodes have been more scarce.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried BB cream and this product works really well. It is oily, but I put light powder on top (if im going out) and the oil goes away. other than that, on my day to day, regular days; i simply apply this and it feels great. I have acne and acne marks. so i am very picky with these cover ups. and this is the best ive found so far. i&#x27;ve also tried tinted moisturizer but they felt too heavy and un natural.</li>
            <li> No such thing as deep with this product, deep means to them tan caucasian. Doesn&#x27;t work for most skin colors.  Need to try a different more universal product.</li>
            <li> not for african americans.</li>
            <li> awesome for skin work good,thanks</li>
            <li> I got the one for combo/oily skin in med/deep. As soon as I got out of the store I tried it on my hand and thought I had to take it back as it looked too pink for my skin tone, but after a couple minutes it just kinda blended into my color so I decided to try it in my face at home before taking it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only tried it on one side of my face to see how much of a difference it made. It looked great and didn&#x27;t feel too heavy. The color is perfect for my olive skin. Now here&#x27;s the best part: I kid you not, when I washed off the cream I could see the noticable difference on my face. I went into it expecting it to be more of a tinted moisturizer and was blown away with how better my one half of the face looked even after just an hour of keeping it on (wanted to check for irritation). I seriously laughed out loud and thought I was on crazy pills. That&#x27;s how much of a difference it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was yesterday, and I got to wear it all day today to see how it held up on my shiny and oily skin. It was fantastic for the first 4 hours. After that my shine kicked in on my forehead and nose. That&#x27;s pretty good for humid fl weather! And again, when&lt;br /&gt;I took it off my skin was glowing. It usually looks extra drab to me when I remove my make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparison to Bare Minerals:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forehead gets shiny after a couple hours of applying B Minerals- 4 hours with Garnier.&lt;br /&gt;Garnier coverage is better than B Minerals, especially when it comes to my dark undereyes,&lt;br /&gt;I would say B Minerals feels lighter, but Garnier isn&#x27;t too much heavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I would defintely recommened it to all my friends. It won&#x27;t break the bank and it lived up to all the hype.</li>
            <li> Have used sooooo many liquid makeups and this one is great! Evens out skin tone and lasts all day! Not cheap, but worth it!!! Just try it and you&#x27;ll love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for two years it&#x27;s my favorite cream</li>
            <li> A friend who&#x27;s a beauty in her mid sixties shared this BB cream secret with me... and I love it!  It gives a nice glow and natural warm color to my face, and just makes me look more put together without having a heavy foundation, yet gives a bit more color than a tinted moisturizer that I used before. You only need a tiny bit and it glides on easily. It&#x27;s a great beauty secret that I&#x27;ve shared with my friends. Try it... You&#x27;ll love it, and you get more with Garnier than other BB creams at higher prices.</li>
            <li> i like this item but its more of a tinted moisturizer than a bb cream it does give lighter skin tone but its wet and doesnt last all day on my skin,i have dry skin but it did a nice job and smells fantastic</li>
            <li> Works great for my skin. Will definitely buy more. I will say its not for everyone, but there definitely needs to be a more wider range of this product for different skin tones.</li>
            <li> Love the way this covers and it looks so natural.  It lasts all day even on a hot summer day.</li>
