            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>The best new product I have tried!</li>
            <li>Now, this particular uncle had just retired from 35 years of year-round swim-coaching in the California sun in favor of a desk job, so his wrinkles were LEGENDARY.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Great serum, absorbs easily and tones the skin, it feels more moisture</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results and plan on using it more to see if they can disappear altogether.</li>
            <li>, it dries very fast, and it smells really good!</li>
            <li>I was happy with the way the skin around my eyes felt, softer and more smooth.</li>
            <li>I like the product a lot, and the company is super helpful, with great customer service.</li>
            <li>Also, I kept wondering why so many 4-star reviews (instead of 5-stars), if this product is so amazing -</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is simply, amazing results.</li>
            <li>This product sounded too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very important and I therefore invest in what are considered top-of-the-line and pricey products.</li>
            <li>The product feels very smooth on the skin</li>

            <li>Many benefits with this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended this product and boy I am glad he did.</li>
            <li>After three weeks or so, she called me up and told me how much firmer and lifted her skin was looking, and that it was a great improvement on her pores.</li>
            <li>, shes brighter, and looks 5 years younger, i&#x27;m so glad i could make her happy with this!</li>
            <li>and it really does make my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li>This anti-aging serum is perfect for a younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>Love that it has three types of vit. C, as most C products don&#x27;t absorb into the dermis, this one does.</li>
            <li>Send more please.</li>
            <li>Skin is getting better.</li>
            <li>I love the results I am achieving.</li>
            <li>My skin has more clarity, it&#x27;s softer, lines have been reduced, and some have gone away.</li>

            <li>My skin looks and feels more supple.  </li>
            <li>Love the price and love the product...</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results and at my age I need something to help with lines and skin smoothing.</li>
            <li>I use this stuff after my toner and before I moisturize and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this NuNutrients anti-aging serum.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I feel more confident when I walk out the door in the morning.</li>
            <li>I gave this product a try and was quite satisfied with the results after my purchase.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d imagine that many people, like myself, trust Amazon reviews when we are researching a product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite formulation of it.</li>
            <li>and I look healthy.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not too sure,</li>
            <li>and I am amazed at the wonderful results I have received in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the dermatologist for dermabrasion more than 10 years ago and this procedure did work</li>
            <li>so im always looking for ways to keep myself looking youthful and healthy.</li>
            <li>May have seen more results</li>
            <li>I have tried so many home remedies to do the job that this serum does, but nothing came even close to how this product improved my skin.  </li>
            <li>OK results.</li>
            <li>You simply add a drop to whatever you use -- I use Dermalogica -- and you can feel your skin wonderfully smoother.</li>
            <li>The fact that the vitamin c replaces lost collagen amazes me and allows me to feel better as I age.</li>
            <li>love this serum</li>
            <li>I am completely in love with this line.</li>
            <li>I am completely in love.</li>
            <li>Anti-Aging the liquid makes my skin is more radiant and it looks more refreshed.</li>
            <li>Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also contains antioxidant properties that helps you maintain a healthy body.  </li>
            <li>You will never have a better complexion.  </li>
            <li>and I definitely love the way my face looks and feels.  </li>
            <li>plus it is more hydrated.</li>
            <li>I am really impressed with it and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>After about a month, I am already noticing a more youthful presence.</li>
            <li>She was most worried about those age spots and wrinkles, which have already begun to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I’m sure this has everything to do with the Nutrients Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>Antioxidants are so healthy and beneficial to our skin and bodies.</li>
            <li>The serum has started to brighten my skin providing me with a more radiant and youthful complexion.</li>
            <li>Since I started using this serum, I&#x27;ve not had nearly as many breakouts ..</li>
            <li>What I love the most is my skin feels softer yet</li>
            <li>will now better allow me to take better care of my skin and make me feel more confident in the way I look.</li>
            <li>I am looking more than my age</li>
            <li>; lady any more.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments on my skin since I started using it.</li>
            <li>just got it,  love the way it makes my skin feel  </li>
            <li>Ignoring my first thought and trying it anyway was one of the best decisions I have made.&lt;br /&gt;Within the first three weeks of using this product as directed, I began to notice a change in the way my skin looked and felt.</li>
            <li>What makes this product even greater is the fact that I can apply my makeup over it without an issue.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels afterwards when using this.  </li>
            <li>Allow Vitamin C Serum to help your body maintain your youthful, healthy, resilient skin.</li>
            <li>C Serum gives you a tighter and more youthful skin appearance.</li>
            <li>I may not be better at soccer because of NuNutrients, but man do I look better playing it.</li>
            <li>However I love this product but can do without the flaking of the skin .</li>
            <li>My skin looked and felt more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I wish it were a pump instead of a dropper, but I love the product</li>
            <li>After using this for about a week, I can visibily tell that my wrinkles and lines have reduced, and on top of that, I have that youthful glow to my skin that I&#x27;ve been looking for for years.</li>
            <li>According to Valerie Monroe, beauty editor of &amp;#34;O, the Oprah magazine,&amp;#34; antioxidant serums can brighten your complexion and help moisturizers absorb better.</li>
            <li>This works much better and is so much more affordable.</li>
            <li>I am hoping that with using this for a prolonged amount of time, I will see even more drastic changes.  </li>
            <li>My mam was very impressed - feel it has smoothed skin almost immediately, and she definitely plan to continue to use it.</li>
            <li>And I believe it has a lot to do with taking good care of your skin and using the right anti aging</li>
            <li>Surprisingly it was super easy to use too.  </li>
            <li>That is why I was very excited to find NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum - Anti-Aging Serum.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>This is by-far the best anti-aging product that I have used and I am sure that I will be using this product for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>I look better, I feel better, and more importantly I&#x27;m happier because of it.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that this product stands true to its description.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how quickly and effectively this brightened my skin tone from tiredness.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is fair and, to be honest, quite sensitive</li>
            <li>Really nice, light weight, smooth to the touch serum.</li>
            <li>So the good news is that I don’t really have many wrinkles and wasn’t sure this would be very useful</li>
            <li>My wife like it very much, the quality is very good and the price is very favourable</li>
            <li>My pores were clearing and my skin was becoming more smooth and even toned.</li>
            <li>It works amazing, the price is more than fair especially since it works so well.  </li>
            <li>Wow what a great product</li>
            <li>It has brightened my skin and gave it a great natural glow and radiance.</li>
            <li>It is FDA approved and that makes it more credible.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really think it could do so much good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line I am now a full time serum user!</li>
            <li>Sweet..!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Given the hype around Vitamin C, I couldn&#x27;t be more excited what NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum has to offer.</li>
            <li>The serum is easy to apply thanks to the handy dropper top on the bottle.</li>
            <li>and I know that I am using a clean and healthy product on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing Vitamin C serum that you would absolutely fall in love with.</li>

            <li>Just like their other products, this has a light scent and perfect consistency.</li>
            <li>The fine lines I now have in my 40s don&#x27;t seem as visible anymore.  </li>

            <li>My fine lines are not as noticeable.  </li>

            <li>I had fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li>The product is light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It look away the fine lines by my eyes and helped fill in the wrinkles around my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I ended up using it on the wrinkles on my face as well as the fine lines</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product that would help with the lines under my eyes and fine lines on my forehead..</li>
            <li>Fine lines-</li>
            <li>All the fine lines are vanished.</li>
            <li>I am getting some fine lines that people tell me are from laughing.</li>
            <li>It diminished fine lines and wrinkles by inducing collagen.</li>
            <li>As an avid outdoor soccer player who has the misfortune of being allergic to most sunblock creams, I thought for sure I was destined to become a rhinoceros.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the packaging and find it easy to carry with me on the go, if needed.</li>
            <li>because it is light and easy to apply, I can feel it soak into my skin immediately.  </li>
            <li>Vitamin C can cause some mild dryness or flaking, so if you have this issue, be sure to use a moisturizer after using the Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>After using it for a little over a month now, my skin appears to be more healthy and beautiful.</li>
            <li>But as long as I do both, my skin looks good!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s never looked do good or been so soft!</li>
            <li>I use excellent cleaning and moisturizng products on my face and have been very careful to keep my face clean, but no matter what I used I still kept breaking out in hideous bumps and zits all over my face.  </li>
            <li>I have a natural style, so to me, the best investment is in keeping what you&#x27;ve got naturally</li>
            <li>have been using this serum for about 2 months and noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>My skin is clear and bright after using this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Knowing this, my dad bought both of us a specific name brand serum which we were happy with</li>
            <li>well I love to laugh</li>
            <li>I got it as a Valentine present from my husband, and I am truly happy that he did.</li>
            <li>NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum has greatly reduced my facial redness and flushing by about 80%.</li>
            <li>The Vitamin C blend and H2O make me feel comfortable applying to my face.</li>
            <li>so this is an important factor when searching for a skin Serum.  </li>
            <li>this is important to me.</li>
            <li>Fortunately NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li>I received this free product to review.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great price, considering that I used to pay upwards of $100 a bottle for a smaller amount from the dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I use 2X per day (morning and night) and follow up with a good moisturizer for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Getting ready to purchase a second bottle of this awesome anti-aging serum</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a good solid month or better.</li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on smoothly, and soaks right into my skin.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this absorbed quickly, leaving no greasy or oily film on my face and arms.  </li>
            <li>This serum is well worth your money!  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li>I love this serum so much!</li>
            <li>As it dries, you can feel and see a significant difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>to my original review</li>
            <li>and I’m pretty sure this serum is why they are fading a bit.</li>
            <li>first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to work, but soon I noticed that my sunspots were diminishing.</li>
            <li>I already recommended this to some friends who went ahead and tried it for themselves, and they were as excited by it as I was.</li>
            <li>This serum has helped significantly.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my aunt and was so surprised at how amazing (and quick) it worked!</li>
            <li>After finding many positive reviews for this revolutionary supplement, I decided to give a try.</li>
            <li>another thing to notice - most all of the reviews for this product sound like someone&#x27;s real name (maybe to sound more realistic?)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I got it, but the fact that it is rich with Vitamin C really drew me to it.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin and bought this product to mostly help reduce the look of fine lines.</li>
            <li>I use this with hyaluronic acid serum, and love the combo, noticing a difference already, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>like me, know full well the sun is NOT always our friend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She particularly liked the fact that there were no harsh scents.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a true collagen booster try what I did Radiantly Ageless Peptide Fusion Collagen Booster or The Triple Serum De Luxe by radiantlyageless.com  </li>
            <li>I have conducted much research on Vitamin C and feel confident in recommending this product to a friend.</li>
            <li>It had a cool feeling which made me feel relaxed.</li>
            <li>But overall good would  keep using it.</li>
            <li>formula is very gentle and was very pleased that it did not irritate my skin, given I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>NuNutrients absorbs into my skin quickly and leaves my skin feeling nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>I can go without makeup if I want to for quick runs to the store.  </li>
            <li>As I said, though, the pinkness goes away after a minute or two and my skin was left feeling nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>vitamin c quick results</li>
            <li>It helps my skin not only look better, but also feel better.</li>
            <li>My face looks brighter and more vibrant than I can remember.</li>
            <li>I did however find something that has similar ingredeients, but might be more potent or something.</li>
            <li>Depending on how good the condition of your skin is it might be worth looking into this product especially as it also anti-aging.</li>
            <li>For me, I&#x27;m using it to face and neck once a day at night, and it absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li>This serum absorbs quickly and it doesn’t leave my skin feeling sticky or tacky.  </li>
            <li>Of course, we all had a good laugh and he tucked it away in his medicine cabinet (Didn&#x27;t learn this until later; I thought he threw it</li>
            <li>I was purchasing cheap drugstore products, and eventually decided to try something higher end.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the results that I&#x27;ve seen, especially in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>The serum is USA made and FDA approved which is important and the first ingredient is Aqua (water)</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much more youthful and vibrant and so many of my laugh lines have completely vanished!</li>
            <li>This product works really great and help tighten up the skin and making wrinkles seems less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Also, because the serum is absorbed so quickly into my skin, I prefer to apply it under my makeup.  </li>
            <li>Your wrinkles get reduced and fine lines even disappear in certain cases.</li>
            <li>;  This really works..!!</li>
            <li>Vitamin C is something my body needs, and I am glad to have found something natural to help myself age gracefully!</li>
            <li>And my skin overall felt better!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use it consistently, but I&#x27;ve still been able to see my skin get tighter and my crow&#x27;s feet have pretty much disappeared!</li>
            <li>THANKS TO NUNUTRIENTS!!</li>
            <li>I also tend to get very red and blotchy, and since I have been using this amazing product I have noticed that the redness as lessened tremendously.</li>
            <li>This used in conjunction with the NuNutrients eye cream completely made the fine lines around my eyes vanish!</li>
            <li>Since Vitamin C is a natural antioxidant in our bodies, I was very comfortable with knowing that what I was applying to my skin had also a multitude of health benefits.</li>
            <li>I was confident to try this product because of the Vitamin C content and I am well aware of the benefits to your skin from this nutrient that is vital to our overall good health.</li>
            <li>Age Defying Serum contains is a &amp;#34;triple action&amp;#34; blend of ingredients that contains Vitamin C as well as powerful antioxidants.  </li>
            <li>I always have a smile on my face.</li>
            <li>I started seeing results after a couple weeks, so it&#x27;s definitely worth adding to your beauty routine.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C makes you more sensitive to the sun.  </li>
            <li>I used to make fun of my wife for using this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is much brighter, I have a more even complexion and many of my numerous frown lines are almost invisible.</li>
            <li>For us it works nicely with the &amp;#34;eb5 Anti-Aging Facial Cream.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the investment</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that my face feels smoother and some of the wrinkles already starting to fade away.</li>
            <li>and so far I really love it.</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth that money</li>
            <li>It also helps gives your skin a natural glow because after using Vitamin C serum helps your moisturizer to absorb in your skin better.</li>
            <li>have noticed a difference in my smile</li>
            <li>I find that it’s moisturizing enough on its own.  </li>
            <li>In the morning, I apply it as soon as I get out of the shower and by the time I brush my hair and teeth, it’s fully absorbed and I can put my makeup on.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh and has a youthful glow to it.</li>
            <li>The combination of vitamin C an hylouronic acid is very powerful and is essential for healthy skin.  </li>
            <li>noticed a difference in my skin right away.  </li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s an anti-aging cream, they&#x27;re all crocks anyway, right?)</li>
            <li>The applications are easy and feel fine, and the bags under my eyes have gotten smaller.</li>
            <li>only that regenerates and renews the aging skin but also has a great intense moisturizing action.</li>
            <li>Some of my colleagues have even mentioned that I seem more exuberant in the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I will certainly be purchasing another!</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been using it about a month now and looks have certainly improved!</li>
            <li>Another thing that I have learned is how vitamin C is not only great for inside health but outside health too.</li>
            <li>I plan to continue with NuNutrients--just as good but a lot less money.</li>
            <li>After just a few uses I noticed some lovely results, my face just feels brighter, youthful, and just healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very much into taking care of my skin</li>
            <li>The 12 month shelf life is a plus and the cost is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I tried everything I could find at the pharmacy and online and nothing seemed to help very much.</li>
            <li>The Vitamin C Serum will absorb directly into your skin, and treat age spots, wrinkles and fine</li>
            <li>Last, this serum doesn&#x27;t feel greasy AT ALL, which is huge for me because I don&#x27;t like anything sticky on face!  </li>
            <li>But this is my first experience with a serum.</li>
            <li>It really works and is an inviting smell to it too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been to a lot of facial places trying to get my skin to a better place.</li>
            <li>This product which contains vitamin C, an essential nutrient to help maintain a healthy,  radiant skin did the job.</li>
            <li>until now, I had been spending $100 and up on Estee Lauder&#x27;s anti-aging night serum, but I got similar or better results with NuiNutrients.  </li>
            <li>I love it, I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>and when i wake up next morning i feel more tension in my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping is so fast!</li>
            <li>The lack of sleep was evident every time I saw my reflection in the mirror.</li>
            <li>Will continue to use this in future.. :)</li>
            <li>First off, let me start with what I like about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plastic leaches yucky toxins into products, and I don&#x27;t want those toxins absorbing in my skin when I apply the serum!  </li>
            <li>and without any explanations from reviewers - which makes me believe someone didn&#x27;t want to be too obvious with too many 5-stars.</li>
            <li>I did not wear sunglasses when I was younger and have many wrinkles around my eyes as a result.  </li>
            <li>but it cost about a grand and caused my skin to be sore and red for a week.</li>
            <li>Our skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>but it managed to still smooth out my skin considerably.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the lines that weren&#x27;t so deep when I woke, look like the Grand Canyon.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different products that made my skin worse.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This serum works for me although tit took a while at first.</li>
            <li>Any product with water as the first ingredient is an option for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen the way this works and its gentle yet powerful.  </li>
            <li>If used on a regular basis, you will see as I did your pores shrink and your face feel soft, smooth and appear more youthful.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much tighter and youthful!</li>
            <li>First off, let me start out by saying that I didn&#x27;t buy this for myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still way too young to have much use for it, but logically speaking, I think it makes sensemble that something as natural as vitamin C would be so much more effective than the chemical-laden creams you get from big brands.</li>
            <li>I have been using NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum along with their Cucumber eye cream, and I am so pleased with how much younger and fresher my face</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say it has helped 1 line or a laugh line or anything.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a gorgeous glow without being all oily, my dark spots are finally fading, and my face feels as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>(you only use a little), and I am beginning to like it more and more!</li>
            <li>I use the product at night (simply because I do not think makeup goes onto it very well), because that is when your skin is doing the most of its cell recovery.  </li>
            <li>Pretty certain I&#x27;ll be a customer of NuNutrients the rest of my life&#x3D;</li>
            <li>I have used many anti-aging products in the past that have felt very heavy,and I never really noticed any great difference.</li>
            <li>Positive results guaranteed.</li>
            <li>Like many women approaching forty years, I have been consciously looking for an effective day cream or serum that will compensate all the dry areas around my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li>I also had some older scars that just dissapeared out right.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I saw this product recommended in many magazines and websites for long time and decide to buy it.</li>
            <li>I am a man but always looking to get my skin looking better, I work long hours which can take a toll on the skin and how a person looks.  </li>
            <li>My fine lines around my eyes and mouth are diminishing, my makeup goes on smoother, and my skin seems to have a more natural glow due to the vitamins in this product.  </li>
            <li>After applying it to my clean face it dries fast and clear.  </li>
            <li>For years I didn&#x27;t get enough sleep and generally abused my own body.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how quickly my acne scars started to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: Easy to use, simple design, see results in a matter of days, no sticky residue, no stinging or allergies.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Most products that I purchase don&#x27;t really work or take way toooo long to work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But the real reason I highly recommend this is because it has made my skin look better overall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using NuNutrients for a couple of months now and the difference is certainly noticeable.</li>
            <li>Unlike Vitamin E serums, this is not meant to be a moisturizer, but it certainly helps diminish the effects of aging and environmental toxins, including unfiltered tap water, which can have damaging effects on the skin.</li>
            <li>I certainly can tell the difference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had problems with dry skin for many years, and NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum has really balances that out.</li>
            <li>my pores on my cheeks and nose have closed tremendously!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 32, I used this in hopes to fill in some of the lines-very fine on my forehead.</li>
            <li>Works really well on my fine lines, especially along the edges of my eyes.</li>
            <li>In two days I noticed that my skin was so much softer.</li>
            <li>and she loves it so much</li>
            <li>Really makes a difference and is improving my Eczema.  </li>
            <li>It really worked and changed the texture if my skin.</li>
            <li>It is thicker and is not thin as water like others.</li>
            <li>Brightened my skin so much.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum is one of my absolute FAVORITES.</li>
            <li>I really to a leap of faith on this</li>
            <li>The NuNutrients really works and you can feel it working</li>
            <li>It was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I ordered the serum and saw the results very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I was very content with my purchase.</li>
            <li>, but they are not the Amazon verified \\&quot;real name\\</li>
            <li>this product has done absolute wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li>feels very hydrated</li>
            <li>and it really made me feel refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product and the way it makes my face look and feel.</li>
            <li>but after about a month there wasn&#x27;t much of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Like anything else, it takes time, but the results really were almost immediate.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much softer.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>I tried this one and it REALLY</li>
            <li>I once got my hand on a real and efficient vitamin C serum from Korea which costed me $20 and worked</li>
            <li>It took about 2 weeks for the real results to kick in.</li>
            <li>Living in a seasonal region, the winter can be very drying.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I had gigantic pores around my nose and could never find anything to make much of a difference until now.</li>
            <li>I can really tell the difference in the way my face looks and feels.</li>
            <li>The lines are really disappearing and leaving my skin so much smoother.</li>
            <li>My skin&#x27;s appearance was much smoother, the serum helped reduce my wrinkles along with also giving my skin</li>
            <li>I apply this once a day in the morning after washing my face and the whole day</li>
            <li>short, this really is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>This serum is gentle and cooling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really like this Serum</li>
            <li>Its a product you can really see and feel working.  </li>
            <li>I use this every day and my skin feels so much softer and smoother than before.</li>
            <li>I always felt as if I was wasting my money, and I really needed something that was going to do what it said it would do.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if this is working or not.</li>
            <li>Even got a few comments about how nice my skin looked.</li>
            <li>She is constantly raving about it and honestly I can see a big difference.</li>
            <li>Her favorite part besides the obvious effects it has on her young looking skin is its shelf life.</li>
            <li>I have difficulty with many skin care products due to them containing fillers and/or non pure ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product with some skepticism because I have very sensitive skin, but to my surprise it was very gentle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is truly a trusted brand that provides simple and pure skin care products because it leaves my skin feeling clean, refreshed, and replenished.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about what I put on my face, especially now that I&#x27;m older and my skin is more sensitive.</li>
            <li>The serum is easy to use, lasts a long time, and is affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>after reading up about several other products, I decided to give this one a try because it had good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see the results right away, maybe because I was expecting the product not to work like all the other ones, but after a week, my face felt more youthful and soft and stronger.</li>
            <li>It seems to help my makeup set better because there isn&#x27;t that greasy feel that you get after using some of the other wrinkle creams.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty surprised!</li>
            <li>I am excited to see the future results as I continuously use this product.</li>
            <li>and it was a better cost than some of the other products out there on the market.</li>
            <li>I definitely saw a significant difference in my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t really lighten up the spots which are making me look older.</li>
            <li>From tanning too much, stress, etc my skin looked much older than it</li>
            <li>However, this serum proves that it’s not just another one of those money making products, but actually one that works, besides, it’s Dr. Oz recommended ;)</li>
            <li>Nutrients Vitamin C Serum - Anti-Aging Serum is I feel is not only safer, cheaper and easier than a facelift or chemical peel but two weeks after applying the serum on clean skin after my morning cleansing routine, I did feel an improvement in the texture of the skin around my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li>When you are young, your skin is full of Vitamin C but as you age, your skin will naturally lose this nutrient.  </li>
            <li>This product really reduced the appearance and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>OMG what a difference on my skin specially around my mouth and cheek area totally fuller</li>
            <li>I just started using it about a week ago and many of my friends have commented on how much smoother and slightly lighter my skin looks.</li>
            <li>This vitamin C serum was very effective for my dark spots and it improved the rough texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and if you feel your skin starting to dry up a little after you apply it, then you can apply good quality moisture over it and let NuNutrient do its work.</li>
            <li>At some point I cleaned up my health and started taking much better care of myself, but the dark baggy circles persisted.</li>
            <li>however I live in desert climates so very often</li>
            <li>Love this product, makes my skin smoother, lines less visible.</li>
            <li>Wrinkles immediately feel less prominent, too.</li>
            <li>Not only has it reduced the appearance of the most obvious lines and wrinkles on my face, it has also worked on the finer lines which can be trickier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m getting older.</li>
            <li>This year I am looking forward to my birthday instead of dreading getting another year older.</li>
            <li>Decent product.  </li>
            <li>I was mainly concerned about resurfacing my skin and decrease the appearance of my enlarged pores around my cheek area.  </li>
            <li>so actually it lasts a while, but I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more when mine runs out.</li>
            <li>I was not sure if it would really work and make my skin better or not as I have tried many other skin smoothing and anti wrinkle creams but nothing gave me any beneficial results.</li>
            <li>oily-sensitive skin and serums usually do not take to my skin very well.  </li>
            <li>I even found that I had ZERO breakouts after using this like I normally would from trying something new!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to both women and men who care about their skincare needs.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve ranged from $70-$200 for high end products.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is an antioxidant that is naturally found in citrus fruits and certain vegetables.</li>
            <li>I have a prominent dark spot under my eye and the crows have made their trek across my face!</li>
            <li>By this time, most of the dark spots on my face faded and it had already begun toning up the coloring of my face and neck!</li>
            <li>Positives were it goes on easy and can be used with other products.  </li>
            <li>the dull complexion is visibly reduced and the lines around my eyes have diminished nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using different types of lotions for years trying to get my wrinkles out and get it looking just a little more useful.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure going to give it my all in slowly down the process!  </li>
            <li>With the sensitive skin I have, I am very weary about what I put on myself</li>
            <li>I have decided that of all of the products I have used to preserve the health of my skin, this (and sunscreen) are completely worth the financial investment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m dating someone younger than me, so I&#x27;m more sensitive about my appearance now, but this stuff has given me back my confidence.</li>
            <li>I definitely think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>so that is a sure sign that you are not putting a bunch of harsh chemicals on your face and into your pores.</li>
            <li>I always appreciate a serum that is nice and thick, and doesn&#x27;t drip off my fingers before it makes it to my face.</li>
            <li>I was looking at my pores on my nose and thinking I needed to take a sandblaster to them, then received this product yesterday, tried it that night, looked at my skin in the am and noticed right off that the pores on my nose were smaller.  </li>
            <li>Now, rather than disclose this little gold mine I&#x27;d discovered, I bought 5 more bottles and took them to the next family reunion where they sold like hot cakes, aided by my uncle&#x27;s glowing endorsement and my aunt&#x27;s non-stop hype.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I have learned recently plays a very large role in the healthiness of our body and skin tone.</li>
            <li>I have neglected taking care of my skin in the past, but as I grow older, I am not taking any more chances.</li>
            <li>... mix with other wrinkle free</li>
            <li>She took me  to the bathroom and shined the light on my face and showed me the crows feet and some other stuff on my face</li>
            <li>I was super close to buying this product based on all the glowing reviews, but the reviews just seemed a little too much like an advertisement instead of real people.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my aunt, who has been looking for an anti-aging serum for quite some time new.</li>
            <li>an the 3 of us need to order new bottles soon.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect just a new face</li>
            <li>I needed to find something to add to my new anti aging arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, this product has been a big success</li>
            <li>I bought this for my older sister who&#x27;s feel that she isn&#x27;t looking that young anymore.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s tried quite a few different things and so far, this has had the best performance of anything she&#x27;s tried in the past.</li>
            <li>I have to say I was very surprised with this product.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and prone to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have always struggled with finding a product that was very natural yet also helped with reducing the aging properties of my skin.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Something like this that actually works at this low of a price is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>My 15 year old daughter, Maddie has even been using it!</li>
            <li>first issue is simply a vitamin C issue:  </li>
            <li>This serum (NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum) was my third one I tried (because hey, i keep reading and hearing so much about vitamin C!).</li>
            <li>So soft!</li>
            <li>This makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li>I’ve tried several Vitamin C Serums and this is the first that doesn’t leave my face greasy.  </li>
            <li>As I get older my face has been really starting to show some real wear and tare as I approach fifty.</li>
            <li>I have always heard that Vitamin C is very good for your skin and at one local clinic there were a lot of very expensive products I would buy and use that did work very well.</li>
            <li>It has definitely made a positive difference in her appearance.</li>
            <li>For the past 10-15 years, I have not aged as much as most other woman, most people think that I am about 10 years younger than my age.</li>
            <li>I skeptically tried this product because I have been looking for something new to try with not a lot of good results.</li>
            <li>It looked brighter, pores smaller, lines less prominent.  </li>
            <li>A coworker asked me the other day if I was pregnant because she thought my skin looked &amp;</li>
            <li>It has triple action Vitamin C serum with natural antioxidant that helps your skin stay young.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something to revitalize and clear your skin then</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s 52 yrs old.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so even tho</li>
            <li>I can promise my skin glows naturally.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>It is made of all natural ingredients as well, which is always a plus in my book.</li>
            <li>lotion.&lt;br /&gt;there is no trouble to my skin</li>
            <li>I personally didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in her beauty</li>
            <li>It is triple action.  </li>
            <li>I never knew how old I was looking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a month so far, and the results are clear.</li>
            <li>My husband has commented about his young looking wife and now when I wear makeup I am not trying to cover-up my wrinkles.</li>
            <li>but lately, I have switched to using Vitamin C serum and noticed that it is easier on my skin than Retina while getting better</li>
            <li>I am 57 year young Caucasian woman</li>
            <li>I have tried everything natural and organic out there.</li>
            <li>My skin looks like its old self  NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>I am 34 years old.</li>
            <li>Make it part of your routine because vitamin c is vital to our bodies.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m on the fence.  </li>
            <li>I use it directly on my problem areas after I exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li>the overall look and consistency is much firmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a guy looking for something to get your old lady; buy this</li>
            <li>I really do look younger than I did a week ago when I started using it.</li>
            <li>Replenish your skin with Vitamin C Serum as early as 2-4 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li>I felt very refreshed especially after adding this to my face and under my eyes!  </li>
            <li>I am 30 years old, so I guess I have just started the \\&quot;aging\\&quot; process.</li>
            <li>the troublesome parts around my eyes look better and everyday I fell and look younger.</li>
            <li>I have been using NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum for a few months now, I love how it&#x27;s a topical vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>To soon to tell about how it will work on my face overall, but having smaller pores is worth 5 stars.    </li>
            <li>The serum allows us to be youthful, healthy and to have the skin we had when we were younger before the sun and other pollutants left its toll.</li>
            <li>After three days or so my fingers glided over my cheeks smoothly and there were fewer dry noticeable dry patches on the forehead.</li>
            <li>I have large pores, and they are still large but definitely less noticeable than before.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for regular use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended as an addition to your current moisturizing routine.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m only giving the product 4 stars because my skin is quite dry, and it took a while for my moisturizer to take effect in battling this powerful agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This Irish Girl burns with 100 SPF on, so I have to be super careful to remember not to use it on days I work in my garden.  </li>
            <li>My skin is even and smooth, no more zits and bumps.  </li>
            <li>My skin came back to normal in record time.</li>
            <li>At first it was rough butan.</li>
            <li>I have dark spots and the laugh lines that I had to get rid of.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m going to put on my NEW pair of BLUE Chuck Taylors and HIT THE TOWN..!</li>
            <li>What are the chances that all 5 new reviews were from men on the same day.  </li>
            <li>I have always had issues with dry skin for years, and NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum has really given my face the moisture it deserves.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend using this to anybody I can who wants to look and feel younger!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see any major results.</li>
            <li>As I grow older, I find myself competing with younger guys for the same customers.  </li>
            <li>Hard to write a review here because I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in my skin, but I don&#x27;t see any age spots or deeper wrinkles, either.</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li>a general health perspective</li>
            <li>It made me feel self conscious since my face always looked damp as if I am constantly sweating.  </li>
            <li>With this product you can get that young softer smoother skin back.  </li>
            <li>I have people falling back when i tell them i am 38 years old.</li>
            <li>This product contains several natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>All instructions are concise and simple to follow.</li>
            <li>This serum has helped to replenish the natural look of my skin and my aging spots are starting to fade.</li>
            <li>Saw results sooner than I expected and the fine lines around my eyes look less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Not only has it lightened up the dark spots under my eyes but have gotten rid of my laugh</li>
            <li>I tried every kind of lotion you could imagine- topicals, butters, specialized treatments, expensive Bath&amp;Body works &#x27;miracle creams&#x27;...</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin has responded in just a few weeks by looking less tired, and more youthful.</li>
            <li>This product comes in a handy little dropper bottle so a little can potentially go a long way to keeping skin soft and younger looking.  </li>
            <li>I also feel that my skin is much more firm and less sagging</li>
            <li>I used them for years until I became pregnant and got too lazy to drive to that clinic.</li>
            <li>So i developed dark circles around my eyes that made me look older and have tried some things that did not work.</li>
            <li>The smell of the serum is nice too, and most products like this smell horrible.</li>
            <li>My dad confirmed it, he swears she looks at least 10 younger!</li>
            <li>She sent me a couple pictures of my uncles freshly renewed skin, shocked to see him looking better than her.</li>
            <li>I am a 36-yr old male with obvious wrinkles and dry/dull complexion.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical that this serum would work any better than the tons of others I had tried, but soon after using it, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This product did not dry my skin nor did it feel oily.  </li>
            <li>Will use rest of bottle - not bad, just not seeing same benefits as usual.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit, at first, I was a little apprehensive given the price.</li>
            <li>In just a couple of weeks I see a very noticeable difference in the lines and dark spot.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product that could lighten some of the dark spots that I have under my eyes and after two weeks I can tell a real difference.</li>
            <li>i actually bought this for my mom for her birthday recently, i know it sounds kind of lame</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that it wasn&#x27;t harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am pretty skeptical of anti-aging products, but I had heard some good things about NuNutrients and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a few weeks now, and I have seriously noticed a positive difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Having tried a variety of facials and even chemical peels I have now found this new product ‘’Nu Nutrients Vitamin C Serum’’, that gives me the satisfaction that I so longed for in easing the dry nature of my facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am left feeling less wrinkled and with less fine lines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 months and the texture of my skin has really improved, a lot less crepey.</li>
            <li>My face is a lot less red and my skin tone has really evened out.  </li>
            <li>but I had too as I received a watery gel with a slight medicated smell and after finishing the bottle couldn&#x27;t sincerely notice any improvement at all on the slight blemishes I have due to sun exposure this summer</li>
            <li>Any of you other &#x27;burning state dwellers&#x27; out there in Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, ect...</li>
            <li>My cheeks became a little pink but that disappeared a minute or so later as the serum was  absorbed by my skin.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Now, this particular uncle had just retired from 35 years of year-round swim-coaching in the California sun in favor of a desk job, so his wrinkles were LEGENDARY.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> I like the product a lot, and the company is super helpful, with great customer service.</li>
            <li> Also, I kept wondering why so many 4-star reviews (instead of 5-stars), if this product is so amazing -</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is simply, amazing results.</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product and boy I am glad he did.</li>
            <li> After three weeks or so, she called me up and told me how much firmer and lifted her skin was looking, and that it was a great improvement on her pores.</li>
            <li> , shes brighter, and looks 5 years younger, i&#x27;m so glad i could make her happy with this!</li>
            <li> and it really does make my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li> This anti-aging serum is perfect for a younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> Love that it has three types of vit. C, as most C products don&#x27;t absorb into the dermis, this one does.</li>
            <li> Send more please.</li>
            <li> Skin is getting better.</li>
            <li> I love the results I am achieving.</li>
            <li> My skin has more clarity, it&#x27;s softer, lines have been reduced, and some have gone away.</li>
            <li> I love that the product is produced in an FDA certified facility.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels more supple.  </li>
            <li> Love the price and love the product...</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results and at my age I need something to help with lines and skin smoothing.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff after my toner and before I moisturize and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this NuNutrients anti-aging serum.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I feel more confident when I walk out the door in the morning.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a try and was quite satisfied with the results after my purchase.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d imagine that many people, like myself, trust Amazon reviews when we are researching a product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite formulation of it.</li>
            <li> and I look healthy.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not too sure,</li>
            <li> and I am amazed at the wonderful results I have received in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the dermatologist for dermabrasion more than 10 years ago and this procedure did work</li>
            <li> so im always looking for ways to keep myself looking youthful and healthy.</li>
            <li> May have seen more results</li>
            <li> I have tried so many home remedies to do the job that this serum does, but nothing came even close to how this product improved my skin.  </li>
            <li> OK results.</li>
            <li> You simply add a drop to whatever you use -- I use Dermalogica -- and you can feel your skin wonderfully smoother.</li>
            <li> The fact that the vitamin c replaces lost collagen amazes me and allows me to feel better as I age.</li>
            <li> love this serum</li>
            <li> I am completely in love with this line.</li>
            <li> I am completely in love.</li>
            <li> Anti-Aging the liquid makes my skin is more radiant and it looks more refreshed.</li>
            <li> Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also contains antioxidant properties that helps you maintain a healthy body.  </li>
            <li> You will never have a better complexion.  </li>
            <li> and I definitely love the way my face looks and feels.  </li>
            <li> plus it is more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with it and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> After about a month, I am already noticing a more youthful presence.</li>
            <li> She was most worried about those age spots and wrinkles, which have already begun to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I’m sure this has everything to do with the Nutrients Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> Antioxidants are so healthy and beneficial to our skin and bodies.</li>
            <li> The serum has started to brighten my skin providing me with a more radiant and youthful complexion.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this serum, I&#x27;ve not had nearly as many breakouts ..</li>
            <li> What I love the most is my skin feels softer yet</li>
            <li> will now better allow me to take better care of my skin and make me feel more confident in the way I look.</li>
            <li> I am looking more than my age</li>
            <li> ; lady any more.</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments on my skin since I started using it.</li>
            <li> just got it,  love the way it makes my skin feel  </li>
            <li> Ignoring my first thought and trying it anyway was one of the best decisions I have made.&lt;br /&gt;Within the first three weeks of using this product as directed, I began to notice a change in the way my skin looked and felt.</li>
            <li> What makes this product even greater is the fact that I can apply my makeup over it without an issue.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels afterwards when using this.  </li>
            <li> Allow Vitamin C Serum to help your body maintain your youthful, healthy, resilient skin.</li>
            <li> C Serum gives you a tighter and more youthful skin appearance.</li>
            <li> I may not be better at soccer because of NuNutrients, but man do I look better playing it.</li>
            <li> However I love this product but can do without the flaking of the skin .</li>
            <li> My skin looked and felt more hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I wish it were a pump instead of a dropper, but I love the product</li>
            <li> After using this for about a week, I can visibily tell that my wrinkles and lines have reduced, and on top of that, I have that youthful glow to my skin that I&#x27;ve been looking for for years.</li>
            <li> According to Valerie Monroe, beauty editor of &amp;#34;O, the Oprah magazine,&amp;#34; antioxidant serums can brighten your complexion and help moisturizers absorb better.</li>
            <li> This works much better and is so much more affordable.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that with using this for a prolonged amount of time, I will see even more drastic changes.  </li>
            <li> My mam was very impressed - feel it has smoothed skin almost immediately, and she definitely plan to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> And I believe it has a lot to do with taking good care of your skin and using the right anti aging</li>
            <li> Surprisingly it was super easy to use too.  </li>
            <li> That is why I was very excited to find NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum - Anti-Aging Serum.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> This is by-far the best anti-aging product that I have used and I am sure that I will be using this product for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I look better, I feel better, and more importantly I&#x27;m happier because of it.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that this product stands true to its description.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how quickly and effectively this brightened my skin tone from tiredness.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is fair and, to be honest, quite sensitive</li>
            <li> Really nice, light weight, smooth to the touch serum.</li>
            <li> So the good news is that I don’t really have many wrinkles and wasn’t sure this would be very useful</li>
            <li> My wife like it very much, the quality is very good and the price is very favourable</li>
            <li> My pores were clearing and my skin was becoming more smooth and even toned.</li>
            <li> It works amazing, the price is more than fair especially since it works so well.  </li>
            <li> Wow what a great product</li>
            <li> It has brightened my skin and gave it a great natural glow and radiance.</li>
            <li> It is FDA approved and that makes it more credible.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really think it could do so much good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line I am now a full time serum user!</li>
            <li> Sweet..!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Given the hype around Vitamin C, I couldn&#x27;t be more excited what NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum has to offer.</li>
            <li> The serum is easy to apply thanks to the handy dropper top on the bottle.</li>
            <li> and I know that I am using a clean and healthy product on my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing Vitamin C serum that you would absolutely fall in love with.</li>
            <li> The Serum was easy to apply and took no time out of my day.  </li>
            <li> NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum is easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i strongly recommend to use c-serum.</li>
            <li> I liked it right away since it goes on smooth</li>
            <li> Just like their other products, this has a light scent and perfect consistency.</li>
            <li> The fine lines I now have in my 40s don&#x27;t seem as visible anymore.  </li>
            <li> Reduced my fine lines.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and spread easily.</li>
            <li> My fine lines are not as noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Her face is softer and the fine lines around her eyes seem to be clearing up.</li>
            <li> I had fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li> The product is light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It look away the fine lines by my eyes and helped fill in the wrinkles around my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I ended up using it on the wrinkles on my face as well as the fine lines</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would help with the lines under my eyes and fine lines on my forehead..</li>
            <li> Fine lines-</li>
            <li> All the fine lines are vanished.</li>
            <li> I am getting some fine lines that people tell me are from laughing.</li>
            <li> It diminished fine lines and wrinkles by inducing collagen.</li>
            <li> As an avid outdoor soccer player who has the misfortune of being allergic to most sunblock creams, I thought for sure I was destined to become a rhinoceros.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the packaging and find it easy to carry with me on the go, if needed.</li>
            <li> because it is light and easy to apply, I can feel it soak into my skin immediately.  </li>
            <li> Vitamin C can cause some mild dryness or flaking, so if you have this issue, be sure to use a moisturizer after using the Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> After using it for a little over a month now, my skin appears to be more healthy and beautiful.</li>
            <li> But as long as I do both, my skin looks good!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s never looked do good or been so soft!</li>
            <li> I use excellent cleaning and moisturizng products on my face and have been very careful to keep my face clean, but no matter what I used I still kept breaking out in hideous bumps and zits all over my face.  </li>
            <li> I have a natural style, so to me, the best investment is in keeping what you&#x27;ve got naturally</li>
            <li> have been using this serum for about 2 months and noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> My skin is clear and bright after using this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Knowing this, my dad bought both of us a specific name brand serum which we were happy with</li>
            <li> well I love to laugh</li>
            <li> I got it as a Valentine present from my husband, and I am truly happy that he did.</li>
            <li> NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum has greatly reduced my facial redness and flushing by about 80%.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C blend and H2O make me feel comfortable applying to my face.</li>
            <li> so this is an important factor when searching for a skin Serum.  </li>
            <li> this is important to me.</li>
            <li> Fortunately NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> I received this free product to review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a great price, considering that I used to pay upwards of $100 a bottle for a smaller amount from the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I use 2X per day (morning and night) and follow up with a good moisturizer for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Getting ready to purchase a second bottle of this awesome anti-aging serum</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a good solid month or better.</li>
            <li> I love the way it goes on smoothly, and soaks right into my skin.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this absorbed quickly, leaving no greasy or oily film on my face and arms.  </li>
            <li> This serum is well worth your money!  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> I love this serum so much!</li>
            <li> As it dries, you can feel and see a significant difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> to my original review</li>
            <li> and I’m pretty sure this serum is why they are fading a bit.</li>
            <li> first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to work, but soon I noticed that my sunspots were diminishing.</li>
            <li> I already recommended this to some friends who went ahead and tried it for themselves, and they were as excited by it as I was.</li>
            <li> This serum has helped significantly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my aunt and was so surprised at how amazing (and quick) it worked!</li>
            <li> After finding many positive reviews for this revolutionary supplement, I decided to give a try.</li>
            <li> another thing to notice - most all of the reviews for this product sound like someone&#x27;s real name (maybe to sound more realistic?)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I got it, but the fact that it is rich with Vitamin C really drew me to it.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin and bought this product to mostly help reduce the look of fine lines.</li>
            <li> I use this with hyaluronic acid serum, and love the combo, noticing a difference already, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> like me, know full well the sun is NOT always our friend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She particularly liked the fact that there were no harsh scents.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a true collagen booster try what I did Radiantly Ageless Peptide Fusion Collagen Booster or The Triple Serum De Luxe by radiantlyageless.com  </li>
            <li> I have conducted much research on Vitamin C and feel confident in recommending this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> It had a cool feeling which made me feel relaxed.</li>
            <li> But overall good would  keep using it.</li>
            <li> formula is very gentle and was very pleased that it did not irritate my skin, given I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> NuNutrients absorbs into my skin quickly and leaves my skin feeling nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> I can go without makeup if I want to for quick runs to the store.  </li>
            <li> As I said, though, the pinkness goes away after a minute or two and my skin was left feeling nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> vitamin c quick results</li>
            <li> It helps my skin not only look better, but also feel better.</li>
            <li> My face looks brighter and more vibrant than I can remember.</li>
            <li> I did however find something that has similar ingredeients, but might be more potent or something.</li>
            <li> Depending on how good the condition of your skin is it might be worth looking into this product especially as it also anti-aging.</li>
            <li> For me, I&#x27;m using it to face and neck once a day at night, and it absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li> This serum absorbs quickly and it doesn’t leave my skin feeling sticky or tacky.  </li>
            <li> Of course, we all had a good laugh and he tucked it away in his medicine cabinet (Didn&#x27;t learn this until later; I thought he threw it</li>
            <li> I was purchasing cheap drugstore products, and eventually decided to try something higher end.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the results that I&#x27;ve seen, especially in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> The serum is USA made and FDA approved which is important and the first ingredient is Aqua (water)</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much more youthful and vibrant and so many of my laugh lines have completely vanished!</li>
            <li> This product works really great and help tighten up the skin and making wrinkles seems less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Also, because the serum is absorbed so quickly into my skin, I prefer to apply it under my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Your wrinkles get reduced and fine lines even disappear in certain cases.</li>
            <li> ;  This really works..!!</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is something my body needs, and I am glad to have found something natural to help myself age gracefully!</li>
            <li> And my skin overall felt better!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use it consistently, but I&#x27;ve still been able to see my skin get tighter and my crow&#x27;s feet have pretty much disappeared!</li>
            <li> THANKS TO NUNUTRIENTS!!</li>
            <li> I also tend to get very red and blotchy, and since I have been using this amazing product I have noticed that the redness as lessened tremendously.</li>
            <li> This used in conjunction with the NuNutrients eye cream completely made the fine lines around my eyes vanish!</li>
            <li> Since Vitamin C is a natural antioxidant in our bodies, I was very comfortable with knowing that what I was applying to my skin had also a multitude of health benefits.</li>
            <li> I was confident to try this product because of the Vitamin C content and I am well aware of the benefits to your skin from this nutrient that is vital to our overall good health.</li>
            <li> Age Defying Serum contains is a &amp;#34;triple action&amp;#34; blend of ingredients that contains Vitamin C as well as powerful antioxidants.  </li>
            <li> I always have a smile on my face.</li>
            <li> I started seeing results after a couple weeks, so it&#x27;s definitely worth adding to your beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C makes you more sensitive to the sun.  </li>
            <li> I used to make fun of my wife for using this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is much brighter, I have a more even complexion and many of my numerous frown lines are almost invisible.</li>
            <li> For us it works nicely with the &amp;#34;eb5 Anti-Aging Facial Cream.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the investment</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that my face feels smoother and some of the wrinkles already starting to fade away.</li>
            <li> and so far I really love it.</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth that money</li>
            <li> It also helps gives your skin a natural glow because after using Vitamin C serum helps your moisturizer to absorb in your skin better.</li>
            <li> have noticed a difference in my smile</li>
            <li> I find that it’s moisturizing enough on its own.  </li>
            <li> In the morning, I apply it as soon as I get out of the shower and by the time I brush my hair and teeth, it’s fully absorbed and I can put my makeup on.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh and has a youthful glow to it.</li>
            <li> The combination of vitamin C an hylouronic acid is very powerful and is essential for healthy skin.  </li>
            <li> noticed a difference in my skin right away.  </li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s an anti-aging cream, they&#x27;re all crocks anyway, right?)</li>
            <li> The applications are easy and feel fine, and the bags under my eyes have gotten smaller.</li>
            <li> only that regenerates and renews the aging skin but also has a great intense moisturizing action.</li>
            <li> Some of my colleagues have even mentioned that I seem more exuberant in the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I will certainly be purchasing another!</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been using it about a month now and looks have certainly improved!</li>
            <li> Another thing that I have learned is how vitamin C is not only great for inside health but outside health too.</li>
            <li> I plan to continue with NuNutrients--just as good but a lot less money.</li>
            <li> After just a few uses I noticed some lovely results, my face just feels brighter, youthful, and just healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very much into taking care of my skin</li>
            <li> The 12 month shelf life is a plus and the cost is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I tried everything I could find at the pharmacy and online and nothing seemed to help very much.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C Serum will absorb directly into your skin, and treat age spots, wrinkles and fine</li>
            <li> Last, this serum doesn&#x27;t feel greasy AT ALL, which is huge for me because I don&#x27;t like anything sticky on face!  </li>
            <li> But this is my first experience with a serum.</li>
            <li> It really works and is an inviting smell to it too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been to a lot of facial places trying to get my skin to a better place.</li>
            <li> This product which contains vitamin C, an essential nutrient to help maintain a healthy,  radiant skin did the job.</li>
            <li> until now, I had been spending $100 and up on Estee Lauder&#x27;s anti-aging night serum, but I got similar or better results with NuiNutrients.  </li>
            <li> I love it, I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> and when i wake up next morning i feel more tension in my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping is so fast!</li>
            <li> The lack of sleep was evident every time I saw my reflection in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use this in future.. :)</li>
            <li> First off, let me start with what I like about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plastic leaches yucky toxins into products, and I don&#x27;t want those toxins absorbing in my skin when I apply the serum!  </li>
            <li> and without any explanations from reviewers - which makes me believe someone didn&#x27;t want to be too obvious with too many 5-stars.</li>
            <li> I did not wear sunglasses when I was younger and have many wrinkles around my eyes as a result.  </li>
            <li> but it cost about a grand and caused my skin to be sore and red for a week.</li>
            <li> Our skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> but it managed to still smooth out my skin considerably.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the lines that weren&#x27;t so deep when I woke, look like the Grand Canyon.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products that made my skin worse.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This serum works for me although tit took a while at first.</li>
            <li> Any product with water as the first ingredient is an option for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen the way this works and its gentle yet powerful.  </li>
            <li> If used on a regular basis, you will see as I did your pores shrink and your face feel soft, smooth and appear more youthful.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much tighter and youthful!</li>
            <li> First off, let me start out by saying that I didn&#x27;t buy this for myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still way too young to have much use for it, but logically speaking, I think it makes sensemble that something as natural as vitamin C would be so much more effective than the chemical-laden creams you get from big brands.</li>
            <li> I have been using NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum along with their Cucumber eye cream, and I am so pleased with how much younger and fresher my face</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say it has helped 1 line or a laugh line or anything.</li>
            <li> It gives my skin a gorgeous glow without being all oily, my dark spots are finally fading, and my face feels as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> (you only use a little), and I am beginning to like it more and more!</li>
            <li> I use the product at night (simply because I do not think makeup goes onto it very well), because that is when your skin is doing the most of its cell recovery.  </li>
            <li> Pretty certain I&#x27;ll be a customer of NuNutrients the rest of my life&#x3D;</li>
            <li> I have used many anti-aging products in the past that have felt very heavy,and I never really noticed any great difference.</li>
            <li> Positive results guaranteed.</li>
            <li> Like many women approaching forty years, I have been consciously looking for an effective day cream or serum that will compensate all the dry areas around my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li> I also had some older scars that just dissapeared out right.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I saw this product recommended in many magazines and websites for long time and decide to buy it.</li>
            <li> I am a man but always looking to get my skin looking better, I work long hours which can take a toll on the skin and how a person looks.  </li>
            <li> My fine lines around my eyes and mouth are diminishing, my makeup goes on smoother, and my skin seems to have a more natural glow due to the vitamins in this product.  </li>
            <li> After applying it to my clean face it dries fast and clear.  </li>
            <li> For years I didn&#x27;t get enough sleep and generally abused my own body.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how quickly my acne scars started to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : Easy to use, simple design, see results in a matter of days, no sticky residue, no stinging or allergies.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Most products that I purchase don&#x27;t really work or take way toooo long to work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the real reason I highly recommend this is because it has made my skin look better overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using NuNutrients for a couple of months now and the difference is certainly noticeable.</li>
            <li> Unlike Vitamin E serums, this is not meant to be a moisturizer, but it certainly helps diminish the effects of aging and environmental toxins, including unfiltered tap water, which can have damaging effects on the skin.</li>
            <li> I certainly can tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had problems with dry skin for many years, and NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum has really balances that out.</li>
            <li> my pores on my cheeks and nose have closed tremendously!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 32, I used this in hopes to fill in some of the lines-very fine on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Works really well on my fine lines, especially along the edges of my eyes.</li>
            <li> In two days I noticed that my skin was so much softer.</li>
            <li> and she loves it so much</li>
            <li> Really makes a difference and is improving my Eczema.  </li>
            <li> It really worked and changed the texture if my skin.</li>
            <li> It is thicker and is not thin as water like others.</li>
            <li> Brightened my skin so much.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum is one of my absolute FAVORITES.</li>
            <li> I really to a leap of faith on this</li>
            <li> The NuNutrients really works and you can feel it working</li>
            <li> It was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I ordered the serum and saw the results very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I was very content with my purchase.</li>
            <li> , but they are not the Amazon verified \\&quot;real name\\</li>
            <li> this product has done absolute wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> feels very hydrated</li>
            <li> and it really made me feel refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product and the way it makes my face look and feel.</li>
            <li> but after about a month there wasn&#x27;t much of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Like anything else, it takes time, but the results really were almost immediate.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much softer.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> I tried this one and it REALLY</li>
            <li> I once got my hand on a real and efficient vitamin C serum from Korea which costed me $20 and worked</li>
            <li> It took about 2 weeks for the real results to kick in.</li>
            <li> Living in a seasonal region, the winter can be very drying.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I had gigantic pores around my nose and could never find anything to make much of a difference until now.</li>
            <li> I can really tell the difference in the way my face looks and feels.</li>
            <li> The lines are really disappearing and leaving my skin so much smoother.</li>
            <li> My skin&#x27;s appearance was much smoother, the serum helped reduce my wrinkles along with also giving my skin</li>
            <li> I apply this once a day in the morning after washing my face and the whole day</li>
            <li> short, this really is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> This serum is gentle and cooling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really like this Serum</li>
            <li> Its a product you can really see and feel working.  </li>
            <li> I use this every day and my skin feels so much softer and smoother than before.</li>
            <li> I always felt as if I was wasting my money, and I really needed something that was going to do what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if this is working or not.</li>
            <li> Even got a few comments about how nice my skin looked.</li>
            <li> She is constantly raving about it and honestly I can see a big difference.</li>
            <li> Her favorite part besides the obvious effects it has on her young looking skin is its shelf life.</li>
            <li> I have difficulty with many skin care products due to them containing fillers and/or non pure ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product with some skepticism because I have very sensitive skin, but to my surprise it was very gentle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is truly a trusted brand that provides simple and pure skin care products because it leaves my skin feeling clean, refreshed, and replenished.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about what I put on my face, especially now that I&#x27;m older and my skin is more sensitive.</li>
            <li> The serum is easy to use, lasts a long time, and is affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> after reading up about several other products, I decided to give this one a try because it had good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see the results right away, maybe because I was expecting the product not to work like all the other ones, but after a week, my face felt more youthful and soft and stronger.</li>
            <li> It seems to help my makeup set better because there isn&#x27;t that greasy feel that you get after using some of the other wrinkle creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty surprised!</li>
            <li> I am excited to see the future results as I continuously use this product.</li>
            <li> and it was a better cost than some of the other products out there on the market.</li>
            <li> I definitely saw a significant difference in my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t really lighten up the spots which are making me look older.</li>
            <li> From tanning too much, stress, etc my skin looked much older than it</li>
            <li> However, this serum proves that it’s not just another one of those money making products, but actually one that works, besides, it’s Dr. Oz recommended ;)</li>
            <li> Nutrients Vitamin C Serum - Anti-Aging Serum is I feel is not only safer, cheaper and easier than a facelift or chemical peel but two weeks after applying the serum on clean skin after my morning cleansing routine, I did feel an improvement in the texture of the skin around my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li> When you are young, your skin is full of Vitamin C but as you age, your skin will naturally lose this nutrient.  </li>
            <li> This product really reduced the appearance and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> OMG what a difference on my skin specially around my mouth and cheek area totally fuller</li>
            <li> I just started using it about a week ago and many of my friends have commented on how much smoother and slightly lighter my skin looks.</li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum was very effective for my dark spots and it improved the rough texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and if you feel your skin starting to dry up a little after you apply it, then you can apply good quality moisture over it and let NuNutrient do its work.</li>
            <li> At some point I cleaned up my health and started taking much better care of myself, but the dark baggy circles persisted.</li>
            <li> however I live in desert climates so very often</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes my skin smoother, lines less visible.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles immediately feel less prominent, too.</li>
            <li> Not only has it reduced the appearance of the most obvious lines and wrinkles on my face, it has also worked on the finer lines which can be trickier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m getting older.</li>
            <li> This year I am looking forward to my birthday instead of dreading getting another year older.</li>
            <li> Decent product.  </li>
            <li> I was mainly concerned about resurfacing my skin and decrease the appearance of my enlarged pores around my cheek area.  </li>
            <li> so actually it lasts a while, but I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if it would really work and make my skin better or not as I have tried many other skin smoothing and anti wrinkle creams but nothing gave me any beneficial results.</li>
            <li> oily-sensitive skin and serums usually do not take to my skin very well.  </li>
            <li> I even found that I had ZERO breakouts after using this like I normally would from trying something new!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to both women and men who care about their skincare needs.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve ranged from $70-$200 for high end products.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is an antioxidant that is naturally found in citrus fruits and certain vegetables.</li>
            <li> I have a prominent dark spot under my eye and the crows have made their trek across my face!</li>
            <li> By this time, most of the dark spots on my face faded and it had already begun toning up the coloring of my face and neck!</li>
            <li> Positives were it goes on easy and can be used with other products.  </li>
            <li> the dull complexion is visibly reduced and the lines around my eyes have diminished nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using different types of lotions for years trying to get my wrinkles out and get it looking just a little more useful.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure going to give it my all in slowly down the process!  </li>
            <li> With the sensitive skin I have, I am very weary about what I put on myself</li>
            <li> I have decided that of all of the products I have used to preserve the health of my skin, this (and sunscreen) are completely worth the financial investment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dating someone younger than me, so I&#x27;m more sensitive about my appearance now, but this stuff has given me back my confidence.</li>
            <li> I definitely think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> so that is a sure sign that you are not putting a bunch of harsh chemicals on your face and into your pores.</li>
            <li> I always appreciate a serum that is nice and thick, and doesn&#x27;t drip off my fingers before it makes it to my face.</li>
            <li> I was looking at my pores on my nose and thinking I needed to take a sandblaster to them, then received this product yesterday, tried it that night, looked at my skin in the am and noticed right off that the pores on my nose were smaller.  </li>
            <li> Now, rather than disclose this little gold mine I&#x27;d discovered, I bought 5 more bottles and took them to the next family reunion where they sold like hot cakes, aided by my uncle&#x27;s glowing endorsement and my aunt&#x27;s non-stop hype.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I have learned recently plays a very large role in the healthiness of our body and skin tone.</li>
            <li> I have neglected taking care of my skin in the past, but as I grow older, I am not taking any more chances.</li>
            <li> ... mix with other wrinkle free</li>
            <li> She took me  to the bathroom and shined the light on my face and showed me the crows feet and some other stuff on my face</li>
            <li> I was super close to buying this product based on all the glowing reviews, but the reviews just seemed a little too much like an advertisement instead of real people.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my aunt, who has been looking for an anti-aging serum for quite some time new.</li>
            <li> an the 3 of us need to order new bottles soon.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect just a new face</li>
            <li> I needed to find something to add to my new anti aging arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, this product has been a big success</li>
            <li> I bought this for my older sister who&#x27;s feel that she isn&#x27;t looking that young anymore.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s tried quite a few different things and so far, this has had the best performance of anything she&#x27;s tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was very surprised with this product.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and prone to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with finding a product that was very natural yet also helped with reducing the aging properties of my skin.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Something like this that actually works at this low of a price is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter, Maddie has even been using it!</li>
            <li> first issue is simply a vitamin C issue:  </li>
            <li> This serum (NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum) was my third one I tried (because hey, i keep reading and hearing so much about vitamin C!).</li>
            <li> So soft!</li>
            <li> This makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li> I’ve tried several Vitamin C Serums and this is the first that doesn’t leave my face greasy.  </li>
            <li> As I get older my face has been really starting to show some real wear and tare as I approach fifty.</li>
            <li> I have always heard that Vitamin C is very good for your skin and at one local clinic there were a lot of very expensive products I would buy and use that did work very well.</li>
            <li> It has definitely made a positive difference in her appearance.</li>
            <li> For the past 10-15 years, I have not aged as much as most other woman, most people think that I am about 10 years younger than my age.</li>
            <li> I skeptically tried this product because I have been looking for something new to try with not a lot of good results.</li>
            <li> It looked brighter, pores smaller, lines less prominent.  </li>
            <li> A coworker asked me the other day if I was pregnant because she thought my skin looked &amp;</li>
            <li> It has triple action Vitamin C serum with natural antioxidant that helps your skin stay young.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something to revitalize and clear your skin then</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s 52 yrs old.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so even tho</li>
            <li> I can promise my skin glows naturally.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> It is made of all natural ingredients as well, which is always a plus in my book.</li>
            <li> lotion.&lt;br /&gt;there is no trouble to my skin</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in her beauty</li>
            <li> It is triple action.  </li>
            <li> I never knew how old I was looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month so far, and the results are clear.</li>
            <li> My husband has commented about his young looking wife and now when I wear makeup I am not trying to cover-up my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> but lately, I have switched to using Vitamin C serum and noticed that it is easier on my skin than Retina while getting better</li>
            <li> I am 57 year young Caucasian woman</li>
            <li> I have tried everything natural and organic out there.</li>
            <li> My skin looks like its old self  NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> I am 34 years old.</li>
            <li> Make it part of your routine because vitamin c is vital to our bodies.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m on the fence.  </li>
            <li> I use it directly on my problem areas after I exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li> the overall look and consistency is much firmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a guy looking for something to get your old lady; buy this</li>
            <li> I really do look younger than I did a week ago when I started using it.</li>
            <li> Replenish your skin with Vitamin C Serum as early as 2-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li> I felt very refreshed especially after adding this to my face and under my eyes!  </li>
            <li> I am 30 years old, so I guess I have just started the \\&quot;aging\\&quot; process.</li>
            <li> the troublesome parts around my eyes look better and everyday I fell and look younger.</li>
            <li> I have been using NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum for a few months now, I love how it&#x27;s a topical vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> To soon to tell about how it will work on my face overall, but having smaller pores is worth 5 stars.    </li>
            <li> The serum allows us to be youthful, healthy and to have the skin we had when we were younger before the sun and other pollutants left its toll.</li>
            <li> After three days or so my fingers glided over my cheeks smoothly and there were fewer dry noticeable dry patches on the forehead.</li>
            <li> I have large pores, and they are still large but definitely less noticeable than before.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for regular use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended as an addition to your current moisturizing routine.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m only giving the product 4 stars because my skin is quite dry, and it took a while for my moisturizer to take effect in battling this powerful agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This Irish Girl burns with 100 SPF on, so I have to be super careful to remember not to use it on days I work in my garden.  </li>
            <li> My skin is even and smooth, no more zits and bumps.  </li>
            <li> My skin came back to normal in record time.</li>
            <li> At first it was rough butan.</li>
            <li> I have dark spots and the laugh lines that I had to get rid of.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m going to put on my NEW pair of BLUE Chuck Taylors and HIT THE TOWN..!</li>
            <li> What are the chances that all 5 new reviews were from men on the same day.  </li>
            <li> I have always had issues with dry skin for years, and NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum has really given my face the moisture it deserves.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend using this to anybody I can who wants to look and feel younger!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any major results.</li>
            <li> As I grow older, I find myself competing with younger guys for the same customers.  </li>
            <li> Hard to write a review here because I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in my skin, but I don&#x27;t see any age spots or deeper wrinkles, either.</li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> a general health perspective</li>
            <li> It made me feel self conscious since my face always looked damp as if I am constantly sweating.  </li>
            <li> With this product you can get that young softer smoother skin back.  </li>
            <li> I have people falling back when i tell them i am 38 years old.</li>
            <li> This product contains several natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> All instructions are concise and simple to follow.</li>
            <li> This serum has helped to replenish the natural look of my skin and my aging spots are starting to fade.</li>
            <li> Saw results sooner than I expected and the fine lines around my eyes look less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Not only has it lightened up the dark spots under my eyes but have gotten rid of my laugh</li>
            <li> I tried every kind of lotion you could imagine- topicals, butters, specialized treatments, expensive Bath&amp;Body works &#x27;miracle creams&#x27;...</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin has responded in just a few weeks by looking less tired, and more youthful.</li>
            <li> This product comes in a handy little dropper bottle so a little can potentially go a long way to keeping skin soft and younger looking.  </li>
            <li> I also feel that my skin is much more firm and less sagging</li>
            <li> I used them for years until I became pregnant and got too lazy to drive to that clinic.</li>
            <li> So i developed dark circles around my eyes that made me look older and have tried some things that did not work.</li>
            <li> The smell of the serum is nice too, and most products like this smell horrible.</li>
            <li> My dad confirmed it, he swears she looks at least 10 younger!</li>
            <li> She sent me a couple pictures of my uncles freshly renewed skin, shocked to see him looking better than her.</li>
            <li> I am a 36-yr old male with obvious wrinkles and dry/dull complexion.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this serum would work any better than the tons of others I had tried, but soon after using it, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This product did not dry my skin nor did it feel oily.  </li>
            <li> Will use rest of bottle - not bad, just not seeing same benefits as usual.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit, at first, I was a little apprehensive given the price.</li>
            <li> In just a couple of weeks I see a very noticeable difference in the lines and dark spot.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that could lighten some of the dark spots that I have under my eyes and after two weeks I can tell a real difference.</li>
            <li> i actually bought this for my mom for her birthday recently, i know it sounds kind of lame</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that it wasn&#x27;t harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am pretty skeptical of anti-aging products, but I had heard some good things about NuNutrients and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a few weeks now, and I have seriously noticed a positive difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Having tried a variety of facials and even chemical peels I have now found this new product ‘’Nu Nutrients Vitamin C Serum’’, that gives me the satisfaction that I so longed for in easing the dry nature of my facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am left feeling less wrinkled and with less fine lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 months and the texture of my skin has really improved, a lot less crepey.</li>
            <li> My face is a lot less red and my skin tone has really evened out.  </li>
            <li> but I had too as I received a watery gel with a slight medicated smell and after finishing the bottle couldn&#x27;t sincerely notice any improvement at all on the slight blemishes I have due to sun exposure this summer</li>
            <li> Any of you other &#x27;burning state dwellers&#x27; out there in Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, ect...</li>
            <li> My cheeks became a little pink but that disappeared a minute or so later as the serum was  absorbed by my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was also frowning a lot less, than I do normally.</li>
            <li> I never thought such a small amount could do so much for my skin.</li>
            <li> Between all the women in my family and myself, I’ve spent countless amounts of money on different anti-aging skin-care products which did absolutely nothing, but waste my time and money.</li>
            <li> After seven days I noticed less tightness around the cheeks and the mouth area, and for the last few days I have noticed that I am using less tinted moisturizer and my fingers are gliding smoothly over my face.</li>
            <li> In less than two weeks it chnaged my skin conditions completely.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I forget to moisturize my skin after using this serum which occasionally causes my skin to get dry.</li>
            <li> I recommend using a moisturizer as well so that your skin, especially in the winter climates, doesn&#x27;t dry out or flake.</li>
            <li> I also have been getting red patches of dry skin on my face this winter, and this product helped soothe and heal them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged man, recently divorced.  </li>
            <li> The last Vitamin C serum I purchased was too harsh and burned my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> EXCEPT for a few unsightly red, scaly patches I developed.  </li>
            <li> I was sort of expecting the same thing with this, but was pleasantly surprised after a few days of using it.</li>
            <li> It only took a couple of weeks for me to really notice the effects: my skin felt smoother and less tight, dry patches went away, the lines in my forehead and eyes eased up.  </li>
            <li> but shes been really taking it hard that she has been developing wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Hard to say if it was really working or not.  </li>
            <li> I will admit I was a little skeptical, especially when I saw how many five star reviews there were.  </li>
            <li> but I did not think the mediocre results justified the price.</li>
            <li> I thought I long outgrew this problem - have improved.</li>
            <li> It has a long shelf life (12 months) and is made in the USA and is FDA approved.</li>
            <li> and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this well in a long time.  </li>
            <li> For a long time I have been searching for a product that won&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> Not only that, my wrinkles no longer looked like I&#x27;ve spent years under the sun without SPF, squinting into the horizon.</li>
            <li> It also has a long shelf life, but I can&#x27;t imagine keeping it that long.  </li>
            <li> You apply it directly to your face in those trouble areas, once a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other anti-aging products in the past that have felt heavy and seemed like a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It also lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li> After using it for a little under a month, we saw a big difference in the appearance of her skin prior to taking the serum.</li>
            <li> The lines make me look older and it can be hard sometimes covering them up with make-up.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have tried numerous products such as various forms of cocoa butter, shea butter, and aloe vera products to aid my dry and cracked skin.</li>
            <li> The serum left my face very wet and for some reason my skin would not absorb it.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> My face is no longer dry and</li>
            <li> Our mutual problem has always been that anti-aging mixtures usually dry our skin out.</li>
            <li> Because it didn&#x27;t dry my face out, I kept using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smoother and not as dry.</li>
            <li> but as soon as it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> MY skin used to be wrinkly and dry looking no matter what lotion I would use, this serum helps moisturize and strengthen your skin to look rejuvenated and youthful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is clear, and no more potholes for pores.</li>
            <li> I have trouble sleeping, so I barely get any sleep.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day with a facial oil, and I guess it&#x27;s just the combination of ingredients that has calmed my skin down.  </li>
            <li> I had wrinkles and some black spots around my upper cheek area</li>
            <li> Maybe its something hereditary- not sure, but it has made us pretty wary new products.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want to look a little bit younger?</li>
            <li> Of course, I hope it only stops working when the dark baggy circles stop being there at all!</li>
            <li> this product not only makes up the deficiency of Vitamin C but also decreases spots and freckles on our skin.&lt;br /&gt;The NuNutrient Vitamin C serum will start giving you results within as little as two to three weeks.</li>
            <li> but you only use a little at a time</li>
            <li> I had been having some real dry skin problems and nothing was working.</li>
            <li> Now, my skin looks at least ten years younger.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see if my review here suddenly becomes \\&quot;unhelpful\\&quot; by a massive number of people like the negative teeth whitening reviews did.</li>
            <li> As I expected with vitamin C, after using this serum, my skin does look healthier.  </li>
            <li> Some of the red, blotchy spots and even some of the trouble areas where I tend to get whiteheads -</li>
            <li> After my initial review, all of the newest reviews were deleted within a few days.  </li>
            <li> Not normally a serum user as all the other serum I tried all either too oily and just don&#x27;t do the work.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days now</li>
            <li> No matter what I do, at the end of the day, those 12 hours I&#x27;ve been up, turn into 12 years I&#x27;ve aged.</li>
            <li> and I had been carefully using the skin brightening treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since the inclusion of this serum into my everyday facial regimen, I have no worries about how the sun may effect my appearance when it&#x27;s time to workout and compete.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful what I put on my face.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I am getting all the good stuff out of facials and peels without spending the outrageous costs of both of those services or having a red face for days after.</li>
            <li> It definitely rejuvenates tired, old skin.</li>
            <li> my skin is exposed to conditions that&#x27;ll dry my skin out and eventually that&#x27;ll have me with wrinkles and/or pale and dry skin if I&#x27;m not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t have an extreme amount</li>
            <li> And it doesnt leave that oily feeling like lotion and other products, yes.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical of NuNutrients</li>
            <li> I have tried other vitamin serums before.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t purchase again due to the fact the product didn&#x27;t leave an impression on me.</li>
            <li> When a small drop is placed on the skin, instantly with one application, you will feel the difference of smoother and firmer looking skin.</li>
            <li> And I live in chicago which makes it even worse.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when using this product at first; I do not typically buy into “Anti-aging” products, because I am both not entirely ready for them nor do I usually believe in their authenticity.  </li>
            <li> My skin is no longer dull and actually \\&quot;glow\\&quot; (according to my mom).  </li>
            <li> may be on the younger side, but I have learned the hard way that you have to take care of your skin.  </li>
            <li> but shes actually in her late 40&#x27;s if she does anything</li>
            <li> I have always had dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, this product is slowly climbing to one of my favorites, please believe it will definitely be kept in stock.</li>
            <li> Hands down, I give it a month maybe 2</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum is extremely rejuvenating!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was skeptical ordering the product because I was not sure if it was going to work bit it seems like from my results i have made a very smart purchase.</li>
            <li> I think that people with less sensitivity probably wouldn&#x27;t feel anything when they applied the NuNutrients serum.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the previous poster who said something is fishy about the reviews for this product...</li>
            <li> , i am half black and half indian and my face is getting whiter</li>
            <li> I usually get a break out or dry skin, but this product did its job without any irritation at all!  </li>
            <li> The lines under my eyes seem to be fading away and the lines on my forehead are definitely less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Visible results in less than 2 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> They seem to be less noticeable and fading.</li>
            <li> I saw results in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It does leave a slight tightening feeling when it dries</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;ve worked or only worked to a small degree.</li>
            <li> I previously was spending $120.</li>
            <li> This product did wonders on my face, my face felt smoother, and firmer, and I noticed that my crows feet became less visible.</li>
            <li> My skin was brighter and my face in general looked less tired.  </li>
            <li> I also decided to use this on my arms because of the uneven dark spots I have from scarring.  </li>
            <li> With other serums, they feel very thin to the touch, but because I have sensitive and drier skin, once I put them on, they made me feel like my skin was aging and tight (which isn&#x27;t what you want from an anti-aging serum).&lt;br</li>
            <li> A lot of other serums that I&#x27;ve tried like this were too harsh and left my skin even worse off than when I started.</li>
            <li> It took my skin a little longer to show the effects, about 5 weeks, though they were substantial.</li>
            <li> As I checked around, there isn&#x27;t any other \\&quot;NuNutrient\\&quot; on the web, and the only other products sold by this store are teeth whitening strips that are also accused of having fake reviews.</li>
            <li> Let talk a little bit about living in AZ, the sun, and its effects shall we?</li>
            <li> This little bottle works wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li> but I noticed them dissolving away in as little as two weeks.</li>
            <li> It helped to brighten up my eyes by getting rid of those little mini lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> We teased him about his leathery face all the time, so I grabbed one of these for his birthday to up the ante a little.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried toners and a few masques.</li>
            <li> You will begin to see the results in a few days of use.</li>
            <li> I heard a few friends talk about this product and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I am tempted I try to avoid peels and heavy scrubs, and I worry that I miss out on the clarifying aspects of those products.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend brought this home and has been using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> Everyday night i use this</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an anti-aging product that was made here in the U.S. and didn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin (or make me breakout).</li>
            <li> It even built up my everyday confidence.</li>
            <li> but once we started using it very much disliked it.  </li>
            <li> I got results about two months of everyday treatment.  </li>
            <li> Found it l, bought it, applied it and in a few days I can see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t feel harsh or abrasive when</li>
            <li> few weeks passed, and I got a call from my aunt.</li>
            <li> NuNutrients Vitamin C Serium has saved my skin from getting the dry, cracked patches I generally get in the cold.  </li>
            <li> less blemishes!</li>
            <li> For the past couple of years I have been on the swim team and my face was showing little signs of wrinkles from the sun.</li>
            <li> I started showing results in as little as 2 1/2 weeks!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Plus, unlike with other products, I haven&#x27;t had any issue with breakouts or with my skin getting that waxy feeling I hate so much.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how vibrant I felt just after a few days of using the serum.  </li>
            <li> I read the few negative reviews of this product</li>
            <li> now I can laugh and not have to worry of those annoying laugh-lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In all the years of expensive products, I have not seen such an improvement... ever.</li>
            <li> firm skin&#x3D; HELLO!</li>
            <li> Put it on every night into a small towel and rub it in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month now, not sure if its working or not.  </li>
            <li> I have always been really skeptical about so-called &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; products, but this one is definitely an exception to the rule.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was skeptical about using the product because I wasn&#x27;t concerned about the aging of my skin but went along with using it anyway because it mentioned its ability to replenish the loss of Vitamin C in the body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small container</li>
            <li> It is not so thin it runs out of my hand, and not super thick like a moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li> This NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum was recommended by a friend as I do feel my face is a bit dull these days.</li>
            <li> I was tired of wasting money on countless products that in the end... failed.</li>
            <li> dislike writing negative review</li>
            <li> As we age our skin loses Vitamin C and this allows us to replenish it.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it gets 5 stars from me and at least 10 from everyone</li>
            <li> I guess you could call it the baby bear of serums:  Not too thick, not too</li>
            <li> As a woman who just turned 41, I have become desperate to stop these facial wrinkles and spots from getting any worse.  </li>
            <li> Seriously?  </li>
            <li> Immediate results, seriously.</li>
            <li> Between the dark spots and lines it can at times be very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not surprising that there was a bit of sensitivity after I applied the serum to my face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It took about 2 weeks, but I started to first see changes on my forehead which seems to have the worst spots from the sun.  </li>
            <li> It is about that time in my life where I have aging skin that is rapidly getting worse.</li>
            <li> She looks nicer, fresher...not as tired and worn out as before.</li>
            <li> The side effect is not so bad just a little skin flaking here and there .</li>
            <li> and she is officially addicted!</li>
            <li> My father, mother, and me all have terrible skin conditions, especially as we age.</li>
            <li> I am going through menopause and recently my face has been terribly congested with clogged pores and cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too expensive, so I figured i would give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed with beauty products.</li>
            <li> unfortunately I didn&#x27;t SEE that review until I&#x27;d already ordered the product.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to use products which contained therapeutic amounts of vitamin C. NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t look tired anymore!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does not appear to be working at all.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom, who was unhappy with her appearance...</li>
            <li> Some products like this have some nasty small to it and this one didn&#x27;t have any rank odor to it.</li>
            <li> I went on vacation and got a bad sunburn.</li>
            <li> I have really bad acne scars.</li>
            <li> but those lines were ugly...</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re sick of spending a lot of money on products that don&#x27;t work, give this serum a shot.</li>
            <li> If people like this company are allowed to manipulate the system and deceive customers, then product reviews become worthless.</li>
            <li> Ever since I was a teenager, or perhaps even before, I had horrible acne and even did a stint with Accutane at one point.</li>
            <li> No breakouts or anything nasty happened to face either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hereditarily, I have dreadful skin.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This serum is well worth your money!  It is awesome!  I have been using it for 3 weeks now and my pores on my cheeks and nose have closed tremendously!!  I can go without makeup if I want to for quick runs to the store.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> I’ve used scrubs. I’ve tried toners and a few masques. But this is my first experience with a serum. Ta da! So the good news is that I don’t really have many wrinkles and wasn’t sure this would be very useful but hey I’m always up for trying anything that will help in the beauty department. Wow. In two days I noticed that my skin was so much softer. And within a week it had a healthy glow that it never had before. Even got a few comments about how nice my skin looked. Which also doesn’t happen. Bottom line I am now a full time serum user!</li>
            <li> I have only been using the serum for about two weeks, and already I see a difference. I liked it right away since it goes on smooth (you only use a little), and I am beginning to like it more and more! A coworker asked me the other day if I was pregnant because she thought my skin looked &amp;#34;radiant.&amp;#34; Wow! I have large pores, and they are still large but definitely less noticeable than before. Many benefits with this product. I love it.</li>
            <li> A Bit of Sensitivity...and then Supple Skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the passage of age, I&#x27;ve gotten some wrinkles.  My husband teases me and keeps reminding me that it&#x27;s a fact of life.  Maybe it is but I&#x27;m sure going to give it my all in slowly down the process!  My skin tone is fair and, to be honest, quite sensitive so it&#x27;s not surprising that there was a bit of sensitivity after I applied the serum to my face.  My cheeks became a little pink but that disappeared a minute or so later as the serum was  absorbed by my skin.  I think that people with less sensitivity probably wouldn&#x27;t feel anything when they applied the NuNutrients serum.  As I said, though, the pinkness goes away after a minute or two and my skin was left feeling nice and smooth.  Also, because the serum is absorbed so quickly into my skin, I prefer to apply it under my makeup.  It seems to help my makeup set better because there isn&#x27;t that greasy feel that you get after using some of the other wrinkle creams.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product and boy I am glad he did. It really works and is an inviting smell to it too! This is the safest way to attend to my skin and its health.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my aunt, who has been looking for an anti-aging serum for quite some time new. After three weeks or so, she called me up and told me how much firmer and lifted her skin was looking, and that it was a great improvement on her pores. She uses it daily and says that she will even continue to purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother-in-law to try and she is officially addicted! She is constantly raving about it and honestly I can see a big difference. Definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I&#x27;M IN A STATE OF SHOCK...&amp;#34;  This really works..!! I keep wondering if I&#x27;m imagining things... Now I&#x27;m going to put on my NEW pair of BLUE Chuck Taylors and HIT THE TOWN..! Sweet..!</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes my skin smoother, lines less visible.</li>
            <li> i actually bought this for my mom for her birthday recently, i know it sounds kind of lame but shes been really taking it hard that she has been developing wrinkles. i ended up asking a woman at the gym who i thought was in her 30&#x27;s but shes actually in her late 40&#x27;s if she does anything and she recommend this Vitamin C Serum, my mom started using it and she loves it so much, shes brighter, and looks 5 years younger, i&#x27;m so glad i could make her happy with this!</li>
            <li> good product, i use in combo with the Hydro Boost from Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 6 weeks and I absolutely love it! It gives my skin a gorgeous glow without being all oily, my dark spots are finally fading, and my face feels as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Coming back for my second bottle.  Really makes a difference and is improving my Eczema.  My face is a lot less red and my skin tone has really evened out.  I use 2X per day (morning and night) and follow up with a good moisturizer for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a lot of issues with my skin. Ever since I was a teenager, or perhaps even before, I had horrible acne and even did a stint with Accutane at one point. I&#x27;ve also been to a lot of facial places trying to get my skin to a better place. I have always heard that Vitamin C is very good for your skin and at one local clinic there were a lot of very expensive products I would buy and use that did work very well. I used them for years until I became pregnant and got too lazy to drive to that clinic. I am a fan of this brand so I decided to give this a try seeing that it had Vitamin C and it really does make my skin look and feel great. And the price is so much better than what I&#x27;m used to paying !</li>
            <li> This anti-aging serum is perfect for a younger looking skin. It has triple action Vitamin C serum with natural antioxidant that helps your skin stay young. What I like about this product is that it has a 12 month shelf life and is an anti-wrinkle, anti-aging Vitamin C serum. You will begin to see the results in a few days of use. My friends have also bought this product after they saw the results in me and they are also very happy that they bought this product. This is by-far the best anti-aging product that I have used and I am sure that I will be using this product for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> NuNutrients Age Defying Serum contains is a &amp;#34;triple action&amp;#34; blend of ingredients that contains Vitamin C as well as powerful antioxidants.  This anti-wrinkle, anti-aging serum helps to improve the tone and softness of your skin by fighting wrinkles, toning and firming the skin, and increasing collagen production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NuNutrients should be applied in both the am and pm. Apply the serum after toner, but before your moisturizer.  The serum is easy to apply thanks to the handy dropper top on the bottle. Just a drop or two is enough to cover my face.  NuNutrients has the perfect consistency, which I love! I always appreciate a serum that is nice and thick, and doesn&#x27;t drip off my fingers before it makes it to my face. NuNutrients absorbs into my skin quickly and leaves my skin feeling nice and soft.  It does not leave my skin with any sticky feeling.  I would recommend this serum to anyone looking for a quality Vitamin C Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for sharing my honest opinion of the product. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li> I love this serum so much! My skin looks so much more youthful and vibrant and so many of my laugh lines have completely vanished! It uses antioxidants and Vitamin C to replenish the elasticity of your skin which in turn removes the wrinkles. Best of all, it feels and smells great on the skin and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is even softer than it was before I started using this. It also lasts a really long time! One bottle lasted me about 3 months and I will certainly be purchasing another!</li>
            <li> My father, mother, and me all have terrible skin conditions, especially as we age. It is about that time in my life where I have aging skin that is rapidly getting worse. I heard a few friends talk about this product and decided to try it. I knew what to look for, and realized this is what I needed. I couldn&#x27;t be more happier with my purchase! In less than two weeks it chnaged my skin conditions completely. My pores were clearing and my skin was becoming more smooth and even toned. My skin, like my parents skin (who have now started using it) has been clearing an the 3 of us need to order new bottles soon. Something like this that actually works at this low of a price is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> My mom was complaining some about the wrinkles around her eyes so I decided to buy something for her. She doesn&#x27;t have an extreme amount but of course with age you get some. I bought this one and it has been greatly improving. I didn&#x27;t expect just a new face but it&#x27;s been working great.</li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum worked great for me. I have read that Nu Nutrients is a good company that people seem to like. I was happy with the way the skin around my eyes felt, softer and more smooth. I do plan on purchasing it again, Id recommend it also, great price!</li>
            <li> My skin is clear and bright after using this product.  Am on my second bottle!</li>
            <li> I am going through menopause and recently my face has been terribly congested with clogged pores and cystic acne.  I use excellent cleaning and moisturizng products on my face and have been very careful to keep my face clean, but no matter what I used I still kept breaking out in hideous bumps and zits all over my face.  I bought this based on the reviews, hoping it might help and I am still reeling in shock...within 3 days my acne is just about gone.  My pores are no longer clogged and my skin is glowing again.  My skin is even and smooth, no more zits and bumps.  I use it twice a day with a facial oil, and I guess it&#x27;s just the combination of ingredients that has calmed my skin down.  I can&#x27;t say enough about it.  It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.  I read the few negative reviews of this product and I&#x27;m wondering what the person who wrote them was using, because frankly, I can&#x27;t imagine this not working for anyone.</li>
            <li> After I discovered that I like the brand NuNutrients by trying another skin product, I bought this to add to my skin care. Although, it took some time to see results, I like it because it does help brighten my skin. Sometimes I forget to moisturize my skin after using this serum which occasionally causes my skin to get dry. But as long as I do both, my skin looks good! Another thing that I have learned is how vitamin C is not only great for inside health but outside health too.</li>
            <li> I went on vacation and got a bad sunburn. After the skin peeled, white sunspots remained and I needed something to help my skin heal. This product which contains vitamin C, an essential nutrient to help maintain a healthy,  radiant skin did the job. My skin came back to normal in record time.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want to look a little bit younger? I&#x27;m a middle aged man, recently divorced.  I&#x27;ve put some wear and tear on my body.  I&#x27;m not one to walk into a beauty store and look around for products, so it was nice that i could order this online.  It&#x27;s not too expensive, so I figured i would give it a shot.  I&#x27;m pretty surprised! You can really tell the difference after only using it a few days.  I&#x27;m hoping the results stick, but only time will tell.  So far so good!</li>
            <li> The last Vitamin C serum I purchased was too harsh and burned my sensitive skin. I am happy to say that I got better results with this product. This vitamin C serum was very effective for my dark spots and it improved the rough texture of my skin. I’ve added this serum to my nightly regimen.</li>
            <li> I had been having some real dry skin problems and nothing was working. On the recommendations of some friends, I tried this product. It really worked and changed the texture if my skin.</li>
            <li> I have always had dark circles under my eyes. For years I didn&#x27;t get enough sleep and generally abused my own body. At some point I cleaned up my health and started taking much better care of myself, but the dark baggy circles persisted. I&#x27;ve been using NuNutrients for a couple of months now and the difference is certainly noticeable. The applications are easy and feel fine, and the bags under my eyes have gotten smaller. I&#x27;m going to continue using this Vitamin C Serum until it stops working. Of course, I hope it only stops working when the dark baggy circles stop being there at all! We will see. So far, this product has been a big success and I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom, who was unhappy with her appearance...she&#x27;s 52 yrs old. She&#x27;s been using it about a month now and looks have certainly improved! She looks nicer, fresher...not as tired and worn out as before. She&#x27;s tried quite a few different things and so far, this has had the best performance of anything she&#x27;s tried in the past.</li>
            <li> My mother loves this stuff!!! After hearing about it from a friend she tried it and loves it. Her favorite part besides the obvious effects it has on her young looking skin is its shelf life. 12 months! That&#x27;s a lot longer than a lot of creams and lotions so she doesn&#x27;t feel like she is wasting money!!!</li>
            <li> I love the power of vitamin C!!!  As I expected with vitamin C, after using this serum, my skin does look healthier.  The fine lines I now have in my 40s don&#x27;t seem as visible anymore.  My skin feels tighter yet still smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up until now, I had been spending $100 and up on Estee Lauder&#x27;s anti-aging night serum, but I got similar or better results with NuiNutrients.  I plan to continue with NuNutrients--just as good but a lot less money.</li>
            <li> I have decided that of all of the products I have used to preserve the health of my skin, this (and sunscreen) are completely worth the financial investment.</li>
            <li> Goes on very nice. It is thicker and is not thin as water like others. Still waiting to see if any results occur.</li>
            <li> I have used NuNutrients Vitamin C for a month now and I have to say that my quest for finding a wrinkle solution has come to end. Thank god! I was tired of wasting money on countless products that in the end... failed. This is NOT one of them. Thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> Love that it has three types of vit. C, as most C products don&#x27;t absorb into the dermis, this one does. I use this with hyaluronic acid serum, and love the combo, noticing a difference already, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the best. I like to alternate products on my face. This is really good  vitamin c quick results</li>
            <li> Nice product for reducing wrinkles and retaining the moisture and youthful look.  Apply in the morning after you put moisturizer on and off you go for the day.  It took a couple of weeks for me to notice the lines were fading.  Yeah.  Send more please.</li>
            <li> Brightened my skin so much. Reduced my fine lines. Really works. I love it, I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle. A little goes a long way. Not greasy at all. Goes on smooth and spread easily. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> As I get older my face has been really starting to show some real wear and tare as I approach fifty. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different products but always come back to NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum. It helps my skin not only look better, but also feel better. I&#x27;m dating someone younger than me, so I&#x27;m more sensitive about my appearance now, but this stuff has given me back my confidence. I look better, I feel better, and more importantly I&#x27;m happier because of it. My 15 year old daughter, Maddie has even been using it! Pick some up, it&#x27;s so great.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with beauty products. I subscribe to 4 different beauty boxes (birchbox, ipsy, etc) and I always make my preferences anti-aging products. I have a natural style, so to me, the best investment is in keeping what you&#x27;ve got naturally (your skin) in top condition, instead of spending money on the best purse or shoes. NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum is one of my absolute FAVORITES. I have sensitive skin, so even tho I am tempted I try to avoid peels and heavy scrubs, and I worry that I miss out on the clarifying aspects of those products. NuNutrients is my salvation! I feel like I am getting all the good stuff out of facials and peels without spending the outrageous costs of both of those services or having a red face for days after. Love and recommend this serum!</li>
            <li> Hands down, I give it a month maybe 2 and you can feel the difference in your skin. It looks and feel softer than what you expect. I can promise my skin glows naturally. At first it was rough butan. And it doesnt leave that oily feeling like lotion and other products, yes. Yes and yes!</li>
            <li> Skin is getting better.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to both women and men who care about their skincare needs. I have tried several vitamin c serums in recent years. I love them! I recently had the opportunity to switch to NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum - Anti-Aging Serum. I love the results I am achieving. My skin has more clarity, it&#x27;s softer, lines have been reduced, and some have gone away. My face and neck are saying thank you. The serum is easy to use, lasts a long time, and is affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I openly admit that I worry about products and how they are manufactured. I love that the product is produced in an FDA certified facility. This gives me confidence in its production and I know that I am using a clean and healthy product on my skin.  Hooray to the vitamin c serum for giving me a way to feed my skin from the outside in!</li>
            <li> As a woman who just turned 41, I have become desperate to stop these facial wrinkles and spots from getting any worse.  I am pretty skeptical of anti-aging products, but I had heard some good things about NuNutrients and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a few weeks now, and I have seriously noticed a positive difference in my skin.  My fine lines are not as noticeable.  My skin looks and feels more supple.  I did not experience any dryness or flaking.  I even had multiple darkened spots that seem lighter too.  I&#x27;m glad I bought NuNutrients and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> The is a really good product. My skin looks like I&#x27;m in my 20s again and it&#x27;s soft to the touch. Me being who I  am I really to a leap of faith on this but I&#x27;m happy that I did. The NuNutrients really works and you can feel it working that&#x27;s what made me believe in this. I use palmers lotion and I add 4 drops to it and mixed it in and it feels wonder and it works wonder .</li>
            <li> My girlfriend brought this home and has been using it for a few months. It has definitely made a positive difference in her appearance. Her face is softer and the fine lines around her eyes seem to be clearing up. She&#x27;s very happy that she&#x27;s found something that works and swears by it and even bought a bottle for my mother, who also is very pleased with her results.</li>
            <li> Love the price and love the product...what can I say? Saw results sooner than I expected and the fine lines around my eyes look less noticeable. I am pleased with the results and at my age I need something to help with lines and skin smoothing. Will keep using!</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try after using NuNutrients Cucumber Eye Cream and loving the results. Just like their other products, this has a light scent and perfect consistency. After using this cream every day for 10 days, I definitely noticed an improvement in the overall tone of my skin. Some of the red, blotchy spots and even some of the trouble areas where I tend to get whiteheads - I thought I long outgrew this problem - have improved. Unlike Vitamin E serums, this is not meant to be a moisturizer, but it certainly helps diminish the effects of aging and environmental toxins, including unfiltered tap water, which can have damaging effects on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have to say that these NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum is one of the best! It definitely rejuvenates tired, old skin. I have been using it for over a month now, and have been very pleased with the results! It is made of all natural ingredients as well, which is always a plus in my book. Will definitely be my go-to product from now on!</li>
            <li> It took my skin a little longer to show the effects, about 5 weeks, though they were substantial. I feel like I have skin like a newborn ;) I use this stuff after my toner and before I moisturize and love it. To me it&#x27;s an obvious solution, we take extra vitamin c when we are not feeling well, so why not apply it to our skin when it is exposed daily to a mirage of chemicals and constant UV rays (I am outside a lot). I like the product a lot, and the company is super helpful, with great customer service. Why use something else?</li>
            <li> Now that I am almost 2 years into my 40&#x27;s, my face was starting to show it. I have a prominent dark spot under my eye and the crows have made their trek across my face! I needed to find something to add to my new anti aging arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum! In just a couple of weeks I see a very noticeable difference in the lines and dark spot. I am very picky about what I put on my face, especially now that I&#x27;m older and my skin is more sensitive. Vitamin C is something my body needs, and I am glad to have found something natural to help myself age gracefully!</li>
            <li> Love it! It firms the skin and shrinks lines &amp; wrinkles.  The best new product I have tried!</li>
            <li> Everyday night i use this ... mix with other wrinkle free lotion.&lt;br /&gt;there is no trouble to my skin and when i wake up next morning i feel more tension in my face.&lt;br /&gt;i have used only 2 weeks ... even though i can feel my face going brighter even it slow.&lt;br /&gt;i strongly recommend to use c-serum.</li>
            <li> I did not see any improvement.</li>
            <li> Shipping is so fast! I bought this for my older sister who&#x27;s feel that she isn&#x27;t looking that young anymore. I personally didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in her beauty but she felt amazing. Her confidence skyrocketed! I definitely think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this NuNutrients anti-aging serum. I love the way it goes on smoothly, and soaks right into my skin. I love the way my skin has responded in just a few weeks by looking less tired, and more youthful. I have trouble sleeping, so I barely get any sleep. The lack of sleep was evident every time I saw my reflection in the mirror. Now, my skin looks at least ten years younger. Therefore, I feel more confident when I walk out the door in the morning. I always have a smile on my face.</li>
            <li> I agree with the previous poster who said something is fishy about the reviews for this product...unfortunately I didn&#x27;t SEE that review until I&#x27;d already ordered the product.  The product is sticky and I didn&#x27;t see any changes in my skin for the two weeks I used it, EXCEPT for a few unsightly red, scaly patches I developed.  Definitely do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an anti-aging product that was made here in the U.S. and didn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin (or make me breakout). At first I was skeptical of NuNutrients but I gave it a shot because of its Vitamin C properties and the fact it was anti-aging and anti-wrinkle. I am so glad I tried it! Not only has it reduced the appearance of the most obvious lines and wrinkles on my face, it has also worked on the finer lines which can be trickier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, unlike with other products, I haven&#x27;t had any issue with breakouts or with my skin getting that waxy feeling I hate so much. With other serums, they feel very thin to the touch, but because I have sensitive and drier skin, once I put them on, they made me feel like my skin was aging and tight (which isn&#x27;t what you want from an anti-aging serum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real reason I highly recommend this is because it has made my skin look better overall. My face looks brighter and more vibrant than I can remember. I get told all the time how wonderful my skin tone is and how I have this &#x27;glow.&#x27; And my sun spots - GONE. I have even used it on sun spots on my hands and they held reduce their appearance as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re sick of spending a lot of money on products that don&#x27;t work, give this serum a shot. I started seeing results after a couple weeks, so it&#x27;s definitely worth adding to your beauty routine.</li>
            <li> It was reasonably priced. I will get back to you, if I see any results.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a try and was quite satisfied with the results after my purchase. I am in my forties and I started having age spots that I recently noticed so I began looking for remedies. I ordered the serum and saw the results very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and I am glad I gave it a try. I would not put anything on my skin except a vitamin and I was very content with my purchase. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin. And I live in chicago which makes it even worse. I had fine lines on my face. But after I started using this product, these lines started growing subtle&lt;br /&gt; I love the way my skin feels now. I would say this product has leveraged all the nutritional and antioxidant values of vitamin C. The product is light and easy to use. Will continue to use this in future.. :)</li>
            <li> First off, let me start with what I like about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I like that it is in an amber bottle with a glass straw.  Plastic leaches yucky toxins into products, and I don&#x27;t want those toxins absorbing in my skin when I apply the serum!  Thumbs up for glass!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I like the viscosity of this serum.  It is not so thin it runs out of my hand, and not super thick like a moisturizing cream.  I guess you could call it the baby bear of serums:  Not too thick, not too thin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It is triple action.  Anytime I can use one product instead of three, I am happy!  I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend on my beauty routine, so I like this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It has a 12 month shelf life, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it expiring if I use it sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It starts tightening skin upon application.  As it dries, you can feel and see a significant difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, For the things I wish were different:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first issue is simply a vitamin C issue:  Vitamin C makes you more sensitive to the sun.  This Irish Girl burns with 100 SPF on, so I have to be super careful to remember not to use it on days I work in my garden.  It&#x27;s that way with all C Serums, so there is nothing to do to prevent this, I am just pointing it out to prevent future sunburns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally think this serum is pricey at $35.  It works amazing, the price is more than fair especially since it works so well.  However, $35 is a splurge for me and not a price I can pay on a monthly basis.  We all have different budgets though, so I realize my needs are subjective to my budge and this may not be an issue at all for many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***********Disclaimer:  I received product in exchange for review.  All opinions stated are 100% honest and my exclusive opinion!*****</li>
            <li> Hard to write a review here because I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in my skin, but I don&#x27;t see any age spots or deeper wrinkles, either.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s I feel like I&#x27;m getting older. A friend suggested trying NuNutrients Vitamin C serum. I&#x27;m always sceptical about items such as this and didn&#x27;t expect much.&lt;br /&gt;A month after starting I was blown away with what NuNutrients Vitamin C serum did for me. The lines and wrinkles on my face became visably lighter. I also had some older scars that just dissapeared out right. Wow what a great product and Ive already ordered my next bottle.</li>
            <li> I used to make fun of my wife for using this product. Yea, jokes on me. She took me  to the bathroom and shined the light on my face and showed me the crows feet and some other stuff on my face I literally never noticed. I never knew how old I was looking. I asked her why this stuff and not the more expensive stuff? &amp;#34;You&#x27;ll see&amp;#34; was her answer. So I ordered my own and started to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;  I started to see my crows feet disappear halfway through my cycle. It even built up my everyday confidence. I was very impressed with the results I got from this product. I would definitely recommend using this to anybody I can who wants to look and feel younger!</li>
            <li> I was super close to buying this product based on all the glowing reviews, but the reviews just seemed a little too much like an advertisement instead of real people. Also, I kept wondering why so many 4-star reviews (instead of 5-stars), if this product is so amazing - and without any explanations from reviewers - which makes me believe someone didn&#x27;t want to be too obvious with too many 5-stars. As I checked around, there isn&#x27;t any other \\&quot;NuNutrient\\&quot; on the web, and the only other products sold by this store are teeth whitening strips that are also accused of having fake reviews. We&#x27;ll see if my review here suddenly becomes \\&quot;unhelpful\\&quot; by a massive number of people like the negative teeth whitening reviews did. Just beware and do your research!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update to my original review** 5/20/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I definitely don&#x27;t trust these reviews!!  After my initial review, all of the newest reviews were deleted within a few days.  And now, since my review, the newest reviews were all posted on May 16th - 5 MEN giving 5-star reviews all \\&quot;coincidentally\\&quot; on the same date.  Seriously?  What are the chances that all 5 new reviews were from men on the same day.  (Note, these reviews from men may mysteriously be deleted after my review posts....)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s another thing to notice - most all of the reviews for this product sound like someone&#x27;s real name (maybe to sound more realistic?), but they are not the Amazon verified \\&quot;real name\\&quot; that will show up next to a user name from Amazon.  Just an observation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, not trying to be the watchdog here, but I can&#x27;t stand deceptive practices such as falsifying reviews.  I&#x27;d imagine that many people, like myself, trust Amazon reviews when we are researching a product.  If people like this company are allowed to manipulate the system and deceive customers, then product reviews become worthless.</li>
            <li> Vitamin c is always a plus and this help exfoliate the skin and tighten where you have wrinkles at . The side effect is not so bad just a little skin flaking here and there . I would definetly keep using these .</li>
            <li> I love this product. It tightens pores but does not make my skin flake.</li>
            <li> Growing up I had to wear glasses ALOT! So i developed dark circles around my eyes that made me look older and have tried some things that did not work. They didn&#x27;t really lighten up the spots which are making me look older. So i was looking around for something that would work and low and behold I found NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum. Not only has it lightened up the dark spots under my eyes but have gotten rid of my laugh lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical ordering the product because I was not sure if it was going to work bit it seems like from my results i have made a very smart purchase. I have gotten compliments on how my skin is improving and have also recommended this product to friends of mine. this product has done absolute wonders for my skin. Would I recommend this product? You better believe I will!</li>
            <li> I did not wear sunglasses when I was younger and have many wrinkles around my eyes as a result.  This product really reduced the appearance and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I just got it last wk, yet have had several compliments on my skin.  feels very hydrated and I was looking for a vit. c day serum to use as sunblock, or along with a sunblock.</li>
            <li> Both my mom and I are always looking for serum to help tighten our skin and help prevent age and sun spots. Knowing this, my dad bought both of us a specific name brand serum which we were happy with but once we started using it very much disliked it.  My experience was not too great.  The serum left my face very wet and for some reason my skin would not absorb it.  It made me feel self conscious since my face always looked damp as if I am constantly sweating.  Once a comment was said about me looking sweating I knew it was time to stop using it. My mom had a similar experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best friend referred me to this Vitamin C Serum.  She let me try some of hers one and it really made me feel refreshed.  I went home and purchased it.  Once delivered I began using it.  It look away the fine lines by my eyes and helped fill in the wrinkles around my mouth.  I got results about two months of everyday treatment.  This serum feels so good on your skin!  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I have been using Vitamin C on my face for years. This is my favorite formulation of it. Results are noticeable within a month. Softer, smoother, glowing complexion.</li>
            <li> Let talk a little bit about living in AZ, the sun, and its effects shall we? HA! Any of you other &#x27;burning state dwellers&#x27; out there in Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, ect... like me, know full well the sun is NOT always our friend. I swear- I tried every kind of lotion you could imagine- topicals, butters, specialized treatments, expensive Bath&amp;Body works &#x27;miracle creams&#x27;... I was just about at my giving up point when I was sent this NuNutrients package from a family friend.&lt;br /&gt;LET ME TELL YOU! IM THRILLED! If I hadn&#x27;t asked family and friends for something that WORKS- I never would have found this Vitamin C Serum. Thank the Lord!! i can&#x27;t even see my crinkle wrinkles anymore! (crows feet) and I&#x27;ve been told by my husband and friends my face just glows now! Ive got color and I look healthy. I love it. Pretty certain I&#x27;ll be a customer of NuNutrients the rest of my life&#x3D;o)</li>
            <li> it gives me a nice glow but it is not helping with any scarring but it is just making my face lighter, i am half black and half indian and my face is getting whiter</li>
            <li> I bought this for my aunt and was so surprised at how amazing (and quick) it worked! She has been looking for an anti-aging product that wouldn&#x27;t harm her skin and this proved to be the perfect one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She particularly liked the fact that there were no harsh scents. It&#x27;s been a month so far, and the results are clear. Smoother skin and color correction. She is extremely happy and so am I!</li>
            <li> Nunutrients helps your face maintain healthy and beautiful  resilient skin. When you are young, your skin is full of Vitamin C but as you age, your skin will naturally lose this nutrient.  With this product you can get that young softer smoother skin back.  specifically  in your favor with problem areas. The Vitamin C Serum will absorb directly into your skin, and treat age spots, wrinkles and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;  we all know that when you age you get wrinkles as well as spots. Apply Vitamin C once a day  and all your troubles will go away.  It worked for me after a couple of weeks. I would how ever use an exfolliant on your skin. Vitamin C can cause some mild dryness or flaking, so if you have this issue, be sure to use a moisturizer after using the Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this product to see if it would work. I had been looking for an anti aging product to help remove my scars. I have really bad acne scars. Most products that I purchase don&#x27;t really work or take way toooo long to work. I was surprised at how quickly my acne scars started to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not too sure, but I assume it&#x27;s the vitmain c that helped fade my scars. I was always told vitamin k works to fade scars, but if looks like vitamin c is the winner. It took me 3 weeks to start seeing results. Just goes to show you never know what&#x27;s going to work until you try it.</li>
            <li> So I bought this serum as a recommendation from s friend. I had been looking for a serum to help me with my skin problems. I wanted something that would help with the wrinkles that are coming in by my eyes and mouth. I tried some different soaps that just broke my face out with bumps and red spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend saw that I was fed up with my results and recommended me NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum. The first thing I noticed was that it wasn&#x27;t harsh on my skin. I noticed the lines on my face started to disappear in about 5 weeks. And my skin overall felt better!</li>
            <li> My daughter recently gave me a bottle of NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum for my birthday and I am amazed at the wonderful results I have received in a short amount of time. I was confident to try this product because of the Vitamin C content and I am well aware of the benefits to your skin from this nutrient that is vital to our overall good health. My skin is much brighter, I have a more even complexion and many of my numerous frown lines are almost invisible. My lips use to have several laugh-lines...well I love to laugh but those lines were ugly...now I can laugh and not have to worry of those annoying laugh-lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the troublesome parts around my eyes look better and everyday I fell and look younger. My husband has commented about his young looking wife and now when I wear makeup I am not trying to cover-up my wrinkles. This year I am looking forward to my birthday instead of dreading getting another year older. Another added feature of this product is it ability to increase the production of Collagen, which is something else will lose as we get older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting ready to purchase a second bottle of this awesome anti-aging serum and I am looking forward to continued results</li>
            <li> I am a middle age woman who cares a lot about her skin. For the past 10-15 years, I have not aged as much as most other woman, most people think that I am about 10 years younger than my age. And I believe it has a lot to do with taking good care of your skin and using the right anti aging products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the dermatologist for dermabrasion more than 10 years ago and this procedure did work but it cost about a grand and caused my skin to be sore and red for a week. I decided to do some research on anti aging skin care products and have tried Retina/Retinol based products for a while but lately, I have switched to using Vitamin C serum and noticed that it is easier on my skin than Retina while getting better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all the Vitamin C serums I have used, I like the one made by NuNutrients the best. I would highly recommend this product for regular use.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was very surprised with this product. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I got it, but the fact that it is rich with Vitamin C really drew me to it. I have normal skin and bought this product to mostly help reduce the look of fine lines. I ended up using it on the wrinkles on my face as well as the fine lines and I saw a decrease in both in about 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overtime I saw a difference in my skin that I hadn&#x27;t seen in a while. I really like this product and the way it makes my face look and feel. Also I can&#x27;t get over all the Vitamin C that this is packed with! So happy I decided to try this!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both use this serum.  For us it works nicely with the &amp;#34;eb5 Anti-Aging Facial Cream.  Our skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this with my daily moisturizer. Its really good. Feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very much into taking care of my skin so im always looking for ways to keep myself looking youthful and healthy. Vitamin C is great for the skin however I live in desert climates so very often my skin is exposed to conditions that&#x27;ll dry my skin out and eventually that&#x27;ll have me with wrinkles and/or pale and dry skin if I&#x27;m not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So a friend recommended that I use this along with my moisturizer and it would help immensely. Found it l, bought it, applied it and in a few days I can see and feel the difference. Definitely worth the investment and the results are amazing. Check it out.</li>
            <li> Decent product.  Hard to say if it was really working or not.  Didn&#x27;t see any major results. Positives were it goes on easy and can be used with other products.  May have seen more results had I used it longer but after about a month there wasn&#x27;t much of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I will admit I was a little skeptical, especially when I saw how many five star reviews there were.  This product sounded too good to be true.  I have tried so many home remedies to do the job that this serum does, but nothing came even close to how this product improved my skin.  I have oily-sensitive skin and serums usually do not take to my skin very well.  I usually get a break out or dry skin, but this product did its job without any irritation at all!  I use the product at night (simply because I do not think makeup goes onto it very well), because that is when your skin is doing the most of its cell recovery.  I started showing results in as little as 2 1/2 weeks!  My fine lines around my eyes and mouth are diminishing, my makeup goes on smoother, and my skin seems to have a more natural glow due to the vitamins in this product.  I truly recommend this product to anyone looking for similar results as me.</li>
            <li> OK results. I used it every day and as directed. I know everyones skin is different so I am not complaining. I did however find something that has similar ingredeients, but might be more potent or something. I found it on Amazon once but now I cant find it except on the company website. I started to see visible results in just 5 days. Truly amazing. So dont be discouraged everyone, there are good products out there. If you are looking for a true collagen booster try what I did Radiantly Ageless Peptide Fusion Collagen Booster or The Triple Serum De Luxe by radiantlyageless.com  i found it on ebay once for I want to say 30 dollars.</li>
            <li> NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum provides amazing support to your moisturizing system. You simply add a drop to whatever you use -- I use Dermalogica -- and you can feel your skin wonderfully smoother. Wrinkles immediately feel less prominent, too. However, I&#x27;m only giving the product 4 stars because my skin is quite dry, and it took a while for my moisturizer to take effect in battling this powerful agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw effects after about 4 weeks. I noticed it helped with sun spots, freckles and pollution&#x27;s harm. The fact that the vitamin c replaces lost collagen amazes me and allows me to feel better as I age. Now that I&#x27;ve found NuNutrients, I no longer fear those birthdays as they approach. People say I still can pass for age 26, and I intend to keep it that way with this product. Try it for yourself and you&#x27;ll see results!</li>
            <li> I decided to take a couple of minutes and write a review about this great product. I got it as a Valentine present from my husband, and I am truly happy that he did. I am 57 year young Caucasian woman and I now learned to appreciate what this anti-aging serum does for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Not only that regenerates and renews the aging skin but also has a great intense moisturizing action. I can honestly say that my face feels smoother and some of the wrinkles already starting to fade away.</li>
            <li> Not normally a serum user as all the other serum I tried all either too oily and just don&#x27;t do the work.  This NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum was recommended by a friend as I do feel my face is a bit dull these days. I have very sensitive skin and prone to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this serum for about 2 months and noticed a huge difference.  My skin is no longer dull and actually \\&quot;glow\\&quot; (according to my mom).  My face is no longer dry and especially the area around my eyes are brightened after only 2 months of using this product.  Last, this serum doesn&#x27;t feel greasy AT ALL, which is huge for me because I don&#x27;t like anything sticky on face!  No breakouts or anything nasty happened to face either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this serum and it&#x27;s become my staple and routine of my skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other anti-aging products in the past that have felt heavy and seemed like a waste of money. I was purchasing cheap drugstore products, and eventually decided to try something higher end. The best beauty tip my mother ever gave me was not to skimp on the quality of products that you put on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had problems with dry skin for many years, and NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum has really balances that out. I also tend to get very red, something I&#x27;ve noticed has lessened since I started using this product. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with my skin type.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would help with the lines under my eyes and fine lines on my forehead..after reading up about several other products, I decided to give this one a try because it had good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used NuNutrients for about 2.5 weeks now and I have definitely seen noticeable results. The lines under my eyes seem to be fading away and the lines on my forehead are definitely less noticeable.  Like anything else, it takes time, but the results really were almost immediate. My skin overall definitely feels smoother.</li>
            <li> NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum has greatly reduced my facial redness and flushing by about 80%. Prior to using NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum I was unable to use products which contained therapeutic amounts of vitamin C. NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum has healed my skin It also helped strengthen capillaries which helped reduced my facial flushing and redness.&lt;br /&gt;  I am referred to as the product master by my friends and family. I have tried everything natural and organic out there. This product delivers results like nothing i have ever seen. I have people falling back when i tell them i am 38 years old. My skin looks like its old self  NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum. I am completely in love with this line.</li>
            <li> Great serum, absorbs easily and tones the skin, it feels more moisture</li>
            <li> I am completely in love. My skin feels so much softer.  The crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes havr lessened. I see my pores getting smaller daily.  And it smells good!</li>
            <li> I wanted to use NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum - Anti-Aging for a while before giving a review and here it is now: I have been applying this product 2x/day before my moisturizers for 1 month now. I am a 36-yr old male with obvious wrinkles and dry/dull complexion. My skin is very important and I therefore invest in what are considered top-of-the-line and pricey products. The Skinceuticals Phloretin serum worked some but I did not think the mediocre results justified the price. Now to NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum - Anti-Aging the liquid makes my skin is more radiant and it looks more refreshed. the dull complexion is visibly reduced and the lines around my eyes have diminished nicely. In all the years of expensive products, I have not seen such an improvement... ever. The best thing is NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum - Anti-Aging is AFFORDABLE!!!</li>
            <li> Very effective product. A friend told me about this serum and actually bought me a bottle. After using it, I was so happy with it that I bought some more for myself. It has a long shelf life (12 months) and is made in the USA and is FDA approved. It visibly reduced my wrinkles and made me look years younger. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> My brother got me and my sister the Nu Nutrients soothing cucumber eye cream, and he got our mother this one! We are a Nu Nutrients family! We got our gifts around the same time, so she has been using this Nu Nutrients vitamin c anti-aging cream for about a month now. We have watched in awe as her crows feet disappeared, her frown lines became nonexistent, and her skin began soften, lose the spots and even gave it a healthy glow! She loves it and she gets compliments all the time on how beautiful her skin is! My dad confirmed it, he swears she looks at least 10 younger! Best of all, we haven&#x27;t seen any nasty side effects or breakouts. So she will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> NuNutrients Vitamin C is an anti-aging serum. It works by replenishing the Vitamin C in your skin. Priced just under $40, it&#x27;s a great product to use in the winter time. I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> This stuff feels so good on my face. It hasn&#x27;t aggravated my psoriasis which I worry about. It doesn&#x27;t have perfumes and a scent. It hydrates my skin well. Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> I have tried other vitamin serums before. This serum truly assists in wrinkles and crows feet, as well as overall skin tone improvement. I am 34 years old. My brother told me I look like I am in my 20&#x27;s and I don&#x27;t look tired anymore! Ha ha! He had no clue I had been using this product. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum for a few months now, I love how it&#x27;s a topical vitamin C serum. After just a few uses I noticed some lovely results, my face just feels brighter, youthful, and just healthy. and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this well in a long time.  I feel good about this product, and would recommend it to anyone who truly is looking to provide their skin with a healthy boost of Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> All I can say is it&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;It does the job!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soothing!&lt;br /&gt;Visible results in less than 2 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;The price is fair!&lt;br /&gt;NuNutrients Serum is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> NuNutrients Vitamin C is an anti-aging serum.  It works by replenishing the Vitamin C in your skin.  It&#x27;s also contains antioxidant properties that helps you maintain a healthy body.  Priced just under $40, it&#x27;s a great product to use in the winter time.</li>
            <li> This serum (NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum) was my third one I tried (because hey, i keep reading and hearing so much about vitamin C!). Theres no perfumes in this, which is great. I dont want perfumes in stuff that im putting on my face, I want skin rejuvinating results, which I have to say, is what I got. Fine lines- 50% GONE, sunspots, 75% GONE, firm skin&#x3D; HELLO!</li>
            <li> This little bottle works wonders on my skin. I just started using it about a week ago and many of my friends have commented on how much smoother and slightly lighter my skin looks. I never thought such a small amount could do so much for my skin. This product is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum is extremely rejuvenating!  The combination of vitamin C an hylouronic acid is very powerful and is essential for healthy skin.  This does wonders for any person at any age.  You will never have a better complexion.  It heals, makes healthier skin and refreshes your own glowing look.  I love this product, it is simply, amazing results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum sparingly for 3 months now. I don&#x27;t even use it consistently, but I&#x27;ve still been able to see my skin get tighter and my crow&#x27;s feet have pretty much disappeared! Along with the age-reducing benefits, it also has Vitamin C in it, which gives me a nice boost of energy and health. It&#x27;s super easy to use (just pat the serum on your face), it dries very fast, and it smells really good! I definitely recommend this, with or without using toning lotion!</li>
            <li> My face had pock marks and I’m pretty sure this serum is why they are fading a bit. I am very pleased with the results and plan on using it more to see if they can disappear altogether.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days now and I definitely love the way my face looks and feels.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s cheaper, but doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as some of the more expensive brands of vitamin c serums I&#x27;ve been using.  Will use rest of bottle - not bad, just not seeing same benefits as usual.  Oh well - sometimes you have to pay more for quality (but not always!)</li>
            <li> Really nice, light weight, smooth to the touch serum. I have been using this for 1 week and so far I really love it. It has brightened my skin and gave it a great natural glow and radiance. Works really well on my fine lines, especially along the edges of my eyes. They seem to be less noticeable and fading. I also feel that my skin is much more firm and less sagging plus it is more hydrated. I am really impressed with it and definitely recommend it. I received this product to try in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. All opinions expressed are truly my own.</li>
            <li> love what it is doing for my skin! So soft! less blemishes! smaller pores! great product with quick ship!</li>
            <li> Put it on every night into a small towel and rub it in. Make it part of your routine because vitamin c is vital to our bodies.</li>
            <li> I skeptically tried this product because I have been looking for something new to try with not a lot of good results. I have gone through a lot of &amp;#34;magic serums&amp;#34; and nothing! I happened across this one when my sister told me about her good results with it. Our mutual problem has always been that anti-aging mixtures usually dry our skin out. Maybe its something hereditary- not sure, but it has made us pretty wary new products. I tried this one and it REALLY WORKED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles (thankfully) but it managed to still smooth out my skin considerably. I have super dry skin and this actually felt like it was nourishing it. Because it didn&#x27;t dry my face out, I kept using it. Now- three and 1/2 weeks later, I can feel a difference in my skin&#x27;s texture. It&#x27;s smoother and not as dry. My makeup goes on with a smoother finish as a results. I will keep this with me from now on because I feel like its a great base for my skin and it replenishes it daily. THANKS TO NUNUTRIENTS!! They just made another loyal customer VERY happy!</li>
            <li> From tanning too much, stress, etc my skin looked much older than it should so I was looking for something to try to reverse that effect. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and the change is definitely noticeable. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about two weeks with my daily routine I noticed brighter glowing skin it&#x27;s never looked do good or been so soft! I look 5 years younger already!</li>
            <li> I once got my hand on a real and efficient vitamin C serum from Korea which costed me $20 and worked wonder.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m since trying to find an equivalent.&lt;br /&gt;The NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum I received is a joke.&lt;br /&gt;I dislike writing negative review but I had too as I received a watery gel with a slight medicated smell and after finishing the bottle couldn&#x27;t sincerely notice any improvement at all on the slight blemishes I have due to sun exposure this summer and I don&#x27;t have lines yet.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m even wondering if I didn&#x27;t receive some sort of counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money....</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m on the fence.  Unfortunately, it does not appear to be working at all.  I will keep using until I finish the bottle and update this review.</li>
            <li> This makes your skin so soft! Skin is radiant and shiny!</li>
            <li> This product contains several natural ingredients. The Vitamin C blend and H2O make me feel comfortable applying to my face. After about a month, I am already noticing a more youthful presence. Some of my colleagues have even mentioned that I seem more exuberant in the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions vary depending on whether or not you are using the toner. The toner should be used before the actual serum. All instructions are concise and simple to follow. I actually have been using this twice a day to achieve desired results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the hype around Vitamin C, I couldn&#x27;t be more excited what NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum has to offer. I also do not have an oily face or burning sensation after applying the toner and serum.  I have conducted much research on Vitamin C and feel confident in recommending this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought the Nutrients Vitamin C Serum for my aunt who had tried every anti-aging product on the market. After using it for a little under a month, we saw a big difference in the appearance of her skin prior to taking the serum. She looks noticeably healthier and her skin seems replenished. She was most worried about those age spots and wrinkles, which have already begun to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product! I recommend it to anyone looking to rejuvenate their skin. I have to admit, at first, I was a little apprehensive given the price. Between all the women in my family and myself, I’ve spent countless amounts of money on different anti-aging skin-care products which did absolutely nothing, but waste my time and money. However, this serum proves that it’s not just another one of those money making products, but actually one that works, besides, it’s Dr. Oz recommended ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Impressed by my aunt’s results, I started to use some myself. I’ve only been applying it for about three weeks now and have already noticed my skin is looking a lot brighter. I’m sure this has everything to do with the Nutrients Vitamin C Serum. Try it. It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and speedy delivery too might I add!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an effective Anti-Aging Serum, NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum is definitely for you. For a long time I have been searching for a product that won&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I have very sensitive skin so this is an important factor when searching for a skin Serum.  This Vitamin C  Anti-Aging Serum helps prevent aging lines and wrinkles all the while improving the tone and softness of your skin.  Definite plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the best benefit of this product is the fact that it contains antioxidants. Antioxidants are so healthy and beneficial to our skin and bodies. Definite selling point. This product comes in a handy little dropper bottle so a little can potentially go a long way to keeping skin soft and younger looking.  As a mom of 3 this is important to me.</li>
            <li> The NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum is amazing! After using it for a little over a month now, my skin appears to be more healthy and beautiful. This serum has helped to replenish the natural look of my skin and my aging spots are starting to fade. I use it directly on my problem areas after I exfoliate my skin. Additionally, I use a moisturizer along with the serum to keep my skin texture balanced and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is truly a trusted brand that provides simple and pure skin care products because it leaves my skin feeling clean, refreshed, and replenished. The serum has started to brighten my skin providing me with a more radiant and youthful complexion. I am excited to see the future results as I continuously use this product. If you are looking for something to revitalize and clear your skin then NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum is it. I recommend that you give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing Vitamin C serum that you would absolutely fall in love with. When I bought the product  I was not sure if it would really work and make my skin better or not as I have tried many other skin smoothing and anti wrinkle creams but nothing gave me any beneficial results. But NuNutrient  Vitamin C is different from others. It has incredibly made my skin smoother, cleaner and shinny. It is FDA approved and that makes it more credible. As we all know Vitamin C is very essential for our skin and we tend to lose it with increasing age and this product not only makes up the deficiency of Vitamin C but also decreases spots and freckles on our skin.&lt;br /&gt;The NuNutrient Vitamin C serum will start giving you results within as little as two to three weeks. I had wrinkles and some black spots around my upper cheek area but I noticed them dissolving away in as little as two weeks. It is easy to apply and if you feel your skin starting to dry up a little after you apply it, then you can apply good quality moisture over it and let NuNutrient do its work. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Positive results guaranteed.</li>
            <li> Hereditarily, I have dreadful skin. No matter what I do, at the end of the day, those 12 hours I&#x27;ve been up, turn into 12 years I&#x27;ve aged. The sunspots that have been there, since I can&#x27;t remember when, grew. Not to mention the lines that weren&#x27;t so deep when I woke, look like the Grand Canyon. That was until I found NuNutrients Serum, of course.&lt;br /&gt;At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to work, but soon I noticed that my sunspots were diminishing. Not only that, my wrinkles no longer looked like I&#x27;ve spent years under the sun without SPF, squinting into the horizon. It took about 2 weeks for the real results to kick in. I no longer have sun spots &amp; the wrinkles are essentially nonexistent. Nonetheless, this product is slowly climbing to one of my favorites, please believe it will definitely be kept in stock.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with some skepticism because I have very sensitive skin, but to my surprise it was very gentle. I have dark spots and the laugh lines that I had to get rid of. I saw results in less than 2 weeks. I read the reviews and said what the heck. I might as well try it. I have tried so many different products that made my skin worse.&lt;br /&gt;I recommended it to some of my friends and they still thank me to this day.  I know people look for something that won&#x27;t bother their skin and this is the best product. I am almost out of this bottle so will be purchasing a few bottles very soon.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I use it with a moisturizer and eye cream to maximize results. Since I started using this serum, I&#x27;ve not had nearly as many breakouts .. Highly recommended as an addition to your current moisturizing routine.</li>
            <li> I was looking at my pores on my nose and thinking I needed to take a sandblaster to them, then received this product yesterday, tried it that night, looked at my skin in the am and noticed right off that the pores on my nose were smaller.  To soon to tell about how it will work on my face overall, but having smaller pores is worth 5 stars.    Update:  I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 months and the texture of my skin has really improved, a lot less crepey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month now, not sure if its working or not.  I probably won&#x27;t purchase again due to the fact the product didn&#x27;t leave an impression on me.</li>
            <li> got this serum 6 days ago OMG what a difference on my skin specially around my mouth and cheek area totally fuller im 75 ordered it for my daughter today BEST BEST LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have difficulty with many skin care products due to them containing fillers and/or non pure ingredients.  This product did not dry my skin nor did it feel oily.  Living in a seasonal region, the winter can be very drying.  NuNutrients Vitamin C Serium has saved my skin from getting the dry, cracked patches I generally get in the cold.  When I wake in the am, my skin maintains its moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a general health perspective I appreciate that the serum is produced in an FDA certified facility.  It also has a long shelf life, but I can&#x27;t imagine keeping it that long.  In fact, I hope they will produce a larger bottle.  I don&#x27;t want to run out.  I plan on purchasing this for my Mom for Mother&#x27;s Day, perfect gift.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when using this product at first; I do not typically buy into “Anti-aging” products, because I am both not entirely ready for them nor do I usually believe in their authenticity.  However, in this case with NuNutrients I was mistaken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with how well my skin looked after using it.  More so, I was impressed with how refreshed my skin felt afterwards.  Surprisingly it was super easy to use too.  I already recommended this to some friends who went ahead and tried it for themselves, and they were as excited by it as I was.</li>
            <li> Like many women approaching forty years, I have been consciously looking for an effective day cream or serum that will compensate all the dry areas around my cheeks and forehead. Having tried a variety of facials and even chemical peels I have now found this new product ‘’Nu Nutrients Vitamin C Serum’’, that gives me the satisfaction that I so longed for in easing the dry nature of my facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nu Nutrients Vitamin C Serum - Anti-Aging Serum is I feel is not only safer, cheaper and easier than a facelift or chemical peel but two weeks after applying the serum on clean skin after my morning cleansing routine, I did feel an improvement in the texture of the skin around my cheeks and forehead. After three days or so my fingers glided over my cheeks smoothly and there were fewer dry noticeable dry patches on the forehead.I was also frowning a lot less, than I do normally. After seven days I noticed less tightness around the cheeks and the mouth area, and for the last few days I have noticed that I am using less tinted moisturizer and my fingers are gliding smoothly over my face. Depending on how good the condition of your skin is it might be worth looking into this product especially as it also anti-aging.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;For some reason my skin responds to vitamin c and I had been carefully using the skin brightening treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I cannot believe how quickly and effectively this brightened my skin tone from tiredness. Simply amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For me, I&#x27;m using it to face and neck once a day at night, and it absorbs quickly into my skin. A must have in my&lt;br /&gt; book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I will definitely reorder. Thanks!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have had problems with the skin on my face for quite some time.  Between the dark spots and lines it can at times be very frustrating.  That is why I was very excited to find NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum - Anti-Aging Serum.  I knew that Vitamin C was good for your body and immune system but I didn&#x27;t really think it could do so much good for your skin.  The Serum was easy to apply and took no time out of my day.  It also didn&#x27;t feel harsh or abrasive when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about 2 weeks, but I started to first see changes on my forehead which seems to have the worst spots from the sun.  My skin was brighter and my face in general looked less tired.  It helped to brighten up my eyes by getting rid of those little mini lines around my eyes.  What I love the most is my skin feels softer yet the overall look and consistency is much firmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be on the younger side, but I have learned the hard way that you have to take care of your skin.  Fortunately NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum will now better allow me to take better care of my skin and make me feel more confident in the way I look.</li>
            <li> I am looking more than my age and so, searching for the best anti-aging product. I came across this NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum. After finding many positive reviews for this revolutionary supplement, I decided to give a try. The Vitamin C in this supplement helped me to retain my actual age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In just 4 weeks of using this product, there is a lot of difference in my face texture. All the fine lines are vanished. It made me happy and turned my life. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this serum would work any better than the tons of others I had tried, but soon after using it, I was pleasantly surprised.I had gigantic pores around my nose and could never find anything to make much of a difference until now. I can really tell the difference in the way my face looks and feels. My skin is clear, and no more potholes for pores. The smell of the serum is nice too, and most products like this smell horrible.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now, I added it to my skin care regimen and I can tell that it is working. It has helped to improve the tone of my skin. I was looking for a product that could lighten some of the dark spots that I have under my eyes and after two weeks I can tell a real difference. It was definitely worth that money and it was a better cost than some of the other products out there on the market.</li>
            <li> I put this serum under my eyes every night before bed and once a day when I remember. I am getting some fine lines that people tell me are from laughing. The lines make me look older and it can be hard sometimes covering them up with make-up. This serum works for me although tit took a while at first. The lines are really disappearing and leaving my skin so much smoother.</li>
            <li> Another product I&#x27;ve bought for my wife. She loves it, I can tell she does too. Makes her look younger and she says it makes her skin feel amazing too. Some products like this have some nasty small to it and this one didn&#x27;t have any rank odor to it. Immediate results, seriously. If you&#x27;re a guy looking for something to get your old lady; buy this and she won&#x27;t be an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; lady any more.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum is amazing!  I have always been really skeptical about so-called &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; products, but this one is definitely an exception to the rule. I could feel my skin tighten as I was applying the serum. After a couple of weeks it became obvious that this product was working - my skin looked and felt younger. I have gotten so many compliments on my skin since I started using it.</li>
            <li> My neighbor lady swears by NuNutrient Vitamin C Serum.  Since I started using this product, the vitamin C is helping the wrinkles around my eyes and mouth.  I certainly can tell the difference.  I have received compliments from my friends.  The 12 month shelf life is a plus and the cost is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I started noticing a difference within a couple of days. I apply it 3 times a day after I wash my face. It does leave a slight tightening feeling when it dries but as soon as it&#x27;s dry I apply organic coconut oil to my face so it&#x27;s no longer a problem. My skin feels smoother and my face is a bit fuller and some of the lines are disappearing. I really do look younger than I did a week ago when I started using it. This is a keeper.</li>
            <li> just got it,  love the way it makes my skin feel  I cannot wait to see the effects of using it every day</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with finding a product that was very natural yet also helped with reducing the aging properties of my skin. A friend of mine recommended this product to me, so I decided to try it out. Since Vitamin C is a natural antioxidant in our bodies, I was very comfortable with knowing that what I was applying to my skin had also a multitude of health benefits. I used this product for about 2 weeks, using it daily. I definitely saw a significant difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My skin&#x27;s appearance was much smoother, the serum helped reduce my wrinkles along with also giving my skin a very healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;The formula is very gentle and was very pleased that it did not irritate my skin, given I have very sensitive skin. The product feels very smooth on the skin and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the results that I&#x27;ve seen, especially in such a short amount of time. I would recommend this product to anyone, especially since the product has such an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that this product stands true to its description. Being an athlete and spending countless hours in the sun has proven to do a lot of damage to my skin. In the past, I have tried numerous products such as various forms of cocoa butter, shea butter, and aloe vera products to aid my dry and cracked skin. A friend of mine introduced me to NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum Anti-Aging Serum. Initially, I was skeptical about using the product because I wasn&#x27;t concerned about the aging of my skin but went along with using it anyway because it mentioned its ability to replenish the loss of Vitamin C in the body. Ignoring my first thought and trying it anyway was one of the best decisions I have made.&lt;br /&gt;Within the first three weeks of using this product as directed, I began to notice a change in the way my skin looked and felt. By this time, most of the dark spots on my face faded and it had already begun toning up the coloring of my face and neck! What makes this product even greater is the fact that I can apply my makeup over it without an issue. Since the inclusion of this serum into my everyday facial regimen, I have no worries about how the sun may effect my appearance when it&#x27;s time to workout and compete.</li>
            <li> Any product with water as the first ingredient is an option for me. For the past couple of years I have been on the swim team and my face was showing little signs of wrinkles from the sun. I tried everything I could find at the pharmacy and online and nothing seemed to help very much. I was at a loss for options and freaking out because i&#x27;m only in my 20&#x27;s! I found this product and thought I would give it a try and decide if it was something I could stick with.&lt;br /&gt;When i got this product, I immediately washed my face and applied the product on my cheeks and anywhere where I felt i needed it. It had a cool feeling which made me feel relaxed. I didn&#x27;t see the results right away, maybe because I was expecting the product not to work like all the other ones, but after a week, my face felt more youthful and soft and stronger. It&#x27;s like the elastic in my skin time-traveled back to when I was 5. I am definitely going to go with this product from now on!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moE9NFNARYJBJI]]I used NuNutrients for several days now and have seen immediate results.  I love the way my skin feels afterwards when using this.  I was mainly concerned about resurfacing my skin and decrease the appearance of my enlarged pores around my cheek area.  I&#x27;ve seen the way this works and its gentle yet powerful.  You can use this under your make up too.  My skin feels hydrated and moisturized without the weight.  After applying it to my clean face it dries fast and clear.  I loved it and will continue to be a loyal customer.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!</li>
            <li> Allow Vitamin C Serum to help your body maintain your youthful, healthy, resilient skin. Replenish your skin with Vitamin C Serum as early as 2-4 weeks. NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum is easy to use. You apply it directly to your face in those trouble areas, once a day. Its best used after exfoliating your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C Serum gives you a tighter and more youthful skin appearance. It diminished fine lines and wrinkles by inducing collagen. Your wrinkles get reduced and fine lines even disappear in certain cases. It also, Improves your  skin texture. Vitamin C Serum works for sun damaged skin and hyperpigmentation. It also helps gives your skin a natural glow because after using Vitamin C serum helps your moisturizer to absorb in your skin better. I recommend NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum!!</li>
            <li> When my younger sister put this in my stocking last Christmas, I was offended until she showed me what it had done for her brother-in-law&#x27;s skin.  As an avid outdoor soccer player who has the misfortune of being allergic to most sunblock creams, I thought for sure I was destined to become a rhinoceros.  It only took a couple of weeks for me to really notice the effects: my skin felt smoother and less tight, dry patches went away, the lines in my forehead and eyes eased up.  I may not be better at soccer because of NuNutrients, but man do I look better playing it.</li>
            <li> My wife like it very much, the quality is very good and the price is very favourable</li>
            <li> **I received this free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C Serum I have learned recently plays a very large role in the healthiness of our body and skin tone. The serum allows us to be youthful, healthy and to have the skin we had when we were younger before the sun and other pollutants left its toll. As we age our skin loses Vitamin C and this allows us to replenish it. When a small drop is placed on the skin, instantly with one application, you will feel the difference of smoother and firmer looking skin. I apply this once a day in the morning after washing my face and the whole day I am left feeling less wrinkled and with less fine lines. I recommend using a moisturizer as well so that your skin, especially in the winter climates, doesn&#x27;t dry out or flake. This is not an immediate miracle worker, it will take time. I have used it for a month now and I definitely see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle comes 1 fl oz. but doesn&#x27;t take a lot to cover your neck and face. I enjoy the packaging and find it easy to carry with me on the go, if needed. The serum is USA made and FDA approved which is important and the first ingredient is Aqua (water) so that is a sure sign that you are not putting a bunch of harsh chemicals on your face and into your pores. If used on a regular basis, you will see as I did your pores shrink and your face feel soft, smooth and appear more youthful. I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> This product works really great and help tighten up the skin and making wrinkles seems less noticeable. However I love this product but can do without the flaking of the skin . But overall good would  keep using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for 2 weeks now,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a difference in my smile, well OTHERS have noticed. MY skin used to be wrinkly and dry looking no matter what lotion I would use, this serum helps moisturize and strengthen your skin to look rejuvenated and youthful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easy to use, simple design, see results in a matter of days, no sticky residue, no stinging or allergies.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: No guarantees, it didn&#x27;t work for my friend but it worked for me,</li>
            <li> I’ve tried several Vitamin C Serums and this is the first that doesn’t leave my face greasy.  I have naturally oily skin so I have to be careful what I put on my face.  This serum absorbs quickly and it doesn’t leave my skin feeling sticky or tacky.  Since I do have oily skin, I don’t use a moisturizer with this.  I find that it’s moisturizing enough on its own.  In the morning, I apply it as soon as I get out of the shower and by the time I brush my hair and teeth, it’s fully absorbed and I can put my makeup on.  At night I apply it after I wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference in my skin right away.  It looked brighter, pores smaller, lines less prominent.  My skin looked and felt more hydrated.  The only drawback for me personally is the dispenser.  I wish it were a pump instead of a dropper, but I love the product so I’ll just have to deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using different types of lotions for years trying to get my wrinkles out and get it looking just a little more useful. I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;ve worked or only worked to a small degree. They&#x27;ve ranged from $70-$200 for high end products. I recently found this NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum after doing some research on how vitamin C affects your skin. After using this for about a week, I can visibily tell that my wrinkles and lines have reduced, and on top of that, I have that youthful glow to my skin that I&#x27;ve been looking for for years. I also use it in conjunction with my moisturizer just to give it that extra glow. My skin feels so much tighter and youthful! I love it!</li>
            <li> This serum is INCREDIBLE! It actually makes me look younger. My skin is tighter, my wrinkles are fainter, and this is only after a week of use. My skin feels fresh and has a youthful glow to it. I cannot believe how well this serum works. I use it nightly and it is incredible.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is an antioxidant that is naturally found in citrus fruits and certain vegetables. According to Valerie Monroe, beauty editor of &amp;#34;O, the Oprah magazine,&amp;#34; antioxidant serums can brighten your complexion and help moisturizers absorb better. Because skin care companies found that topical vitamin C may have anti-aging effects, they created anti-aging skin serums for application to the face and neck. I have been using vitamin C serums for years and I think I look younger now than I did 5 years ago. I have very fair skin that freckles and burns in a heartbeat, and I&#x27;ve seen a lifetime of damage being repaired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum has the perfect recommended percentage of serum for the best results without damaging sensitive skin. It&#x27;s also a great price, considering that I used to pay upwards of $100 a bottle for a smaller amount from the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This is one of the Best products that I have ever used. I previously was spending $120. for anti-aging serum. This works much better and is so much more affordable. It has also cleared some brown spots on my face. This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> With the sensitive skin I have, I am very weary about what I put on myself but this sounded like something I could trust putting on my face.  I also decided to use this on my arms because of the uneven dark spots I have from scarring.  I love the fact that this absorbed quickly, leaving no greasy or oily film on my face and arms.  I felt very refreshed especially after adding this to my face and under my eyes!  I am hoping that with using this for a prolonged amount of time, I will see even more drastic changes.  I even found that I had ZERO breakouts after using this like I normally would from trying something new!</li>
            <li> First off, let me start out by saying that I didn&#x27;t buy this for myself. (It&#x27;s an anti-aging cream, they&#x27;re all crocks anyway, right?) I bought this as a sort of gag gift for an uncle. Now, this particular uncle had just retired from 35 years of year-round swim-coaching in the California sun in favor of a desk job, so his wrinkles were LEGENDARY. We teased him about his leathery face all the time, so I grabbed one of these for his birthday to up the ante a little. Of course, we all had a good laugh and he tucked it away in his medicine cabinet (Didn&#x27;t learn this until later; I thought he threw it out.)&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks passed, and I got a call from my aunt. She sent me a couple pictures of my uncles freshly renewed skin, shocked to see him looking better than her. She demanded to know what my source was. Now, rather than disclose this little gold mine I&#x27;d discovered, I bought 5 more bottles and took them to the next family reunion where they sold like hot cakes, aided by my uncle&#x27;s glowing endorsement and my aunt&#x27;s non-stop hype.&lt;br /&gt;In short, this really is a fantastic product. I&#x27;m still way too young to have much use for it, but logically speaking, I think it makes sensemble that something as natural as vitamin C would be so much more effective than the chemical-laden creams you get from big brands. Anyway, it gets 5 stars from me and at least 10 from everyone I shared a bottle with.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this. Now.</li>
            <li> I struggle with rosascea and am always searching for products to sooth my inflamed, spotty cheeks. This serum has helped significantly. It has calmed my inflammation and evened my complexion. A lot of other serums that I&#x27;ve tried like this were too harsh and left my skin even worse off than when I started. I was sort of expecting the same thing with this, but was pleasantly surprised after a few days of using it. This serum is gentle and cooling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing this item again, it&#x27;s one of the only face products that has actually worked with my face instead of against it.</li>
            <li> I bought Nunutrients Vitamin C for my mom. Her skin is suffering the signs of aging and I was told her to try vitamin c. I saw this product recommended in many magazines and websites for long time and decide to buy it. My mam was very impressed - feel it has smoothed skin almost immediately, and she definitely plan to continue to use it. She likes that this product doesn&#x27;t have any side effect.</li>
            <li> I am a man but always looking to get my skin looking better, I work long hours which can take a toll on the skin and how a person looks.  I have been using NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum along with their Cucumber eye cream, and I am so pleased with how much younger and fresher my face looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this Serum because it is light and easy to apply, I can feel it soak into my skin immediately.  Its a product you can really see and feel working.  Instantly the wrinkles start to fade and your skin will feel moisturized.  This is an excellent product for the skin of anyone, man or woman.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I use this every day and my skin feels so much softer and smoother than before. I even told my friends to get it too! It&#x27;s a small container but you only use a little at a time so actually it lasts a while, but I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> I have used many anti-aging products in the past that have felt very heavy,and I never really noticed any great difference. I always felt as if I was wasting my money, and I really needed something that was going to do what it said it would do. The happiest day of my life was when I came across and I decided to try NuNutrients vitamin c serum, and it was the best decision I ever made!. This product did wonders on my face, my face felt smoother, and firmer, and I noticed that my crows feet became less visible. I have always had issues with dry skin for years, and NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum has really given my face the moisture it deserves. I also tend to get very red and blotchy, and since I have been using this amazing product I have noticed that the redness as lessened tremendously. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with this skin type.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old, so I guess I have just started the \\&quot;aging\\&quot; process. This used in conjunction with the NuNutrients eye cream completely made the fine lines around my eyes vanish! I also have been getting red patches of dry skin on my face this winter, and this product helped soothe and heal them. I have neglected taking care of my skin in the past, but as I grow older, I am not taking any more chances. I am definitely hooked on this product!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if this is working or not. I do try to use it consecutive but I do miss sometimes. I can&#x27;t really say it has helped 1 line or a laugh line or anything. I&#x27;m only 32, I used this in hopes to fill in some of the lines-very fine on my forehead. Can&#x27;t say that its done that. I have used it for a good solid month or better. I&#x27;m still using it though, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This ain&#x27;t yo mommas orange juice!  No sir!  I was shocked at how vibrant I felt just after a few days of using the serum.  As I grow older, I find myself competing with younger guys for the same customers.  NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum is indeed the anti-aging solution for me!</li>
