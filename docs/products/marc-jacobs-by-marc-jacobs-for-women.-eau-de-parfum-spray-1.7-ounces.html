            <li> counter for Marc Jacobs, no more.  </li>
            <li> i have even asked coworkers to smell my neck and and there is only a faint trace of it.</li>
            <li> they also sent three small samples for me to try</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find, Macy&#x27;s use to have&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was expensive.</li>

            <li> Purchased this for myself--too good to be true. Item came in box unused and it&#x27;s the real deal. I use it everyday--favorite scent. Thrilled with this purchase!!</li>
            <li> Great price and my one of my favorite parfum. I would recommend because it&#x27;s a great scent and nice size for the price.</li>
            <li> i love this fragrance, but after putting it on by the time i get to work it&#x27;s barely detectable. i have even asked coworkers to smell my neck and and there is only a faint trace of it. i use no scented powders or deodorants. dont know if i should return it. it was expensive.</li>
            <li> My mother bought my sister and i this parfum as teenagers years ago. I love love love this it smell really clean, not to strong and you get what you pay for. I have been wanting some for awhile didnt want it to take a long time to arrive. I ordered it friday morning from amazon and received wednesday afternoon. Perfect timing because i wanted it before this wedding that i have to go to saturday. FYI they also sent three small samples for me to try i thought that was really nice.</li>
            <li> This is one of my ALL time favorites. Smells just beautiful.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my girlfriend for Christmas and she smells so good. The vendor sent it in time for Christmas. I am very happy.</li>

            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes...very hard to find...I am absolutely pleased</li>
            <li> The reason I wanted this perfume was because I tried it at my sisters and it was heaven and lasted all day.  When I got my bottle, which was shipped on time, it felt like it was watered down.  I had to lift my shirt up to smell it, and the fragrance hasn&#x27;t lasted long.&lt;br /&gt;No one can smell it on me.  I am very disappointed since it was a lot more money than I wanted to spend!</li>
            <li> I love the tuberose notes.  This is absolutely beautiful.  Fragrances are very subjective so all I can say is that I love it!  My husband picked it out.  And he loves it.  And I always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
