    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>this is awesome for keeping the frizz out of your hair</li>
            <li>This stuff is incredible!!!!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good for about eight hours of no-frizz</li>
            <li>Does the job nicely.</li>
            <li>Glad to find it here on Amazon because not all stores carry it.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s mostly water.  </li>
            <li>(yes, I have tried most of them).  </li>
            <li>I used to use the standard Step 3, but the Frizzologie version works better at keeping my hair perfect.</li>
            <li>That is how much I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Even my hairdresser asked me what the heck happened to my strong, glorious, healthy hair?</li>
            <li>Since I have a pony tail and fine hair, it is great to have a product which I may spray on prior to binding the hair.</li>
            <li>Makes my curls so sleek and smooth and bouncy.</li>
            <li>Perfect to tame a perm and help the tangles..</li>
            <li>best anti frizz , de tangler for people with hard to manage and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>lighter than the gels sold for same purpose although some of those are good as well</li>
            <li>For the price you really can&#x27;t ask for much more.</li>
            <li>And it does so in such a thorough and smooth way you&#x27;ll quickly overlook its less than perfect nozzle and smell.</li>
            <li>This is not the first time this had happened to me!</li>
            <li>It might be useful as a quick-fix, for when you get a spring of frizz, and need to control it for a couple hours, but I&#x27;m fishing for a reason to like it.  </li>
            <li>Infusium is a must for these hazy hot days of summer.</li>
            <li>pretty waves.</li>
            <li>Of course, if you put your Infusium in a spray bottle then add a drop of your favorite essential oil...</li>
            <li>but I cannot wait to try the whole system!</li>
            <li>so here I am at Amazon ordering large quantities of it.</li>
            <li>I believe this is for straight and not curly hair.</li>
            <li>Nice product to tame unruly hair.</li>
            <li>Also, while it does not have an overpowering scent it has an \\&quot;unscent\\&quot; that is not exactly alluring or completely refreshing.</li>
            <li>Nothing more, nothing less.  </li>
            <li>Its \\&quot;drizzle top\\&quot; does not pour out gently when you try to put it directly onto your hair.</li>
            <li>and I must still use a styling product to smooth and hold the frizz down.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used it off and on for years; my husband really likes it to help manage his graying hair, which is coarse in nature.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m completely off the hairspray/sulfates merry-go-round of hair damage.</li>
            <li>As an all natural, it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Frizz is not good, but gentle waves are beautiful (even if the current hairstyle in vogue is a harsh blowout that straightens everyone&#x27;s hair).</li>
            <li>Since I got Prime, it&#x27;s easy to get it from Amazon aside from the usual problems with UPS.</li>
            <li>Nothing beats Infusium if you want a leave-in treatment that is not heavy, not heavily scented and actually saves what is \\&quot;best\\&quot; about having curly hair:</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled, this does exactly what the other Infusium Step 3&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Because in the end, this product de-frizzes like no other affordable treatment.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly aside from those randomly-occurring \\&quot;bad hair days.\\&quot; Target stopped carrying this stuff a few years back.</li>

            <li> Product works well especially when applied to wet hair.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> But these are minor issues.</li>
            <li> Instead, I&#x27;m now using [[ASIN:B000FBZLHG Nature&#x27;s Gate Nourishing Shampoo for Dry or Frizzy Hair with Hemp, (18 fl oz) (532 ml)]] followed by [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I wait until my hair is mostly dry - about 10 minutes after the shower.</li>
            <li> Infusium can be applied when your hair is wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Helps with combing wet hair and with blow drying.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to use too much,best to buy a spritz bottle and spray on wet hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert on conditioners; some reviews complain about leaving hair too wet</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t put in too much on wet hair</li>
            <li> I substituted other pricey products for about 6-8 months.</li>
            <li> Can it be that this product will stand the test of time long past any and all anti-frizz fad products out there?</li>
            <li> I have extremely course frizzy hair and this stuff is a miracle worker!</li>
            <li> A little known side benefit to this product is that it prevents hair from falling out.</li>
            <li> and then a small dollop of [[ASIN:B001QT8CX6 Aveeno Nourish Plus Moisturize Conditioner, 10.5 Ounce Bottle]]</li>
            <li> My hair is just as frizzy as usual</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used infusium products in the past and have been pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recently, it has been difficult to find</li>
            <li> The product is a very thin liquid, which makes it a bit difficult to apply, and I suspect that&#x27;s part of the reason for the lack of control</li>
            <li> I recieved the wrong item!</li>
            <li> Do not understand why this product makes my hair so hard and so terribly unwieldy not recommend it to anyone....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product works well especially when applied to wet hair. Re-application during the day also seems to work well. I would reccomend this product over the much more expensive salon products.</li>
            <li> Perfect to tame a perm and help the tangles.. Add, scrunch and go!</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for a long time. best anti frizz , de tangler for people with hard to manage and frizzy hair. Helps with combing wet hair and with blow drying. Be careful not to use too much,best to buy a spritz bottle and spray on wet hair. lighter than the gels sold for same purpose although some of those are good as well</li>

            <li> Since I have a pony tail and fine hair, it is great to have a product which I may spray on prior to binding the hair.</li>
            <li> I like this product and have been using infusion brands for years. It controls your hair but does not leave it greasy.</li>
            <li> Nice product to tame unruly hair. We&#x27;ve used it off and on for years; my husband really likes it to help manage his graying hair, which is coarse in nature. Does the job nicely. Glad to find it here on Amazon because not all stores carry it.</li>
            <li> I was rather disipointed! I recieved the wrong item! This is not the first time this had happened to me!</li>
            <li> This product does seem to work, but only for a short time.  After a couple of hours, I&#x27;ve got the frizz springing back again.  The product is a very thin liquid, which makes it a bit difficult to apply, and I suspect that&#x27;s part of the reason for the lack of control - it&#x27;s mostly water.  Sure, my hair is difficult and a bit damaged, but that&#x27;s why I was in the market for a frizz control product.  It might be useful as a quick-fix, for when you get a spring of frizz, and need to control it for a couple hours, but I&#x27;m fishing for a reason to like it.  Instead, I&#x27;m now using [[ASIN:B000FBZLHG Nature&#x27;s Gate Nourishing Shampoo for Dry or Frizzy Hair with Hemp, (18 fl oz) (532 ml)]] followed by [[ASIN:B001QT8CX6 Aveeno Nourish Plus Moisturize Conditioner, 10.5 Ounce Bottle]], [[ASIN:B007CDSFKU Now Foods Certified Organic Argan Oil, 2 Oz]] after towel-drying, and then a small dollop of [[ASIN:B001QT8CX6 Aveeno Nourish Plus Moisturize Conditioner, 10.5 Ounce Bottle]] again as a leave-in conditioner.  That&#x27;s good for about eight hours of no-frizz so I&#x27;m completely off the hairspray/sulfates merry-go-round of hair damage.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled, this does exactly what the other Infusium Step 3&#x27;s do (yes, I have tried most of them).  Nothing more, nothing less.  My hair is just as frizzy as usual and I must still use a styling product to smooth and hold the frizz down.</li>
            <li> Can it be that this product will stand the test of time long past any and all anti-frizz fad products out there? I think yes. Infusium is a must for these hazy hot days of summer. Nothing beats Infusium if you want a leave-in treatment that is not heavy, not heavily scented and actually saves what is \\&quot;best\\&quot; about having curly hair: pretty waves. Frizz is not good, but gentle waves are beautiful (even if the current hairstyle in vogue is a harsh blowout that straightens everyone&#x27;s hair). Infusium can be applied when your hair is wet or dry. The bottle is the weakest part of this product. Its \\&quot;drizzle top\\&quot; does not pour out gently when you try to put it directly onto your hair. My hairstylist recommends hair products be applied by hands anyway. The tricky thing is, Infusium is slippery and viscous...so there is some spillage issue with each application. Also, while it does not have an overpowering scent it has an \\&quot;unscent\\&quot; that is not exactly alluring or completely refreshing. But these are minor issues. Because in the end, this product de-frizzes like no other affordable treatment. And it does so in such a thorough and smooth way you&#x27;ll quickly overlook its less than perfect nozzle and smell. As the saying goes: you can&#x27;t have it all--and that maxim applies to hair products as it does to life. Of course, if you put your Infusium in a spray bottle then add a drop of your favorite essential oil...well, maybe you can have it all, with curls, afterall.</li>
            <li> For the price you really can&#x27;t ask for much more. I&#x27;m no expert on conditioners; some reviews complain about leaving hair too wet but I think that depends you&#x27;re hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible!!!! I have extremely course frizzy hair and this stuff is a miracle worker! Makes my curls so sleek and smooth and bouncy. I have only used the leave in conditioner but I cannot wait to try the whole system!</li>
            <li> Item received as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in my hair for about 10 years now. I used to use the standard Step 3, but the Frizzologie version works better at keeping my hair perfect. Just don&#x27;t put in too much on wet hair - you&#x27;ll end up with the over-gelled look. I wait until my hair is mostly dry - about 10 minutes after the shower. I add this stuff and comb it. It works perfectly aside from those randomly-occurring \\&quot;bad hair days.\\&quot; Target stopped carrying this stuff a few years back. I had to grit my teeth and enter Walmart every 2 months to get it or pay the inflated price at the beauty shop/drug store. Since I got Prime, it&#x27;s easy to get it from Amazon aside from the usual problems with UPS.</li>
            <li> It did not help control the frizz.  I believe this is for straight and not curly hair. As an all natural, it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used infusium products in the past and have been pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m letting my hair grow out and thought I&#x27;d try this product and it did nothing at all for my frizzies.</li>
            <li> I have used this product (shampoo,conditioner, and leave-in) since it came out! Recently, it has been difficult to find so here I am at Amazon ordering large quantities of it. Let me tell you, when I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere I substituted other pricey products for about 6-8 months. Nothing else worked! They all left my hair looking AND FEELING like STRAW! Even my hairdresser asked me what the heck happened to my strong, glorious, healthy hair? That did it, I had to find it again. What gives, Infusium people? Why can&#x27;t I find it anywhere? A little known side benefit to this product is that it prevents hair from falling out. Even with the pricier shampoos and conditioners I found hair in my drain. I don&#x27;t know what is in this product but it makes my hair grow faster, thicker, healthier and is easier to style. I cannot be without it. If the Infusium people read this, please respond to the availability issues! I might as well cut off all my hair if you stop making this product. That is how much I LOVE IT.</li>
