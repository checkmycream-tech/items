            <li>+ hours it got kind of snarled up.</li>
            <li>I wished I could use it on my own hair.</li>
            <li>I sprayed it on a synthetic ponytail hair piece and it looked like new and smelled GREAT!!</li>
            <li>Smells delightful and restores the natural sheen.</li>
            <li>Works nice and fast shipping great product will buy again</li>
            <li>Had this before love the smell works great on wig and is well worth the money but make sure u look at</li>

            <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>Theyre nice and cleaned smelling, the look cleaned, they ARE clean.</li>
            <li>Great product would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I finally found a product that&#x27;s works great on my synthetic wigs.</li>
            <li>Smells great but comes in a TINY spray bottle.</li>
            <li>The wig looks fabulous now.</li>
            <li>I had a wig that looks brand new and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Excellent scent left on wigs and natural hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it to untangle  loads of wigs, the smell is pleasant enough, and the bottles have worked so I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone who asked.  </li>
            <li>I love this so much</li>
            <li>It matted my real hair with the glue and more than an Orange Size ball of hair combed out...</li>
            <li>it made them super super soft, smell nice, de-tangle easier, and it well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Great product which leaves your wig, weaves and natural hair soft.</li>
            <li>But it came in the mail quickly and at this price</li>
            <li>My wig is synthetic and I swear it looks even better than when it was brand new now that I&#x27;ve used this spray on it.</li>
            <li>My Friend recommended this to me and i tried it on my shorter wig and it made it look like and feel like when it first came out of the box!</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, comes in a nice pump that sprays an even amount of mist, and works immediately to condition and detangle synthetic and human hair alike.</li>
            <li>This has a beautiful smell, but I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my hair once it dried.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and works really well with my wigs my only problem was the size</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely ordering more.</li>
            <li>Make sure you&#x27;re aware how tiny it is though</li>
            <li>I very recently started wearing wigs and realized there&#x27;s a lot more to it than I realized, maintenance-wise.</li>
            <li>I brought this item at first when you spray it in your weave</li>
            <li>pick one up its for real!</li>
            <li>Very very small bottle but great for travel size in my purse</li>
            <li>still the price was decent and it was worth it..</li>
            <li>I used this on one of my wigs that had gotten a bit tangled and it pretty much did all the work for me.</li>
            <li>A few mists of this really helped at getting the knots out of it and my wig looks as good as new!</li>
            <li>I have a quick weave and I am now nearly Bald.</li>
            <li>All I had to do was slide the comb through a few times and it was as good as new...</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Works better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Does not take as much as I worried either.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t do what it says on the product review.</li>
            <li>This worked very well at untangling my Twilight Sparkle wig from MapOfBeauty.</li>
            <li>DO NOT use this on your Real hair.</li>
            <li>This is like NAIR on real hair.</li>
            <li>Today, I found a new wig at a thrift store that was pretty tangled.</li>
            <li>So I originally bought this for my current cosplay wigs I have.</li>
            <li>it feels fine, but when it dry your hair is very sticky.</li>
            <li>Works amazing but really small bottle</li>
            <li>It did give my wigs new life though!</li>
            <li>It made it look like a brand new wig!</li>
            <li>I just used a few pumps as I went on each area I styled/detangled, so I&#x27;d be sure not to use too much since I&#x27;d never used it before.</li>
            <li>and it makes it so soft!</li>
            <li>I just really wished it was a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>Old wigg had added to wigg and what a difference</li>
            <li>Works very well for long wigs.</li>
            <li>AS LONG AS it NEVER touches your real hair.</li>
            <li>The product was OKbased on the first bottle&#x27;s partial spray.</li>
            <li>It has a limited ability to detangle, but it certainly helps.</li>

            <li> and it makes it so soft!</li>
            <li> I just really wished it was a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Old wigg had added to wigg and what a difference</li>
            <li> Works very well for long wigs.</li>
            <li> AS LONG AS it NEVER touches your real hair.</li>
            <li> The product was OKbased on the first bottle&#x27;s partial spray.</li>
            <li> It has a limited ability to detangle, but it certainly helps.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t to obnoxious but it doesn&#x27;t to very well untangling my wigs and the bottle was a little smaller then expected.</li>
            <li> it goes by so fast :-/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosplayer and i have several long wigs that are knotted and tangled.</li>
            <li> I found this took a long time to comb through.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Not a very good deal for doing a DECENT job at keeping my wigs manageable.</li>
            <li> does not untangle wigs just wets them and leaves a citrus scent also takes a very long time to ship</li>
            <li> This did just what it says, it helped me comb out a very long wig with ease.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair dry</li>
            <li> dont buy it.makes the hair dry</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the ounces and it took almost a month to get to me total waste I should have just went to my local bss.</li>
            <li> I have a wig that basically had been a tangled mess for about a decade (!)</li>
            <li> The bottle is a little smaller than I thought though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no real problems with this item</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> That formed a wet stick mess.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t weight my hair down or leave a build up, or residue.</li>
            <li> I tried dozens of other products, they were a waste of my money and time.</li>
            <li> I bought it, took it home, washed it, and used this spray after it dried.</li>
            <li> It felt oily and stiff.</li>
            <li> All this does is make your weave sticky and stiff.</li>
            <li> i bought 2 bottles of this product: the first bottles spray pump leaked around the base of  the pump and down onto the face of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t realize it was so small.</li>
            <li> It is a small bottle but has lasted well.</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t read the description well because it is a small bottle</li>
            <li> I got the small bottle</li>
            <li> definitely small...</li>
            <li> It was so small</li>
            <li> Dont LEARN THE HARD WAY...</li>
            <li> Just sucks</li>
            <li> Noy bad wish it was a bigger bottle though.</li>
            <li> but hate you can&#x27;t purchase it in any store, only online.</li>
            <li> I do not know if I used this product wrong or what.</li>
            <li> The wig I used it on didn&#x27;t usually tangle very badly, but after wearing it at a convention for 7</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Like I did :(</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed on this product.</li>

            <li> The spray pump does not work.  i bought 2 bottles of this product: the first bottles spray pump leaked around the base of  the pump and down onto the face of the bottle.  That formed a wet stick mess.  The product was OKbased on the first bottle&#x27;s partial spray.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE PRODUCT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the price for the amount that I got!&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely reorder.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully they will have a 2 for 1 or package deal!</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and works really well with my wigs my only problem was the size but it was my fault for not checking ounces but still the price was decent and it was worth it..defiantly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Great Stuff!!! I use it on my human hair and synthetic wigs. It detangles them and it smells good too! It really works. I&#x27;m definitely ordering more. It&#x27;s a great price and free shipping. Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> It is ok but I didn&#x27;t realize it was so small. I didn&#x27;t read the content and ounces.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything for the wigs.  I had to go and purchase another product.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> And it works well too. Make sure you&#x27;re aware how tiny it is though</li>
            <li> Just wish it was a bigger bottle</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me.</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected. I have a lot of wigs and will definitely get this again. Does not take as much as I worried either. It is a small bottle but has lasted well. I wear a wig almost every day and have had this for some time now.</li>
            <li> Ok so I know the name of the product may confuse people. But its a great spray for weaves and wigs. If u want a product that&#x27;s gonna give ur hair unit life, vitality, bounce, shine, and manageable this is it. My unit lasted for like 2 months, and it was synthetic hair. It didn&#x27;t weight my hair down or leave a build up, or residue. I sewed in some synthetic hair for my mom and her hair lasted 2 months no tangles at all. The hair didn&#x27;t look waxie, or anything. I tried dozens of other products, they were a waste of my money and time. This is a must have. A must for any and all wig weave extension lovers. It&#x27;s the best investment for ur units.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS, BUT MY PROBLEM IS I PAID THE SAME AMOUNT FOR A 2 OUNCE WHICH IS WHAT THIS IS AND THEY HAVE THE SAME THING AT THE BEAUTY SUPPLY STORE IN AN 8 OUNCE FOR THE SAME DAMN PRICE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no real problems with this item and I&#x27;ve been through two bottles! I&#x27;ve used it to untangle  loads of wigs, the smell is pleasant enough, and the bottles have worked so I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone who asked.  They are kinda small, one lasted one con, prepping three medium length wigs beforehand and three long ones at the event, so it&#x27;s worth what you pay for it.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t like this product at all. It leaves my hair dry and course so I stopped using it. It really doesn&#x27;t do what it says on the product review. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosplayer and i have several long wigs that are knotted and tangled. I use lotion to condition the wigs. I found this took a long time to comb through. My Friend recommended this to me and i tried it on my shorter wig and it made it look like and feel like when it first came out of the box! It smells really great too hehe. Can&#x27;t wait to use this on my longer wigs and i&#x27;m sure it will work. I just really wished it was a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t read the description well because it is a small bottle just be prepared otherwise it is a good product I would order it again</li>
            <li> I do not know if I used this product wrong or what. It said spray it in and do not rinse. When I did this My wig got gross. It felt oily and stiff.</li>
            <li> I finally found a product that&#x27;s works great on my synthetic wigs. It last all day . I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I love this so much oh my gosh is it a life saver!! literally sprayed 3 times all around my wig, Brushed them out, and boom they smelt WONDERFUL oh my gosh its like having a bowl of fruit on your head! it made them super super soft, smell nice, de-tangle easier, and it well worth the money! It gives your well used wigs a well deserved break. Theyre nice and cleaned smelling, the look cleaned, they ARE clean. I love this product, i couldnt be happier, can i give it 6 stars?!</li>
            <li> This has a beautiful smell, but I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my hair once it dried.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it on my weave clientS</li>
            <li> Smells really good and makes my dog nice and shiny and detangles it</li>
            <li> I very recently started wearing wigs and realized there&#x27;s a lot more to it than I realized, maintenance-wise. I used this on one of my wigs that had gotten a bit tangled and it pretty much did all the work for me. All I had to do was slide the comb through a few times and it was as good as new... and it smells great!</li>
            <li> All this does is make your weave sticky and stiff. I&#x27;ve used it on the cheapest of hair and virgin hair and the last thing this spray does is condition or DETANGLE.</li>
            <li> it smells so great i can&#x27;t wait until i get my wig to use it im so excited!!!! :)</li>
            <li> This worked very well at untangling my Twilight Sparkle wig from MapOfBeauty. The wig I used it on didn&#x27;t usually tangle very badly, but after wearing it at a convention for 7+ hours it got kind of snarled up. A few mists of this really helped at getting the knots out of it and my wig looks as good as new!</li>
            <li> It did a good job and I&#x27;m glad I tried it out.  It is a smaller bottle, but you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> does not untangle wigs just wets them and leaves a citrus scent also takes a very long time to ship</li>
            <li> I brought this item at first when you spray it in your weave it feels fine, but when it dry your hair is very sticky.</li>
            <li> Very very small bottle but great for travel size in my purse</li>
            <li> i use on my hair not a wig and it makes it so soft!</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders on my human hair and synthetic wigs.</li>
            <li> great product arrived on time:)</li>
            <li> dont buy it.makes the hair dry</li>
            <li> Small bottle, but works very well!</li>
            <li> Great product which leaves your wig, weaves and natural hair soft. Excellent scent left on wigs and natural hair. Great on the go bottle.</li>
            <li> Had this before love the smell works great on wig and is well worth the money but make sure u look at how many OZ u get I got the small bottle oops</li>
            <li> Noy bad wish it was a bigger bottle though. It did give my wigs new life though!</li>
            <li> Works and smells great!</li>
            <li> This product seems to work ok. The smell isn&#x27;t to obnoxious but it doesn&#x27;t to very well untangling my wigs and the bottle was a little smaller then expected. But it came in the mail quickly and at this price I couldn&#x27;t turn it away.</li>
            <li> Dude this S*** is awesome!! Lol &#x27; it does exactly what it says it will. It detangles, softens and freshens the hair while smelling delish all at the same time. Just sucks it goes by so fast :-/</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed on this product. Didn&#x27;t work as a conditioner should on a human hair wig. Would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I saw this product being used on you tube on several videos, figure I would try it out. I like the product but hate you can&#x27;t purchase it in any store, only online. Overall it smells good and does a great job on detangling and conditioning your hair.</li>
            <li> Smells delightful and restores the natural sheen. It has a limited ability to detangle, but it certainly helps. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Works amazing but really small bottle</li>
            <li> definitely small...one spray and its finish</li>
            <li> This did just what it says, it helped me comb out a very long wig with ease. Love it and will buy again!&lt;br /&gt;Big bonus is that the scent freshens the wig.</li>
            <li> Works very well for long wigs.</li>
            <li> Works nice and fast shipping great product will buy again</li>
            <li> The smell is ok. It&#x27;s a good detangler.</li>
            <li> So I originally bought this for my current cosplay wigs I have. Today, I found a new wig at a thrift store that was pretty tangled. I bought it, took it home, washed it, and used this spray after it dried. It made it look like a brand new wig! I wish I remembered to take pictures. However, this is a great product for people who cosplay and buy cheaper wigs. The bottle is a little smaller than I thought though. But oh well.</li>
            <li> Smells great but comes in a TINY spray bottle. For $8+? No thanks. Not a very good deal for doing a DECENT job at keeping my wigs manageable.</li>
            <li> Great product would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I received this a couple days days ago and this product is really good. I sprayed it on a synthetic ponytail hair piece and it looked like new and smelled GREAT!! I wished I could use it on my own hair. Great value. ..pick one up its for real!</li>
            <li> it does what it says, I need to get more. Old wigg had added to wigg and what a difference</li>
            <li> I have a wig that basically had been a tangled mess for about a decade (!) - I misted it with this and used a wire wig brush and within about five minutes I had a wig that looks brand new and smells amazing. It&#x27;s not greasy, comes in a nice pump that sprays an even amount of mist, and works immediately to condition and detangle synthetic and human hair alike. My wig is synthetic and I swear it looks even better than when it was brand new now that I&#x27;ve used this spray on it. I just used a few pumps as I went on each area I styled/detangled, so I&#x27;d be sure not to use too much since I&#x27;d never used it before. The wig looks fabulous now. And the seller is fantastic - this arrived immediately and was packaged beautifully. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It was so small I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the ounces and it took almost a month to get to me total waste I should have just went to my local bss.</li>
            <li> Miracle worker!!! Absolutely love this product.  Can turn any unmanageable weave manageable.</li>
            <li> Great Detangler! I use it on my cosplay wigs. Keeps them Shiney without leaving them greasy. Smells good too!</li>
            <li> This is my ever purchase of a wig detangler, it has a great tangerine smell to it and fits in my purse nicely. I only gave it 4 stars because I&#x27;ve had it for a month and 1/2 the bottle is gone already. I wish it would last longer.</li>
            <li> DO NOT use this on your Real hair. I have a quick weave and I am now nearly Bald. Use this ONLY ON THE Weave PART. This is like NAIR on real hair. It matted my real hair with the glue and more than an Orange Size ball of hair combed out...TWICE... B4 I realized it was this. It works great on weave AS LONG AS it NEVER touches your real hair. Dont LEARN THE HARD WAY...Like I did :(</li>
            <li> She says it works excellent to comb or brush the hair out, without pulling out the hairs in the wig.</li>
