    <ol>
            <li>Excellent as always.</li>
            <li>This item is good.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>and they didnt fit any of them well.they are great for wrk boots</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this product for about 7 months and was getting some kind of pain on the ball of my foot.</li>
            <li>They are nearly perfect when you put a high quality rubber insole on top of them.</li>
            <li>and they are very comfortable now.</li>
            <li>fine.i had to remove the front springs,because they killd my feet.after removing them their perfect.i love the springs in the heel.i</li>
            <li>Excellent Insoles Spring loaded, Only insoles I have purchased that truly keep the heel spur pain away!!</li>
            <li>I am a power walker (I walk more than 30 miles/week)...</li>
            <li>Better yet, buy something else.</li>
            <li>I am glad that is working for some people, but please make sure the pads are located under your foot on the right place.</li>
            <li>These were fine for about a week, then they gave out.</li>
            <li>do NOTget this because the will be no room to fit your foot.</li>
            <li>i bought these insoles for my wrk boots which fit</li>
            <li>Cut them to fit shoe to try them on and now stuck with them.</li>
            <li>The walking is more comfortable and the support is good for the arches (flat though they may be).  </li>
            <li>Meaning if u can&#x27;t take out the original innersole</li>
            <li>It looks like click pen springs cut into 8ths.&lt;br /&gt;Remove or reinforce front springs and they might be worth thinking about.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But other than that its a good insole.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking at it right now.</li>
            <li>(It came right off with 2 fingers)</li>
            <li>The right insole heel spring began to creak.</li>
            <li>Although, they felt great on my heels the inserts send me back to the podiatric and several injection.</li>
            <li>I had purchased some when they first hit the market.</li>
            <li>I have high arches but love my flat skater shoes.</li>
            <li>I expected a lil more.</li>
            <li>so they sent me a replacement pair (after I provided them with a picture of the defective insole) without me having to mail back the original set.</li>
            <li>first set fell apart poor manufacturing i had to use good automotive glue to fix,they did send me another pair</li>
            <li>The heel is too high putting all my weight on the front of my feet.</li>
            <li>I always wear these in my work shoes in a factory on concrete.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what all the hype was about these insoles, I gave them a few weeks just to make sure my feet didn&#x27;t need to adjust to them</li>
            <li>Great for about 2 weeks until the &amp;#34;spring?&amp;#34; under the last joint in my big toe on both feet, felt like a small stone you can&#x27;t remove.</li>
            <li>but instead I&#x27;ll end this endorsement by saying that I just ordered three more pairs of these insoles so that I can replace my other orthotics with them in the various shoes I regularly wear.  </li>
            <li>So I thought I&#x27;d try this product and was very pleasantly surprised that it actually works!!!  </li>
            <li>Too thick to fit in any shoe.</li>
            <li>I took mine out and its still pretty tight in there.</li>
            <li>The first pair I received were defective (one set of springs was missing on one of the insoles)</li>

            <li> the insoles were a little high for my shoes so had my shoes streched</li>
            <li> They cause me lots of pain under the last joint in my big toe on both feet, felt like a small stone you can&#x27;t remove.</li>
            <li> Kinda high in the front behind your toes.</li>
            <li> you move on foot, consider other insoles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five star is because it really honestly is really thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 72 years old and have flat feet and degenerative arthritis in both big toes...very painful.  </li>
            <li> I tried not wearing them one day and my body was missing them because of the support.</li>
            <li> The front &amp;#34;springs&amp;#34; with the rubbery gel those not fit under the ball of your foot where it should be and instead was by my toes to far forward creating sharp pain and so bad that I got a MRI because of the severe pain.</li>
            <li> The heel &amp;#34;springs&amp;#34; did not push through the hard plastic casing.</li>
            <li> Too hard on soles, metatarsals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just add that the company DOES stand behind their product.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product.  </li>
            <li> Step on them before cutting them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying and I am not using them anymore.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This item is good. It came on time and had the comfort I was looking for. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five star is because it really honestly is really thick. Meaning if u can&#x27;t take out the original innersole do NOTget this because the will be no room to fit your foot. I took mine out and its still pretty tight in there. But other than that its a good insole.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all the hype was about these insoles, I gave them a few weeks just to make sure my feet didn&#x27;t need to adjust to them but these insoles hurt my feet, give no cushion and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get them out of my work boots.</li>
            <li> i bought these insoles for my wrk boots which fit fine.i had to remove the front springs,because they killd my feet.after removing them their perfect.i love the springs in the heel.i tried these insoles in all my shoes and they didnt fit any of them well.they are great for wrk boots</li>
            <li> Great for about 2 weeks until the &amp;#34;spring?&amp;#34; under the last joint in my big toe on both feet, felt like a small stone you can&#x27;t remove. I&#x27;m looking at it right now. The heel &amp;#34;springs&amp;#34; did not push through the hard plastic casing. The front &amp;#34;springs&amp;#34; are in a rubbery gel which they push aside and get to the waffle plasticy rubber and then your foot.&lt;br /&gt;I just pulled the gel off. It looks like click pen springs cut into 8ths.&lt;br /&gt;Remove or reinforce front springs and they might be worth thinking about.&lt;br /&gt;If you move on foot, consider other insoles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the pic the gel was removed (It came right off with 2 fingers) easily.&lt;br /&gt;That gel is on the bottom originally.&lt;br /&gt;Between the springs and foot are waffle rubbery plastic.</li>
            <li> I have high arches but love my flat skater shoes. problem solved.</li>
            <li> I always wear these in my work shoes in a factory on concrete. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different insoles and can&#x27;t seem to do without them. I tried not wearing them one day and my body was missing them because of the support. They are nearly perfect when you put a high quality rubber insole on top of them.</li>
            <li> A++ all around. Product EXCEEDED my expectations!! Walk 5 miles a day--cleared up my heel pain!</li>
            <li> Excellent Insoles Spring loaded, Only insoles I have purchased that truly keep the heel spur pain away!! Was on my feet for 8 hours today!!</li>
            <li> Good but they got noisy after a week. The right insole heel spring began to creak. It&#x27;s annoying and I am not using them anymore.</li>
            <li> I had purchased some when they first hit the market. I lost one shoe and didn&#x27;t have access to any nowhere. Until I checked amazon and found them! Excellent as always. &amp;#34;If you need something you can&#x27;t find anywhere, go to Amazon.com they always come through for you.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this product for about 7 months and was getting some kind of pain on the ball of my foot. Although, they felt great on my heels the inserts send me back to the podiatric and several injection. They cause me lots of pain under the last joint in my big toe on both feet, felt like a small stone you can&#x27;t remove. The front &amp;#34;springs&amp;#34; with the rubbery gel those not fit under the ball of your foot where it should be and instead was by my toes to far forward creating sharp pain and so bad that I got a MRI because of the severe pain. I am glad that is working for some people, but please make sure the pads are located under your foot on the right place.</li>
            <li> the insoles were a little high for my shoes so had my shoes streched and they are very comfortable now.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product.  I am a power walker (I walk more than 30 miles/week)...I&#x27;m 72 years old and have flat feet and degenerative arthritis in both big toes...very painful.  I&#x27;ve used Podiatrist created orthotics for years.  So I thought I&#x27;d try this product and was very pleasantly surprised that it actually works!!!  The walking is more comfortable and the support is good for the arches (flat though they may be).  I could go on and on, but instead I&#x27;ll end this endorsement by saying that I just ordered three more pairs of these insoles so that I can replace my other orthotics with them in the various shoes I regularly wear.  I&#x27;ll just add that the company DOES stand behind their product.  The first pair I received were defective (one set of springs was missing on one of the insoles) so they sent me a replacement pair (after I provided them with a picture of the defective insole) without me having to mail back the original set.</li>
            <li> Kinda high in the front behind your toes. I expected a lil more. They work but not a big improvement from regulat insoles.</li>
            <li> These were fine for about a week, then they gave out.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time on my feet, after day two with these my feet are killing me. The heel is too high putting all my weight on the front of my feet. After about 20 minutes of walking around I&#x27;m limping with these.</li>
            <li> first set fell apart poor manufacturing i had to use good automotive glue to fix,they did send me another pair</li>
            <li> One of the orthotics started sqeeking making noise</li>
            <li> Too hard on soles, metatarsals. No arch support. Too thick to fit in any shoe. Cut them to fit shoe to try them on and now stuck with them. Step on them before cutting them. Better yet, buy something else.</li>
