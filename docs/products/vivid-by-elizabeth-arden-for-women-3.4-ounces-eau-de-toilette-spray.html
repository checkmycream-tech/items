            <li>My all time favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This has been my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume for years.</li>
            <li>but I did want purchasers to know that this is NOT the ORIGINAL version but a darn good copy so since they have quit making my beloved VIVID</li>
            <li>I was so excited I ordered 5 bottles!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available once again.</li>
            <li>the price is cheap.</li>
            <li>When I got the bottle, I was surprised at how good it, still, smelled on me.</li>
            <li>She said it arrived quickly and was well packed.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied and now with two bottles hopefull it will last until another like it comes along.</li>
            <li>Vivid is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many of Liz Claiborne&#x27;s scents - Vivid and Liz Claiborne (the one in the triangle bottle) are my &#x27;go-to&#x27; scents.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to have it back;)</li>
            <li>my bottles of original have been around a LONG time the scent sticks more, but who knows?  </li>
            <li>Vivid by Liz Claiborne is a fabulous perfume I have worn for years.</li>
            <li>It was very fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>but it smelled exactly as I remembered at a very reasonable price</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s nothing quite as flattering as when a breeze carries your perfume to a stranger and they like it so much they have to come over and ask you what you&#x27;re wearing!</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>I think this product was a knock off of the real product.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the real thing.</li>
            <li>The smell is very muskish and not my type.</li>
            <li>If she&#x27;s gettin what she wants then</li>
            <li>I have been using this perfume for several years and it is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This was a brand new in the box, 3.4 oz large spray bottle</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and package is like new.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the smell, maybe if I was 40 years older.</li>
            <li>Vivid is probably #2 on my fragrance list; #1 in affordability!  </li>
            <li>So that being said, the fragrance is of high quality and smells pretty much the same but scent does not last as long as the original.  </li>
            <li>However, when I received them I noticed that the bottle no longer says LIZ CLAIBORNE underneath the Vivid name</li>
            <li>I give Vivid Five Stars</li>
            <li>and I sent it directly to her</li>
            <li>in an hour or so the scent disappears, i usually spray directly on my wrist...and there isnt any lingering scent as the original.</li>
            <li>I used to use Vivid perfume but haven&#x27;t for a long time.</li>
            <li>but this particular one...has the same smell kinda, and doesnt last long....</li>
            <li>it is her favorite fragrance and has become hard to find in the last few years.  </li>

            <li> I ordered this product for my daughter. She was delighted with it. Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> I havent been able to find this fragrence in the store and was leary of ordering on line but it smelled exactly as I remembered at a very reasonable price</li>
            <li> My wife loved this happy wife happy life it smells awesome</li>
            <li> I love this scent! It has been my favorite for twenty years. I never stop receiving compliments.</li>
            <li> Vivid is my favorite perfume. When I could no longer find it in the stores I usually purchase it, I found it on Amazon. It was very fast and efficient. I&#x27;ll purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I was so happy that I found what I was looking for at Amazon. I received notice per e-mail that my order had been mailed. When I arrived home it was there the same day. What a suprise. Great service!!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.  I have been purchasing it for the last 10 years.  Only perfume I use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter it is her favorite fragrance and has become hard to find in the last few years.  This was a brand new in the box, 3.4 oz large spray bottle and I sent it directly to her and she loved it!!  She said it arrived quickly and was well packed.</li>
            <li> If you have been a long time user of this perfume like I have, you will know that this product was discontinued sometime around the year 2000, though I have no idea why!  It has been EXTREMELY hard to find for a decent price until this month when it showed up here on Amazon for ~ $32.  I was so excited I ordered 5 bottles!  However, when I received them I noticed that the bottle no longer says LIZ CLAIBORNE underneath the Vivid name so I checked the bottom of the bottle and it is not manufactured by LIZ but by EA Fragrances.  When I googled them, I found out that they are a type of &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34; perfume distributor, there FB page says - &amp;#34;We Provide you luxury High quality Copy Fragrances with best Prices &amp; even better prices for amounts&amp;#34;.  So that being said, the fragrance is of high quality and smells pretty much the same but scent does not last as long as the original.  Why, I do not know, I can only speculate that maybe bc my bottles of original have been around a LONG time the scent sticks more, but who knows?  I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I did want purchasers to know that this is NOT the ORIGINAL version but a darn good copy so since they have quit making my beloved VIVID I will continue to purchase from here.  PLEASE continue to make this fragrance, EA Fragrances!!</li>
            <li> What a treat to find this cologne again.  I had used it for years, but could no longer find it.  I am thrilled to have it back;)</li>
            <li> Vivid is probably #2 on my fragrance list; #1 in affordability!  I&#x27;ve used many of Liz Claiborne&#x27;s scents - Vivid and Liz Claiborne (the one in the triangle bottle) are my &#x27;go-to&#x27; scents.</li>
            <li> I think this product was a knock off of the real product. It is not the same as I have been using and I&#x27;m very disappointed that I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent!  I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available once again.</li>

            <li> This perfume is easily the best smelling perfume I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I get nothing but compliments from everyone who smells it on me...there&#x27;s nothing quite as flattering as when a breeze carries your perfume to a stranger and they like it so much they have to come over and ask you what you&#x27;re wearing! I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> Vivid by Liz Claiborne is a fabulous perfume I have worn for years. I recently purchased this product, and it is NOT Vivid by Liz Claiborne. It&#x27;s a total fake. Doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the real thing. Wrong package, cheap bottle. Stay away from this product!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell, maybe if I was 40 years older. The smell is very muskish and not my type.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and could not find it anywhere.  It&#x27;s alright I guess.  i give it 5 stars because it made her happy that I found it for her!...and that&#x27;s all that matters right!  If she&#x27;s gettin what she wants then that means i&#x27;m getting what i want...har d har har!</li>
