            <li>Awesome buy, recommend for processed hair</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!!!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and thought I had a great deal buying this product.  </li>
            <li>It feels great and well moisturized once you put it on your hair but</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>This is one of those products that gives your hair moisturization, shine, and a great smell.</li>
            <li>I really loved this cream.  </li>
            <li>Rub it really good between you</li>
            <li>smells super awesome</li>
            <li>today, my hair looks really nice and feels good.  </li>
            <li>It was effective on my hair and my kids.  </li>
            <li>smells good, but not for my hair tho, need something with more oil in it.  </li>
            <li>Mizani&#x27;s Rose H2O hairdress has been used by my daughter since she was a toddler</li>
            <li>Gave to someone who liked it.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and it isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li>So I decided to give the Rose H20 a shot.</li>
            <li>I like using the Mizani Rose H20 hairdress because if it non-greasy and very light.  </li>
            <li>I love the rose smell.</li>
            <li>The texture of this product is a very light cream...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use too much at once, it smells great.  </li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on how silky it looks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not awful, but I have drug store products that perform better.</li>
            <li>I skimmed the top with my finger, rubbed it in my hair.</li>
            <li>and, after 10 years, we still haven&#x27;t found anything that works better.</li>
            <li>I love the richness of it and the way my hair seemed to soak it in.</li>
            <li>This is an ok product.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the results I got from this product.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with how it performs on my hair.</li>
            <li>The even better part is I don&#x27;t get any residue.</li>
            <li>The texture is really smooth and goes on really nicely.</li>
            <li>For me, I use what makes my 4c hair more</li>
            <li>I live in a humid area and this product helps with frizz control and fly away ends....</li>
            <li>I was willing to pay because I feel it makes my hair healthier, though I was very glad to find it cheaper online.  </li>
            <li>The Rose H2O adds moisture and shine without the greasy feeling and has a fresh smell.</li>
            <li>I tried the Mizani Butter Rich and it was okay.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Mizani Rose H2O.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Mizani products</li>
            <li>I am growing out my hair and needed something light.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, instantly pentrates and hydrates into my scalp.</li>
            <li>I wish that it were available in some of the beauty supply stores nearby, but it isn&#x27;t, so getting it online is a must.</li>
            <li>and i really loved how soft it made my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the rose smell of this hair moisturizer, but I feel that it doesn&#x27;t retain a lasting moisturize.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found Mizani night hair cream to be thicker and it supplied better lasting moisture for my hair than the Mizani Rose H20 cream...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the scent as much as the Butter Rich, but found this to worked much better on my 4C hair.</li>
            <li>Product not bad</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase again, but it is not a bad product.</li>
            <li>For this kind of price i expected more.</li>
            <li>I do think it IS worth it.</li>
            <li>i was pleased to find the complete line on amazon</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the smell, but had really mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>Unless you only wear your hair in a ponytail or pinned up, don&#x27;t buy if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>It really moisturized well.  </li>
            <li>i am relaxing my hair again and this keeps it very moisturized</li>
            <li>may be a year depending on how often and how much you use.</li>
            <li>and I knew not to use too much, so</li>
            <li>This product works really well for my daughter and myself.  </li>
            <li>i keep buying this one and it really works very well.</li>
            <li>but i still like my pink oil moisturizer way more.</li>
            <li>You do have to be able to stand smell of fake rose I suppose to want to use this.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and touchable and provides the right amount of shine.</li>
            <li>and I have found other things such as coconut oil that work better for my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair is fine and this product wasv way too heavy.</li>
            <li>At times it is a little to light</li>
            <li>We have soft, curly, hair.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Both my professional hair stylist</li>
            <li>There are now only two places where I live that have it and</li>
            <li>Not great, but better.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it for dray, relaxed hair, as well as dry, natural hair.</li>
            <li>And the smell was a little too much</li>
    </ol>

            <li> And the smell was a little too much</li>
            <li> the first time i used this my hair was natural, very dry and hard to manage.  </li>
            <li> product may be better for those who have thin texture hair due to its lightness ..</li>
            <li> You have to be careful not use too much, though, or it will weigh your hair down.  </li>
            <li> I use it on flat ironed hair.</li>
            <li> I just use it on my scalp after I shampoo to keep it from getting too dry.  </li>
            <li> my daughter&#x27;s hair looks dry again within 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> I thought I would hate it because I&#x27;ve been using all natural products for a while now, but I love how my hair and scalp react to it.</li>
            <li> just use a little and the product should last a long time</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s dry and damaged!</li>
            <li> Vaseline does the same and it cost a lot less</li>
            <li> but I feel this product fell a little short .</li>
            <li> Only need just a little.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> I works exactly as I expected on my hair.</li>
            <li> And just using the small amount I had was so greasy, that the gross feeling stayed even after washing my hands.</li>
            <li> Will try their other products</li>
            <li> looking forward to trying other items by mizani.</li>
            <li> On the other had if you are a person worried about ingredients, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years but seriously considered switching because it was getting harder and harder to find.  </li>
            <li> It has mineral oil, petroleum and other things that most naturals hate.</li>
            <li> This product is so oiled down with only God knows what that I can hardly stand it.  </li>
            <li> A must have for people who have thick and coarse hair because it doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair, making it easier to style.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> It provided needed moisture and does not weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I am black with relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my hair stylist for my hair type (kinky, tight curls)and</li>
            <li> and I use just a little bit of it.</li>
            <li> hands 1st and use just a little dab.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to nobody who don&#x27;t like musky harsh smellls.</li>
            <li> and I am heavy handed with product.</li>
            <li> And it seems to slow down my perpetual dandruff.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product, but when I got it I ignored the bad feeling I had about it.</li>
            <li> The cream is thick, very thick in the jar.</li>
            <li> This hairdress had an awful smell and tried to do a deep condition with but couldn&#x27;t get passed the smell, so washed out.  </li>
            <li> Once again, I&#x27;m very disappointed I wasted money on this product, but</li>

            <li> I really loved this cream.  I didn&#x27;t use too much at once, it smells great.  It was effective on my hair and my kids.  We have soft, curly, hair.  It really moisturized well.  I appreciate its price because of its quality.  I do think it IS worth it.</li>
            <li> the first time i used this my hair was natural, very dry and hard to manage.  my sister-in-law let me try this and i really loved how soft it made my hair.  i am relaxing my hair again and this keeps it very moisturized and i love it.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected. and at a savings.</li>
            <li> Vaseline does the same and it cost a lot less</li>
            <li> I only use Mizani products on my hair.  Since I started a year ago, My hair is healthier than it ever  has been.  I get many compliments on how silky it looks. The Rose H2O adds moisture and shine without the greasy feeling and has a fresh smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years but seriously considered switching because it was getting harder and harder to find.  There are now only two places where I live that have it and both of them charge over $20 per jar.  I was willing to pay because I feel it makes my hair healthier, though I was very glad to find it cheaper online.  You have to be careful not use too much, though, or it will weigh your hair down.  I just use it on my scalp after I shampoo to keep it from getting too dry.  One jar will usually last a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and thought I had a great deal buying this product.  This product is so oiled down with only God knows what that I can hardly stand it.  Beware.  this is the only product I have purchased, but I am not taking another chance!  Gets a 1 star for showing up at my door in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I am growing out my hair and needed something light.  At times it is a little to light so I mix with jojoba and coconut oil.  I used it last night and today, my hair looks really nice and feels good.  Not great, but better.</li>
            <li> I like this product..I live in a humid area and this product helps with frizz control and fly away ends....just use a little and the product should last a long time may be a year depending on how often and how much you use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!! It smells great, instantly pentrates and hydrates into my scalp. A must have for people who have thick and coarse hair because it doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair, making it easier to style.</li>
            <li> I am black with relaxed hair. I used to swear by this product, but I&#x27;m wondering if the ingredients have changed? I didn&#x27;t get the moisture or shine I&#x27;m used to. It&#x27;s not awful, but I have drug store products that perform better.</li>
            <li> Gives hair silky and shiny look. Will definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product cause my hair dresser had suggested it.  I love the rose smell of this hair moisturizer, but I feel that it doesn&#x27;t retain a lasting moisturize. It feels great and well moisturized once you put it on your hair but the moisture  feel is short lived. I&#x27;m a huge fan of Mizani products but I feel this product fell a little short . The texture of this product is a very light cream...I&#x27;ve found Mizani night hair cream to be thicker and it supplied better lasting moisture for my hair than the Mizani Rose H20 cream...Product not bad but just didn&#x27;t work for me. product may be better for those who have thin texture hair due to its lightness ..It won&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I thought I would hate it because I&#x27;ve been using all natural products for a while now, but I love how my hair and scalp react to it. It feels like I&#x27;m infusing my strands with moisture when I apply it. And it seems to slow down my perpetual dandruff. It doesn&#x27;t clog my scalp and I seal it in with olive and coconut oil. If you need something to moisturize your scalp, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> smells good, but not for my hair tho, need something with more oil in it.  thank U,,,,  Val</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product, but when I got it I ignored the bad feeling I had about it. The cream is thick, very thick in the jar. I read reviews before hand and I knew not to use too much, so I skimmed the top with my finger, rubbed it in my hair. It didn&#x27;t absorb AT ALL. And just using the small amount I had was so greasy, that the gross feeling stayed even after washing my hands. I don&#x27;t like this product, and I&#x27;m sending it to my mom who&#x27;ll probably make use of it somehow. Once again, I&#x27;m very disappointed I wasted money on this product, but whatever. I&#x27;d recommend L&#x27;oreal Everstrong Overnight Treatment, because it actually absorbs and it is NOT greasy.</li>
            <li> I find it to be too greasy and my daughter&#x27;s hair looks dry again within 24 hrs. Will try their other products</li>
            <li> Mizani&#x27;s Rose H2O hairdress has been used by my daughter since she was a toddler and, after 10 years, we still haven&#x27;t found anything that works better.</li>
            <li> This hairdress had an awful smell and tried to do a deep condition with but couldn&#x27;t get passed the smell, so washed out.  Gave to someone who liked it.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to nobody who don&#x27;t like musky harsh smellls.</li>
            <li> This product works really well for my daughter and myself.  It has a nice scent and it isn&#x27;t greasy.  Please the price and NOT be beat.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Mizani Rose H2O. I love the richness of it and the way my hair seemed to soak it in. It leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable. I am adding it to my hair care collection.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I can actually tell the difference in my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> This is an ok product. I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase again because of the price and I have found other things such as coconut oil that work better for my hair. I only use this when I straighten my hair and I use just a little bit of it. I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase again, but it is not a bad product. I don&#x27;t think it is conditioning enough for my hair.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that gives your hair moisturization, shine, and a great smell. I wish that it were available in some of the beauty supply stores nearby, but it isn&#x27;t, so getting it online is a must.</li>
            <li> My hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair is fine and this product wasv way too heavy. Won&#x27;t buy again and I got a refund.  Unless you only wear your hair in a ponytail or pinned up, don&#x27;t buy if you have fine hair. O! And the smell was a little too much</li>
            <li> Been using Mizani H2O for over 5 years now. It makes my hair soft and touchable and provides the right amount of shine. It was recommended by my hair stylist for my hair type (kinky, tight curls)and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the results I got from this product.  I works exactly as I expected on my hair.</li>
            <li> looking forward to trying other items by mizani. i keep buying this one and it really works very well. i recommend this to my friends and all products by mizani. i was pleased to find the complete line on amazon</li>
            <li> I like using the Mizani Rose H20 hairdress because if it non-greasy and very light.  It provided needed moisture and does not weigh my hair down.  Both my professional hair stylist and I recommend it for dray, relaxed hair, as well as dry, natural hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome buy, recommend for processed hair that&#x27;s dry and damaged!</li>
            <li> I love the rose smell. You do have to be able to stand smell of fake rose I suppose to want to use this. I am pleased with how it performs on my hair. Only need just a little. If I have any frizz I know this stuff will lay it to rest. I use it on flat ironed hair. Rub it really good between you hands 1st and use just a little dab. Run your hands thru your hair and watch that frizz die. When nothing else works this does.</li>
            <li> smells super awesome but i still like my pink oil moisturizer way more. For this kind of price i expected more.</li>
            <li> I tried the Mizani Butter Rich and it was okay. I really enjoyed the smell, but had really mixed reviews. So I decided to give the Rose H20 a shot. I didn&#x27;t like the scent as much as the Butter Rich, but found this to worked much better on my 4C hair. This stuff gives you shine like nobody business! And my hair just drinks this stuff up. I tell you this disappears as soon as I put it on my hair and I am heavy handed with product. The even better part is I don&#x27;t get any residue. The texture is really smooth and goes on really nicely. It also helps with the frizz. On the other had if you are a person worried about ingredients, this is not for you. It has mineral oil, petroleum and other things that most naturals hate. For me, I use what makes my 4c hair more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because of the scent*****</li>
