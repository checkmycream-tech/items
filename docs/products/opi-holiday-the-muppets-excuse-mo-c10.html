            <li>This is my favorite of The Muppets line!  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I ordered this color!</li>
            <li>Would recommend OPI polish for sure!</li>
            <li>Designer de Better underneath, but no one would know because you can&#x27;t see it after one (admittedly generous!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased!  </li>
            <li>This color is amazing.</li>
            <li>This color is nice, bought as a gift.</li>
            <li>I used  two coats to cover my nails, but it chipped very easily.  </li>
            <li>gorgeous color; dries quickly!  </li>
            <li>Maybe isn&#x27;t the best for professional adults to use on their hands</li>
            <li>Two coats was all I needed for full coverage, and it lasted about 5 days with a good top coat.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely loved the color and how it shimmers, not to mention it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with just one coat but did another anyway</li>
            <li>I love this color.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE this color.</li>
            <li>Still glittery, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love glitter polish</li>
            <li>I love OPI, but this wasn&#x27;t a hit for me.</li>
            <li>I want and will order more just</li>
            <li>I think it looks like a barbie party on my feet. :)</li>
            <li>A top coat is recommended.</li>
            <li>Love the name.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Either by itself or over another color, I love wearing it.</li>
            <li>This is such a great polish!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just cheerful!</li>
            <li>This color is lovely.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheerful and can be be used any time--great for summer!  </li>
            <li>I love the color, I just wished it wouldn&#x27;t chip so easily.</li>
            <li>This color is great, I love to use it as an accent top coat or for french nail tips.</li>
            <li>It adds just the right amount of sparkle if you like that kind of thing.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS BRAND AND COLOR IS A FUN ONE.  </li>
            <li>I do reccomend a good top coat to make it last even longer and to smooth out the roughness of the glitter.</li>
            <li>Now to be fair, it is clearly labelled as glitter polish, and that was one of the reasons I picked it out.  </li>
            <li>Best to wear a solid color under to really look</li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite color right now</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, this is definitely a fun color!</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try out this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite feminine, pretty, and even appropriate in conservative workplaces.  </li>
            <li>Fab color for glittery fun!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bright and has just enough glitter.</li>
            <li>I was able to get complete coverage in only two coats, which is so great with a glitter polish.</li>
            <li>I love, the entire Muppet&#x27;s Collection, but this is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>This is very pretty and girly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great sparkly pink and only takes two coats to make it look nice.</li>
            <li>I used it on top of a dark pink polish and it set it off perfectly!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s REALLY pretty on!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute and nice for a little girl</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it to my 9 year old neice, she&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I found it online because I LOVE having pink sparkly toes!</li>
            <li>I got it at a pedicure and had to come right now and buy it for myself.  </li>
            <li>but seriously fun and very girly!</li>
            <li>You really want to use a clear top and bottom coat with this product, though.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick service.</li>
            <li>Agree that the surface is rough, but the brilliant and dynamic colors make up for it.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be fun to wear occasionally, but I didn&#x27;t love it because it requires several coats of clear over top just too make the finished texture smooth.</li>
            <li>she diggs the texture going to be ordering more of Excuse Mo very soon !!</li>
            <li>The color is really pretty, but its a gel polish.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice in-between pink that you will reach for a lot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first glitter nail polish.  </li>
            <li>VERY GLITTERY!</li>
            <li>It looks so good on and last for a long time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very glittery</li>
            <li>Well, it wasn&#x27;t really the polish, it was the glitter.</li>
            <li>These types of colors do not show up very well.</li>
            <li>this is a glitter packed polish and doesn&#x27;t take much to cover</li>
            <li>Like most glitter polishes it is hard to remove but not nearly as bad as the Revlon glitter polishes.</li>
            <li>It only takes 2 coats to get full glitter coverage and it dries really fast.</li>
            <li>This particular color is a little bit more burgundy than I had hoped.</li>
            <li>The color was great, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t even stay on my nails for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>I bought two more bottles of this stuff since it&#x27;s a discontinued color, and I don&#x27;t know when OPI will come out with a similar pink tone.</li>
            <li>The color of this polish is more of a pink color than the deep fuschia that it appears to be in this picture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not dark enough to be funky and loud, but not light enough to be sheer or dainty.  </li>
            <li>like it does in the bottle so buy a similiar solid to wear as first coat....</li>
            <li>This is actually a cool pink.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always really hesitant to buy anything with glitter in it because nothing ever seems vibrant enough.</li>
            <li>Love this color, sparkles in a flashy way, easy to put on and when it starts to chip (as all polish does), you can throw on an extra coat and not tell you had a \\&quot;do-over\\&quot; coat.</li>
            <li>I had expected it to be more pink.</li>
            <li>It has really feminine colors of glitter and different sized pieces of glitter as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick enough to be worn on its own with just a couple coats.  </li>
            <li>(There&#x27;s a product I have yet to try by Seche Vite that apparently can restore goopy nail polish, drying nail polish...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very fun color, hard to take off.</li>
            <li>It has good coverage,but chips really soon which is annoying</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really looking forward to getting the other colors!</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m really looking forward to getting the other colors!</li>
            <li> It is a bit harder to remove after, but it is worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather difficult to remove if you don&#x27;t use a bottom coat, and the texture of the polish is HORRID - very rough, so use a top coat to help \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; the surface of your nails.  </li>
            <li> so I have the color for a long time.</li>
            <li> I use it over red or pink.  </li>
            <li> After a long debate on a color I finally decided on this pink</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t wear pink colors on my fingers, since I have really pale skin</li>
            <li> Maybe in the future I&#x27;ll try to find a solid pink that closely matches and do one coat of solid, one coat of glitter and see if it lasts a little longer.  </li>
            <li> coat of the Excuse Moi! polish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more difficult to remove</li>
            <li> The only downside to this polish is that it chips off quicker and easier than the solid colors (I had a chip within a few days of the pedi), which is probably par for the course for glitter polishes.  </li>
            <li> Ordering a second bottle now, as I know how hard it can be to get retired colors later.</li>
            <li> I usually end up having to coat the stuff on but this polish is totally different.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take nearly as many layers of polish to get the look you want when you start with a color base coat.  </li>
            <li> This is a light pink-berry glitter base color, with flecks of blue, green, silver, and pale pink glitter in it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty, glittery color with a pink base.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend starting with a base coat of a similar color when using the glitter polishes.  </li>
            <li> colors without a true base color.</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed.  </li>
            <li> complaint is that the glitter makes it scratchy.</li>
            <li> It goes on really thick.</li>
            <li> It has a really weird consistency.</li>

            <li> This is a perfect red/pink glitter look to accent with.  I used it on top of a dark pink polish and it set it off perfectly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always really hesitant to buy anything with glitter in it because nothing ever seems vibrant enough. I usually end up having to coat the stuff on but this polish is totally different. It&#x27;s fantastic! After a long debate on a color I finally decided on this pink and I do not regret it a bit. I was satisfied with just one coat but did another anyway and it looks great. It&#x27;s bright and has just enough glitter. I would definitely purchase this again and I&#x27;m really looking forward to getting the other colors!</li>
            <li> I love this color.  I got it at a pedicure and had to come right now and buy it for myself.  It&#x27;s thick enough to be worn on its own with just a couple coats.  The only downside to this polish is that it chips off quicker and easier than the solid colors (I had a chip within a few days of the pedi), which is probably par for the course for glitter polishes.  Maybe in the future I&#x27;ll try to find a solid pink that closely matches and do one coat of solid, one coat of glitter and see if it lasts a little longer.  Other than that though, love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS BRAND AND COLOR IS A FUN ONE.  THIS WILL BE A GREAT STOCKING STUFFER FOR OUR DAUGHTER.</li>
            <li> The color is gorgeous, very shiny and brilliant!  You really want to use a clear top and bottom coat with this product, though.  Why?  It&#x27;s rather difficult to remove if you don&#x27;t use a bottom coat, and the texture of the polish is HORRID - very rough, so use a top coat to help \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; the surface of your nails.  Love it, though!  Gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Got this color for my wife an she just loves it it&#x27;s very glittery an she diggs the texture going to be ordering more of Excuse Mo very soon !!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be fun to wear occasionally, but I didn&#x27;t love it because it requires several coats of clear over top just too make the finished texture smooth. and then it took a lot off effort to take the polish off. Well, it wasn&#x27;t really the polish, it was the glitter. Now to be fair, it is clearly labelled as glitter polish, and that was one of the reasons I picked it out.  I think i didn&#x27;t realize that it was actually going to have confetti type pieces in the polish.  If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, this is definitely a fun color!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE this color. It looks so good on and last for a long time. This has to be one of my favoirte OPI colors. You can wear it in the winter or summer and it would still look great.</li>
            <li> This particular color is a little bit more burgundy than I had hoped. I had expected it to be more pink. Still glittery, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love glitter polish so I was excited to try out this one. The color is really pretty, but its a gel polish. It has a really weird consistency. It goes on really thick. I love OPI, but this wasn&#x27;t a hit for me.</li>
            <li> This color is amazing. I absolutly love it! I want and will order more just so I have the color for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of The Muppets line!  It has really feminine colors of glitter and different sized pieces of glitter as well.  It&#x27;s REALLY pretty on!  I definitely recommend starting with a base coat of a similar color when using the glitter polishes.  It doesn&#x27;t take nearly as many layers of polish to get the look you want when you start with a color base coat.  I am so glad I ordered this color!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very fun color, hard to take off. it doesn&#x27;t just come off with a cotton ball and a nail polish remover, you gotta go in there and take it out with a pusher. but seriously fun and very girly!</li>
            <li> This is truly a &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; shade.  I use it over red or pink.  It adds just the right amount of sparkle if you like that kind of thing.</li>
            <li> This is very pretty and girly. Maybe isn&#x27;t the best for professional adults to use on their hands but it&#x27;s great for the toes.  I think it looks like a barbie party on my feet. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that the glitter makes it scratchy. A top coat is recommended.</li>
            <li> Great product. Thanks for the quick service. Keep up the great work! Would recommend OPI polish for sure! Thanks again!</li>
            <li> This color is great, I love to use it as an accent top coat or for french nail tips. Like most glitter polishes it is hard to remove but not nearly as bad as the Revlon glitter polishes. The shine and sparkle is great.</li>
            <li> This is easily the best glitter polish out of the Muppets collection.  It&#x27;s a great sparkly pink and only takes two coats to make it look nice.</li>
            <li> I love the color, I just wished it wouldn&#x27;t chip so easily. I know the sparkles make it so it is this way. Oh well.</li>
            <li> I gave this nail polish only three out of five stars because it&#x27;s another one of those &amp;#34;sparkle only&amp;#34; colors without a true base color. These types of colors do not show up very well.</li>
            <li> This is great color great for toes or fingernails. Excus Mo!! Love the name.&lt;br /&gt;But I think these might be out of print cause this the Muppets collection.</li>
            <li> Either by itself or over another color, I love wearing it.</li>
            <li> This came just when it was supposed to. I am glad that I found it online because I LOVE having pink sparkly toes! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is such a great polish! I was able to get complete coverage in only two coats, which is so great with a glitter polish. This is probably my favorite color right now and I&#x27;m already thinking about ordering another couple bottles so I don&#x27;t run out! I definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I love, the entire Muppet&#x27;s Collection, but this is my absolute favorite! Two coats was all I needed for full coverage, and it lasted about 5 days with a good top coat.  I work in a hotel, so a lot of people see my nails when I am checking guests in, and I got a lot of compliments for this one!</li>
            <li> This is actually a cool pink.  It&#x27;s not dark enough to be funky and loud, but not light enough to be sheer or dainty.  It&#x27;s quite feminine, pretty, and even appropriate in conservative workplaces.  It&#x27;s a nice in-between pink that you will reach for a lot.</li>
            <li> this is a glitter packed polish and doesn&#x27;t take much to cover but it is lighter than in the photo</li>
            <li> Product was a great price and arrived on time.  This is a beautiful nail polish!!  Can&#x27;t wait to get the rest of the Muppets 2011 holiday collection!!</li>
            <li> This is a light pink-berry glitter base color, with flecks of blue, green, silver, and pale pink glitter in it...it&#x27;s a smaller glitter than the others in the Muppet&#x27;s series, and I painted a coat of Designer de Better underneath, but no one would know because you can&#x27;t see it after one (admittedly generous!) coat of the Excuse Moi! polish. I also used two coats of topcoat to reduce the roughness of the glitter on my nails, but I knew it was glitter when I bought it, so no big deal. Normally I don&#x27;t wear pink colors on my fingers, since I have really pale skin and it tends to look \\&quot;precious\\&quot; but this stuff is so eye-catching it&#x27;s just cheerful! I bought two more bottles of this stuff since it&#x27;s a discontinued color, and I don&#x27;t know when OPI will come out with a similar pink tone. (There&#x27;s a product I have yet to try by Seche Vite that apparently can restore goopy nail polish, drying nail polish...so if I need it and it works I&#x27;ll let you know how that goes...)</li>
            <li> gorgeous color; dries quickly!  even glitter; doesn&#x27;t look tacky (in my opinion!)</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Brightly colored, good distribution of the glitter and durable. I do reccomend a good top coat to make it last even longer and to smooth out the roughness of the glitter.</li>
            <li> This color is nice, bought as a gift.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the color and how it shimmers, not to mention it arrived quickly.  It is a bit harder to remove after, but it is worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> This color is lovely.  Sparkly,  but wearable in the workplace.  Agree that the surface is rough, but the brilliant and dynamic colors make up for it.</li>
            <li> The color was great, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t even stay on my nails for 24 hours.  I used  two coats to cover my nails, but it chipped very easily.  I was pretty disappointed.  I&#x27;m actually going to just through this nail polish away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t paint my nails that often, but I bought this as a treat for myself.  It&#x27;s my first glitter nail polish.  I&#x27;m really pleased!  It only takes 2 coats to get full glitter coverage and it dries really fast.</li>
            <li> Fab color for glittery fun! Best to wear a solid color under to really look like it does in the bottle so buy a similiar solid to wear as first coat....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty, glittery color with a pink base. It has good coverage,but chips really soon which is annoying</li>
            <li> The color of this polish is more of a pink color than the deep fuschia that it appears to be in this picture. It&#x27;s cute and nice for a little girl but I wouldn&#x27;t wear it. I&#x27;ll give it to my 9 year old neice, she&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the OPI glitter nail polish for a family carnival. My niece had a nail polish station. After one blooper, we realized that the product hadn&#x27;t been shaken enough. After removing and repolishing, a coat of clear-coat was added and looked great! VERY GLITTERY!</li>
            <li> Love this color, sparkles in a flashy way, easy to put on and when it starts to chip (as all polish does), you can throw on an extra coat and not tell you had a \\&quot;do-over\\&quot; coat. Ordering a second bottle now, as I know how hard it can be to get retired colors later.</li>
            <li> This polish can be worn alone or over another color.  It&#x27;s cheerful and can be be used any time--great for summer!  It&#x27;s a little more difficult to remove but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
