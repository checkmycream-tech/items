            <li> Instead of taking hours for all the layers of my manicure, I can do a strengthener, a base coat, 2 layers of color, a sparkle coat and Seche Vite Fast Dry Top Coat in about 30-45 minutes with basically no drying time!  </li>

            <li> I bought this for me girlfriend along with some other polish and said it works better then other top coats she has used.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best top coat I have used.  I work in critical parts logistics and maintain natural nails.  This means that at any given time, I could be in a parts warehouse auditing process, moving stock, or needing to go into executive meetings with clients and managers.  My nails always look bright, shiny, and my polish rarely chips.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m pretty hard on my hands and i&#x27;m impatient. i&#x27;ve used other top coats before such as OPI but always had problems with it not drying fast enough and being soft even if it was dried so i would immediately have nick marks or gouges in my newly painted nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this stuff dries fast and it dries hard. LOVE it. especially when paired with the american classic gelous nail gel base. my nails are so pretty now and i can do all my every day stuff and no worries!</li>
            <li> I have a problem with nail polish chipping off my  [very short] nails. My daughter gifted me a bottle of Seche Vite and told me my problems were over. She was NOT kidding. I cannot tell you how impressed I am by it&#x27;s staying power. I play a few instruments and garden, indoors and out. Cook. This stuff really lasts! My biggest prob is with the darker colors that I like [such as &amp;#34;OPI, Jade is the new black&amp;#34; and dark blue, Brown and Black nail polishes] . You KNOW one chip at the tip of a nail is very obvious. S.V Really helps nails last at least a week or more. You can tell by the smell, it has an epoxy type smell to it, different than a regular clear nail polish top coat. Buy and Enjoy :-) [uploading a pic of a darker color I am wearing, so you can see how well the S.V protects even the darker colors]</li>
            <li> This really drys very quickly and give a nice glossy shine.</li>

            <li> BEST TOP COAT EVER!!! If you&#x27;re looking for a top coat that will dry extremely FAST and give you a glossy finished look this is it! This top gives my nails a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; look finish. Have been using it for about a year now and haven&#x27;t changed since!</li>
            <li> Best stuff. Got it fast.</li>
            <li> Seems to work quite well.  I&#x27;m very hard on my nails and my polish job lasted nearly a week with this.</li>
