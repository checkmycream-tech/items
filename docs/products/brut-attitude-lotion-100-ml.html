            <li>Application:&lt;br /&gt;Oh so very smooth!  </li>
            <li>Best that Brut ever made and the original is very good smell and my woman really gets close and doesn&#x27;t stop sniffing me till it wares out.</li>
            <li>B001A3DNY6 Van Der Hagen Deluxe Shave Soap]]</li>
            <li>to my expectations, this one has a very nice fragrance, and feels cool and nice.</li>
            <li>Purchased this at my Dollar Mart for $7.50 and Im glad I did.</li>
            <li>Unique for sure!</li>
            <li>and I was really pleased with the purchase</li>
            <li>Love the product&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>get many compliments on this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it.  </li>
            <li>but it is OK.  </li>
            <li>When I ware this Brut Attitude many times I&#x27;m asked what lotion am I wearing from everyone I&#x27;m around.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t sting that much and is quite good.</li>
            <li>This scent is more like a cool water or polo sport type scent.  </li>
            <li>Great after shave lotion, the only problem is that brut has now quit making it.  </li>
            <li>it were available in Walmart and or Walgreens.</li>
            <li>I got this one to see if it was anything like the original Brut I was trying to find.  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t care for it compared to the original</li>
            <li>I will admit I use Polo as my special occasion aftershave</li>
            <li>Citrusy, clean, and crisp.  </li>
            <li>Very nice fruity and Aqua Scent that dries down to a somewhat flowery but still manly and fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>Everything was first class</li>
            <li>My husband has a million colognes yet still loves his brut aftershave...pretty funny.</li>
            <li>, he doesn&#x27;t know how) and was very suprised to unwrap this.</li>
            <li>may very well out-rank Old Spice and Aqua Velva (two standards by which all after-shaves should be measured).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean sharp aroma not over powering.</li>
            <li>The price is a little higher but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>This smell goes well with my natural musk.</li>
            <li>I am an old school shaver</li>
            <li>this is a vast improvement over BRUT Musk (green bottle), and many other \\&quot;after-shaves\\&quot; that are torture to rub-in on a freshly shaved face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>brut attitude has a scent for the young adult male and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Not great, but an okay product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Everything was first class</li>
            <li> Not great, but an okay product. Pleasing aroma but short hold time. I would probably buy again for occasional use.</li>
            <li> This smell goes well with my natural musk.</li>
            <li> Brut Attitude- Great after shave lotion, the only problem is that brut has now quit making it.  Will keep ordering as long as it is in stock.  Have used this product for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> Purchased this at my Dollar Mart for $7.50 and Im glad I did. A glass bottle! Very nice fruity and Aqua Scent that dries down to a somewhat flowery but still manly and fresh smell. Unique for sure! Great smoothing and toning qualities. Will join in my regular rotation. I heard it has been discontinued so stock up!</li>
            <li> My husband has a million colognes yet still loves his brut aftershave...pretty funny. He loves the smell and the feel.</li>
            <li> my dad had looked everywhere for this (not online, he doesn&#x27;t know how) and was very suprised to unwrap this.</li>
            <li> I ordered Brut to act as my daily aftershave lotion.  I like the way it feels and smells after I shave and I like the price of it.  I will admit I use Polo as my special occasion aftershave but I use Brut on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> A great after shave lotion!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Many favorable comments from the ladies!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Wish it were available in Walmart and or Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Sad they don&#x27;t make these anymore. The fragrance was fresh and subtle. I loved it.</li>
            <li> i use this a lot and I was really pleased with the purchase</li>
            <li> Blue Brut?  Who knew?  There is also a red and black.  This scent is more like a cool water or polo sport type scent.  Citrusy, clean, and crisp.  If you&#x27;re a Brut fan, you should try it.</li>
            <li> Love the product&lt;br /&gt;I get many compliments on this fragrance. Long time customer. Price is right. Arrives on time and perfect packaging.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrific after shave splash!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product has been discontinued.  I love the smell of it.  I don&#x27;t like the regular Brut but this one is great!</li>
            <li> brut attitude has a scent for the young adult male and does not irritate my skin. The local stores do not have this product in stock.</li>
            <li> I can no longer find this lotion in any retail store. The price is a little higher but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Clean sharp aroma not over powering. Hard to find in retail shops.</li>
            <li> The Wife says: &amp;#34;You smell better!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I go this product for three things -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I like collecting after shave&lt;br /&gt;2) Brut is a good brand&lt;br /&gt;3) this bottle looked nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True to my expectations, this one has a very nice fragrance, and feels cool and nice. Doesn&#x27;t sting that much and is quite good. 5 stars as I could&#x27;t find any flaw in it. (careful wile opening the package as the bottle is of glass).</li>
            <li> Application:&lt;br /&gt;Oh so very smooth!  Your hands will glide over your face as you rub-this in.&lt;br /&gt;...this is a vast improvement over BRUT Musk (green bottle), and many other \\&quot;after-shaves\\&quot; that are torture to rub-in on a freshly shaved face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent:&lt;br /&gt;My wife fairly swooned over the aroma!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle:&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a glass bottle!  I am an old school shaver and I prefer the qualities of glass over plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accessibility:&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it is not one of Amazon&#x27;s Prime or Subscribe and Save items...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Ranking***&lt;br /&gt;This may very well out-rank Old Spice and Aqua Velva (two standards by which all after-shaves should be measured).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Testing Conditions:&lt;br /&gt;Old School 2-Pass Wet Shave twice daily (in shower).&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000QYEK88 Merkur 34C HD DE Razor]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004SGKMA0 Derby Extra DE Razor Blades]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00AGG3MNU Feather DE Razor Blades]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman Badger Hair Shaving Brush]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001A3DNY6 Van Der Hagen Deluxe Shave Soap]]</li>
            <li> I got this one to see if it was anything like the original Brut I was trying to find.  It wasn&#x27;t but it is OK.  I just don&#x27;t care for it compared to the original and I have found that now.</li>
            <li> Item was as described; it is hard to find this in local stores.</li>
            <li> Best that Brut ever made and the original is very good smell and my woman really gets close and doesn&#x27;t stop sniffing me till it wares out. When I ware this Brut Attitude many times I&#x27;m asked what lotion am I wearing from everyone I&#x27;m around. Great product. Buy IT!</li>
