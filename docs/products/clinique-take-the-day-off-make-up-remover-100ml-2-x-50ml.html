            <li> Great product.  I highly recommend this make up remover.</li>
            <li> I used this a few years ago and loved it. It&#x27;s the best eye make up remover that I&#x27;ve used so far and is very gentle. It leaves your eyes nicely moisturized afterwards, too.</li>
            <li> great product take lipstick right off could not live with out this</li>
            <li> If the product photo represents the product (as it should...) - these things are ancient! Even the samples are not produced with those green lids.  They are the shiny chrome finish.  I have old ♦old♦ ones in my cosmetics that have the shiny chrome tops.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my eyes and whole face, the best for eyes after trying different products.&lt;br /&gt;They are small, so despite is a little cheaper than the one you buy in clinic website or in a department store is not that Cheap considering the size, is fair price for amazon and the product is the same you can buy in the places mentioned before.

            <li> Very good product by Clinique - I bought this for my wife as she only uses Clinique. I can tell my wife is is very happy with the product. Clinique products are of the highest quality always. Highly recommended. Cheers!</li>
            <li> it removes makeup easily and its awonder ful product. not at all harsh on eyes and leave skin smooth.</li>
            <li> What a product!  I never used a traditional &amp;#34;make up remover&amp;#34; before  and recently had the opportunity to try this product -  it was great for effortlessly removing mascara!  I ordered it immediately and had it here in 2 days with Prime shipping!  Don&#x27;t be thrown off by the size of the bottles -  a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This removes my makeup well but I hate how oily it makes my face. I&#x27;d prefer the makeup remover pads</li>
            <li> Product as described &amp; prompt delivery !</li>
            <li> good value for the product</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.  It takes all of my eye makeup off in a matter of a couple swipes with a cotton ball.  I used to use those cleansing face wipes (well I still do, just not for my eyes anymore) and I would have to rub at my eyeliner for a while to get it off, which as we all know, is a no-no.  This stuff takes eye makeup off so easily without any pressure, just a gentle swipe.  It is a little oily feeling afterward, but I just GENTLY wipe off the residue with a face wipe (that I still use for the rest of my face) and voila! All done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wear contacts and I don&#x27;t have any problems with &amp;#34;cloudiness&amp;#34; after using it like I&#x27;ve heard people complain about with similar &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; cleansers.</li>
            <li> I love this make up remover! It is the only remover I have found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I wear false eyelashes&lt;br /&gt;and the glue comes off so easy with this remover! It&#x27;s a product I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> This has a terrible chemical smell to it, and it was pretty harsh on my sensitive skin especially since I needed it most in the eye area.</li>
            <li> I love this make up remover, It is very light</li>
            <li> I wear eyeliner that&#x27;s near impossible to wash off scrubbing with soap and water.  Clinique take the day off wipes my makeup off with ease, no scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy of the delicate under eye skin - Love it *The wife*</li>
