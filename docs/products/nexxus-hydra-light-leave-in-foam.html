    <ol>
            <li>This conditioner came along at the perfect time.</li>
            <li>Pantene Pro v Expert collection keratin repair which does an excellent job.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is the perfect balance.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care if they put baby fat and bat guano in the bottle--this stuff is VERY good.</li>
            <li>The hydradlight Weightless Conditioner smells great.</li>
            <li>I used to be a haircare rep and have tried everything, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, my wife seems happy with the product, though I don&#x27;t expect her to replace her salon products with it.</li>
            <li>The Nexxus Hydralight shampoo is equally great.  </li>
            <li>Gotta love Nexxus products to begin with but this one is really wonderful.  </li>
            <li>The scent for this conitioner wasn&#x27;t the best, I&#x27;ve used Nexxus products before &amp; they always seem to just do a okay job.</li>
            <li>It smells pleasant and works well.</li>
            <li>but I think it does a great job, and for me I think whatever gives you the best hair is worth any money ...</li>
            <li>it smells good, and it conditions your hair</li>
            <li>I recommend this as a good conditioner.</li>
            <li>Oh so good&#x27;, and</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells good and is light-weight.</li>
            <li>Well, yes it is, but it is a good product indeed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product succeeds.  </li>
            <li>The scent is also just ok and nothing really great smelling.  </li>
            <li>I like Nexxus as a brand a good deal, and they make many good products, but this is one I do not like.</li>
            <li>My hair feels amazing and is shiny.</li>
            <li>Both of us liked the product&#x27;s results, but neither of us would get it again.</li>
            <li>Personally, I liked the scent as well ...</li>
            <li>neutral (which makes it nice for either gender) and not overpowering (</li>
            <li>Rinse with warm</li>
            <li>/&gt;The consistency of the conditioner is nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s affordable now.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Plus, my hair does not seem to have build up, and it feels nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best of all, it&#x27;s a premium hair salon quality product, but at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It is floral, which is usually nice, but it is very strong in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I liked this much better than Nexxus Age Renewal conditioner.</li>
            <li>light smell for summer is good because bugs won&#x27;t be attracted to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful product and I am thrilled to have the choice of now customizing the look I want in different situations!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light, fruity, sweaty rotten smell to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE it, and when my Vine bottle is gone, I will be buying more, and that is the biggest compliment</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommendation: Absolutely love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>After many, many years of Nexxus</li>
            <li>But not this stuff, love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many conditioners in my time, and this is one I&#x27;d stick with the cheaper, dollar type conditioners.</li>
            <li>Perhaps this is a much better conditioner than others.</li>
            <li>Nexxus makes some of my favorite hair products [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Okay, I will admit it.</li>
            <li>The best I&#x27;ve tried so far is Tresemme Keratin Smooth Keratin Infusing Conditioner in terms of softness and ease of comb-through.</li>
            <li>and my hair stays healthy looking between trims.&lt;br</li>
            <li>recommend it as a nice, light product to moisturize hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The stuff at Best Western made this stuff look like a miracle</li>
            <li>Truthfully, while I did not want to believe it, I would say the product did deliver as marketed.  </li>
            <li>This is a light but not runny conditioner with a mild, pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>But it is pretty good</li>
            <li>okay, not too strong.</li>
            <li>Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Conditioner is a product that others in my household were more excited to try than myself.  </li>
            <li>Light and does a great job of moisturizing - it offers everything that I look for in a conditioner.</li>
            <li>Because of the way it keeps hair light and fluffy and the bright fragrance, I could see this being a great shampoo and conditioning combo for summertime.</li>
            <li>first thing I liked</li>
            <li>Trying out this Nexxus conditioner was the first time I&#x27;ve used Nexxus products, and combined with the matching shampoo I found I liked them quite a bit.</li>
            <li>all those with fine  hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;The conditioner itself was fine.</li>
            <li>normally wash my hair weekly or biweekly and need a conditioner that is light but still does a good job of smoothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s rather fine in texture.</li>
            <li>I splurged a little and found this works great!</li>
            <li>then but this is a great daily conditioner.</li>
            <li>I think I will use it in summer because it is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair</li>
            <li>My hair needs conditioner to be smooth</li>
            <li>The two together work well to keep hair light and fluffy, and give it a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>is the other thing; while I don&#x27;t like the smell during the shower....afterwards, the smell is light and clean and very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It also rinses out well and leaves you hair very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>My wife (who has much longer hair than I do!) tried out the product as well and enjoyed it as well.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t exactly help with that, but I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my head.</li>
            <li>but after a week of using with no change in results, I&#x27;m really not pleased or impressed.</li>
            <li>Provide quality moisturizing performance, while not adding significant residues to your hair.  </li>
            <li>It does work ok as a conditioner, and my hair was soft afterwards and fairly manageable but nothing to really rave about.</li>
            <li>I love it,gives me shiny bouncy soft  hair :) but as with everything you gotta try it for yourself .</li>
            <li>After two weeks I&#x27;ve noticed quite a nice change in the smoothness and softness of hair and also a clear lack of split ends (without a hair cut!)</li>
            <li>This product is a great in-between conditioner that I can use daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent and rinses with ease -- leave hair tangle free and light (not weighed down)</li>
            <li>but really it reminded me of some very cheap conditioners-</li>
            <li>Luckily it isn&#x27;t a strong scent - if it had been, I would have just tossed it right then and there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but you pretty much know exactly what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li>It really does look healthy.</li>
            <li>However, Nexxus&#x27;s products produce superior shine and make my older hair (I&#x27;m 48) look better overall.</li>
            <li>My hair is mid-back length, naturally curly and color treated, so using a good conditioner is very important to keep my hair from becoming frizzy and dry.  </li>
            <li>Nexxus Hydralight seemed a great solution for my fine hair that tends to get oily if I use heavy conditioners like Pantene or Dove.</li>
            <li>I prefer almost no scent (or one that leaves the hair quickly) and this Nexxus product made me sneeze repeatedly in the shower each time I used it.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is great since it does not weigh my hair down or make it greasy faster.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite conditonar.</li>
            <li>I have tried SO MANY hair lines, I have fine, blonde highlighted past shoulder length hair,I really thought this was lovely !!!</li>
            <li>I do not even know how to describe it - it is a putrid yet somewhat sweet smell and not sweet in a good way, it is a rotten sort of sweet...</li>
            <li>For my non-color-treated, fine, thick hair, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>Right before I requested this product as a vine request---I had my hair bleached blond for the very first time in my life.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t look like I stuck my finger in a light socket, thanks to Nexxus conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and way it leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>But too many of the professional beauty products are overrated (and overpriced) disappointments.</li>
            <li>It was mesmerizing.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get the layers to lay right now</li>
            <li>, right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is just a conditioner, right?  </li>
            <li>It is a fresh, clean, slightly citrus scent that rinses away nicely.</li>
            <li>- Instead of a fuller and shinier look, the Nexxus leaves my hair feeling light (weightless) and very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s similar in scent to the shampoo that goes with it, that a citrus scent to it, with very light floral undertones.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft, shiny and smooth when I blow-dried it, the waves stayed in, but the ends weren&#x27;t crispy and sticking up all over like before.</li>
            <li>seems to be exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker than basic Suave conditioners, but not as dense as many Pantene conditioners.</li>
            <li>I guess I just don&#x27;t know enough about conditioner to be able to tell.</li>
            <li>I just know this works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I am usually an avid Pantene user and was advised by my stylist to start switching shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners throughout the month to keep hair at</li>
            <li>Because of the smell, I threw it away, so I cannot rate this any higher than a</li>
            <li>The price is better than salon hair products and you get the same results.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re simply looking for something which improves texture while maintaining body and reducing frizz, then Tresemme is better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>First of all--I must make a disclaimer.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner does what a conditioner is supposed to do: it makes your hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Plus, when used with the matched shampoo, the hair care connoisseur in my home raved that the product team kept their hair light, while still keeping it soft.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Nexxus!</li>
            <li>After using the Nexxus conditioner several times I am pleased with how well it absorbs and leaves hair feeling softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more of a salon quality conditioner and work a little better than your normaL conditioners.  </li>
            <li>The first day I used it, I got my first compliment in a long while about how healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably better for someone with thinner hair that doesn&#x27;t need as much moisturizing as my Asian hair does.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually buy salon shampoo or conditioner, but I think these are a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>I use volume mousse and root booster (like always) and I have full soft volume</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s leaving my hair super soft, but not frizzy.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is white in color and has a very mild, barley-there fragrance.</li>
            <li>For color-treated or dry hair, you might want something more intensively conditioning.  </li>
            <li>For me I&#x27;ve been happy with several conditioners that I purchase for less than $5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This did both, though it isn&#x27;t better than some of the other conditioners that I&#x27;ve tried on the higher end of the scale.</li>
            <li>Plus, it really does have a salon look, feel and smell to it.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cut the tangles out, this would probably be great for thin hair or shorter hair.</li>
            <li>you know the kind that &#x27;knocks off&#x27; the big names but only cost a couple of dollars?</li>
            <li>Your hair will be soft and smooth and it will feel like it is naturally that way, not</li>
            <li>considering how many other products I use also.  </li>
            <li>It is better than any other product I can name.</li>
            <li>I probably will not be purchasing again because I can get other products that run through my hair better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mainly looking for something that will help me comb out my hair more easily while it is wet and add softness and body when it is dry.</li>
            <li>It just seemed to work ok for her and not like the other pricier brands that she normally uses.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another important thing to mention is that I have long hair;</li>
            <li>I rate conditioners on how well they take the tangles out of my hair, after a day of riding with the top down, my head out the window, or riding a bicycle without a helmet.  </li>
            <li>This was a fairly heavy conditioner for my very fine hair but worked well for my daughter.</li>
            <li>(I found it best to leave it on for a few minutes) but the payoff is hair that is light and breezy (not stripped dry or coated with waxy soap scum).</li>
            <li>I tried using less and rinsing more (just in case)</li>
            <li>It is June, the weather has been rainy and muggy, and my layered, naturally wavy hair has that Brillo pad look, especially on top at the ends of the layers.</li>
            <li>Her hair comes out soft and smooth, even with a different brand of shampoo.</li>
            <li>It keeps hair light and fluffy, and still keeps it smooth enough that brushing through wet hair is easy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;ll be buying this stuff regularly, but once in a while it&#x27;s probably worth the expense.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Given those instructions the user should not need nearly as much as normal conditioners (seems like sort of a spot treatment for the tips</li>
            <li>but it is easily weighed down.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad after it&#x27;s rinsed and my hair is dry, but while I&#x27;m using it, it&#x27;s a little too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li>I used A LOT of it and ended up having to add my usual conditioner on top of it, to detangle my hair and get a conditioned feel.</li>
            <li>I usually just love Nexxus hair products.</li>
            <li>The conditioning is light and it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down at all.</li>
            <li>and I have to apply hair serums or sprays to smooth it down.</li>
            <li>However, the scent is really strong and harsh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to use this conditioner on a daily basis, it isn&#x27;t weighing my hair down</li>
            <li>It is easy to use too much of this stuff because you hardly know it is there when you are working it into your hair.</li>
            <li>, I wouldn&#x27;t say it is really damaged so maybe not a fair test, but it is supposed to be a light conditioner , I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is long, thick, and full, so it can take a fair amount of conditioner and not look weighed down.</li>
            <li>for the price, yes it is a little more than regular brands</li>
            <li>They clearly are salon-level in terms of how your hair will look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product surprised me.  </li>
            <li>still gave it 3 stars as it keeps the hair soft and non-greasy and works out well if I use a frizz control spray while styling my hair.</li>
            <li>A recent highlighting job dried the ends out even more.</li>
            <li>and I have pretty dry hair</li>
            <li>The effects are pretty immediate even before blow drying, I noticed the softness that seems to last even though some pretty heavy weather and workouts.</li>
            <li>My wife is pretty careful about what she puts in her hair.</li>
            <li>Let me preface by saying she colors her hair on a regular basis and normally uses salon products to wash and care for her hair</li>
            <li>conditioner might be ok for someone with short and/or straight (and thin?)</li>
            <li>this id say is not a bad priced item it certainly makes you use the correct amount and not a huge handful, its not really needed ....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I was a bit skeptical at first, but I was quickly converted.  </li>
            <li>I was really let down by this conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I live in the dry desert of Nevada, so it can get really dry if the proper precautions are not taken.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used many conditioners in my time, and this is one I&#x27;d stick with the cheaper, dollar type conditioners.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this is a much better conditioner than others.</li>
            <li> Nexxus makes some of my favorite hair products [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Okay, I will admit it.</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve tried so far is Tresemme Keratin Smooth Keratin Infusing Conditioner in terms of softness and ease of comb-through.</li>
            <li> and my hair stays healthy looking between trims.&lt;br</li>
            <li> recommend it as a nice, light product to moisturize hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stuff at Best Western made this stuff look like a miracle</li>
            <li> Truthfully, while I did not want to believe it, I would say the product did deliver as marketed.  </li>
            <li> This is a light but not runny conditioner with a mild, pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> But it is pretty good</li>
            <li> okay, not too strong.</li>
            <li> Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Conditioner is a product that others in my household were more excited to try than myself.  </li>
            <li> Light and does a great job of moisturizing - it offers everything that I look for in a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Because of the way it keeps hair light and fluffy and the bright fragrance, I could see this being a great shampoo and conditioning combo for summertime.</li>
            <li> first thing I liked</li>
            <li> Trying out this Nexxus conditioner was the first time I&#x27;ve used Nexxus products, and combined with the matching shampoo I found I liked them quite a bit.</li>
            <li> all those with fine  hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;The conditioner itself was fine.</li>
            <li> normally wash my hair weekly or biweekly and need a conditioner that is light but still does a good job of smoothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s rather fine in texture.</li>
            <li> I splurged a little and found this works great!</li>
            <li> then but this is a great daily conditioner.</li>
            <li> I think I will use it in summer because it is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair</li>
            <li> My hair needs conditioner to be smooth</li>
            <li> The two together work well to keep hair light and fluffy, and give it a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> is the other thing; while I don&#x27;t like the smell during the shower....afterwards, the smell is light and clean and very pleasant.  </li>
            <li> It also rinses out well and leaves you hair very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> My wife (who has much longer hair than I do!) tried out the product as well and enjoyed it as well.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t exactly help with that, but I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my head.</li>
            <li> but after a week of using with no change in results, I&#x27;m really not pleased or impressed.</li>
            <li> Provide quality moisturizing performance, while not adding significant residues to your hair.  </li>
            <li> It does work ok as a conditioner, and my hair was soft afterwards and fairly manageable but nothing to really rave about.</li>
            <li> I love it,gives me shiny bouncy soft  hair :) but as with everything you gotta try it for yourself .</li>
            <li> After two weeks I&#x27;ve noticed quite a nice change in the smoothness and softness of hair and also a clear lack of split ends (without a hair cut!)</li>
            <li> This product is a great in-between conditioner that I can use daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent and rinses with ease -- leave hair tangle free and light (not weighed down)</li>
            <li> but really it reminded me of some very cheap conditioners-</li>
            <li> Luckily it isn&#x27;t a strong scent - if it had been, I would have just tossed it right then and there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but you pretty much know exactly what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> It really does look healthy.</li>
            <li> However, Nexxus&#x27;s products produce superior shine and make my older hair (I&#x27;m 48) look better overall.</li>
            <li> My hair is mid-back length, naturally curly and color treated, so using a good conditioner is very important to keep my hair from becoming frizzy and dry.  </li>
            <li> Nexxus Hydralight seemed a great solution for my fine hair that tends to get oily if I use heavy conditioners like Pantene or Dove.</li>
            <li> I prefer almost no scent (or one that leaves the hair quickly) and this Nexxus product made me sneeze repeatedly in the shower each time I used it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great since it does not weigh my hair down or make it greasy faster.  </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite conditonar.</li>
            <li> I have tried SO MANY hair lines, I have fine, blonde highlighted past shoulder length hair,I really thought this was lovely !!!</li>
            <li> I do not even know how to describe it - it is a putrid yet somewhat sweet smell and not sweet in a good way, it is a rotten sort of sweet...</li>
            <li> For my non-color-treated, fine, thick hair, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> Right before I requested this product as a vine request---I had my hair bleached blond for the very first time in my life.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t look like I stuck my finger in a light socket, thanks to Nexxus conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and way it leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> But too many of the professional beauty products are overrated (and overpriced) disappointments.</li>
            <li> It was mesmerizing.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the layers to lay right now</li>
            <li> , right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is just a conditioner, right?  </li>
            <li> It is a fresh, clean, slightly citrus scent that rinses away nicely.</li>
            <li> - Instead of a fuller and shinier look, the Nexxus leaves my hair feeling light (weightless) and very soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s similar in scent to the shampoo that goes with it, that a citrus scent to it, with very light floral undertones.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft, shiny and smooth when I blow-dried it, the waves stayed in, but the ends weren&#x27;t crispy and sticking up all over like before.</li>
            <li> seems to be exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker than basic Suave conditioners, but not as dense as many Pantene conditioners.</li>
            <li> I guess I just don&#x27;t know enough about conditioner to be able to tell.</li>
            <li> I just know this works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I am usually an avid Pantene user and was advised by my stylist to start switching shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners throughout the month to keep hair at</li>
            <li> Because of the smell, I threw it away, so I cannot rate this any higher than a</li>
            <li> The price is better than salon hair products and you get the same results.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re simply looking for something which improves texture while maintaining body and reducing frizz, then Tresemme is better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> First of all--I must make a disclaimer.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner does what a conditioner is supposed to do: it makes your hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Plus, when used with the matched shampoo, the hair care connoisseur in my home raved that the product team kept their hair light, while still keeping it soft.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Nexxus!</li>
            <li> After using the Nexxus conditioner several times I am pleased with how well it absorbs and leaves hair feeling softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more of a salon quality conditioner and work a little better than your normaL conditioners.  </li>
            <li> The first day I used it, I got my first compliment in a long while about how healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably better for someone with thinner hair that doesn&#x27;t need as much moisturizing as my Asian hair does.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy salon shampoo or conditioner, but I think these are a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> I use volume mousse and root booster (like always) and I have full soft volume</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s leaving my hair super soft, but not frizzy.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is white in color and has a very mild, barley-there fragrance.</li>
            <li> For color-treated or dry hair, you might want something more intensively conditioning.  </li>
            <li> For me I&#x27;ve been happy with several conditioners that I purchase for less than $5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This did both, though it isn&#x27;t better than some of the other conditioners that I&#x27;ve tried on the higher end of the scale.</li>
            <li> Plus, it really does have a salon look, feel and smell to it.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cut the tangles out, this would probably be great for thin hair or shorter hair.</li>
            <li> you know the kind that &#x27;knocks off&#x27; the big names but only cost a couple of dollars?</li>
            <li> Your hair will be soft and smooth and it will feel like it is naturally that way, not</li>
            <li> considering how many other products I use also.  </li>
            <li> It is better than any other product I can name.</li>
            <li> I probably will not be purchasing again because I can get other products that run through my hair better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mainly looking for something that will help me comb out my hair more easily while it is wet and add softness and body when it is dry.</li>
            <li> It just seemed to work ok for her and not like the other pricier brands that she normally uses.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another important thing to mention is that I have long hair;</li>
            <li> I rate conditioners on how well they take the tangles out of my hair, after a day of riding with the top down, my head out the window, or riding a bicycle without a helmet.  </li>
            <li> This was a fairly heavy conditioner for my very fine hair but worked well for my daughter.</li>
            <li> (I found it best to leave it on for a few minutes) but the payoff is hair that is light and breezy (not stripped dry or coated with waxy soap scum).</li>
            <li> I tried using less and rinsing more (just in case)</li>
            <li> It is June, the weather has been rainy and muggy, and my layered, naturally wavy hair has that Brillo pad look, especially on top at the ends of the layers.</li>
            <li> Her hair comes out soft and smooth, even with a different brand of shampoo.</li>
            <li> It keeps hair light and fluffy, and still keeps it smooth enough that brushing through wet hair is easy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;ll be buying this stuff regularly, but once in a while it&#x27;s probably worth the expense.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Given those instructions the user should not need nearly as much as normal conditioners (seems like sort of a spot treatment for the tips</li>
            <li> but it is easily weighed down.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad after it&#x27;s rinsed and my hair is dry, but while I&#x27;m using it, it&#x27;s a little too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li> I used A LOT of it and ended up having to add my usual conditioner on top of it, to detangle my hair and get a conditioned feel.</li>
            <li> I usually just love Nexxus hair products.</li>
            <li> The conditioning is light and it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down at all.</li>
            <li> and I have to apply hair serums or sprays to smooth it down.</li>
            <li> However, the scent is really strong and harsh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to use this conditioner on a daily basis, it isn&#x27;t weighing my hair down</li>
            <li> It is easy to use too much of this stuff because you hardly know it is there when you are working it into your hair.</li>
            <li> , I wouldn&#x27;t say it is really damaged so maybe not a fair test, but it is supposed to be a light conditioner , I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is long, thick, and full, so it can take a fair amount of conditioner and not look weighed down.</li>
            <li> for the price, yes it is a little more than regular brands</li>
            <li> They clearly are salon-level in terms of how your hair will look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product surprised me.  </li>
            <li> still gave it 3 stars as it keeps the hair soft and non-greasy and works out well if I use a frizz control spray while styling my hair.</li>
            <li> A recent highlighting job dried the ends out even more.</li>
            <li> and I have pretty dry hair</li>
            <li> The effects are pretty immediate even before blow drying, I noticed the softness that seems to last even though some pretty heavy weather and workouts.</li>
            <li> My wife is pretty careful about what she puts in her hair.</li>
            <li> Let me preface by saying she colors her hair on a regular basis and normally uses salon products to wash and care for her hair</li>
            <li> conditioner might be ok for someone with short and/or straight (and thin?)</li>
            <li> this id say is not a bad priced item it certainly makes you use the correct amount and not a huge handful, its not really needed ....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I was a bit skeptical at first, but I was quickly converted.  </li>
            <li> I was really let down by this conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I live in the dry desert of Nevada, so it can get really dry if the proper precautions are not taken.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s a little pricier than your average conditioner, but personally I thought it was worth the difference.</li>
            <li> My hair style is more difficult, thick, curly and frizzy, but even VO5 works better than this, though I&#x27;m usually a Pantene/Aussie girl.</li>
            <li> On the positive side, it does not weigh hair down and my hair does not get oily and sticky like with other conditioners</li>
            <li> While I like the texture and the weight of the product, I feel like it&#x27;s pretty hard to get through snarls, even though it&#x27;s conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick hair which is pretty dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely used better Nexxus conditioners though, and the $2 less expensive brand smells a lot</li>
            <li> I did find that it does leave a little build up on the hair but not enough to be of major concern</li>
            <li> so I only need a tiny bit to do the job so this will last me through quite a few uses.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that I highlight</li>
            <li> This conditioner just didn&#x27;t work for my long colored hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thick and dry hair, so I need something that really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Several other conditioners don&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> that tends to get dry and kinky.</li>
            <li> hair is a bit dry.</li>
            <li> It is naturally dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lived in a very dry climate the past few years and for the first time in my life have had some issues with dry scalp and dandruff</li>
            <li> My almost 50 year old hair is fine and thinning, so when this happens, it really looks awful, making this a conditioner I won&#x27;t be using or recommending.</li>
            <li> My daughters hair always looked so weighted down with conditioner, I had to try something different.  </li>
            <li> While using this, compared to my previous brand I have noticed that this whipped conditioner has a very different effect.  </li>
            <li> well past the middle of my back.  </li>
            <li> conditioner (another brand) bottle wasn&#x27;t empty yet but this Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Conditioner had arrived from Vine</li>
            <li> Have thin hair and it doesn&#x27;t take much to weight it down.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> And although I may not make it my everyday conditioner, I can see splurging on it to use occasionally when I feel my hair needs a boost.</li>
            <li> I comb it through with a wide tooth comb when I put the conditioner in, so</li>
            <li> So for my ends, I still use matrix biolage conditioning balm which is heavy enough for my damaged ends.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner daily on the bottom few inches of my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning out due to age, and this product helps me fluff it out a bit.  </li>
            <li> I have never smelled a hair product, or any other product, like this.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair that has to be washed every other day.</li>
            <li> it is not exactly inexpensive.</li>
            <li> No pretty floral scent or yummy fruity aromas.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or thick going on and it rinses off completely.</li>
            <li> Overall I cannot find a negative about Nexxus, not even the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since I used Nexxus products, so I was curious how they are as of lately.</li>
            <li> lots of hair is going down the drain.  </li>
            <li> It is weightless and does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> It is not a super conditioning so you want to tratde out with a richer conditioner every now and</li>
            <li> Product is a typical conditioner, rub in, keeping at the ends for 60 seconds and then rinsing afterward.</li>
            <li> It smelled a bit like, if maybe I spread half rotted fruit on my body and ran a marathon.</li>
            <li> (so less of a hindrance for her in her</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not floral, it&#x27;s not sweet like candy or fruit, not herbally..</li>
            <li> but it also became weighed down and greasy looking by the end of the evening (not even 14 hours after washing!).</li>
            <li> this does the trick w/o being heavy or taking away any body.</li>
            <li> I prefer products that are thick enough to make getting through my hair easier, but not so thick as to cause build up or make my hair feel</li>
            <li> I keep my hair short, so I was a little skeptical about whether I&#x27;d notice a difference with this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Garnier Fructus moisturizing conditioner and then finish with their leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I usually smell the conditioners in the store before I buy them.</li>
            <li> So I am not sure if that impacted what I was looking for or not (in regards to hair</li>
            <li> Who does not love that?  </li>
            <li> For a product claiming to be weightless, I found this to be a very thick and heavy conditioner, not light at all.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s impossible to live with the frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about the scent, but its ok, not that bad.</li>
            <li> Comb through and leave-in for at least 60 seconds.</li>
            <li> But because it is so thick I can not use it every day.  </li>
            <li> I have thick and wavy hair that reaches my mid-back.</li>
            <li> fragrance is also \\&quot;light,\\&quot; and subtle.  </li>
            <li> I used tons of it and it still was no good at conditioning/detangling.</li>
            <li> hair, but it was not good at all for me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit thin...</li>
            <li> Makes it like a bad hair day every day unless I apply other hair products and style it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> unfortunately, it did leave my hair a bit drier than the Garnier stuff does.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this stuff.</li>
            <li> If any of this sounds weird you just have to see for yourself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an unpleasant scent, but it is a persistent one.</li>
            <li> It used to be very expensive.</li>
            <li> Just bad.</li>
            <li> I must say I was highly disappointed with this</li>
            <li> was really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> like you have some goopy crap in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the smell... is awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This conditioner came along at the perfect time. It is June, the weather has been rainy and muggy, and my layered, naturally wavy hair has that Brillo pad look, especially on top at the ends of the layers. A recent highlighting job dried the ends out even more. I couldn&#x27;t get the layers to lay right now matter how I blow-dried or what styling products I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conditioner (another brand) bottle wasn&#x27;t empty yet but this Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Conditioner had arrived from Vine so I stuck it in the shower to give it a try. Can&#x27;t hurt, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a difference. It was obviously the conditioner. My hair was soft, shiny and smooth when I blow-dried it, the waves stayed in, but the ends weren&#x27;t crispy and sticking up all over like before. I use volume mousse and root booster (like always) and I have full soft volume but it doesn&#x27;t look like I stuck my finger in a light socket, thanks to Nexxus conditioner. I LOVE it, and when my Vine bottle is gone, I will be buying more, and that is the biggest compliment a Vine reviewer can give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: Absolutely love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> My daughters hair always looked so weighted down with conditioner, I had to try something different.  I splurged a little and found this works great!</li>
            <li> Have thin hair and it doesn&#x27;t take much to weight it down.&lt;br /&gt;This seems to be exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I rate conditioners on how well they take the tangles out of my hair, after a day of riding with the top down, my head out the window, or riding a bicycle without a helmet.  And this just does not cut it....lots of hair is going down the drain.  I switched to this after Nexxus seemingly discontinued my conditioner that worked on tangles.  After many, many years of Nexxus I have switched to another brand for my conditioners.  Pantene Pro v Expert collection keratin repair which does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> that tends to get dry and kinky. this does the trick w/o being heavy or taking away any body. I use correct amount but leave in for about 20-30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I have tried SO MANY hair lines, I have fine, blonde highlighted past shoulder length hair,I really thought this was lovely !!! it smells good, and it conditions your hair and I have pretty dry hair, I wouldn&#x27;t say it is really damaged so maybe not a fair test, but it is supposed to be a light conditioner , I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the price, yes it is a little more than regular brands but I think it does a great job, and for me I think whatever gives you the best hair is worth any money ...within reason of course this id say is not a bad priced item it certainly makes you use the correct amount and not a huge handful, its not really needed ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to all those with fine  hair I love it,gives me shiny bouncy soft  hair :) but as with everything you gotta try it for yourself .</li>
            <li> This was a fairly heavy conditioner for my very fine hair but worked well for my daughter. She uses conditioner daily, where I use it every week or so. Both of us liked the product&#x27;s results, but neither of us would get it again. I prefer almost no scent (or one that leaves the hair quickly) and this Nexxus product made me sneeze repeatedly in the shower each time I used it. It&#x27;s not an unpleasant scent, but it is a persistent one.</li>
            <li> My hair is mid-back length, naturally curly and color treated, so using a good conditioner is very important to keep my hair from becoming frizzy and dry.  I have to admit that Nexxus is a brand that I have never bought because of the price. For me I&#x27;ve been happy with several conditioners that I purchase for less than $5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I liked about [[ASIN:B00ALV8EJW Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Conditioner]] was the scent. It is a fresh, clean, slightly citrus scent that rinses away nicely. I&#x27;ve been able to use this conditioner on a daily basis, it isn&#x27;t weighing my hair down and it&#x27;s leaving my hair super soft, but not frizzy. Overall I cannot find a negative about Nexxus, not even the price.  And although I may not make it my everyday conditioner, I can see splurging on it to use occasionally when I feel my hair needs a boost.</li>
            <li> I liked this much better than Nexxus Age Renewal conditioner. The hydradlight Weightless Conditioner smells great. It also rinses out well and leaves you hair very clean and fresh. But it still managed to detangle my hair. It is weightless and does not weigh my hair down. It is not a super conditioning so you want to tratde out with a richer conditioner every now and then but this is a great daily conditioner.</li>
            <li> After two weeks I&#x27;ve noticed quite a nice change in the smoothness and softness of hair and also a clear lack of split ends (without a hair cut!) It smells pleasant and works well. If you use a lot of product or it&#x27;s been a while since you&#x27;ve cut off the split ends I recommend this as a good conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have really thick and dry hair, so I need something that really moisturizes. The problem that I have is everything I&#x27;ve use leaves such build up in my hair. But not this stuff, love the way it makes my hair feel. This is my new favorite conditonar. I used to be a haircare rep and have tried everything, this stuff is great. I still havent tried the shampoo yet</li>
            <li> Trying out this Nexxus conditioner was the first time I&#x27;ve used Nexxus products, and combined with the matching shampoo I found I liked them quite a bit. The conditioning is light and it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down at all. It&#x27;s thicker than basic Suave conditioners, but not as dense as many Pantene conditioners. It keeps hair light and fluffy, and still keeps it smooth enough that brushing through wet hair is easy. The conditioner is white in color and has a very mild, barley-there fragrance. It&#x27;s similar in scent to the shampoo that goes with it, that a citrus scent to it, with very light floral undertones. The citrus in them reminds me of the smell of lemons. Because of the way it keeps hair light and fluffy and the bright fragrance, I could see this being a great shampoo and conditioning combo for summertime. The fragrance layers well when using the matching shampoo. The two together work well to keep hair light and fluffy, and give it a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> For a product claiming to be weightless, I found this to be a very thick and heavy conditioner, not light at all. As a conditioner, it didn&#x27;t \\&quot;condition\\&quot; my hair. I&#x27;ve used many conditioners in my time, and this is one I&#x27;d stick with the cheaper, dollar type conditioners. My hair style is more difficult, thick, curly and frizzy, but even VO5 works better than this, though I&#x27;m usually a Pantene/Aussie girl. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since I used Nexxus products, so I was curious how they are as of lately. I must say I was highly disappointed with this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the smell... is awful. I do not even know how to describe it - it is a putrid yet somewhat sweet smell and not sweet in a good way, it is a rotten sort of sweet... like vomit. I have never smelled a hair product, or any other product, like this. Just bad. It&#x27;s not floral, it&#x27;s not sweet like candy or fruit, not herbally.. just rotten or spoiled, like vomit type of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the smell, I proceed to apply it to my hair. I used tons of it and it still was no good at conditioning/detangling. I used A LOT of it and ended up having to add my usual conditioner on top of it, to detangle my hair and get a conditioned feel. My hair is waist length and curly/wavy. I comb it through with a wide tooth comb when I put the conditioner in, so I can definitely tell whether it detangles well or not, right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner might be ok for someone with short and/or straight (and thin?) hair, but it was not good at all for me.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair short, so I was a little skeptical about whether I&#x27;d notice a difference with this conditioner.  I&#x27;ve lived in a very dry climate the past few years and for the first time in my life have had some issues with dry scalp and dandruff: I found that those problems went away once I started using this product (and the Nexxus shampoo) ... even for my short hair, I noticed the difference in moisture retained.  My wife (who has much longer hair than I do!) tried out the product as well and enjoyed it as well.  Personally, I liked the scent as well ... neutral (which makes it nice for either gender) and not overpowering (but not non-existent either).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was a bit skeptical at first, but I was quickly converted.  This product&#x27;s a little pricier than your average conditioner, but personally I thought it was worth the difference.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair that has to be washed every other day. This conditioner is great since it does not weigh my hair down or make it greasy faster.  I&#x27;m not too crazy about the scent, but its ok, not that bad. My hair feels amazing and is shiny. I use this with rusk bodifying shampoo. The only downside is my ends are overprocessed and damaged, just the last 4 inches. This conditioner doesn&#x27;t perform so well on damaged hair. So for my ends, I still use matrix biolage conditioning balm which is heavy enough for my damaged ends.</li>
            <li> So, this is conditioner. It&#x27;s about what you&#x27;d expect. It&#x27;s a good product, but you pretty much know exactly what you&#x27;re getting. Perhaps this is a much better conditioner than others. I guess I just don&#x27;t know enough about conditioner to be able to tell. I just know this works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair which is pretty dry. I usually use Garnier Fructus moisturizing conditioner and then finish with their leave in conditioner. The Nexxus felt lighter and seemed to soak into my hair faster. There was no stink like some revievers have stated. unfortunately, it did leave my hair a bit drier than the Garnier stuff does. It&#x27;s probably better for someone with thinner hair that doesn&#x27;t need as much moisturizing as my Asian hair does.</li>
            <li> I am usually an avid Pantene user and was advised by my stylist to start switching shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners throughout the month to keep hair at it&#x27;s best. While using this, compared to my previous brand I have noticed that this whipped conditioner has a very different effect.  - Instead of a fuller and shinier look, the Nexxus leaves my hair feeling light (weightless) and very soft. It&#x27;s a wonderful product and I am thrilled to have the choice of now customizing the look I want in different situations!  Product is a typical conditioner, rub in, keeping at the ends for 60 seconds and then rinsing afterward. The effects are pretty immediate even before blow drying, I noticed the softness that seems to last even though some pretty heavy weather and workouts.</li>
            <li> My wife is pretty careful about what she puts in her hair. But she also doesn&#x27;t like to spend a lot of money on hair products. So this was a thrill for her to try. She loves this stuff, but the price is a bit steep. Her hair comes out soft and smooth, even with a different brand of shampoo. I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;ll be buying this stuff regularly, but once in a while it&#x27;s probably worth the expense.</li>
            <li> Nexxus makes some of my favorite hair products [[ASIN:B000GFZWDO Nexxus Keraphix Restorative Strengthening Conditioner, 13.5Ounce Bottle]]is a conditioner I use often.  But because it is so thick I can not use it every day.  This product is a great in-between conditioner that I can use daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent and rinses with ease -- leave hair tangle free and light (not weighed down)</li>
            <li> I was really let down by this conditioner. I usually just love Nexxus hair products. I had just used a shampoo that smelled &#x27;Oh so good&#x27;, and I reached for the bottle of conditioner, opened it, and thought &#x27;Ewwwwww[...] It smelled a bit like, if maybe I spread half rotted fruit on my body and ran a marathon. Luckily it isn&#x27;t a strong scent - if it had been, I would have just tossed it right then and there. It&#x27;s a very light, fruity, sweaty rotten smell to me.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner itself was fine. My medium texture, wavy hair soaked it up - it&#x27;s a bit thin...but really it reminded me of some very cheap conditioners- you know the kind that &#x27;knocks off&#x27; the big names but only cost a couple of dollars? It&#x27;s about like that. It does work ok as a conditioner, and my hair was soft afterwards and fairly manageable but nothing to really rave about. I&#x27;ve definitely used better Nexxus conditioners though, and the $2 less expensive brand smells a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;I was really disappointed in this product. Because of the smell, I threw it away, so I cannot rate this any higher than a one.&lt;br /&gt;Normally I like Nexxus as a brand a good deal, and they make many good products, but this is one I do not like.</li>
            <li> Gotta love Nexxus products to begin with but this one is really wonderful.  I love the smell and way it leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.  I did find that it does leave a little build up on the hair but not enough to be of major concern considering how many other products I use also.  The price is better than salon hair products and you get the same results.  I have short hair so I only need a tiny bit to do the job so this will last me through quite a few uses.</li>
            <li> Okay, I will admit it. I am a snob when it comes to what I will put in my hair. I won&#x27;t even look at the trash that lines the supermarket shelves. I would rather wash my hair in sand. But too many of the professional beauty products are overrated (and overpriced) disappointments. I was skeptical about this stuff. In fact, after I got it I let it sit for a week while I put off putting \\&quot;that stuff\\&quot; on my head. Is it liquid gold? Oh hell no. But it is pretty good conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They call this stuff \\&quot;light.\\&quot; OI have to agree with that. It is easy to use too much of this stuff because you hardly know it is there when you are working it into your hair. It takes about 5 minutes (I found it best to leave it on for a few minutes) but the payoff is hair that is light and breezy (not stripped dry or coated with waxy soap scum). I don&#x27;t care if they put baby fat and bat guano in the bottle--this stuff is VERY good. Your hair will be soft and smooth and it will feel like it is naturally that way, not like you have some goopy crap in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is a bit dry. It didn&#x27;t exactly help with that, but I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my head. It was mesmerizing. If any of this sounds weird you just have to see for yourself. It is better than any other product I can name. I hope they make it in larger bottles though--it is not exactly inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I have thick and wavy hair that reaches my mid-back. It is naturally dry and I live in the dry desert of Nevada, so it can get really dry if the proper precautions are not taken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally wash my hair weekly or biweekly and need a conditioner that is light but still does a good job of smoothing and moisturizing. I was drawn to this conditioner as it has coconut oil and I use that occasionally as a hair mask and for all things skin related.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great conditioner. Light and does a great job of moisturizing - it offers everything that I look for in a conditioner. I like the convenience of purchasing on Amazon or in a drugstore and not having to visit my salon. I will continue to purchase this product - over my preferred salon brand!</li>
            <li> My wife tried this conditioner. Let me preface by saying she colors her hair on a regular basis and normally uses salon products to wash and care for her hair (so less of a hindrance for her in her purchases).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says the product does indeed leave her hair feeling lighter and performs the basic functions of a conditioner. I do notice the instructions are not quite the norm for conditioners&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Apply to damp hair focusing on ends, which are prone to dryness. Comb through and leave-in for at least 60 seconds. Rinse with warm water.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given those instructions the user should not need nearly as much as normal conditioners (seems like sort of a spot treatment for the tips only).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my wife seems happy with the product, though I don&#x27;t expect her to replace her salon products with it. P-)</li>
            <li> I used the Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Conditioner along with the [[ASIN:B00ALV8EL0 Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Shampoo, 13.5 Ounce]] (as recommended), and found that my hair did feel nicer and softer but it also became weighed down and greasy looking by the end of the evening (not even 14 hours after washing!). I tried using less and rinsing more (just in case) but after a week of using with no change in results, I&#x27;m really not pleased or impressed. My almost 50 year old hair is fine and thinning, so when this happens, it really looks awful, making this a conditioner I won&#x27;t be using or recommending.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife to use as she uses a lot of conditioner for her hair.  I thought it would be more of a salon quality conditioner and work a little better than your normaL conditioners.  It just seemed to work ok for her and not like the other pricier brands that she normally uses.  For the quality I would just use a cheaper brand. The scent is also just ok and nothing really great smelling.  Probably will not use again.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, thick, and full, so it can take a fair amount of conditioner and not look weighed down. I&#x27;m mainly looking for something that will help me comb out my hair more easily while it is wet and add softness and body when it is dry. This did both, though it isn&#x27;t better than some of the other conditioners that I&#x27;ve tried on the higher end of the scale. The best I&#x27;ve tried so far is Tresemme Keratin Smooth Keratin Infusing Conditioner in terms of softness and ease of comb-through. However, Nexxus&#x27;s products produce superior shine and make my older hair (I&#x27;m 48) look better overall. They clearly are salon-level in terms of how your hair will look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your concern is about how your hair looks rather than how it feels, then I definitely recommend using Nexxus shampoo and conditioner. If you&#x27;re simply looking for something which improves texture while maintaining body and reducing frizz, then Tresemme is better.</li>
            <li> This Nexxus conditioner works well for my hair. I have long hair that I highlight and it&#x27;s rather fine in texture. I use this conditioner daily on the bottom few inches of my hair. It seems to work well and my hair stays healthy looking between trims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the conditioner is nice. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or thick going on and it rinses off completely. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this conditioner is the scent. It is floral, which is usually nice, but it is very strong in my opinion. It&#x27;s not bad after it&#x27;s rinsed and my hair is dry, but while I&#x27;m using it, it&#x27;s a little too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li> I usually smell the conditioners in the store before I buy them. If I did that with Nexxus Hydralight, I would never have bought it. No pretty floral scent or yummy fruity aromas. It&#x27;s business only and the I&#x27;m seeing results. The first day I used it, I got my first compliment in a long while about how healthy my hair looks. It&#x27;s soft and smooth. It really does look healthy.</li>
            <li> After buying this product, I read on the bottle that I should use it as a leave-in treatment. I haven&#x27;t had time to use it like this.&lt;br /&gt;But I have used it in the shower as a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good and is light-weight. I think I will use it in summer because it is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;For winter, I would choose something heavier with a headier smell.&lt;br /&gt;The light smell for summer is good because bugs won&#x27;t be attracted to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pragmatic about this.&lt;br /&gt;I will post again once I use this as a leave-in treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it as a nice, light product to moisturize hair.&lt;br /&gt;Nexxus has always been a trusted salon brand. It used to be very expensive. It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s affordable now.[[ASIN:B00ALV8EJW Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 13.5 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> First of all--I must make a disclaimer.  Right before I requested this product as a vine request---I had my hair bleached blond for the very first time in my life.  (I&#x27;d only done weaves and colors prior) So I am not sure if that impacted what I was looking for or not (in regards to hair snarls)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another important thing to mention is that I have long hair; well past the middle of my back.  I am always looking for a conditioning product that I can put in my hair and then comb through with a pick while in the shower before I rinse the product out.  I prefer products that are thick enough to make getting through my hair easier, but not so thick as to cause build up or make my hair feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as I tried this product at first....I was dissatisfied with both the smell in the shower and how it feels when I&#x27;m brushing through my hair.  While I like the texture and the weight of the product, I feel like it&#x27;s pretty hard to get through snarls, even though it&#x27;s conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, during the use of this bottle....I went on vacation and forgot to take any conditioner with me.  The stuff at Best Western made this stuff look like a miracle product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the other thing; while I don&#x27;t like the smell during the shower....afterwards, the smell is light and clean and very pleasant.  Plus, it really does have a salon look, feel and smell to it.  (Both in packaging and the way it applies to your hair) Plus, my hair does not seem to have build up, and it feels nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, for the price...I probably will not be purchasing again because I can get other products that run through my hair better.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does what a conditioner is supposed to do: it makes your hair soft and smooth. However, the scent is really strong and harsh. I had to wash it off my hair almost immediately because I couldn&#x27;t stand the scent any longer.</li>
            <li> Nexxus Hydralight Weightless Moisture Conditioner is a product that others in my household were more excited to try than myself.  It is just a conditioner, right?  Well, yes it is, but it is a good product indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product&#x27;s goal?  Provide quality moisturizing performance, while not adding significant residues to your hair.  The product succeeds.  Plus, when used with the matched shampoo, the hair care connoisseur in my home raved that the product team kept their hair light, while still keeping it soft.  It treated the hair without adding weight to it.  One supposes, it performs as its name suggests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is also \\&quot;light,\\&quot; and subtle.  Truthfully, while I did not want to believe it, I would say the product did deliver as marketed.  Best of all, it&#x27;s a premium hair salon quality product, but at a reasonable price.  Who does not love that?  The product surprised me.  Recommended.  Thanks Nexxus!</li>
            <li> This is a light but not runny conditioner with a mild, pleasant scent.  For my non-color-treated, fine, thick hair, it&#x27;s great.  My hair needs conditioner to be smooth but it is easily weighed down.  This conditioner is the perfect balance.  For color-treated or dry hair, you might want something more intensively conditioning.  The Nexxus Hydralight shampoo is equally great.  I don&#x27;t usually buy salon shampoo or conditioner, but I think these are a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> Nexxus Hydralight seemed a great solution for my fine hair that tends to get oily if I use heavy conditioners like Pantene or Dove. Several other conditioners don&#x27;t work either. After using the Nexxus conditioner several times I am pleased with how well it absorbs and leaves hair feeling softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it does not prevent the frizz, if anything, it exacerbates it as my hair becomes frizzy and fly-away and I have to apply hair serums or sprays to smooth it down. On the positive side, it does not weigh hair down and my hair does not get oily and sticky like with other conditioners but it&#x27;s impossible to live with the frizz. Makes it like a bad hair day every day unless I apply other hair products and style it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still gave it 3 stars as it keeps the hair soft and non-greasy and works out well if I use a frizz control spray while styling my hair.</li>
            <li> The scent for this conitioner wasn&#x27;t the best, I&#x27;ve used Nexxus products before &amp; they always seem to just do a okay job. This conditioner just didn&#x27;t work for my long colored hair. It didn&#x27;t cut the tangles out, this would probably be great for thin hair or shorter hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning out due to age, and this product helps me fluff it out a bit.  And I find the scent okay, not too strong.</li>
