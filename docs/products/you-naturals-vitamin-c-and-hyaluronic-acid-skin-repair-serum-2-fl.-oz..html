            <li>Thanks You Naturals!</li>
            <li>my first impression of this vit.</li>

            <li>I have been using this for a few weeks and have had amazing results.  </li>
            <li>for the serum, I really like this one.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Shes spent hundreds of dollars on products like this trying to achieve a more younger smooth face.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t take that much product to cover the area.</li>
            <li>It was really moisturizing.</li>
            <li>My skin looks much brighter and moisurized.  </li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff makes my skin soft feeling and looking younger!!</li>
            <li>I have only had this for a couple of days, but so far I love it.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin on my face</li>
            <li>I would love to buy again and see what other products this company has!</li>
            <li>The serum goes on and within a minute is dry and her skin is smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is the second brand of vitamin C serum I have tried and as I do love my current brand I think this will be my permanent replacement.  </li>
            <li>It left my face feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I usually try to stay away from anything that has witch hazel because it usually dries my skin out, but they have found a great balance!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been using this product and I highly recommend it to everyone..</li>
            <li>I have been using this product and I highly recommend it to everyone..</li>
            <li>It slightly tightens the face and feels amazingly soft on my face, so far I&#x27;m loving it, and i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Love this natural product, it goes on lightly and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I have used other vitamin C serums and they are very expensive, so this has been a pleasant surprise that this has worked so well even at such a great price.  </li>
            <li>but so far I really like it</li>
            <li>At You Naturals we aim to find natural &amp; organic ingredients with proven efficacy while being gentle on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Proudly MADE in the USA.</li>
            <li>On my second bottle, worth the price.</li>
            <li>the overall color/tone seems to be a little more consistent, so maybe it is somehow reducing redness/pigments?</li>
            <li>but this went right on and dried quickly.</li>
            <li>I currently use the very expensive Clarins serum which is great, but for the money I just haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Her skin has been problematic lately and she was super excited to try this.  </li>
            <li>The result is a radiant complexion, without fine lines, wrinkles or dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;Specially</li>
            <li>But this product makes my face very soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I like the serum so far.</li>
            <li>but I am 40 years old and a lady at a party told me I looked 30.  </li>
            <li>formulated with anti-aging properties to protect skin from harsh environmental conditions, free radicals and sun</li>
            <li>potency of natural ingredients to brighten and refine skin</li>
            <li>So far (after 3 days)</li>
            <li>Too early to notice a difference</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft since I have been using.  </li>
            <li>There is no harsh scent and</li>
            <li>I apply it before I go to bed and wake up with soft supply skin.</li>
            <li>Makes skin soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x60;m sensitive at cosmetic but it has soft smell and don&#x60;t bother me.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my girlfriend who is into natural beauty care products.  </li>
            <li>After only using a few days my skin looks and feels much better.</li>
            <li>You Naturals Skin Repair Serum is made in a FDA regulated, GMP compliant, Cruelty Free Facility with Sustainable Raw Materials</li>
            <li>My doc told me to keep things as simple as possible and said &amp;#34;Vitamin C serum&amp;#34; - as pure as you can get.</li>
            <li>While I have only been using it for a little while I can say that I enjoy the fact that this is a serum</li>
            <li>It does not leave my face feeling heavy or sticky and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and no breakout problems like so many other products that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I have not broken out due to use of this product either.</li>
            <li>That being said, my overall complexion has improved and evened out moderately thus far.</li>
            <li>I had a little bit of an allergic reaction to it the first time I used it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin tone has really evened out and my wrinkles are Less noticeable.</li>
            <li>well-balanced Vitamin C Serum with Vitamin E, hyaluronic acid and ferulic acid will leave your skin feeling amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Apply to face, neck and around eyes to turn back the clock on aging and leave skin feeling smoother and looking youthful.&lt;br /&gt;Brighten a dull complexion with powerful antioxidants that nourish and sooth.</li>

            <li> I really like this serum.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t take that much product to cover the area.</li>
            <li> It was really moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My skin looks much brighter and moisurized.  </li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff makes my skin soft feeling and looking younger!!</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a couple of days, but so far I love it.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin on my face</li>
            <li> I would love to buy again and see what other products this company has!</li>
            <li> The serum goes on and within a minute is dry and her skin is smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is the second brand of vitamin C serum I have tried and as I do love my current brand I think this will be my permanent replacement.  </li>
            <li> It left my face feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I usually try to stay away from anything that has witch hazel because it usually dries my skin out, but they have found a great balance!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and I highly recommend it to everyone..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and I highly recommend it to everyone..</li>
            <li> It slightly tightens the face and feels amazingly soft on my face, so far I&#x27;m loving it, and i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this natural product, it goes on lightly and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have used other vitamin C serums and they are very expensive, so this has been a pleasant surprise that this has worked so well even at such a great price.  </li>
            <li> but so far I really like it</li>
            <li> At You Naturals we aim to find natural &amp; organic ingredients with proven efficacy while being gentle on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Proudly MADE in the USA.</li>
            <li> On my second bottle, worth the price.</li>
            <li> the overall color/tone seems to be a little more consistent, so maybe it is somehow reducing redness/pigments?</li>
            <li> but this went right on and dried quickly.</li>
            <li> I currently use the very expensive Clarins serum which is great, but for the money I just haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Her skin has been problematic lately and she was super excited to try this.  </li>
            <li> The result is a radiant complexion, without fine lines, wrinkles or dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;Specially</li>
            <li> But this product makes my face very soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I like the serum so far.</li>

            <li> Vitamin C with hyaluronic acid and vitamin E is a strong serum and will make your face smooth and diminish lines. you will be so happy with the results. You will see lines diminishing and your skin glowing in a short amount of time. As with any of these types of serums, make sure you follow up with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great product to keep your skin moisturized and refreshed.  Skin is very smooth and resilient since I&#x27;ve been using this serum.  The dropper which comes with he serum makes it super say to apply and best of all this product is for any skin type.  I have very sensitive skin and no breakout problems like so many other products that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> feel great. I love it. I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Talk wife are good for the skin</li>
            <li> Satisfactory quality and price.</li>
            <li> **Disclaimer** I have been using an undereye gel in conjuction with this product for about 3 weeks.  That being said, my overall complexion has improved and evened out moderately thus far. My face feels smoother, more radiant, and youthful. The dark circles and puffiness has also diminished.  work 7pm-7am so I was looking for a product to combat the side effects of these late shifts. This is a product that gets results in minimal time. As a male I was looking for products that diminish the &#x27;tired&#x27; look. Recommended :-)</li>
            <li> This a great serum. Much larger bottle than I expected so I was happy from the time I opened my box! I was packaged well in a small box and arrived quickly.&lt;br /&gt;As for the serum, I really like this one. It&#x27;s thin and absorbed instantly into my skin. It feels amazing on my face. I am very sensitive and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just me but I experience a clean tingling sensation.  This is the second brand of vitamin C serum I have tried and as I do love my current brand I think this will be my permanent replacement.  It is a great price for the size. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I have always looked younger than my age and this past year has taken a tole on my appearance.

            <li> Love this stuff makes my skin soft feeling and looking younger!!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Item came in quickly. Item also doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> it leaves your skin nice and soft</li>
            <li> I have bouncy face every morning.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I am 61 and I have been using for a couple of weeks and can tell a difference in my skin already. I use after my shower and my skin is softer, pores are smaller, and my skin is tighter. It leaves my skin feeling cool and refreshed after using. I had age spots really bad on my neck and they are fading. There is no greasy feeling after using. It dries quickly and I can apply my makeup right after using. I also have less wrinkles under my eyes and on my forehead since using this product.  A little goes a long way. I love the fact that it is almost all natural and organic.</li>
            <li> Great item just i expected</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the size of this serum for the price.&lt;br /&gt;and  It leaves my skin feeling cool and refreshed after using!&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> I was glad that I bought this. The bottle is such a good size I know that it will last me awhile. I squirt some into the palm of my hand and rub it on my face with my fingers. It goes on really smooth. I love how fast that it drys on my face. I hate when it seems like something takes forever when on your face but this went right on and dried quickly. It left my face feeling so soft and smooth. I have dry skin so sometimes I would apply lotion over it but so far I really like it and I can&#x27;t wait to keep at it and see how good it works.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. A little goes a long way and makes my face so soft. The small imperfections on my face have disappeared. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> awesome deal. quality product!</li>
            <li> I am excited to have this serum for my sun-damaged skin!  I&#x27;ve just started using it but am anticipating good results.</li>
            <li> Best thing on the market for your face! Love it !!</li>
            <li> Love the way my face feels after using this great serum..noticeable difference in 2-3 week time!  Would recommend to my friends!</li>
            <li> Nice vitamin C serum.  Absorbs quickly with no greasy feel.  Have been using for 5 days, face looks fresher.</li>
            <li> I use the serum at night. It doesn&#x27;t burn or sying. I don&#x27;t wake up with oily skin or dry skin. I like the serum so far.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> Love how my face looks and feels.</li>
            <li> Great serum, perfect for underneath a moisturizer.  Leaves skin feeling velvety, soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> This water like serum feels more like gel after applied on the face, no particular smell which makes me liking it even more. I feel hydrated a lot after using it and blue bottle is my favorite for some reason.</li>
            <li> I had a little bit of an allergic reaction to it the first time I used it but none since that time.</li>
            <li> A good amount for the price. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell but the serum works and it is a great product!</li>
            <li> Such a difference! I feel better and skin us glowing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and I highly recommend it to everyone..</li>
            <li> I bought this for mom who is 66 years old with alot of wrinkles and fine lines. Shes spent hundreds of dollars on products like this trying to achieve a more younger smooth face. Shes been using this for a little bit and oh my gosh you can see a difference. She has a more youthful glow to her face. Also believe it or not her wrinkles and fine lines are tightening up and getting were they are almost not noticeable. Instead of paying 20000 for a facelift you can just use this product and achieve better more natural safet results.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum. It&#x27;s not as thick as other products I&#x27;ve used. It goes on really well and is absorbed by the the skin really fast. It makes my skin soft and smooth. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love the thickness and the way it feels like it is doing something when I put it on my skin . It looks like an orange color w/ a thickness . Love for my skin !</li>
            <li> good price, thank you</li>
            <li> I got my bottle of the Serum and I tried out last night and I love the way it makes my face feel, is nice and soft. Looking forward to seeing results.</li>
            <li> Great serum. I used on my neck for 3 days, and it already make it more smooth visibly.</li>
            <li> Love this serum!  Feels so good on my face.</li>
            <li> very soothing and super fast absorptive!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It makes me look brighter and health skin. My skin feel better and it seems to smooth out wrinkles as well!</li>
            <li> I tried this around my eyes where you get wrinkles at the sides and I definitely like the tightening feeling and it didn&#x27;t take that much product to cover the area. So far so good.</li>
            <li> this vit.C serum was not sticky oil. It was really moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and feels good on my skin. Love the combination of ingredients! Haven&#x27;t used long enough to notice any skin changes but I feel like this one will be a keeper for my cleansing and moisturizing routine.</li>
            <li> Skins feels so good after putting  this one.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. It is the best product! I put it on after my shower. my skin has never been softer! usually for several hours after I shower, my skin is dry and flaky especially on my forehead. But this product makes my face very soft and supple. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this Vitamin C for about a week.  I am using it a s directed every morning.  It feel great going on and dries quickly so that I can put on other products on.  I will use it for a month every day and see if the product works as directed. I am very anxious for a month to go by, but I don&#x27;t know if this is attributed to the vitamin C but I am 40 years old and a lady at a party told me I looked 30.  I do take good care of my  skin but maybe it is the Premium Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid...&lt;br /&gt;This Vitamin C Serum is amazing.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and no oily residue.  Great under my daytime moisturizer and makeup!</li>
            <li> Have been using for a few weeks. Leaves my skin extremely soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I see no difference, and feels sticky.</li>
            <li> Been using for a couple weeks... my skin looks,markedly better!</li>
            <li> I believe this product works... i love how it feels on my face after it drys up. It slightly tightens the face and feels amazingly soft on my face, so far I&#x27;m loving it, and i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After only using a few days my skin looks and feels much better.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing to my face after 3 weeks of use.  I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Love love love it. Great serum. I dropped my first bottle and literally broke into tears. I&#x27;m very happy new bottle came.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother more luminous fine lines and wrinkles are diminished dark spots are fading a good product over all I&#x27;ve recommended to friends</li>

            <li> I have only had this for a couple of days, but so far I love it. It makes my skin feel like silk.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and have had amazing results.  My skin looks much brighter and moisurized.  I have some sun spots on my face and it seems to even be lightening it.  I have used other vitamin C serums and they are very expensive, so this has been a pleasant surprise that this has worked so well even at such a great price.  I will be definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> So far (after 3 days) I love this stuff!  Not a significant change as of yet, but as other reviewers have said... my skin is soft and bright.  I&#x27;m month 9 post-partum, and for the first time in my life I was struggling with killer acne for the past 3 months.  I just recently stopped using everything except for my makeup, and I added this to my daily/nightly regimen and my acne seems to be going away!! Not saying it is an acne treatment, but it sure does help!</li>
            <li> Feels great on the skin.  Will have to use longer for the anti aging benefits.</li>
            <li> Love this natural product, it goes on lightly and a little goes a long way.  My face is so much softer, firmer and wrinkles are slowly going away. Like that it has a light fragrance but not over powering.  Package was delivered rather quickly.  Would recommend and will continue to use. Thank you</li>
            <li> Love this! Makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> very nice will buy it again</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this serum.  At first I was worried it would be too runny but it is actually a great consistency.  It does not leave my face feeling heavy or sticky and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Healthy vitamin C in a liquid!</li>
            <li> Nice texture and easy to apply.. Too early to notice a difference but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Absorbs  quickly into face and gives a  silky  feel after I put it on. A little bit goes a long way . I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin tone has really evened out and my wrinkles are Less noticeable. You will want to use a moisturizer after this .</li>
            <li> This helps with my fine lines</li>
            <li> Better than I expected. Good quality at affordable prices</li>
            <li> Wow this was delivered to me SUPER fast! I started using it immediately and really loved that its not oily, and the ingredients are fantastic. I usually try to stay away from anything that has witch hazel because it usually dries my skin out, but they have found a great balance! I haven&#x27;t noticed any tightening or peeling. I am also an Esthetician and always looking for new serums and for the price this is fantastic! I would love to buy again and see what other products this company has!</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum feels like it is something you get at a spa.  It goes on easy and smoothly and absorbs immediately.  My skin feels so soft since I have been using.  I feel like I am doing something special for myself using this.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks smoother, since I started using this product.  I even notice that my neck looks like wrinkled, and tighter around my mouth( smile lines)</li>
            <li> This feels wonderful and seems to be brightening my face - have some minor discoloration due to melasma and breakouts.</li>
            <li> I love this, my skin looks better and better everytime I use it.</li>
            <li> One of the best serums I have ever used. Way better than those expensive products you buy at the department store. I am already starting to see a difference in my skin with only one week of use.</li>
            <li> Love this product. On my second bottle, worth the price.</li>
            <li> I went to my dermatologist and asked about aging (I&#x27;m 34 and should start). Specifically wrinkles and age spots due to over tanning in my teens and 20s. There are SO many products out there and it get confusing. I currently use the very expensive Clarins serum which is great, but for the money I just haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference. My doc told me to keep things as simple as possible and said &amp;#34;Vitamin C serum&amp;#34; - as pure as you can get. So I ordered this and I swear, from Day 1 my skin feels so much better. For dryer climates you may want to add a touch of moisture but this is excellent and for the price, I&#x27;ll be saying goodbye to my overly expensive products and just use this.</li>
            <li> I have added this to my daily routine. I love the idea of putting vitamins directly on my skin. This absorbs right away and drys smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a serum before, but now in my 40s I&#x27;m reading more about my skin as it ages. I was not expecting huge results so I&#x27;ve been blown away- my skin is softer, firmer, clearer. I was so impressed that I have started my daughter on it, although she is still in her 20s. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> My draw to this product was &amp;#34;Natural Ingredients&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Organic and Vegan&amp;#34;. While I am not Vegan I prefer to have some idea of what the ingredients are and being Vegan limits the ingredients to many things I am somewhat familiar with and not strange chemical names. An added bonus was the &amp;#34;Made in the USA&amp;#34;. As I am now in my 30&#x27;s I started noticing that I do have uneven skin tones and sun spots, I am hoping this will reduce what I am seeing in that category. While I have only been using it for a little while I can say that I enjoy the fact that this is a serum and it goes on easily and soaks in nicely, it is a good consistency and I don&#x27;t feel like it is too thin/runny or too thick and pasty. There is no harsh scent and all in all it seems like a very nice product so far. I am what you consider combination skin and I do not feel that this makes my skin oily or clogs any of my pores. I apply it before I go to bed and wake up with soft supply skin. It has been doing a great job of hydrating my skin as I can get dry skin in the north east winters. I have not broken out due to use of this product either. Not seeing a huge difference with the sun spots  but the overall color/tone seems to be a little more consistent, so maybe it is somehow reducing redness/pigments? Not seeing a big difference in wrinkles but I don&#x27;t have a lot to begin with. I will continue using this and hopefully I will see more results after longer use.</li>
            <li> It was well packed and delivered right on time. The product itself so far is good. It goes smoothly on my skin. No greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth. Makes skin soft. No filmy residue. Dries quick, no greasy after feel. Just started using, can&#x27;t wait to see results!</li>
            <li> After hearing about the combination of Vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid on Dr. Oz, I had to try it out for myself. I love it! Can feel it repairing my skin, and this bottle will last a long time</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel softer.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a week now and I can already feel a difference in the way my skin feels. It goes on like liquid, but dries fresh with No oily feeling. I have pretty sensitive skin on my face and I have had no issues using this product. I would definitly recommend this product again.</li>
            <li> I am so excited about this vitamin C serum.  I use it right after doing red light therapy on my face, and it makes my skin feel so good!  I am excited to lose some of these brown spots!</li>
            <li> I&#x60;m sensitive at cosmetic but it has soft smell and don&#x60;t bother me. I recomend this product. Delivered safely and very fast. I appreciate it.</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes my skin feel and look healthy</li>
            <li> Repaired my sun damaged skin quickly. Will be ordering another bottle. Thanks You Naturals!</li>
            <li> This product really works. My only comment would be the usage directions. It does NOT say when to use this product, morning? night? both? And also it does not say that you can or cannot apply moisturizer after applying this product.</li>
            <li> my first impression of this vit.C serum was which it was sticky oil, and a kind of aloe vera, though, It was really moisturizing, not oily.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply and no oily residue,  Great under my daytime moisturizer, I love it..</li>
            <li> My Skin is already showing the results of this serum. It is lightening and brightening my skin!</li>
            <li> Grea Vit c - brightens my skin!</li>
            <li> Great Value!&lt;br /&gt;very good!!</li>
            <li> It makes skin bright.&lt;br /&gt;And I feel like a getting more energetic skin</li>
            <li> Love this, large bottle, my face is softer</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.. I have been used for 2 weeks now an I can honestly said I have seen a major improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this products for 3 days but so far it feels good! It is not greasy and absorbs into my skin nicely.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend who is into natural beauty care products.  Her skin has been problematic lately and she was super excited to try this.  We thought it would be oilier bc of her experience of other Vitamin C serums but this was not the case.  The serum goes on and within a minute is dry and her skin is smooth.  She&#x27;s been using this as a toner after washing her face and still applies her face lotion as the serum isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as she needs for this dry and cold weather here in NYC.  She has only used it a couple of times so cannot testify to the long term affects but happy that I got it for her, she seems pleased.</li>
            <li> This product has good value, will worth your dollars.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and I highly recommend it to everyone..</li>
            <li> brightens my complexion in the morning.</li>
    </ol>
