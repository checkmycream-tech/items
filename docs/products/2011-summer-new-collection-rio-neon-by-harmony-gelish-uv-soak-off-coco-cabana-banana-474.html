            <li>It&#x27;s bright</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as bright as it appears in this picture</li>
            <li>bright neon</li>
            <li>This color is just as bright if not brighter in the pix</li>
            <li>these nail products are great and getting 2 for the price of 1 is even better.  </li>
            <li>You are able to see any mistakes that you may have made with the color being so bright</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, but</li>
            <li>Gelish is the best gel brand I have used thus far.  </li>
            <li>I love the bright color, it&#x27;s so fun for summer!  </li>
            <li>The polish went on very smooth.</li>
            <li>My bfs mom and sister love this color</li>
            <li>and I love looking at it all day.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This color requires four or more coats.</li>
            <li>While I love Gelish colors and I find the polish to be the most durable</li>
            <li>I love the neon collection colors.</li>
            <li>I do my own nails at home with my UV light and nail kit.</li>
            <li>But this gel is what most would consider \\&quot;highlighter yellow\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Just to be sure my eyes were not deceiving me, I asked two peopel what color it looked like to them on my fingers</li>
            <li>the color is fun and bright when the sun hits</li>
            <li>Just kind of a bummer that I had to buy two separate polishes to accomplish the original idea.</li>
            <li>Very bright yellow.  </li>
            <li>this is a real fun color (I like for summer).</li>
            <li>so make sure you clean up the edges.</li>
            <li>This color goes on so easy.</li>
            <li>Its a bright yellow, goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Great price and last a full 2 weeks or more.</li>
            <li>Great buy especially for the summer!!!!</li>
            <li>but I still enjoy the color.</li>
            <li>this product is wonderful - not sure what we did before Harmony</li>
            <li>Much better over a white polish than on its own.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try what I thought would be a bright sunny yellow color.</li>
            <li>I love the neon colors for summer and love gelish polishes in general!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very bright yellow but takes too many coats to make it a solid.</li>
            <li>2 coats is plenty for full coverage.</li>
            <li>On first application the color looked kind of clear</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the neon yellow/greenish highlighters!</li>
            <li>It takes about 3-4 coats to be able to not see any natural nail underneath.</li>
            <li>And its a nice yellow.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fun.  </li>
            <li>I love the action going on with this color....</li>
            <li>but fun nonetheless.  </li>
            <li>Nice sunny yellow.</li>
            <li>Need minimum 2 coats,  3 will make it pretty bold.</li>
            <li>I put like 2 or maybe 3 coats on the first time.</li>
            <li>and they are an exact match.</li>
            <li>It is definitely not for those who prefer a more neutral.  </li>
            <li>this is exactly the way to go.  </li>
            <li>so I got this color as I tried the Green neon color and loved it</li>
            <li>I dont think I needed that much.</li>
            <li>Was really upset.</li>
            <li>If you like yellow you will enjoy this color.</li>
            <li>2STARS for fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really  like it.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d probably have to use 4-5 coats to get a real, opaque color.  </li>
            <li>Note, it is not similar to the China Glaze neon which is by far a more \\&quot;highlighter color,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>but the cool thing is when under the uv light the color got brighter then when I went outside in the sun the next day the color got even brighter.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the first time I used it, then I decided to add a couple coats of Gelish White underneath 2 coats of the yellow, and the result was night and day.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, you get a full oz of this polish compared to the .5 oz you get for the same price at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This is not bad necessarily, but it&#x27;s just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>My usual gelish manicures last for 7-10 days with my hand washing, this particular manicure lasted 3 weeks and still looked amazing!</li>
            <li>So if you think the color isnt reallly vibrant</li>
            <li>I stopped using regular nail polish and now only use gel polish and Harmony is my favorite brand.</li>
            <li>They have so many colors to pick from and the bottle is double the size than what you would from Sally&#x27;s and its the same price.</li>
            <li>Its more of a neon yellow color than a sunshine yellow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also MUCH brighter when you use white first, so if you are looking for a statement</li>
            <li>All of the other Gelish colors I have purchased have been fine.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve read reviews of some people using a white polish first, then applying this.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised  when the polish arrived in an extra large bottle.</li>
            <li>Dries hard and absolutely LOVE the color.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste money like I did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a neon yellow than it is a &amp;#34;flat yellow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Even with 3 coats, I can still see my natural nail through this polish.</li>
            <li>If I want to be lazy and use a easy to apply color I use this.</li>
            <li>In addition, having my hands under the UV light for so long is super undesirable and no good for my skin.</li>
            <li>if u put a white coat first then the yellow looks even brighter.</li>
            <li>This particular neon yellow will not harden and stay on the nail.</li>
            <li>I did find the way the bottles are made it will spill out even if the top is closed but other than that I like it!</li>
            <li>The only problem is that the color isn&#x27;t a pure yellow..</li>
            <li>I always use gelish polishes, I&#x27;m a nurse and wash my hands so frequently that regular polishes chip off within a day.</li>

            <li> I always use gelish polishes, I&#x27;m a nurse and wash my hands so frequently that regular polishes chip off within a day.</li>
            <li> A little high on price.</li>
            <li> Good brand, it&#x27;s the only gel polish I trust, but this disappointed me a little because it isn&#x27;t highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> I really love this color but my only concern is that I need to put a white base coat down first or the color seems translucent.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted my nails to pop, and to change things up from the usual reds/pinks that I normally buy.  </li>
            <li> At certain angles it appears a slight green in color.</li>
            <li> I used 3 coats to get an opaqueness as it is slightly translucent, but that is a personal preference.  </li>
            <li> It is in eerily translucent with only two coats and slightly bearable with three.</li>
            <li> / blind you under black light</li>
            <li> Not really florescent as it shows online.</li>
            <li> so I had to apply 3 coats in order to achieve minimal opacity.</li>
            <li> Looks green in the little window in the bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s neon green.</li>
            <li> It does not adhere and is therefore a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Basically neon yellowish green</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it except to say that it has a little bit of a greenish hue.  </li>
            <li> A little too thin</li>
            <li> Not very attractive.</li>
            <li> Use an opaque white base coat then at least three coats of the color.</li>
            <li> I suggest using a white gel base as a primer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also quite thin</li>
            <li> This also goes on very thin.  </li>
            <li> After 3 thin coats I was disappointed at how murky it looked.</li>
            <li> I guess we all had ugly chipped nails.  </li>
            <li> The design of the Gelish polish are horrible!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good brand, it&#x27;s the only gel polish I trust, but this disappointed me a little because it isn&#x27;t highly pigmented. It takes about 3-4 coats to be able to not see any natural nail underneath. I suggest using a white gel base as a primer.</li>
            <li> this product is wonderful - not sure what we did before Harmony Gelish - I guess we all had ugly chipped nails.  This stuff rocks!!! this is a real fun color (I like for summer).</li>
            <li> This color is very bright semi neon. Not really florescent as it shows online. You are able to see any mistakes that you may have made with the color being so bright so make sure you clean up the edges. I put like 2 or maybe 3 coats on the first time. I dont think I needed that much. On first application the color looked kind of clear but the cool thing is when under the uv light the color got brighter then when I went outside in the sun the next day the color got even brighter. So if you think the color isnt reallly vibrant dont be worried it will set it. Great buy especially for the summer!!!!</li>
            <li> This color goes on so easy. If I want to be lazy and use a easy to apply color I use this. And its a nice yellow. I use two coats but you could use three for mote coverage if you wanted. My bfs mom and sister love this color</li>
            <li> Gelish is the best gel brand I have used thus far.  My daughter likes this color, it is certainly yellow!</li>
            <li> Your nails will GLOW..</li>
            <li> I stopped using regular nail polish and now only use gel polish and Harmony is my favorite brand. They have so many colors to pick from and the bottle is double the size than what you would from Sally&#x27;s and its the same price. I really love this color but my only concern is that I need to put a white base coat down first or the color seems translucent.</li>
            <li> Dries hard and absolutely LOVE the color.  It&#x27;s bright, I would even say it&#x27;s neon.  The color pops from my nails and I love looking at it all day.  Note: I used 3 coats to get an opaqueness as it is slightly translucent, but that is a personal preference.  YAY for SUMMER!!</li>
            <li> Do not waste money like I did. The color is not even yellow. It&#x27;s neon green. Was really upset. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> these nail products are great and getting 2 for the price of 1 is even better.  one for the mani, nad one for the pedi.  and they are an exact match.</li>
            <li> This color is so beautiful and it goes on well.</li>
            <li> Nice color really bright!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as bright as it appears in this picture but I like it and it&#x27;s fun.  Need minimum 2 coats,  3 will make it pretty bold. If you like yellow you will enjoy this color.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Its a bright yellow, goes on nice and smooth. Didn&#x27;t chip or anything. Only need one or two coats.</li>
            <li> I love the action going on with this color....every one seems to notice the sparkle and bright color allow it to look great with any outfit</li>
            <li> Buyer beware! This color requires four or more coats. It is in eerily translucent with only two coats and slightly bearable with three. The picture I have has four coats. While I love Gelish colors and I find the polish to be the most durable this color hair is a no-no. In addition, having my hands under the UV light for so long is super undesirable and no good for my skin.</li>
            <li> this color is great. It is highlighter yellow. Very bright and perfect for spring or summer. 2 coats is plenty for full coverage.</li>
            <li> I use gelish alot and was wanting a neon color so I got this color as I tried the Green neon color and loved it but this color is so sheer that it requires over 4 coats plus its not even neon, maybe if you use a white coat but then thats an extra step....2STARS for fast shipping. It did get here 6 days before it was supposed to arrive (3days)</li>
            <li> I was hoping for yellow.  This is road - worker/ convict/ running shoes / blind you under black light bright neon yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that it works great!</li>
            <li> Bright and awesome. A little high on price.</li>
            <li> Very bright yellow.  It is definitely not for those who prefer a more neutral.  Did require 3 coats to be opaque.  Note, it is not similar to the China Glaze neon which is by far a more \\&quot;highlighter color,\\&quot; but fun nonetheless.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Even when using three coats, the whites of my nails showed through.  This color is AWESOME!!! Use an opaque white base coat then at least three coats of the color.</li>
            <li> I am darker tone in skin, this color pops on it&#x27;s own, but if u put a white coat first then the yellow looks even brighter. At certain angles it appears a slight green in color. This color is just as bright if not brighter in the pix</li>
            <li> I really  like it. It is truly a neon yellow color. I did find the way the bottles are made it will spill out even if the top is closed but other than that I like it!</li>
            <li> All of the other Gelish colors I have purchased have been fine. This particular neon yellow will not harden and stay on the nail. It does not adhere and is therefore a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I saw this color on another woman, and I had to try it! ^_^ It&#x27;s really a neon yellow than it is a &amp;#34;flat yellow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Basically neon yellowish green</li>
            <li> I love the neon collection colors. Great price and last a full 2 weeks or more. FYI... I do my own nails at home with my UV light and nail kit.</li>
            <li> Looks green in the little window in the bottle. It&#x27;s very bright yellow but takes too many coats to make it a solid. After 3 thin coats I was disappointed at how murky it looked. Not very attractive.</li>
            <li> Its more of a neon yellow color than a sunshine yellow. Great color for the summer!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try what I thought would be a bright sunny yellow color. But this gel is what most would consider \\&quot;highlighter yellow\\&quot;. It looks exactly like the neon yellow/greenish highlighters! Just to be sure my eyes were not deceiving me, I asked two peopel what color it looked like to them on my fingers and they both said \\&quot;lime green\\&quot;. This is not bad necessarily, but it&#x27;s just not what I was looking for. It&#x27;s also quite thin so I had to apply 3 coats in order to achieve minimal opacity. Even with 3 coats, I can still see my natural nail through this polish. On the plus side, you get a full oz of this polish compared to the .5 oz you get for the same price at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> the color is fun and bright when the sun hits it looks even brighter. The problem I had was I did 3 coats and still was not a solid color i don&#x27;t have time to be doing 3+ to make it look solid.</li>
            <li> Nice sunny yellow. Much better over a white polish than on its own. No issues with clumping.</li>
            <li> A little too thin but I still enjoy the color.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised  when the polish arrived in an extra large bottle. The polish went on very smooth. I always use gelish polishes, I&#x27;m a nurse and wash my hands so frequently that regular polishes chip off within a day. My usual gelish manicures last for 7-10 days with my hand washing, this particular manicure lasted 3 weeks and still looked amazing! I love the neon colors for summer and love gelish polishes in general! GREAT GREAT PRODUCT!! I will never go back to using regular polish.</li>
            <li> The design of the Gelish polish are horrible!  The polish slops all over the place and get all over the rim of the bottle. Ugh!!  This also goes on very thin.  You&#x27;d probably have to use 4-5 coats to get a real, opaque color.  However, I&#x27;ve read reviews of some people using a white polish first, then applying this.  I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but hopefully it will work!</li>
            <li> I love the bright color, it&#x27;s so fun for summer!  I bought this because I wanted my nails to pop, and to change things up from the usual reds/pinks that I normally buy.  The only problem is that the color isn&#x27;t a pure yellow.. I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it except to say that it has a little bit of a greenish hue.  I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the first time I used it, then I decided to add a couple coats of Gelish White underneath 2 coats of the yellow, and the result was night and day.  It&#x27;s also MUCH brighter when you use white first, so if you are looking for a statement this is exactly the way to go.  Just kind of a bummer that I had to buy two separate polishes to accomplish the original idea.</li>
