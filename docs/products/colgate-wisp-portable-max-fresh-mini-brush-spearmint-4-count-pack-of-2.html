            <li>These are excellent for on-the-go freshness.</li>

            <li>These are great for on the go.</li>
            <li>I have found that prices on this item vary greatly from time to time.</li>
            <li>I can no longer find the Colgate Wisps in stores and was happy to find them through this dealer on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t be fair.</li>
            <li>Not as good as a waterpik and electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>The pick is good for picking food out of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great and handy product.</li>
            <li>I love them to keep in my purse for good dental hygiene anywhere!</li>
            <li>So happy I was able to get these from you.  </li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>The bead is kind of like a miniature mint candy that doesn&#x27;t get all sudsy or anything.</li>
            <li>What kind of sense does that make?  </li>
            <li>Handy for travel</li>
            <li>You will be in your clean, fresh best!</li>
            <li>easy to use, convenient, would buy these again!</li>
            <li>Where are the better toothbrush alternatives?    </li>
            <li>I love these things.  </li>
            <li>I use this product at the office, where most others do.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic!</li>
            <li>but they are better then just a breath mint.  </li>
            <li>a Doula - I use them myself and have given them to my mams in labor - they lvoed chewing on something that would help them feel better about their breath</li>
            <li>and I love usuing them</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the flavor</li>
            <li>Very handy, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The Spearmint flavor is pretty refreshing and quite nice</li>
            <li>The bristles are longer than any other disposable toothbrush, and the pick on the end is perfect.</li>
            <li>an emergency or need to quickly freshen up before a date/meeting these are okay,</li>
            <li>disposable toothbrushes from any drugstore for cheap,</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great to have around (especially with the pick at the end) at my desk while snacking or eating lunch.  </li>
            <li>Quick &amp; easy to use &amp; stores easily in my desk draw.</li>
            <li>Quick easy and disposable.  </li>
            <li>, I gotta get some of that clean</li>
            <li>I stash these in every purse and glove compartment I have as I have braces and am fanatical about keeping them clean.  </li>
            <li>So it seems like I have to brush forever to clean up my mouth with this thing.  </li>
            <li>But in my experience, pulling out a toothbrush and giving myself a quick once-over would scare away most hot blondes, not make them say,</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B00153BDH0 Listerine Cool Mint Breath Strips]]</li>
            <li>a quick brush???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the order came quickly</li>
            <li>the best I can say is that if you find it at the right price and do subscribe and save, they at least start to be affordable.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described for a super price.  </li>
            <li>The Wisp definitely doesn&#x27;t replace a full brush/rinse, but help me manage and clean my braces in between my full brushes.  </li>
            <li>Brush is strong enough to clean teeth after a meal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Indeed the promotion that runs when you bring up the Colgate Wisp web site seems to be targeting exactly the clubbin&#x27; crowd.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t even call them \\&quot;bristles\\&quot;, but for lack of a better word, I&#x27;ll refer to them as such here.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time trying \\&quot;Wisps\\</li>
            <li>These work pretty well.</li>
            <li>The order arrived on time and the product is exactly as presented.  </li>
            <li>Will order more for my next package I send to the soldiers over there</li>
            <li>It is the equivalent of washing your face and hands real quick to feel better after a hard days work in lieu of a shower, or when a shower cannot be had.&lt;br</li>
            <li>bead in the middle of the head is a strong blast of mintyness while the bristles sweep away any surface bits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>do you find yourself with something stuck in your teeth very often?</li>
            <li>I really like this item.</li>
            <li>they work really well.</li>
            <li>for those who have invisiline, you know you have to keep your teeth clean after you eat to put the trays back in.  </li>
            <li>_ do is keep the bristles from reaching between your teeth, so you can only get a mild surface polishing.  </li>
            <li>product also worked out extremely well on my trip to England where being out for a full day in the middle of country didn&#x27;t get me to an easy place to take care of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It occurred to me that if you happen to be out clubbin&#x27; or somewhere dark where there were some nice tasty spinach snacks that might leave something behind in your teeth, that having a Colgate Wisp might come in handy if you get in a moment where you must immediately brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>Also the head of the brush is dominated by the breath freshener ball, so you don&#x27;t get too much bristle action.  </li>
            <li>but they&#x27;ve made my life so much easier especially when travelling.</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t take up so much room in my purse or open them and put them in a ziplock bag.  </li>
            <li>Despite the only con I could think of that I wished the bead was a little bit bigger, for just a touch more mintyness, I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>The overall size of the wisp is pretty small too, which is not a big deal for many, but I am a big guy with big hands and a big mouth (Not in that way).  </li>
            <li>They are very useful for those times you need or would like to brush your teeth and are not able to do so with a regular toothbrush and tooth paste.  </li>
            <li>If it was too difficult to brush my teeth with the regular brush and paste routine, these gems were convenient and handy.  </li>
            <li>The hard ball of toothpaste doesn&#x27;t seem to dissolve very well, so you don&#x27;t actually get much toothpaste during your brushing progress.  </li>
            <li>The bristles themselves are plasticky, and it&#x27;s impossible (for me) to do a good brush job with them.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> In essence, unless you plan to re-pack the brushes yourself, the packaging ruins the only pro that I would give this product.    </li>
            <li> They are basically tiny little tooth brushes with a dot of breath freshener in the middle of the brush head, and a tooth pick at the other end.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Each little toothbrush (they&#x27;re about three inches long) comes individually wrapped.</li>
            <li> amazon price is roughly half of what you pay for your standard 4 pack in the store.</li>
            <li> However, the packaging isn&#x27;t very conducive to portability, because you&#x27;re forced to group multiple brushes together, the package edges are sharp, and there&#x27;s a lot of dead airspace involved.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a little balled up piece of one of those dissolvable mint breath strips or a tiny piece of a Life Saverish mint.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from the latter, then these little Colgate Wisp toothbrushes are your aspirin to a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not misconstrue this as a full on toothbrush replacement like a previous reviewer has, that is not the intent behind these little three inch genius sticks.</li>
            <li> Though it seems wasteful that each toothbrush will only be used a few times on average, I wouldn&#x27;t subject them to this grossly inferior product.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only one pro to this item: it&#x27;s small, and therefore portable.  </li>
            <li> The small brush is made of flexible plastic bristles, and it&#x27;s got this tiny little bead in the center.</li>
            <li> the only negative is the cost.  </li>
            <li> The length is so short that it&#x27;s difficult to hold onto the brush (or keep your hands out of your mouth) while cleaning your back teeth.  </li>
            <li> guess the question is not do you think your breath could use a little freshening but</li>
            <li> I even gave a few of them to a student of mine (with Mom&#x27;s permission of course)</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll have a use for them after the braces are off - but would recommend to anyone with braces or retainers.</li>
            <li> the hard ball _does</li>
            <li> Walmart sells these for $3.49 for an eight pack, soooo 16 would be $6.98 rather than the outrageous price amazon is asking...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find them anywhere in stores....I love these!</li>
            <li> I saw the new Colgate Wisp little toothbrushes and gave one a try. It&#x27;s 10 minutes after I used one and my mouth still feels minty fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting product. Each little toothbrush (they&#x27;re about three inches long) comes individually wrapped. The idea is not to use with water. The small brush is made of flexible plastic bristles, and it&#x27;s got this tiny little bead in the center. The bead is kind of like a miniature mint candy that doesn&#x27;t get all sudsy or anything. It&#x27;s like a little balled up piece of one of those dissolvable mint breath strips or a tiny piece of a Life Saverish mint. You rub the bristles and bead over your teeth then toss the thing in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wouldn&#x27;t it have just been easier to pop a [[ASIN:B001872OHG Tic Tac]] or one of those [[ASIN:B00153BDH0 Listerine Cool Mint Breath Strips]] versus trying to find a discrete place to give my teeth a quick brush???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the question is not do you think your breath could use a little freshening but do you find yourself with something stuck in your teeth very often? If you suffer from the latter, then these little Colgate Wisp toothbrushes are your aspirin to a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, on the other hand, prefer the old fashioned hit the restroom after dinner on a night out and look in the mirror. Something in my teeth? Use a paper towel (or use my tongue...ewww) to get it out then pop a mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It occurred to me that if you happen to be out clubbin&#x27; or somewhere dark where there were some nice tasty spinach snacks that might leave something behind in your teeth, that having a Colgate Wisp might come in handy if you get in a moment where you must immediately brush your teeth. But in my experience, pulling out a toothbrush and giving myself a quick once-over would scare away most hot blondes, not make them say, \\&quot;Ooh, I gotta get some of that clean mouth!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed the promotion that runs when you bring up the Colgate Wisp web site seems to be targeting exactly the clubbin&#x27; crowd. And hey, I still do a club every now and then. But I think I&#x27;ll just stick to mints.xactly the clubbin&#x27; crowd. And hey, I still do a club every now and then. But I think I&#x27;ll just stick to mints.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only one pro to this item: it&#x27;s small, and therefore portable.  However, the packaging isn&#x27;t very conducive to portability, because you&#x27;re forced to group multiple brushes together, the package edges are sharp, and there&#x27;s a lot of dead airspace involved.  In essence, unless you plan to re-pack the brushes yourself, the packaging ruins the only pro that I would give this product.    Cons:  * The bristles themselves are plasticky, and it&#x27;s impossible (for me) to do a good brush job with them.  I wouldn&#x27;t even call them \\&quot;bristles\\&quot;, but for lack of a better word, I&#x27;ll refer to them as such here.  * The head is tiny, and thus brushing your teeth takes forever.  Like, you know, if you used your finger.  * The hard ball of toothpaste doesn&#x27;t seem to dissolve very well, so you don&#x27;t actually get much toothpaste during your brushing progress.  I had to add toothpaste to my pre-pasted brush.  What kind of sense does that make?  * What the hard ball _does_ do is keep the bristles from reaching between your teeth, so you can only get a mild surface polishing.  Like, ahem, if you used your finger.  * The length is so short that it&#x27;s difficult to hold onto the brush (or keep your hands out of your mouth) while cleaning your back teeth.  Or do I just have a big mouth?  Maybe.    I may be biased, since I&#x27;ve visited countries where you can get compact, pre-pasted, full-head, biodegradable(!) disposable toothbrushes from any drugstore for cheap, but I just can&#x27;t imagine how anyone would find this product sufficient for tooth care needs.  Look, I can get disposable cutlery made from potato.  Where are the better toothbrush alternatives?    For house-guests, I bought cheap(er!), reusable toothbrushes instead.  Though it seems wasteful that each toothbrush will only be used a few times on average, I wouldn&#x27;t subject them to this grossly inferior product.  It wouldn&#x27;t be fair.</li>
            <li> Walmart sells these for $3.49 for an eight pack, soooo 16 would be $6.98 rather than the outrageous price amazon is asking...</li>
            <li> I really like this item. I used to keep a toothbrush &amp; toothpaste in my desk drew at work, then I find these. I think they are a great way to freshen up while in the office. Quick &amp; easy to use &amp; stores easily in my desk draw.</li>
            <li> This product was used when I wore Invisilign aligners for 9 months.  If it was too difficult to brush my teeth with the regular brush and paste routine, these gems were convenient and handy.  I even gave a few of them to a student of mine (with Mom&#x27;s permission of course) when she forgot her brush and paste to use after lunch at school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also worked out extremely well on my trip to England where being out for a full day in the middle of country didn&#x27;t get me to an easy place to take care of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These gems are a life-saver.</li>
            <li> What can I say...I love these things.  Ordered on Friday, received on Monday.  Exactly as described for a super price.  I stash these in every purse and glove compartment I have as I have braces and am fanatical about keeping them clean.  Not as good as a waterpik and electric toothbrush but they&#x27;ve made my life so much easier especially when travelling. I wish they weren&#x27;t packaged in 2&#x27;s.  I cut them apart so they don&#x27;t take up so much room in my purse or open them and put them in a ziplock bag.  Will definitely be ordering these again.</li>
            <li> I use this product at the office, where most others do. After lunch, or munching a bag of potato chips, these are just the ticket to refresh your mouth, and keep your breath in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bead in the middle of the head is a strong blast of mintyness while the bristles sweep away any surface bits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not misconstrue this as a full on toothbrush replacement like a previous reviewer has, that is not the intent behind these little three inch genius sticks. It is simply to freshen your mouth up. It is the equivalent of washing your face and hands real quick to feel better after a hard days work in lieu of a shower, or when a shower cannot be had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amazon price is roughly half of what you pay for your standard 4 pack in the store. Despite the only con I could think of that I wished the bead was a little bit bigger, for just a touch more mintyness, I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I currently have full-mouth braces, and use the Wisp to freshen up my teeth/get stuff out of the wires/brackets.  They&#x27;re great to have around (especially with the pick at the end) at my desk while snacking or eating lunch.  The Wisp definitely doesn&#x27;t replace a full brush/rinse, but help me manage and clean my braces in between my full brushes.  Not sure if I&#x27;ll have a use for them after the braces are off - but would recommend to anyone with braces or retainers.</li>
            <li> These are excellent for on-the-go freshness. Always carry a set in pocket or purse. You will be in your clean, fresh best!</li>
            <li> easy to use, convenient, would buy these again!</li>
            <li> Its not that brush and gel you can trust&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think that I will purchase it again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be improved</li>
            <li> These are great for on the go. always have them in my purse now.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic! The bristles are longer than any other disposable toothbrush, and the pick on the end is perfect.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying \\&quot;Wisps\\&quot;.  They are basically tiny little tooth brushes with a dot of breath freshener in the middle of the brush head, and a tooth pick at the other end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an emergency or need to quickly freshen up before a date/meeting these are okay, but that is about it.  Basically you get a breath mint and tooth pick with a tiny brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush bristles are pretty flimsy, and the head of the brush is rather small.  Also the head of the brush is dominated by the breath freshener ball, so you don&#x27;t get too much bristle action.  The overall size of the wisp is pretty small too, which is not a big deal for many, but I am a big guy with big hands and a big mouth (Not in that way).  So it seems like I have to brush forever to clean up my mouth with this thing.  The Spearmint flavor is pretty refreshing and quite nice however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it, it did freshen up my breath and get an gunk off of my teeth. And the toothpick end is helpful if you need to pick something out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So these are no replacement for a tooth brushing but they are better then just a breath mint.  I do plan on keeping a pack in the glove box of my car and maybe my desk at work.</li>
            <li> for those who have invisiline, you know you have to keep your teeth clean after you eat to put the trays back in.  these are awesome for that.  the only negative is the cost.  the best I can say is that if you find it at the right price and do subscribe and save, they at least start to be affordable.  I have found that prices on this item vary greatly from time to time.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product to have whle out and about.  It comes with a burst of gel flavored toothpaste in the middle of the brush and a pick on the opposite end.  The pick is good for picking food out of your teeth.  Brush is strong enough to clean teeth after a meal.  Quick easy and disposable.  I carry in my purse in case I may need it!</li>
            <li> These work pretty well. I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend getting rid of your tooth brush, but for on the go, or in the car, etc. they work really well. I am a Doula - I use them myself and have given them to my mams in labor - they lvoed chewing on something that would help them feel better about their breath and I love usuing them so I can do something about my breath (especially on the 44 hour labors).</li>
            <li> Very handy, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find it in big stores or pharmacies..really terrific item for on the go cleaning</li>
            <li> A must have when traveling or on the go</li>
            <li> The order arrived on time and the product is exactly as presented.  I can no longer find the Colgate Wisps in stores and was happy to find them through this dealer on Amazon.  It&#x27;s a great and handy product.</li>
            <li> I ordered thee to send to a Marine in Afghainstan he and his buddies ask for them .  It is easier for them to have these on hnad. I must say they do like them  and the order came quickly&lt;br /&gt;  Will order more for my next package I send to the soldiers over there</li>
            <li> Handy for travel and I keep in my purse &amp; car for use when I&#x27;m out and about. Love the flavor</li>
            <li> I love them to keep in my purse for good dental hygiene anywhere!</li>
            <li> So happy I was able to get these from you.  They are very useful for those times you need or would like to brush your teeth and are not able to do so with a regular toothbrush and tooth paste.  You can even swallow the &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; that comes on the brush.</li>
