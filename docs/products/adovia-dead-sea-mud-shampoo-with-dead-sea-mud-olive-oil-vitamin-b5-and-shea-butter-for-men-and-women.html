            <li>/&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>If you would like my full in-depth review you can find it here![</li>
            <li>The product was dark gray in color, and had a wonderful scent-not one that I could pin-point as smelling like anything in particular, but it was pleasant</li>
            <li>Scientists have yet to determine why this mud has such great results but it has been used in many applications from dryness, muscle relaxation, blood circulation and even treatment for some cancers.</li>
            <li>I figured it would be a good test to see how my hair reacts to this more natural shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The one thing I didn&#x27;t care for was the strong scent both have.</li>
            <li>It lathered up well and had a strong scent.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells great and left my hair feeling smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li>While this doesn&#x27;t help with the large flakes and sores like some other shampoos, she has found that this leaves her hair feeling wonderful and the smell is nice.  </li>
            <li>Good clean scalp without too much lather.</li>
            <li>There is a full review available on my website if you&#x27;d like to learn more head on over.</li>
            <li>It lathers just fine, and I don&#x27;t feel like I have to use a lot to get my hair</li>
            <li>I have fine color treated hair.</li>
            <li>Smell is pleasant, I like that it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li>Yet it is mild on my skin .!  </li>
            <li>It has a very nice scent and makes my hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li>don’t have a huge problem with dandruff although my scalp can get itchy sometimes.</li>
            <li>Since using this shampoo we have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>did help get my hair clean easily</li>
            <li>This dandruff shampoo by Adovia  is great for the entire family.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and not medicinal smelling.</li>
            <li>I bought about ten different shampoos from Amazon, and I liked this best.  </li>
            <li>now dandruff free</li>
            <li>it had a light flower scent nothing too over powering</li>
            <li>I bought this to try for myself, primarily because I deal with itchy scalp, etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a second bottle at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>did receive a free bottle of this shampoo from the company to try.</li>
            <li>Even though it was free, this did not bias my opinion.</li>
            <li>wanted to try Adovia’s shampoo to hopefully find some relief for my scalp issues and be free from embarrassment.</li>
            <li>I experienced throughout the next day were dramatically reduced.</li>
            <li>He’s been impressed by Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo.</li>

            <li>have been dandruff free since using.</li>
            <li>I do want to say they I received a free product trial for it</li>
            <li>I am always looking for a shampoo that will keep my hair looking nice no matter how much I do to it and</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s a really fantastic product</li>
            <li>It has been great for that, has a nice light scent, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or chemically.</li>
            <li>far as my daughter’s scalp, her itchiness has subsided since she’s been consistently using it, so we are very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that when using the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo, it lathers up well and has a very pleasant light scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works very quickly, and although $23 may sound like a lot to pay for one bottle of shampoo, if you are like me, you would be willing to pay over $100 to get rid of these problems!</li>
            <li>I think this will be my new favorite shampoo!</li>
            <li>I had purchased this originally for my husband to use for his itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I used this one it helped with the buildup in just one use.  </li>
            <li>I have fine/thick hair; (yeah I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>how excited he was about using the shampoo after he felt the results.</li>
            <li>First off, I have problems with dandruff and an itchy, flaky scalp most of the year.</li>
            <li>So I was excited.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s rich and luscious.</li>
            <li>So worth it!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve never in my life had this much fun with a product!</li>
            <li>I was pretty sure that was all my husband and I</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Then I bought this shampoo, but noticed the way it made my hair feel after showering it was squeaky clean, but also moisturized.</li>
            <li>The shampoo works great for those who suffer from dry and irritated scalp.</li>
            <li>It did clean my hair well.</li>
            <li>and it felt so much more healthy and alive to</li>
            <li>After just one week of use, I notice my dandruff went away and my hair always feels really clean after every use.</li>
            <li>How was mud going to clean my hair?</li>
            <li>My scalp felt so clean, and almost tingly feeling.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean without any residue.</li>
            <li>I like how it feels like it washes clean</li>
            <li>Will it leave my hair feeling somehow not quite so clean?</li>
            <li>Many shampoos promise to hydrate, add volume, intensify your natural curls, and more.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT MAKE MY SCALP SO CLEAN</li>
            <li>but this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>I recently received a complimentary bottle of Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo for review and it arrived in good timing because my daughter has been suffering from an itchy scalp, so she would be my perfect test-subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I have special moments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a fresh fragrance, leaves the hair clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have already tried their matching conditioner and I was super excited to know that they had a shampoo that went with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I’m really happy with my results, and I’m glad I got the chance to try Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo!</li>
            <li>First the whole shampooing part felt amazing.</li>
            <li>I stated in my review of the conditioner these products are great and left my hair feeling soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>Nice soft, tumbling curls, with no intervention on my part.</li>
            <li>Another thing I love it’s made in Israel, so you’re getting the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair seemed full of knots and tangles and felt almost straw-like to the touch.</li>
            <li>hair felt softer and full of body.</li>
            <li>FULL</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I found that to make the most out of this shampoo I had to really massage it into my scalp and use a conditioner.</li>
            <li>Olive Oil &amp; Shea Butter carrot oil sweet almond oil &amp; Cocamidopropyl betaine is an organic compound derived from coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers</li>
            <li>I love it and the conditioner both equally as much.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe are good</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smell is pleasant, lathers nicely (even in my ultra hard water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is perfect for him as he has dry scalp and makes his hair feel soft and not oily like some others do.</li>
            <li>, just because it doesn&#x27;t work perfectly for me, doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t for someone else.</li>
            <li>, just because it doesn&#x27;t work perfectly for me, doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t for someone else.</li>
            <li>My hair is clean and not built up with any additives, and for the first time in 2 years it is growing again!</li>
            <li>The lather carries away dirt and flakes and leaves you with a fresh squeaky clean scalp.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and fresh after shampooing with this</li>
            <li>importantly it cleaned my hair without drying it, made it feel soft look healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>and these products have left my hair significantly more moisturized and feeling healthy again.</li>
            <li>and I felt like this helped my ahir not feel caked with oil as quickly.</li>
            <li>this Dead sea mud shampoos it really effective in keeping my hair nice..</li>
            <li>I love that it is a natural and cruelty free product.</li>
            <li>As for me, I don&#x27;t really struggle with itchy scalp any more, and when I first started using this product, I was concerned how well it would clean my hair.  </li>
            <li>and so I was not surprised that I loved the shampoo as well.</li>
            <li>Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo strikes a great balance for my hair: clean, yet moisturized.</li>
            <li>It lathered up very nice and left my hair feeling soft and smooth after use.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo left my hair flake-free, smelling amazing as well as full and stronger than ever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, not too dry on your hair.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to have tried this product for the first time.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the ONLY thing that has done all of this and more!</li>
            <li>It seems to clarify the hair without stripping it of its much needed natural oils like most clarifying shampoos have been known to do!</li>
            <li>so make sure you always keep the seal on nice and tight and never leave it sitting sideways.</li>
            <li>This shampoo not only leaves my scalp flake &amp; itch free, but it leaves my hair smelling good, soft, and moisturized!</li>
            <li>His dandruff is under control and he really likes the light scent of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Dead Sea Mud Shampoo works great.</li>
            <li>I really did enjoy using this shampoo</li>
            <li>I really did enjoy using this shampoo</li>
            <li>Their quality is amazing and this product is no different.</li>
            <li>It is also a great choice for people who have trouble with scalp dandruff.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo did not do this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I love how it leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Effective on dandruff and eczema related conditions.</li>
            <li>This stuff was fun to use.  </li>
            <li>But I had fun using it and felt like I was a the spa.  </li>
            <li>Also this has a nice smell to it opposed to the chemical feel and smell of the traditional anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to many products.</li>
            <li>I for one, feel that the floral scent that’s added is not necessary, but most people will enjoy the bouquet smell as well.</li>

            <li>a pleasant mild fresh scent- not overwhelming-</li>
            <li>Im happy to say i have very little if not none dandruff.</li>
            <li>I also noticed his hair looked healthier, more shiny, and less frizzy since he does get the frizzy part from me:)</li>
            <li>used my daughter as a test subject because I wasn’t sure if the shampoo would be okay on my color-treated hair or not.</li>
            <li>i would strongly suggest you try this product if you have issues with your scalp, it is super gentle and only lightly</li>
            <li>It is dark in color , and smells nice and clean.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is Ok, but makes my scalp a little itchy and works Ok for dandruff.</li>
            <li>I am dandruff free at the moment so this will be my new anti dandruff solution.</li>
            <li>I received Adovia Mineral Skin Care Dead Sea Mud Shampoo for free via Tomoson and the opinions expressed in this post are my own.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s getting such great results that I don&#x27;t have the heart to take it back from her.</li>
            <li>It has a light clean scent that does not smell like medical.</li>
            <li>have used this product several more times since the initial use and each time it feels strange during, and right after use, but wonderful once it is clean and dry.</li>
            <li>first day when I used this shampoo in my hair, I don&#x27;t know why</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo during a promotion for which I got a discount in exchNge for being willing to write a review and post my opinion of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He said his scalp felt better as soon as he put it on his scalp, let alone after actually lathering it up!</li>
            <li>To alleviate any or all of my hair issues, I&#x27;m always on the look out for a miracle, so of course I was willing to try the Adovia brand when it came</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo lathered really well!</li>
            <li>though it was pretty funny</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t meet the expectations in my first attempt.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First, the scent.</li>
            <li>color of the shampoo had me worried at first</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo!</li>
            <li>I did notice the first time that my hair seemed softer.  </li>
            <li>Love it and will continue to use it regularly!</li>
            <li>maybe i&#x27;ll be able to adjust the amount in future washings.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After just my first time trying it, I immediately noticed that my hair was softer than before.</li>
            <li>I most definitely recommend this for anyone, but if you are of the textured hair ilk</li>
            <li>I most definitely recommend this for anyone, but if you are of the textured hair ilk</li>
            <li>While my hair did feel amazing after using this product I didn&#x27;t enjoy the small at all.</li>
            <li>I also won&#x27;t be buying anything again if I don&#x27;t first know the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I still have a lot left but went ahead and ordered 3 more bottles of the shampoo, as well as the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be somewhat of a thick, clumpy, product with a not so great smell.</li>
            <li>I am hoping this clears up dandruff too because I really suffer with that and head and shoulders dont even seem to help!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks and going to order some more when I&#x27;m almost done with my current bottle.</li>
            <li>Since the first use I have not had any itchiness on my scalp.</li>
            <li>so I REALLY wanted to try this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>Since the first use this shampoo has reduced my scalp psoriasis.</li>
            <li>--this stuff worked really well!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on the product unless you&#x27;re just looking for a product that smells good.</li>
            <li>May not have been a direct result of the product as it smells very nice and lathers well, but more from the lack of an actual active ingredient to control my symptoms.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t speak to that, but this is great to keep on hand for change of seasons or the occasional dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased several Adovia Natural products and I LOVE Them all!</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it foams up nicely for a nice cleaning.</li>
            <li>The (mostly) healthy ingredient list is a HUGE plus - Dead Sea Mud, Olive Oil, Vitamin E and Aloe Vera.</li>
            <li>My hair felt so clean and soft after washing.</li>
            <li>The ingredients don&#x27;t look 100% natural, but I don&#x27;t know of many shampoos that are totally natural.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not the cheapest or most expensive shampoo out there (for 7.4 fl oz), but I am convinced that it is a good one.</li>
            <li>However, I was running low on my favorite shampoo and decided to sneak out a little bit of this to hold me over till I replenished my own.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has really helped decrease the itchy feeling and reduce scratching after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>so I have a full set of hair I had to use a little more than a quarter size amount.</li>
            <li>the smell is very strong but even so i do not have problems with it bothering my senses like other chemical-y shampoo smells do.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is black and was kind of intimidating</li>
            <li>I have used this for over a week and my hair is super soft, and smells</li>
            <li>My scalp is no longer dry and my hair is softer and even seems stronger :)</li>
            <li>My hair felt super soft after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I just personally think the scent is a bit strong for my preference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked that the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo was not medicated, doesn&#x27;t smell funny and doesn&#x27;t make your head tingle.</li>
            <li>I’m not the only one in my family who has experienced dry scalp, my nine-year old son does too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using products with dead sea minerals on my skin and have loved the results, so it&#x27;s nice to try a shampoo with dead sea minerals too!</li>
            <li>He reports his scalp feels better, less itchy, and his hair definitely looks better.  </li>
            <li>Mine had a slight leak during shipping and the cap top did not work right.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so hard for me to find a good shampoo.</li>
            <li>It no longer felt dry and my scalp was less flaky with continued use, I was happy that it left a nice light scent that reminded me of something that I just cant seem to put my finger down on it.</li>
            <li>To fix this I stopped using conditioner except for the very ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the scalp.</li>
            <li>To me the product is very overrated.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much dandruff in my hair.</li>
            <li>but it really works.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this shampoo also.</li>
            <li>I have seasonal allergies and when things are in bloom, I find my scalp gets very itchy.</li>
            <li>I will say on the plus side though that this shampoo works really well.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to use as much in my hair.</li>
            <li>and I really worried that I&#x27;d look like a hag after using this type of product.</li>
            <li>I use the Adovia hydrating matching conditioner, and it seems to really add to the effectiveness of this treatment.</li>
            <li>I have very oily hair and could not go a day without shampooing.</li>
            <li>and it really cleaned my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>My wife is really picky with her shampoos.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to see if it lived up to the claims because if so it would really come in handy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>My scalp feels clean, yet not dry and stripped.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make my hair feel totally silky smooth</li>
            <li>I did use for 3 weeks straight.  </li>
            <li>After the 3 weeks, it seems I don&#x27;t really need to use the conditioner as much.  </li>
            <li>is that my skin really seems to have changed.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like reviews that say - this product cured me in a day -</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for making this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Her hair is very curly and mine is like a wave-curl.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>: I recommend using also the conditioner: The conditioner really makes my hair shiny and hydrated.</li>
            <li>At the time I tried it I wasn&#x27;t really thinking about the possibility that it would stop my scalp from itching all the time</li>
            <li>We wanted to try something different than what we had been using which were just the brands available at the supermarket for dandruff.</li>
            <li>After using it for a week the results remained the same, but alas, this is not the perfect shampoo for me, even though I wish it were.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Hair is left feeling naturally moisturized , and more manageable&lt;</li>
            <li>Smell good and its looks thick.</li>
            <li>considering I have baby fine flat blah hair.</li>
            <li>I was a little unsure about the color of the shampoo, but it smells nice and lathers up well in my long fine hair.</li>
            <li>When I took the towel off, my hair fell into soft curls right off the bat.</li>
            <li>After trying many other shampoos for dandruff, I am truly amazed how fast it cleared it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a nice light fragrance and should be used sparingly, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a bit strange at first to be using mud to clean with, but who am I to argue with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using other products from Adovia and love everyone of them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had psoriasis for most of my life, nothing other than sunlight has helped it before and nothing helped my scalp.  </li>
            <li>It seems to help my psoriasis better than the other stuff I have used.  </li>
            <li>i just can&#x27;t believe how this product with it&#x27;s sister conditioner made my hair there should be a higher rating than love it, there should be one that says squeel because that is exactly what i did when my hair dried!</li>
            <li>I use it when it is time to deep clean my scalp and strip away build up on my hair</li>
            <li>Many of them saying they saw improvement after the first few uses.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo doesn&#x27;t like my fine hair, within a few hours my hair becomes static, not overly so, but still enough to curse at my hair</li>
            <li>After washing, my hair wasn&#x27;t stained black, it was perfectly fine!</li>
            <li>This product is a dark color, with was not the most pleasing to think about putting in my hair, but I did.</li>
            <li>pretty much after the first or second wash, my itchiness was gone.</li>
            <li>First time using it my hair was soft.</li>
            <li>I normally have very oily hair</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and ready to style!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick like mud, it is like the regular shampoo consistency and smells clean.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Dead Sea Mud Shampoo to anyone who wants healthy hair with natural ingredients!!!</li>
            <li>The company offers a risk free purchase and money back guarantee for one year; it can’t hurt to try it out!</li>
            <li>A small amount creates a rich lather, and my scalp is calm!</li>
            <li>I used the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo, I noticed how lathering the shampoo is, and the light fresh scent.</li>
            <li>and my scalp is totally and completely itch and flake free.</li>
            <li>Adovia’s shampoo contains dead sea mud, chamomile, and olive oil to provide intense hydration to the scalp and it contains many enriching minerals as well.</li>
            <li>After a week of using it, I have tried having my hair both straight and curly (naturally), and I really do think that it has helped to manage the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything from the standard stuff you can find anywhere, to products that are only carried in top salons.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li>The cost is also high compare to remaining products.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I definitely get plenty of rich soft suds.</li>
            <li>I apply this shampoo as directed all you need is a quarter size amount maybe a little bit more than that</li>
            <li>so I was glad that a little bit of the shampoo did the trick.</li>
            <li>I could tell the difference within a couple of uses as my scalp was nice and dry without being overly dry.</li>
            <li>Very light shampoo that really deep cleans my hair and scalp, but left it feeling soft.</li>
            <li>and I have both been using it and enjoying the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>They have made an amazing Dead Sea Mud shampoo and a Dead Sea Salt conditioner that work fabulously with textured hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but WOW this stuff dose so much for my hair .</li>
            <li>Overall worth it.</li>
            <li>It has stopped the continual flaking that I normally have and my head is not as itchy.</li>
            <li>After I washed his hair he said immediately his head felt cleaner than when he uses his normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>My husband normally uses tea tree oil shampoo for dandruff.</li>
            <li>It still had a bit of frizz when I dried and straightened it, but it was noticeably better.</li>
            <li>dead sea mud shampoo itself has a interesting smell (almost metallic), which matches the look of it (a gun metal color).</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have been given the opportunity to try out the Dead Sea shampoo and conditioner for both of</li>
            <li>I mostly got it for my husband because he has occasional yet minor dandruff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo without conditioner on my long hair and it has been surprisingly still manageable</li>
            <li>My hair is about shoulder-length, and I normally follow my shampoo with a conditioner to &amp;#34;tame&amp;#34; it.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t make enough bubble and didn&#x27;t see much change in the hair, but as time past now I feel like this is one of the best dandruff shampoo in the market, in my case this shampoo leave necessary oil in hair to not to dry out the scalp and as a result this week</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great for dry and damaged thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>, all day I went around getting slight scents of apple blossom, which is great because I think I forgot deodorant that day, but it wasn&#x27;t so heavy that I was gagging or offending anyone&#x27;s noses with my shampoo (or B.O.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also love to dye my hair and that results in damaged and dry locks, so I had multiple issues to address.</li>
            <li>I feel dirty and gross when I have dandruff because I am a very clean person with good hygiene</li>
            <li>/&gt;i was not real sure what to expect when i got this product, you know \\&quot;dead sea mud\\&quot;, but i love this the shampoo lathers nicely, left my hair soft and clean feeling, lightly scented but not too feminine-</li>
            <li>It lathers up nicely in the shower and after several uses I noticed little to no dandruff.</li>
            <li>I opened up the package containing my new shampoo, I was a bit scared.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and the humidity makes it</li>
            <li>but sometimes the shampoos don&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Dead Sea Salts and Mud have been featured on CNN, in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Dead Sea Salts and Mud have been featured on CNN, in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times.  </li>
            <li>After my hair dried, it had a lot of extra bounce and volume, which is nice</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and found that using this shampoo caused irritation of my scalp.</li>
            <li>but it smells clean and slightly floral; it left my scalp and hair feeling clean, soft to the touch and refreshed; and, surprisingly, I even noticed a little less fallout of hair in the shower.</li>
            <li>All I can say is...&#x27;wow&#x27;!</li>
            <li>I normally wash my hair every day or every other day, but I was able to go three days with the same soft curls.</li>
            <li>My hair immediately felt moisturized, and soft!</li>
            <li>My hair is soft!</li>
            <li>After one use of this fantastic product in the evening, I noticed my scalp was less irritated and the amount of flakes</li>
            <li>You feel like your hair is stripped down just enough to get all of the excess oils out of it, and leave your hair feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>I extensively read the online reviews of this product before purchase and was hopeful based upon the positive input.</li>
            <li>a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is $23 for a bottle which is a little pricey for me, especially since I didn’t see many results.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft it even shines</li>
            <li>all soft curls, fewer flyaways and frizz.</li>
            <li>So I tried the Adovia again, and &#x27;wow&#x27;...again.</li>
            <li>wash my hair at least once per day, sometimes more depending on my activities.</li>
            <li>but it reminded me of “old man” cologne.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to sulphates, it is in the ingredients.</li>
            <li>The shampoo contains Chamomile, and Olive Oil, which keeps your hair from drying out, as it keeps natural moisture in scalp.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised with the results.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and manageable, with no fizziness.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair</li>
            <li>wow, it has MUD in it.</li>
            <li>Switched to this shampoo after using another dandruff shampoo that was all natural and organic.</li>
            <li>I used to have quite the collection of shampoos (changing between the brands every week or so), until we bought our house and completely ran out of room to store everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and soft again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the product to my scalp and massaged gently for several minutes.</li>
            <li>contains olive oil, shea butter, vitamin E, and chamomile for a natural formula that gets results</li>
            <li>but wow...</li>
            <li>This is not an all natural product.</li>
            <li>This shampoo feels soothing and moisturizing, makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this, and WOW</li>
            <li>and hello to soft spun silk hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is so so soft it even shines</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no wonder it made my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo is available on Amazon.com or through their website Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft without needing a condition over my scalp.</li>
            <li>It works and is not harsh on my scalp or hair.</li>
            <li>You complete satisfaction is guaranteed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other dandruff shampoos, and they just dried my scalp &amp; hair more!</li>
            <li>Not perfect but a good start.</li>
            <li>Good quality product, but unfortunately didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>Once you get past the black color and the name of it you are good, trust me.</li>
            <li>Whereas before I would have characterized my hair as “normal”, I now find my hair is dry and brittle, and my scalp is very irritable.</li>
            <li>Every shampoo I used in the past with the same pattern first clean all the dandruff in my hair and</li>
            <li>I also use this with the Scalp Shampoo Massage Brush (light blue) made in the USA (see my other review of that product)</li>
            <li>I notice that with just a little bit of the shampoo I was able to wash all my long hair.</li>
            <li>I am excited to try out the dead sea mud conditioner and see what I am in for with my hair with that .</li>
            <li>: I got this product as part of an advertorial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited to try Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo after reading about it.</li>
            <li>Dead Sea Mud Shampoo from Adovia leaves your hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite initially, but after the results of no more itchiness, I have become accustomed to it and it no longer is as pungent as I once thought it was.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I typically do not use conditioner anyway.</li>
            <li>but I typically do not use conditioner anyway.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo claimed to give fast, natural relief from itchy, dry, flaky scalp, scalp psoriasis, seborrhea dermatitis and dandruff.</li>
            <li>I have bad dandruff and normal dandruff shampoo isn&#x27;t very effective to manage it.</li>
            <li>People travel all the way to the actual Dead Sea in the Middle East to reap these benefits but you can get them delivered in a bottle and satisfaction is guaranteed! &#x3D; )</li>
            <li>highly recommend that you give this product a try especially if you have been less than satisfied with the other shampoos you have used.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend that you give this product a try especially if you have been less than satisfied with the other shampoos you have used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually sensitive to smells from fragrance, but thankfully the scent is light and hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li>I noticed positive changes after only the first few uses.</li>
            <li>I recommend Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo if you suffer from dry scalp, itchiness due to dry scalp, or if you’re like my son who experienced flakiness.</li>
            <li>and he said it has really helped with his dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>absolutely works for dry and itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>absolutely works for dry and itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have an itchy, dry, flaky scalp and some shampoos really irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li>I would not suggest it for daily use as it could strip too much from your hair, but everyone is different.</li>
            <li>but the second time i used it, WOW!!!!&lt;br /&gt;now, i naturally have soft hair.</li>
            <li>This product really has worked on my scaly, flaky, dry itchy scalp where no other product has worked.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is easy to rinse out and the bottle lasts a long time because so little is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, this product really has worked on my psoriasis scaly, flaky, dry itchy scalp where no other product has worked.</li>
            <li>I went to a hair appointment today and when I mentioned I have major issues with dandruff</li>
            <li>I had a severe itchy scalp and no other shampoos or conditioners worked.</li>
            <li>I applied to review Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo because I&#x27;m always interested in trying new products</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth a shot especially if you&#x27;ve tried other things.  </li>
            <li>(some people are lucky enough to skip a day) because in less then 24 hours my hair looks greasy.</li>
            <li>I used the shampoo in the shower and from the minute it touched my scalp, I felt an instant soothing sensation and was deeply refreshed, but I figured that did not mean the product was working.</li>
            <li>the past, my husband and I would use a dandruff shampoo occasionally to clear up our dandruff or irritated scalp and then return to our regular (not anything special) shampoo.</li>
            <li>The shampoo not only cleans it leaves your hair feeling so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>After your wash your hair is left feeling soft and your scalp refreshed.</li>
            <li>Hopefully something in the near future works.</li>
            <li>This is something that I only noticed recently, that my scalp is really itchy at times, although there is no obvious cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading the list of ingredients, I was very intrigued, and just a bit curious.</li>
            <li>This shampoo contains natural ingredients such as:&lt;br /&gt;*Dead</li>
            <li>i have used natural products for years now and this one mixed with my argon oil shampoo</li>
            <li>it lathers completely into a white foam</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel any kind of stiff residue after washing it out, but the real &#x27;wow&#x27; came after I had squeezed out the excess water and wrapped my wet hair in a towel for a few minutes, as I always do.</li>
            <li>Although the color of the shampoo makes you think that it has the consistency and texture of mud, it is very much the same type of texture and viscosity as any other shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dandruff super bad, but it seems like I have it more in the winter than the summer.</li>
            <li>Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo is available on Amazon.com or through their website Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice.air is dry.</li>
            <li>with pure and natural Dead Sea mud for an infusion of essential minerals into scalp and hair</li>
            <li>: the image of the bottle shows a grey cap that matches the bottle; mine came with a clear cap that doesn&#x27;t appear to go with the bottle and made me wonder if it was repackaged.</li>
            <li>I was given a chance to try Adovia Mineral  Skin Care Dead Sea Mud Shampoo, at first I was a bit skeptic to wash my hair with mud.</li>
            <li>Dead Sea Mud Shampoo is not just a pretty scent, but the shampoo is fabulous!&lt;br</li>
            <li>So when I first heard about this Dead Sea Mud Shampoo</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tip: If you have a few extra bucks, be sure to try the Adovia dead sea mud mask.</li>
            <li>When I first applied this, It almost felt dry and tangled while washing, which was the opposite of what I expected.</li>
            <li>The waves clearly show even after my hair is dry.</li>
            <li>my scalp isn&#x27;t as itchy and dry as it used to be and my hair looks hydrated, healthier and feels soft.</li>
            <li>scalp isn&#x27;t overly dry, so perhaps Im not seeing some of the benefits others do, however, my 4 year old son still has some cradle cap, so I am going to try this on him and see if it makes a differemce</li>
            <li>The Aloe Vera keeps your strands from drying out and retains your scalps natural moisture thus preventing dry scalp.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, leaves it soft for days without getting oily.</li>
            <li>I got the new bottle and noticed the formula is less thick, which is a good thing since it was a bit thick before.</li>
            <li>Dead Sea Mud Shampoo is specially formulated with natural ingredients such as Dead Sea Mud, Chamomile &amp; Olive Oil to bring deep hydration and moisture to the scalp, relieving itching and flakiness.</li>
            <li>I reviewed Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo recently and have nothing but positive things to say about this product.</li>

            <li> This shampoo is also great for after getting a shave cut as my breaks out from clippers and this helps relieve and make the bumps go away as well.</li>
            <li> so I was happy about that as well.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> If you would like my full in-depth review you can find it here![</li>
            <li> The product was dark gray in color, and had a wonderful scent-not one that I could pin-point as smelling like anything in particular, but it was pleasant</li>
            <li> Scientists have yet to determine why this mud has such great results but it has been used in many applications from dryness, muscle relaxation, blood circulation and even treatment for some cancers.</li>
            <li> I figured it would be a good test to see how my hair reacts to this more natural shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one thing I didn&#x27;t care for was the strong scent both have.</li>
            <li> It lathered up well and had a strong scent.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great and left my hair feeling smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li> While this doesn&#x27;t help with the large flakes and sores like some other shampoos, she has found that this leaves her hair feeling wonderful and the smell is nice.  </li>
            <li> Good clean scalp without too much lather.</li>
            <li> There is a full review available on my website if you&#x27;d like to learn more head on over.</li>
            <li> It lathers just fine, and I don&#x27;t feel like I have to use a lot to get my hair</li>
            <li> I have fine color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Smell is pleasant, I like that it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li> Yet it is mild on my skin .!  </li>
            <li> It has a very nice scent and makes my hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li> don’t have a huge problem with dandruff although my scalp can get itchy sometimes.</li>
            <li> Since using this shampoo we have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> did help get my hair clean easily</li>
            <li> This dandruff shampoo by Adovia  is great for the entire family.</li>
            <li> The smell is light and not medicinal smelling.</li>
            <li> I bought about ten different shampoos from Amazon, and I liked this best.  </li>
            <li> now dandruff free</li>
            <li> it had a light flower scent nothing too over powering</li>
            <li> I bought this to try for myself, primarily because I deal with itchy scalp, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a second bottle at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> did receive a free bottle of this shampoo from the company to try.</li>
            <li> Even though it was free, this did not bias my opinion.</li>
            <li> wanted to try Adovia’s shampoo to hopefully find some relief for my scalp issues and be free from embarrassment.</li>
            <li> I experienced throughout the next day were dramatically reduced.</li>
            <li> He’s been impressed by Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo.</li>
            <li> a $24 price tag (and free shipping) on Amazon</li>
            <li> I received the products mentioned  for free using  </li>
            <li> have been dandruff free since using.</li>
            <li> I do want to say they I received a free product trial for it</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a shampoo that will keep my hair looking nice no matter how much I do to it and</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s a really fantastic product</li>
            <li> It has been great for that, has a nice light scent, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or chemically.</li>
            <li> far as my daughter’s scalp, her itchiness has subsided since she’s been consistently using it, so we are very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that when using the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo, it lathers up well and has a very pleasant light scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works very quickly, and although $23 may sound like a lot to pay for one bottle of shampoo, if you are like me, you would be willing to pay over $100 to get rid of these problems!</li>
            <li> I think this will be my new favorite shampoo!</li>
            <li> I had purchased this originally for my husband to use for his itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I used this one it helped with the buildup in just one use.  </li>
            <li> I have fine/thick hair; (yeah I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> how excited he was about using the shampoo after he felt the results.</li>
            <li> First off, I have problems with dandruff and an itchy, flaky scalp most of the year.</li>
            <li> So I was excited.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s rich and luscious.</li>
            <li> So worth it!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve never in my life had this much fun with a product!</li>
            <li> I was pretty sure that was all my husband and I</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Then I bought this shampoo, but noticed the way it made my hair feel after showering it was squeaky clean, but also moisturized.</li>
            <li> The shampoo works great for those who suffer from dry and irritated scalp.</li>
            <li> It did clean my hair well.</li>
            <li> and it felt so much more healthy and alive to</li>
            <li> After just one week of use, I notice my dandruff went away and my hair always feels really clean after every use.</li>
            <li> How was mud going to clean my hair?</li>
            <li> My scalp felt so clean, and almost tingly feeling.</li>
            <li> It rinses clean without any residue.</li>
            <li> I like how it feels like it washes clean</li>
            <li> Will it leave my hair feeling somehow not quite so clean?</li>
            <li> Many shampoos promise to hydrate, add volume, intensify your natural curls, and more.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT MAKE MY SCALP SO CLEAN</li>
            <li> but this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> I recently received a complimentary bottle of Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo for review and it arrived in good timing because my daughter has been suffering from an itchy scalp, so she would be my perfect test-subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I have special moments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a fresh fragrance, leaves the hair clean and smooth.  </li>

            <li> Nice soft, tumbling curls, with no intervention on my part.</li>
            <li> Another thing I love it’s made in Israel, so you’re getting the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair seemed full of knots and tangles and felt almost straw-like to the touch.</li>

            <li> , just because it doesn&#x27;t work perfectly for me, doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t for someone else.</li>
            <li> , just because it doesn&#x27;t work perfectly for me, doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t for someone else.</li>

            <li> and so I was not surprised that I loved the shampoo as well.</li>

            <li> It seems to clarify the hair without stripping it of its much needed natural oils like most clarifying shampoos have been known to do!</li>
            <li> so make sure you always keep the seal on nice and tight and never leave it sitting sideways.</li>
            <li> This shampoo not only leaves my scalp flake &amp; itch free, but it leaves my hair smelling good, soft, and moisturized!</li>
            <li> His dandruff is under control and he really likes the light scent of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Shampoo works great.</li>
            <li> I really did enjoy using this shampoo</li>
            <li> I really did enjoy using this shampoo</li>
            <li> Their quality is amazing and this product is no different.</li>
            <li> It is also a great choice for people who have trouble with scalp dandruff.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo did not do this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I love how it leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Effective on dandruff and eczema related conditions.</li>
            <li> This stuff was fun to use.  </li>
            <li> But I had fun using it and felt like I was a the spa.  </li>
            <li> Also this has a nice smell to it opposed to the chemical feel and smell of the traditional anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to many products.</li>
            <li> I for one, feel that the floral scent that’s added is not necessary, but most people will enjoy the bouquet smell as well.</li>

            <li> Im happy to say i have very little if not none dandruff.</li>
            <li> I also noticed his hair looked healthier, more shiny, and less frizzy since he does get the frizzy part from me:)</li>
            <li> used my daughter as a test subject because I wasn’t sure if the shampoo would be okay on my color-treated hair or not.</li>
            <li> i would strongly suggest you try this product if you have issues with your scalp, it is super gentle and only lightly</li>
            <li> It is dark in color , and smells nice and clean.</li>

            <li> I received Adovia Mineral Skin Care Dead Sea Mud Shampoo for free via Tomoson and the opinions expressed in this post are my own.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s getting such great results that I don&#x27;t have the heart to take it back from her.</li>
            <li> It has a light clean scent that does not smell like medical.</li>
            <li> have used this product several more times since the initial use and each time it feels strange during, and right after use, but wonderful once it is clean and dry.</li>
            <li> first day when I used this shampoo in my hair, I don&#x27;t know why</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo during a promotion for which I got a discount in exchNge for being willing to write a review and post my opinion of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He said his scalp felt better as soon as he put it on his scalp, let alone after actually lathering it up!</li>
            <li> To alleviate any or all of my hair issues, I&#x27;m always on the look out for a miracle, so of course I was willing to try the Adovia brand when it came</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shampoo lathered really well!</li>
            <li> though it was pretty funny</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t meet the expectations in my first attempt.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First, the scent.</li>
            <li> color of the shampoo had me worried at first</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I did notice the first time that my hair seemed softer.  </li>
            <li> Love it and will continue to use it regularly!</li>
            <li> maybe i&#x27;ll be able to adjust the amount in future washings.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After just my first time trying it, I immediately noticed that my hair was softer than before.</li>
            <li> I most definitely recommend this for anyone, but if you are of the textured hair ilk</li>
            <li> I most definitely recommend this for anyone, but if you are of the textured hair ilk</li>
            <li> While my hair did feel amazing after using this product I didn&#x27;t enjoy the small at all.</li>
            <li> I also won&#x27;t be buying anything again if I don&#x27;t first know the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I still have a lot left but went ahead and ordered 3 more bottles of the shampoo, as well as the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be somewhat of a thick, clumpy, product with a not so great smell.</li>
            <li> I am hoping this clears up dandruff too because I really suffer with that and head and shoulders dont even seem to help!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks and going to order some more when I&#x27;m almost done with my current bottle.</li>
            <li> Since the first use I have not had any itchiness on my scalp.</li>
            <li> so I REALLY wanted to try this shampoo!  </li>
            <li> Since the first use this shampoo has reduced my scalp psoriasis.</li>
            <li> --this stuff worked really well!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the product unless you&#x27;re just looking for a product that smells good.</li>
            <li> May not have been a direct result of the product as it smells very nice and lathers well, but more from the lack of an actual active ingredient to control my symptoms.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak to that, but this is great to keep on hand for change of seasons or the occasional dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased several Adovia Natural products and I LOVE Them all!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it foams up nicely for a nice cleaning.</li>
            <li> The (mostly) healthy ingredient list is a HUGE plus - Dead Sea Mud, Olive Oil, Vitamin E and Aloe Vera.</li>
            <li> My hair felt so clean and soft after washing.</li>
            <li> The ingredients don&#x27;t look 100% natural, but I don&#x27;t know of many shampoos that are totally natural.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not the cheapest or most expensive shampoo out there (for 7.4 fl oz), but I am convinced that it is a good one.</li>
            <li> However, I was running low on my favorite shampoo and decided to sneak out a little bit of this to hold me over till I replenished my own.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has really helped decrease the itchy feeling and reduce scratching after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> so I have a full set of hair I had to use a little more than a quarter size amount.</li>
            <li> the smell is very strong but even so i do not have problems with it bothering my senses like other chemical-y shampoo smells do.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is black and was kind of intimidating</li>
            <li> I have used this for over a week and my hair is super soft, and smells</li>
            <li> My scalp is no longer dry and my hair is softer and even seems stronger :)</li>
            <li> My hair felt super soft after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I just personally think the scent is a bit strong for my preference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked that the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo was not medicated, doesn&#x27;t smell funny and doesn&#x27;t make your head tingle.</li>
            <li> I’m not the only one in my family who has experienced dry scalp, my nine-year old son does too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using products with dead sea minerals on my skin and have loved the results, so it&#x27;s nice to try a shampoo with dead sea minerals too!</li>
            <li> He reports his scalp feels better, less itchy, and his hair definitely looks better.  </li>
            <li> Mine had a slight leak during shipping and the cap top did not work right.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so hard for me to find a good shampoo.</li>
            <li> It no longer felt dry and my scalp was less flaky with continued use, I was happy that it left a nice light scent that reminded me of something that I just cant seem to put my finger down on it.</li>
            <li> To fix this I stopped using conditioner except for the very ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> Gentle on the scalp.</li>
            <li> To me the product is very overrated.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much dandruff in my hair.</li>
            <li> but it really works.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this shampoo also.</li>
            <li> I have seasonal allergies and when things are in bloom, I find my scalp gets very itchy.</li>
            <li> I will say on the plus side though that this shampoo works really well.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to use as much in my hair.</li>
            <li> and I really worried that I&#x27;d look like a hag after using this type of product.</li>
            <li> I use the Adovia hydrating matching conditioner, and it seems to really add to the effectiveness of this treatment.</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair and could not go a day without shampooing.</li>
            <li> and it really cleaned my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> My wife is really picky with her shampoos.</li>
            <li> but I wanted to see if it lived up to the claims because if so it would really come in handy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> My scalp feels clean, yet not dry and stripped.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my hair feel totally silky smooth</li>
            <li> I did use for 3 weeks straight.  </li>
            <li> After the 3 weeks, it seems I don&#x27;t really need to use the conditioner as much.  </li>
            <li> is that my skin really seems to have changed.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like reviews that say - this product cured me in a day -</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for making this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Her hair is very curly and mine is like a wave-curl.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> : I recommend using also the conditioner: The conditioner really makes my hair shiny and hydrated.</li>
            <li> At the time I tried it I wasn&#x27;t really thinking about the possibility that it would stop my scalp from itching all the time</li>
            <li> We wanted to try something different than what we had been using which were just the brands available at the supermarket for dandruff.</li>
            <li> After using it for a week the results remained the same, but alas, this is not the perfect shampoo for me, even though I wish it were.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Hair is left feeling naturally moisturized , and more manageable&lt;</li>
            <li> Smell good and its looks thick.</li>
            <li> considering I have baby fine flat blah hair.</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure about the color of the shampoo, but it smells nice and lathers up well in my long fine hair.</li>
            <li> When I took the towel off, my hair fell into soft curls right off the bat.</li>
            <li> After trying many other shampoos for dandruff, I am truly amazed how fast it cleared it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice light fragrance and should be used sparingly, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a bit strange at first to be using mud to clean with, but who am I to argue with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using other products from Adovia and love everyone of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had psoriasis for most of my life, nothing other than sunlight has helped it before and nothing helped my scalp.  </li>
            <li> It seems to help my psoriasis better than the other stuff I have used.  </li>
            <li> i just can&#x27;t believe how this product with it&#x27;s sister conditioner made my hair there should be a higher rating than love it, there should be one that says squeel because that is exactly what i did when my hair dried!</li>
            <li> I use it when it is time to deep clean my scalp and strip away build up on my hair</li>
            <li> Many of them saying they saw improvement after the first few uses.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t like my fine hair, within a few hours my hair becomes static, not overly so, but still enough to curse at my hair</li>
            <li> After washing, my hair wasn&#x27;t stained black, it was perfectly fine!</li>
            <li> This product is a dark color, with was not the most pleasing to think about putting in my hair, but I did.</li>
            <li> pretty much after the first or second wash, my itchiness was gone.</li>
            <li> First time using it my hair was soft.</li>
            <li> I normally have very oily hair</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and ready to style!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick like mud, it is like the regular shampoo consistency and smells clean.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Dead Sea Mud Shampoo to anyone who wants healthy hair with natural ingredients!!!</li>
            <li> The company offers a risk free purchase and money back guarantee for one year; it can’t hurt to try it out!</li>
            <li> A small amount creates a rich lather, and my scalp is calm!</li>
            <li> I used the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo, I noticed how lathering the shampoo is, and the light fresh scent.</li>
            <li> and my scalp is totally and completely itch and flake free.</li>
            <li> Adovia’s shampoo contains dead sea mud, chamomile, and olive oil to provide intense hydration to the scalp and it contains many enriching minerals as well.</li>
            <li> After a week of using it, I have tried having my hair both straight and curly (naturally), and I really do think that it has helped to manage the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything from the standard stuff you can find anywhere, to products that are only carried in top salons.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> The cost is also high compare to remaining products.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I definitely get plenty of rich soft suds.</li>
            <li> I apply this shampoo as directed all you need is a quarter size amount maybe a little bit more than that</li>
            <li> so I was glad that a little bit of the shampoo did the trick.</li>
            <li> I could tell the difference within a couple of uses as my scalp was nice and dry without being overly dry.</li>
            <li> Very light shampoo that really deep cleans my hair and scalp, but left it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> and I have both been using it and enjoying the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> They have made an amazing Dead Sea Mud shampoo and a Dead Sea Salt conditioner that work fabulously with textured hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but WOW this stuff dose so much for my hair .</li>
            <li> Overall worth it.</li>
            <li> It has stopped the continual flaking that I normally have and my head is not as itchy.</li>
            <li> After I washed his hair he said immediately his head felt cleaner than when he uses his normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> My husband normally uses tea tree oil shampoo for dandruff.</li>
            <li> It still had a bit of frizz when I dried and straightened it, but it was noticeably better.</li>
            <li> dead sea mud shampoo itself has a interesting smell (almost metallic), which matches the look of it (a gun metal color).</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have been given the opportunity to try out the Dead Sea shampoo and conditioner for both of</li>
            <li> I mostly got it for my husband because he has occasional yet minor dandruff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo without conditioner on my long hair and it has been surprisingly still manageable</li>
            <li> My hair is about shoulder-length, and I normally follow my shampoo with a conditioner to &amp;#34;tame&amp;#34; it.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t make enough bubble and didn&#x27;t see much change in the hair, but as time past now I feel like this is one of the best dandruff shampoo in the market, in my case this shampoo leave necessary oil in hair to not to dry out the scalp and as a result this week</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for dry and damaged thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> , all day I went around getting slight scents of apple blossom, which is great because I think I forgot deodorant that day, but it wasn&#x27;t so heavy that I was gagging or offending anyone&#x27;s noses with my shampoo (or B.O.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also love to dye my hair and that results in damaged and dry locks, so I had multiple issues to address.</li>
            <li> I feel dirty and gross when I have dandruff because I am a very clean person with good hygiene</li>
            <li> /&gt;i was not real sure what to expect when i got this product, you know \\&quot;dead sea mud\\&quot;, but i love this the shampoo lathers nicely, left my hair soft and clean feeling, lightly scented but not too feminine-</li>
            <li> It lathers up nicely in the shower and after several uses I noticed little to no dandruff.</li>
            <li> I opened up the package containing my new shampoo, I was a bit scared.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and the humidity makes it</li>
            <li> but sometimes the shampoos don&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dead Sea Salts and Mud have been featured on CNN, in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Dead Sea Salts and Mud have been featured on CNN, in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times.  </li>
            <li> After my hair dried, it had a lot of extra bounce and volume, which is nice</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and found that using this shampoo caused irritation of my scalp.</li>
            <li> but it smells clean and slightly floral; it left my scalp and hair feeling clean, soft to the touch and refreshed; and, surprisingly, I even noticed a little less fallout of hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> All I can say is...&#x27;wow&#x27;!</li>
            <li> I normally wash my hair every day or every other day, but I was able to go three days with the same soft curls.</li>
            <li> My hair immediately felt moisturized, and soft!</li>
            <li> My hair is soft!</li>
            <li> After one use of this fantastic product in the evening, I noticed my scalp was less irritated and the amount of flakes</li>
            <li> You feel like your hair is stripped down just enough to get all of the excess oils out of it, and leave your hair feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> I extensively read the online reviews of this product before purchase and was hopeful based upon the positive input.</li>
            <li> a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is $23 for a bottle which is a little pricey for me, especially since I didn’t see many results.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft it even shines</li>
            <li> all soft curls, fewer flyaways and frizz.</li>
            <li> So I tried the Adovia again, and &#x27;wow&#x27;...again.</li>
            <li> wash my hair at least once per day, sometimes more depending on my activities.</li>
            <li> but it reminded me of “old man” cologne.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to sulphates, it is in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> The shampoo contains Chamomile, and Olive Oil, which keeps your hair from drying out, as it keeps natural moisture in scalp.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised with the results.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and manageable, with no fizziness.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair</li>
            <li> wow, it has MUD in it.</li>
            <li> Switched to this shampoo after using another dandruff shampoo that was all natural and organic.</li>
            <li> I used to have quite the collection of shampoos (changing between the brands every week or so), until we bought our house and completely ran out of room to store everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and soft again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the product to my scalp and massaged gently for several minutes.</li>
            <li> contains olive oil, shea butter, vitamin E, and chamomile for a natural formula that gets results</li>
            <li> but wow...</li>
            <li> This is not an all natural product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo feels soothing and moisturizing, makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this, and WOW</li>
            <li> and hello to soft spun silk hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is so so soft it even shines</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no wonder it made my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo is available on Amazon.com or through their website Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft without needing a condition over my scalp.</li>
            <li> It works and is not harsh on my scalp or hair.</li>
            <li> You complete satisfaction is guaranteed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other dandruff shampoos, and they just dried my scalp &amp; hair more!</li>
            <li> Not perfect but a good start.</li>
            <li> Good quality product, but unfortunately didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> Once you get past the black color and the name of it you are good, trust me.</li>
            <li> Whereas before I would have characterized my hair as “normal”, I now find my hair is dry and brittle, and my scalp is very irritable.</li>
            <li> Every shampoo I used in the past with the same pattern first clean all the dandruff in my hair and</li>
            <li> I also use this with the Scalp Shampoo Massage Brush (light blue) made in the USA (see my other review of that product)</li>
            <li> I notice that with just a little bit of the shampoo I was able to wash all my long hair.</li>
            <li> I am excited to try out the dead sea mud conditioner and see what I am in for with my hair with that .</li>
            <li> : I got this product as part of an advertorial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited to try Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo after reading about it.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Shampoo from Adovia leaves your hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite initially, but after the results of no more itchiness, I have become accustomed to it and it no longer is as pungent as I once thought it was.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I typically do not use conditioner anyway.</li>
            <li> but I typically do not use conditioner anyway.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shampoo claimed to give fast, natural relief from itchy, dry, flaky scalp, scalp psoriasis, seborrhea dermatitis and dandruff.</li>
            <li> I have bad dandruff and normal dandruff shampoo isn&#x27;t very effective to manage it.</li>
            <li> People travel all the way to the actual Dead Sea in the Middle East to reap these benefits but you can get them delivered in a bottle and satisfaction is guaranteed! &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> highly recommend that you give this product a try especially if you have been less than satisfied with the other shampoos you have used.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend that you give this product a try especially if you have been less than satisfied with the other shampoos you have used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually sensitive to smells from fragrance, but thankfully the scent is light and hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> I noticed positive changes after only the first few uses.</li>
            <li> I recommend Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo if you suffer from dry scalp, itchiness due to dry scalp, or if you’re like my son who experienced flakiness.</li>
            <li> and he said it has really helped with his dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> absolutely works for dry and itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> absolutely works for dry and itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have an itchy, dry, flaky scalp and some shampoos really irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li> I would not suggest it for daily use as it could strip too much from your hair, but everyone is different.</li>
            <li> but the second time i used it, WOW!!!!&lt;br /&gt;now, i naturally have soft hair.</li>
            <li> This product really has worked on my scaly, flaky, dry itchy scalp where no other product has worked.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is easy to rinse out and the bottle lasts a long time because so little is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, this product really has worked on my psoriasis scaly, flaky, dry itchy scalp where no other product has worked.</li>
            <li> I went to a hair appointment today and when I mentioned I have major issues with dandruff</li>
            <li> I had a severe itchy scalp and no other shampoos or conditioners worked.</li>
            <li> I applied to review Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo because I&#x27;m always interested in trying new products</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth a shot especially if you&#x27;ve tried other things.  </li>
            <li> (some people are lucky enough to skip a day) because in less then 24 hours my hair looks greasy.</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo in the shower and from the minute it touched my scalp, I felt an instant soothing sensation and was deeply refreshed, but I figured that did not mean the product was working.</li>
            <li> the past, my husband and I would use a dandruff shampoo occasionally to clear up our dandruff or irritated scalp and then return to our regular (not anything special) shampoo.</li>
            <li> The shampoo not only cleans it leaves your hair feeling so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> After your wash your hair is left feeling soft and your scalp refreshed.</li>
            <li> Hopefully something in the near future works.</li>
            <li> This is something that I only noticed recently, that my scalp is really itchy at times, although there is no obvious cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading the list of ingredients, I was very intrigued, and just a bit curious.</li>
            <li> This shampoo contains natural ingredients such as:&lt;br /&gt;*Dead</li>
            <li> i have used natural products for years now and this one mixed with my argon oil shampoo</li>
            <li> it lathers completely into a white foam</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel any kind of stiff residue after washing it out, but the real &#x27;wow&#x27; came after I had squeezed out the excess water and wrapped my wet hair in a towel for a few minutes, as I always do.</li>
            <li> Although the color of the shampoo makes you think that it has the consistency and texture of mud, it is very much the same type of texture and viscosity as any other shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff super bad, but it seems like I have it more in the winter than the summer.</li>
            <li> Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo is available on Amazon.com or through their website Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice.air is dry.</li>
            <li> with pure and natural Dead Sea mud for an infusion of essential minerals into scalp and hair</li>
            <li> : the image of the bottle shows a grey cap that matches the bottle; mine came with a clear cap that doesn&#x27;t appear to go with the bottle and made me wonder if it was repackaged.</li>
            <li> I was given a chance to try Adovia Mineral  Skin Care Dead Sea Mud Shampoo, at first I was a bit skeptic to wash my hair with mud.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Shampoo is not just a pretty scent, but the shampoo is fabulous!&lt;br</li>
            <li> So when I first heard about this Dead Sea Mud Shampoo</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tip: If you have a few extra bucks, be sure to try the Adovia dead sea mud mask.</li>
            <li> When I first applied this, It almost felt dry and tangled while washing, which was the opposite of what I expected.</li>
            <li> The waves clearly show even after my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> my scalp isn&#x27;t as itchy and dry as it used to be and my hair looks hydrated, healthier and feels soft.</li>
            <li> scalp isn&#x27;t overly dry, so perhaps Im not seeing some of the benefits others do, however, my 4 year old son still has some cradle cap, so I am going to try this on him and see if it makes a differemce</li>
            <li> The Aloe Vera keeps your strands from drying out and retains your scalps natural moisture thus preventing dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, leaves it soft for days without getting oily.</li>
            <li> I got the new bottle and noticed the formula is less thick, which is a good thing since it was a bit thick before.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Shampoo is specially formulated with natural ingredients such as Dead Sea Mud, Chamomile &amp; Olive Oil to bring deep hydration and moisture to the scalp, relieving itching and flakiness.</li>
            <li> I reviewed Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo recently and have nothing but positive things to say about this product.</li>
            <li> The only thing that worked really was a steroid topical that is just way too harsh and in the long run</li>
            <li> I tend to buy shampoos that are organic or contain a lot of herbs or other natural ingredients</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t small all fruity and isn&#x27;t full of fake chemicals to give it a sweet fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a product I have recently received that I was very intrigued about and was anxious to try.</li>
            <li> Small flakes, large flakes,</li>
            <li> later the day my hair scalp gets dry which then comes out like dandruff and next day my hair gets oily and cycle goes</li>
            <li> hair and scalp are very dry, so I was excited to pour a little bit of this product out into my hand to view the Dead Sea shampoo for myself.</li>
            <li> I am quickly becoming addicted to every product I try!</li>
            <li> really i was expecting the usual shampoo ho hums, but that was NOT the case</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would help me with my flat hair issue.</li>
            <li> so I have to flat iron my hair and use a lot of styling products .</li>
            <li> To give you an idea of how long a bottle might last, I use about a quarter size puddle of this shampoo each time I wash my hair and my hair is below my shoulders.</li>
            <li> To give you an idea of how long a bottle might last, I use about a quarter size puddle of this shampoo each time I wash my hair and my hair is below my shoulders.</li>
            <li> The first few times using it my hair felt weighed down after drying, which is the opposite of what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Salts and Mud have been featured on CNN, in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times.</li>
            <li> I recommend that you try to wash with the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo at least twice a week in order to see accurate results.</li>
            <li> I let it dry, and my hair looked terrific when it dries...</li>
            <li> He likes it and it does seem to be helping with his dandruff and dry scalp although he&#x27;s only been using it for a couple weeks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not scented enough that you smell it after you dry your hair...</li>
            <li> After my fourth pregnancy I suffered from dry scalp.</li>
            <li> It adds moisture to my dry hair with daily use.</li>
            <li> i have a bunch of toddlers, i simply don&#x27;t have time to wait six hours for hair to dry to get anything done.</li>
            <li> The tingle of other shampoos was something that made me think it was doing something, but also worried me a little as to what it really was doing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have searched far and wide for shampoos or creams that will help my extremely flaky, red, dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I have never had any issues with flakes or itchiness before, but have suffered both within the last year or so and no shampoo has helped or eliminated these issues and some of them have left my hair feeling rough and dry.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve decided those positive reviews must be solicited and financially awarded because this product actually made my flaking and itching worse.</li>
            <li> i have issues with a dry scalp but oily hair and this product helped with the itchy dry scalp and did not add extra oil to my hair!</li>
            <li> so it lasts for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> have suffered for years with this embarrassing condition and had no idea all this time, that a cure was not far away at all.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve reviewed two of Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud products and both times</li>
            <li> i used to wear it so long</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the Dead Sea shampoo and conditioners her curls stayed soft and bouncy and when it was time to comb through them</li>
            <li> You also know how long haired woman like myself lose there hair and have issues with dandruff, i call it cradle cap like babies</li>
            <li> if you have long thick hair, you apply it to the scalp and massage gently 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li> shampoo looks little strange because it’s black although the consistency is the same as normal shampoos I have tried.</li>
            <li> I first tried Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo on my son, one shampoo relieved his itchy scalp, and we notice less flakes!</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Shampoo is formulated with natural ingredients such as Dead Sea Mud, Chamomile &amp; Olive Oil to bring deep hydration and moisture to the scalp, relieving itching and flakiness.</li>
            <li> As I have tried many different brands in the past, I’ll admit I was expecting this shampoo to fail as well.</li>
            <li> Some of the ingredients listed include dead sea mud, dead sea water, chamomile, algae extract, papaya extract, dead sea salt, aloe vera gel, wheat germ oil, grape seed oil, sweet almond oil, carrot seed oil, olive oil and shea butter.</li>
            <li> She has her scalp gets dry in the summer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this shampoo at all, if you have hair that it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband since he has dry skin and scalp.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with dry itchy scalp for a while</li>
            <li> This product works wonders on my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> My husband has issues with dry scalp</li>
            <li> It was also quite soothing to my scalp which has a tendency to become dry.</li>
            <li> Noticeable improvement in the dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Dry and itchy scalp have improved again.</li>
            <li> also have autoimmune problem causing dry hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Works wonders on dry color treated hair</li>
            <li> Was looking for cancerogenic and estrogen free shampoo - big disappointment - not all ingredients are listed on this page.</li>
            <li> Adovia Says:&lt;br /&gt;Helps to relieve itching from dry, flaky scalp, and dandruff&lt;br /&gt;Helps to relieve symptoms of scalp psoriasis and seborrhea dermatitis&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> formulated for dry, itchy scalps, and dandruff&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> We have had a dry scalp after the winter.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for itchy or dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Makes your scalp too dry</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for a family member with dry scalp and a dandruff problem.</li>
            <li> Her scalp is not as dry and dandruff has lessened.</li>
            <li> Even after my hair was dry it remained</li>
            <li> And no worries about having dry hair</li>
            <li> I have tried everything on the market, including Head and Shoulders and Selsun Blue, with no success.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is quite different from what we are used to because it is dark colored and comes out of the bottle looking, well like mud or dirt.</li>
            <li> , I have platinum blonde hair, and this was black shampoo.</li>
            <li> i am simply blown away by this product, and i have half a mind to run around to everyone i know and tell them about</li>
            <li> Both of us tend to get very dry</li>
            <li> wash my hair daily, and currently I am using this, and I do recommend using a conditioner with this, as it by itself can get a little dry feeling after a few uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, in fact there are plenty of others who love the smell.</li>
            <li> I left it on for a least 5 -10 and rinse it off last.</li>
            <li> I definitely will continue to use this shampoo, and will purchase Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Shampoo doesn&#x27;t stain my blonde highlights.</li>
            <li> There really is no need to have Sea Mud, Olive Oil</li>
            <li> I have tried several Adovia dead sea products.</li>
            <li> only a few inches.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive but worth the money</li>
            <li> but I spent the money hoping it would work as the reviews said it would</li>
            <li> and i expected it to do nothing</li>
            <li> In fact, I didn&#x27;t even have to deal with tangles when I combed my wet hair.</li>
            <li> Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo removed all of that with no problem and left my hair squeaky</li>
            <li> Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo removed all of that with no problem and left my hair squeaky</li>
            <li> and I even like it as a regular everyday shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what I expected, but I didn&#x27;t expect to see results</li>
            <li> I am careful not to condition my scalp though too which also reduces the itchy feeling.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is formulated with natural ingredients, and is unlikely to be problematic for people with sensitive skin or allergies.</li>
            <li> The color was a little different than other shampoos I have tried.</li>
            <li> I also only needed a very small amount-the lather is plentiful, so realize this shampoo will last you quite a while-use it</li>
            <li> I have been using adovia Dead Sea mud shampoo on my 9 yr old son for the past year.</li>
            <li> this process is a little bit long</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> think it is well moisturized and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I was slightly concerned that it may have given me the opposite of what I was looking for, but once my hair dried all the way</li>
            <li> You only need a small cucumber slice, my hair is past my back and it felt so creamy and foamy in my hair.</li>
            <li> My scalp no longer itches or produce flakes, shampoo works like any other shampoo</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for the past several times I have washed my hair.</li>
            <li> I said, I don’t suffer from extreme scalp issues</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t worry I told her not to think I was weird first)</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely not your “usual” shampoo and for that, I am truly thankful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I plan to use this as a every other day shampoo.</li>
            <li> Sea formula works to relieve Dermatitis, Psoriasis, and other scalp conditions including dandruff&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally the benefits of Dead Sea mud and salt are presented to you in shampoo form!</li>
            <li> Your scalp can get a little itchy and your hair gets dry.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned, but after a day the breakouts were healing and no new ones happening.</li>
            <li> The thought of Dead Sea mud in my hair, enticed me to do a little research prior to my purchase.</li>
            <li> The black mud is harvested from the banks of the Dead Sea which is actually sediments washed down from the surrounding mountains.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to believe this could work so well, so fast, but it seems to have done so for me at least.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo is not a dandruff shampoo, it does say it will provide relief for a dry or irritated scalp.</li>
            <li> I do not have any scalp or dandruff issues, so I was worried that this shampoo might dry my hair out or make it look stiff or funky.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth</li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t not worth $19 a bottle.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clear dandruff... seems to make it worse.</li>
            <li> It does not foam dark-</li>
            <li> You could actually see a difference in how it laid and how thick it looked.</li>
            <li> So she alternates this and her other shampoo!  </li>
            <li> I have also found it helpful for any unpleasant breakouts on the scalp as it helps blemishes or sores to heal quickly.</li>
            <li> no more dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that this doesn&#x27;t leave heavy residue in my hair like some other shampoos do.</li>
            <li> Forewarning this does look nearly black as sin when you receive this</li>
            <li> A lot less itching.</li>
            <li> I never used black shampoo before.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the Adovia mud products, having tried a few lately.</li>
            <li> , my scalp is less itchy, and my hair looks great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No flakes on my black.  </li>
            <li> That shampoo worked for me for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> WHen I bought this shampoo I could go for like a week and a half to two weeks without washing it.</li>
            <li> and I can wear black shirts without shame</li>
            <li> Normally when someone mentions Dead Sea Mud,I imagine something dry and dirty.</li>

            <li> I am not familiar with the chamomile scent so that may be it</li>
            <li> I was a little bit puzzled.</li>
            <li> bottle of shampoo, it may seem a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Don´t be fooled by the dark color of the Shampoo!</li>
            <li> And a little does along away-</li>
            <li> I color my hair and this did not leave my hair all dried out</li>
            <li> I like that it is made with Dead Sea Mud, Olive Oil &amp; Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and feel of it, and it does not contain any harsh ingredients.</li>

            <li> Today i got the dead sea mud shampoo</li>
            <li> That was not the case with Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Now you might be wondering why anyone would want to wash their hair with dead sea mud to start with.</li>
            <li> Dead sea mud has been used for centuries for it&#x27;s healing properties.</li>
            <li> In fact, people travel from all over the world to experience the effects of the mud at the Dead Sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> but I do wash it everyday.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have used the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I once received a Dead Sea hand and nail care set as a gift</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo to use and review</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud has been known for centuries for it&#x27;s healing properties and people travel from all over the world to come and experience</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s effects at the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud contains the highest concentration of minerals found in mud anywhere in the world.</li>
            <li> have been blessed to get to try a few of the Adovia Mineral Skin Care products</li>
            <li> Adovia Mineral Skin Care Dead Sea Mud Shampoo has been a saving grace in my battle with flare-ups.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud has been known for centuries for it&#x27;s healing properties and people travel from all over the world to come and experience</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s effects at the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud contains the highest concentration of minerals found in mud anywhere in the world.</li>
            <li> color is just as the title describes - mud brown, however, the consistency is like that of any other shampoo - not too thick, not runny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So,I tried out this shampoo and upon first opening it I will say I hated the smell,now this is subjective since not everyone would feel the same way about the smell as I did,but I will say, to me it smelt like cheap,strong perfume.</li>
            <li> weigh my hair down so badly that it looks straight.</li>
            <li> He has itchy scalp and has been fighting it a lot the past few months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the mud or the dead sea minerals but this works for me.  </li>
            <li> using a harsh shampoo really makes my hair look bad</li>
            <li> Once I began to towel dry my hair, this got even worse.</li>
            <li> you know you can never ever get all of the extra color out of your hair and it always leaves your hair icky lifeless and just down right disgusting!</li>
            <li> I have problems with dandruff since I was little, and nothing has helped!</li>
            <li> My husband has a very dry, itchy scalp and uses a terrible shampoo that has a bad smell, well I gave him this to try and the smell is great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had really bad and really stubborn scalp psoriasis for 4 years now.</li>
            <li> I like it but not sure its helping my psorasis</li>
            <li> ...maybe it could work for someone with thicker hair, not sure.</li>
            <li> It is so uncomfortable, and regular shampoo does not help.</li>
            <li> All with one shampoo, of course I will continue to use Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo for long-lasting results!</li>
            <li> I want it bottled to wear everyday!</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve learnt, it&#x27;s this--EMBRACE Dead Sea Mud!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an overly itchy scalp or dandruff, but my hair has been drier than usual because of the post-pregnancy hormones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner for a few days now, and what a difference it&#x27;s made!</li>
            <li> No more flakes and</li>
            <li> After just 2 or 3 washes with the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo, there were no flakes on my darker clothes and the itchy scalp was vanquished!</li>
            <li> we had very few</li>
            <li> I had gotten a sunburn on my scalp from not being careful obviously and used the shampoo this morning ( my scalp was so itchy and painful )</li>
            <li> I don’t have dandruff, but had noticed lately that my scalp has been itchy.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t change the color of my hair in the least.</li>
            <li> I have a delicate scalp it seems.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is that is does have a fragrance in it.</li>
            <li> only disappointment is that it seems like i have to use a lot of it each application.</li>
            <li> I was thinking this shampoo would be thick because of the word, \\&quot;Mud\\</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make it go away, but it isn&#x27;t as thick and itchy by the end of (and throughout) the day.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, and I do use hairspray and mousse to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> So, tonight was my first time using this product, I am totally shocked!</li>
            <li> this shampoo will make your hair feel dirty and oily but dry</li>
            <li> If any residue was going to be left behind it would show up like crazy on my hair.</li>
            <li> A little on the expensive side, though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s official, prior to using this shampoo I would go to a salon and always be recommended a dandruff shampoo of some sort because it was bad.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad just different</li>
            <li> immediately-it&#x27;s not too late!</li>
            <li> I do not get bad cases of dandruff at the moment, just small little flakes,and this took case of that.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers from slight to severe dandruff and scalp irritation issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re not happy with this product let the company know.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thin, but i have a LOT of it.</li>
            <li> which is 10x worse when you stop it.</li>
            <li> Not attractive.</li>
            <li> not happy that it has sulfates in it (hence the 4 stars)</li>
            <li> If you have eczema or psoriasis or just an irritating itch that you can&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
            <li> They have poor customer service.</li>
            <li> I can not recommend this product to anyone because it is falsely advertised.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does look like mud but feels like any other shampoo it doesn&#x27;t smell bad</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the ‘thing’ never happened for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , sorry I had a horse show flashback.</li>
            <li> , sorry I had a horse show flashback.</li>
            <li> I went into it slightly skeptical.</li>
            <li> Twisted Mommy Says:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this hasn&#x27;t helped with my scalp psoriasis at all.</li>
            <li> Got this for husband, and it has made his dandruff worse!</li>
            <li> have very thin, lifeless, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it just doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering fragrance trying to make it smell like something it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I am not too crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong!</li>
            <li> and it is very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> After 1 week you would never know how badly he suffered.</li>
            <li> Like really bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still just as bad as when I started using it</li>
            <li> I got this product to review:[...]</li>
            <li> Disappointed, my scalp still inches.</li>
            <li> Over the weeks, I found that it helps to alleviate the annoying scalp itch that I have been experiencing so often.</li>
            <li> and it can be quite annoying.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has Psoriasis very bad.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> worst shampoo i ever used</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using it either because the smell is awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been waiting a while to write this review to give this shampoo time to do its thing. Unfortunately, the ‘thing’ never happened for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo looks little strange because it’s black although the consistency is the same as normal shampoos I have tried. I am not too crazy about the smell. It has a very strong smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t have a huge problem with dandruff although my scalp can get itchy sometimes. I felt like this was making my scalp itch more after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did help get my hair clean easily and my hair feels a touch softer then it before.  The first few times using it my hair felt weighed down after drying, which is the opposite of what it is supposed to do. To fix this I stopped using conditioner except for the very ends of my hair. This helped a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is $23 for a bottle which is a little pricey for me, especially since I didn’t see many results. The shampoo may work better for people with Psoriasis.</li>
            <li> After a couple of uses, nice studs from it and my hair felt clean but not the greatest smell ever. Overall worth it.</li>
            <li> This dandruff shampoo by Adovia  is great for the entire family. It has a fresh fragrance, leaves the hair clean and smooth.  Gentle on the scalp. After drying my hair saw no signs of dandruff.  I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo. I color my hair and this did not leave my hair all dried out</li>
            <li> Did not work at all. To me the product is very overrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a week now, My hair type is oily and has lot of itchy dandruff. Every shampoo I used in the past with the same pattern first clean all the dandruff in my hair and later the day my hair scalp gets dry which then comes out like dandruff and next day my hair gets oily and cycle goes on!&lt;br /&gt;Now first day when I used this shampoo in my hair, I don&#x27;t know why but it didn&#x27;t make enough bubble and didn&#x27;t see much change in the hair, but as time past now I feel like this is one of the best dandruff shampoo in the market, in my case this shampoo leave necessary oil in hair to not to dry out the scalp and as a result this week I didn&#x27;t see much dandruff in my hair. And when bathing the fragrance it gives make my mind at ease. So for first week impression I&#x27;m impressed and it deserve 5 star from me. I&#x27;ll update after if I see any change in the hair.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo thank you for this product.</li>
            <li> This product really has worked on my scaly, flaky, dry itchy scalp where no other product has worked. Good bye Head and Shoulders!!!! My hair is so soft it even shines I just can&#x27;t believe. I notice that with just a little bit of the shampoo I was able to wash all my long hair. It is dark in color , and smells nice and clean. I will be purchasing this product for my family for Christmas</li>
            <li> One of my newest favorite shampoos out on the market available. Forewarning this does look nearly black as sin when you receive this so make sure you always keep the seal on nice and tight and never leave it sitting sideways. I have already tried their matching conditioner and I was super excited to know that they had a shampoo that went with it. I have loved every Adovia product I have ever received. You only need a small cucumber slice, my hair is past my back and it felt so creamy and foamy in my hair. It no longer felt dry and my scalp was less flaky with continued use, I was happy that it left a nice light scent that reminded me of something that I just cant seem to put my finger down on it. I was sent this at a promotional rate for review purposes after testing the product. This has been tested, and approved by my lovely hair!</li>
            <li> For my daughter, hope it works. She has her scalp gets dry in the summer. Smell good and its looks thick.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth it&#x27;s price. to be honest i don&#x27;t feel a thing or change.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is Ok, but makes my scalp a little itchy and works Ok for dandruff. It just isn&#x27;t not worth $19 a bottle.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shampoo.  I liked the way this shampoo lathers, my scalp feels great after using it and my hair feels clean and bouncy.  The ingredients seem to be of excellent quality.  Better than most I&#x27;ve tried.  I bought this shampoo during a promotion for which I got a discount in exchNge for being willing to write a review and post my opinion of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I would improve is the bottle.  Mine had a slight leak during shipping and the cap top did not work right.  The shampoo however is excellent.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with dandruff for years and that&#x27;s the why I decided to try this shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a couple of weeks and I have noticed a difference in my scalp and hair my scalp isn&#x27;t as itchy and dry as it used to be and my hair looks hydrated, healthier and feels soft. This shampoo does look like mud but feels like any other shampoo it doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it&#x27;s very easy to use. I wash my hair 3-4 times a week I apply this shampoo as directed all you need is a quarter size amount maybe a little bit more than that if you have long thick hair, you apply it to the scalp and massage gently 2-3 minutes. Rinse, apply shampoo again and leave it for 5 minutes then you rinse thoroughly this process is a little bit long but it&#x27;s definitely worth it. This shampoo is great for dry and damaged thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> My husband has been very happy with this shampoo. His dandruff is under control and he really likes the light scent of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Adovia is now my go to favorite brand. I have eczema and also dandruff, I have been looking for something that would not only help my dandruff but keep my skin from getting irritated. I received this during one of their promotional discount and now I am stocking up on this shampoo. The shampoo is black and was kind of intimidating but it really works. My scalp no longer itches or produce flakes, shampoo works like any other shampoo only difference is, it is helping my scalp and my skin. After using this I noticed my skin clearing up on my back and neck. I have been using other products from Adovia and love everyone of them.</li>
            <li> I have been using adovia Dead Sea mud shampoo on my 9 yr old son for the past year. It is by far the best shampoo yet for his psoriasis. Before adovia his head was one big sheet of psoriasis. After 1 week you would never know how badly he suffered. I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I like it but not sure its helping my psorasis</li>
            <li> Very nice, helped a lot but didn&#x27;t cure my scalp.</li>
            <li> Normally when someone mentions Dead Sea Mud,I imagine something dry and dirty. But on this shampoo is very good how it works. From the first wash if you follow the instructions is going to be great if you -like me- suffer for some problems in your scalp.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for the past several times I have washed my hair. The smell is light and not medicinal smelling. It has stopped the continual flaking that I normally have and my head is not as itchy. It does all it says it will do so I am quite pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. I don&#x27;t have dandruff super bad, but it seems like I have it more in the winter than the summer. I used this shampoo and my dandruff that I had went away. At times my scalp would itch and that feeling went away after using this shampoo. My hair felt so nice and smooth. I really like the smell of this shampoo also. I like that it is made with Dead Sea Mud, Olive Oil &amp; Shea Butter. Also that it is 100% money back guarantee so if you&#x27;re not happy with this product let the company know. I recommend this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this product for a great deal to try and give my honest opinion</li>
            <li> I have seasonal allergies and when things are in bloom, I find my scalp gets very itchy. This shampoo has really helped decrease the itchy feeling and reduce scratching after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: the image of the bottle shows a grey cap that matches the bottle; mine came with a clear cap that doesn&#x27;t appear to go with the bottle and made me wonder if it was repackaged. I have seen another comment indicating the same.</li>
            <li> So,I tried out this shampoo and upon first opening it I will say I hated the smell,now this is subjective since not everyone would feel the same way about the smell as I did,but I will say, to me it smelt like cheap,strong perfume.If you decide to buy this product you can judge for yourself.I will say on the plus side though that this shampoo works really well.It lathers up nicely in the shower and after several uses I noticed little to no dandruff.I recommend this to anyone struggling with dandruff.It does help to moisturize your scalp,leaving it healthier.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for purpose of review,all views and claims are 100 percent my own.</li>
            <li> Get lots of lather with this good smelling dandruff shampoo. Smells like perfume.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this shampoo at all, if you have hair that it&#x27;s dry but you have oily skin this shampoo will make your hair feel dirty and oily but dry (how&#x27;s that even possible?!)...maybe it could work for someone with thicker hair, not sure.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several Adovia Natural products and I LOVE Them all! It works good!</li>
            <li> I bought about ten different shampoos from Amazon, and I liked this best.  I like the smell and feel of it, and it does not contain any harsh ingredients. A little on the expensive side, though.</li>
            <li> Loving what this did for my hair. I used this in combination with the deep conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I stated in my review of the conditioner these products are great and left my hair feeling soft and healthy. The one thing I didn&#x27;t care for was the strong scent both have. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, in fact there are plenty of others who love the smell. I just personally think the scent is a bit strong for my preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is definitely thicker than the conditioner so I didn&#x27;t have to use as much in my hair. It&#x27;s a good product but I would only purchase again if I feel like splurging on products to pamper myself with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this originally for my husband to use for his itchy scalp. However, I was running low on my favorite shampoo and decided to sneak out a little bit of this to hold me over till I replenished my own. I do not have any scalp or dandruff issues, so I was worried that this shampoo might dry my hair out or make it look stiff or funky. I have  longish, curly hair that can be a pain to manage and I really worried that I&#x27;d look like a hag after using this type of product. All I can say is...&#x27;wow&#x27;! I didn&#x27;t feel any kind of stiff residue after washing it out, but the real &#x27;wow&#x27; came after I had squeezed out the excess water and wrapped my wet hair in a towel for a few minutes, as I always do. When I took the towel off, my hair fell into soft curls right off the bat. I let it dry, and my hair looked terrific when it dries...all soft curls, fewer flyaways and frizz. I normally wash my hair every day or every other day, but I was able to go three days with the same soft curls. Thinking that maybe I had just had a run of good hair days. I tried a different shampoo, and my hair was more difficult to style and maintain after that shampoo. So I tried the Adovia again, and &#x27;wow&#x27;...again. Nice soft, tumbling curls, with no intervention on my part. I think this will be my new favorite shampoo!</li>
            <li> I Just started using this product. I love how it leaves my hair soft and silky. I have dyed hair so I need a shampoo who leaves my hair feeling hydrated and healthy. This Shampoo does it!&lt;br /&gt;I will order their conditioner to try it as well!</li>
            <li> Dandruff Shampoo by Adovia. My son loves it! - Dead Sea Mud Moisturizing Shampoo has stopped the dandruff and softened scalp. Thank-you!</li>
            <li> still got dandruff. switched to tea tree jason shampoo and conditioner. now dandruff free</li>
            <li> My husband is in love. He has itchy scalp and has been fighting it a lot the past few months. He said his scalp felt better as soon as he put it on his scalp, let alone after actually lathering it up! Very happy! Best results of anything he has used in months.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this shampoo for just over a week.  He reports his scalp feels better, less itchy, and his hair definitely looks better.  This shampoo has a nice light fragrance and should be used sparingly, a little goes a long way.  He had been using another popular dandruff shampoo for years, but prefers this one.</li>
            <li> Consider it a mud mask for your scalp and hair. Smells pretty good for a mud and salt based product. I use it when it is time to deep clean my scalp and strip away build up on my hair so it lasts for quite a long time. I have also found it helpful for any unpleasant breakouts on the scalp as it helps blemishes or sores to heal quickly.Effective on dandruff and eczema related conditions.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have chronic dandruff so I can&#x27;t speak to that, but this is great to keep on hand for change of seasons or the occasional dry scalp.  It has been great for that, has a nice light scent, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or chemically.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo, has helped my problem scalp!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is wonderful.  My husband has a very dry, itchy scalp and uses a terrible shampoo that has a bad smell, well I gave him this to try and the smell is great and he said it has really helped with his dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Works well, I was just not fond of the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have used the shampoo twice now. I have only left 4 stars, because for me, its just a shampoo. I havent found anything super spectacular about it, yet, I have nothing to complain about either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is just as the title describes - mud brown, however, the consistency is like that of any other shampoo - not too thick, not runny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell is pleasant, lathers nicely (even in my ultra hard water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp isn&#x27;t overly dry, so perhaps Im not seeing some of the benefits others do, however, my 4 year old son still has some cradle cap, so I am going to try this on him and see if it makes a differemce - if so, I will report back!</li>
            <li> Smell is pleasant, I like that it&#x27;s all natural.  Leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband since he has dry skin and scalp. It&#x27;s helped quite a bit. Not perfect but a good start. Looks like mud though hah.</li>
            <li> Bought this dandruff shampoo for my husband.  He likes it and it does seem to be helping with his dandruff and dry scalp although he&#x27;s only been using it for a couple weeks, still he saw a difference and good results.</li>
            <li> The shampoo not only cleans it leaves your hair feeling so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Received this product, was spilled out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s official, prior to using this shampoo I would go to a salon and always be recommended a dandruff shampoo of some sort because it was bad. Like really bad. Small flakes, large flakes, medium flakes you name it, I had it. Then I bought this shampoo, but noticed the way it made my hair feel after showering it was squeaky clean, but also moisturized. I did not use conditioners when using this shampoo because I didn&#x27;t want to put any buildup. I went to a hair appointment today and when I mentioned I have major issues with dandruff she said she hadn&#x27;t noticed any at all. She said it&#x27;s something she would notice right away, but didn&#x27;t find any traces of it. I&#x27;m officially using this shampoo for life!</li>
            <li> This is a great soothing shampoo for irritated scalp. I use the Adovia hydrating matching conditioner, and it seems to really add to the effectiveness of this treatment. I recommend both.</li>
            <li> seems good bought for psoriasis but don&#x27;t notice improvement from shampoo but love the smell</li>
            <li> Scalp is feeling much better.  A lot less itching.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with dry itchy scalp for a while so i decided to try this shampoo. After a few days of use, i&#x27;ve already noticed that my scalp is less itchy. This is a great shampoo!</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo on the advice of a friend. I don’t have dandruff, but had noticed lately that my scalp has been itchy.  The thought of Dead Sea mud in my hair, enticed me to do a little research prior to my purchase. I learned that the mud, minerals, Olive oil and Shea Butter can helps relieve appearance of scalp psoriasis by moisturizing and hydrating. The black mud is harvested from the banks of the Dead Sea which is actually sediments washed down from the surrounding mountains. Scientists have yet to determine why this mud has such great results but it has been used in many applications from dryness, muscle relaxation, blood circulation and even treatment for some cancers. This particular product is 100% cruelty free and never tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair at least once per day, sometimes more depending on my activities. I have very oily hair and could not go a day without shampooing. This product is a dark color, with was not the most pleasing to think about putting in my hair, but I did. It lathered up well and had a strong scent. I am not familiar with the chamomile scent so that may be it but it reminded me of “old man” cologne. Not my favorite initially, but after the results of no more itchiness, I have become accustomed to it and it no longer is as pungent as I once thought it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I don’t suffer from extreme scalp issues but I would recommend this product to someone who does, as I feel it would be beneficial to them. I was grateful for the opportunity to be able to share my opinion on this product for a reduction in price, for the purpose of testing. The company offers a risk free purchase and money back guarantee for one year; it can’t hurt to try it out!</li>
            <li> Mud shampoo?  Yeah I said it.  This stuff was fun to use.  I never used black shampoo before.  But I had fun using it and felt like I was a the spa.  Dead Sea Mud Shampoo works great.</li>
            <li> What comes to your mind when you hear the word mud? Now what comes to your mind when you hear Dead Sea Mud Shampoo? Hopefully good things come to mind. I was given a chance to try Adovia Mineral  Skin Care Dead Sea Mud Shampoo, at first I was a bit skeptic to wash my hair with mud. When I received the product I knew I just had to smell it to see what kind of scent it had. I was a bit surprised that it didn&#x27;t smell like mud at all, it has a very wonderful scent. The shampoo works great for those who suffer from dry and irritated scalp. This product works wonders on my dry scalp. The lather carries away dirt and flakes and leaves you with a fresh squeaky clean scalp. The smell is glorious, during your hair wash you don&#x27;t realize you are washing your hair with mud. It smells and feels like you are enjoying a relaxing massage while smelling a scent that helps to free your mind.  After your wash your hair is left feeling soft and your scalp refreshed. The Aloe Vera keeps your strands from drying out and retains your scalps natural moisture thus preventing dry scalp. I recommend that you try to wash with the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo at least twice a week in order to see accurate results. Anyone looking for an alternative I recommend you try Deep Sea Mud Shampoo you will begin to notice a difference after just one wash.  I received Adovia Mineral Skin Care Dead Sea Mud Shampoo for free via Tomoson and the opinions expressed in this post are my own.</li>
            <li> When I got the chance to try this one out I was in heaven.  I do get a lot of build up on my scalp from everything I try out and use on a daily basis. I was excited when I used this one it helped with the buildup in just one use.  It lathered up very nice and left my hair feeling soft and smooth after use.  I truly loved this shampoo it had a light flower scent nothing too over powering and it really cleaned my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I was thinking this shampoo would be thick because of the word, \\&quot;Mud\\&quot; in it. It&#x27;s not at all. It did clean my hair well. I liked it. If you are sensitive to sulphates, it is in the ingredients. I still liked the shampoo. I got this product to review:[...]</li>
            <li> Love it. Very light fragrance. Works better with a conditioner, leaves your hair softer.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST shampoo for anyone with itchy scalps, or who have scaly scalps.  I have tried so many other &amp;#34;tar&amp;#34; shampoos, but this one is wonderful.  A small amount creates a rich lather, and my scalp is calm!</li>
            <li> worst shampoo i ever used</li>
            <li> I bought this to try for myself, primarily because I deal with itchy scalp, etc.  I got great results... pretty much after the first or second wash, my itchiness was gone. It&#x27;s really hard to believe this could work so well, so fast, but it seems to have done so for me at least. My wife is really picky with her shampoos. She&#x27;s always struggled to find something that worked well for her. So I told her about the shampoo, and she gave it a try. Big mistake... she&#x27;s getting such great results that I don&#x27;t have the heart to take it back from her. I guess I&#x27;ll just have to order myself another bottle. The downside is neither one of us like the scent... a lavender type of smell. It&#x27;s not scented enough that you smell it after you dry your hair... it&#x27;s just while you are applying it and rinsing it off. If you like lavender scents, you should love this. If you&#x27;re like us, then you just put up with that scent because it works otherwise. Wish they had different scent options.</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo once.  I washed my scalp multiple times.  Two days later, my hair was itching and scalp flaking.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I applied to review Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo because I&#x27;m always interested in trying new products and it&#x27;s so hard for me to find a good shampoo. I have fine/thick hair; (yeah I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s an oxymoron, but that&#x27;s what the hair dressers say about it), I&#x27;m prone to copious amounts of fly-aways, my hair LOVES to become static-y, and I HAVE to wash it daily (some people are lucky enough to skip a day) because in less then 24 hours my hair looks greasy. To alleviate any or all of my hair issues, I&#x27;m always on the look out for a miracle, so of course I was willing to try the Adovia brand when it came up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened up the package containing my new shampoo, I was a bit scared. The shampoo looked like liquid charcoal and I had to brace myself when I took a whiff, thinking I was going to be smelling remnants of the Bubonic Plague, but I was so happy to find looks are deceiving with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that when using the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo, it lathers up well and has a very pleasant light scent. I knew the scent was floral, but couldn&#x27;t place it, so I asked a co-worker to smell my hair (don&#x27;t worry I told her not to think I was weird first) and she said it smelled like apple blossoms, and me being my awesome self had to clarify that apple blossom was indeed floral (I had to double check because it had a fruit and flower name in it, I have special moments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, all day I went around getting slight scents of apple blossom, which is great because I think I forgot deodorant that day, but it wasn&#x27;t so heavy that I was gagging or offending anyone&#x27;s noses with my shampoo (or B.O.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I used it, I noticed that my hair looked shinier and felt softer. After using it for a week the results remained the same, but alas, this is not the perfect shampoo for me, even though I wish it were. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t like my fine hair, within a few hours my hair becomes static, not overly so, but still enough to curse at my hair (I&#x27;ve honestly only found 1 type of shampoo that hasn&#x27;t made my hair static).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo?:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, just because it doesn&#x27;t work perfectly for me, doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t for someone else. I really did enjoy using this shampoo, the scent was pleasant, I don&#x27;t believe my scalp was as itchy, and I had a softer, shinier mane...er hair, sorry I had a horse show flashback. It&#x27;s definitely one of the nicer shampoos I&#x27;ve used.my hair (I&#x27;ve honestly only found 1 type of shampoo that hasn&#x27;t made my hair static).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo?:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, just because it doesn&#x27;t work perfectly for me, doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t for someone else.

            <li> I was given this product to review and when I saw it I knew I had to try it on my husband. My husband has issues with dry scalp but this shampoo worked so great for him. I almost didn&#x27;t know what to expect but I wanted to see if it lived up to the claims because if so it would really come in handy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lathered really well! After I washed his hair he said immediately his head felt cleaner than when he uses his normal shampoo. His hair was softer and looked more healthy after washing it with the shampoo and he loved the results. I though it was pretty funny how excited he was about using the shampoo after he felt the results. He loved it so I loved it! This is an amazing shampoo and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had psoriasis for most of my life, nothing other than sunlight has helped it before and nothing helped my scalp.  This does, it actually works! It&#x27;s so good I&#x27;ve gotten a second bottle at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the mud or the dead sea minerals but this works for me.  I use regular conditioner afterwards so that&#x27;s what smell sticks to my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad just different and it&#x27;s a bit strange at first to be using mud to clean with, but who am I to argue with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may not work for everyone, nothing seems to but it&#x27;s worth a shot especially if you&#x27;ve tried other things.  There is a full review available on my website if you&#x27;d like to learn more head on over.</li>
            <li> After my fourth pregnancy I suffered from dry scalp. I still do! I don’t experience flakiness, but once in a while I experience itchiness. It is so uncomfortable, and regular shampoo does not help. I’m not the only one in my family who has experienced dry scalp, my nine-year old son does too! The only difference is he has flakiness issues. We gave Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo a try. The results were great! I first tried Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo on my son, one shampoo relieved his itchy scalp, and we notice less flakes! I also noticed his hair looked healthier, more shiny, and less frizzy since he does get the frizzy part from me:) He is very happy with his results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo, I noticed how lathering the shampoo is, and the light fresh scent. My hair immediately felt moisturized, and soft! I’m not experiencing itchiness on my scalp! All with one shampoo, of course I will continue to use Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo for long-lasting results! I’m really impressed with this shampoo! Another thing I love it’s made in Israel, so you’re getting the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m really happy with my results, and I’m glad I got the chance to try Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo! I recommend Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo if you suffer from dry scalp, itchiness due to dry scalp, or if you’re like my son who experienced flakiness. I definitely will continue to use this shampoo, and will purchase Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo for reviewing purposes. However all the opinions expressed are my own based on my experience.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would help me with my flat hair issue. I also love to dye my hair and that results in damaged and dry locks, so I had multiple issues to address. When I first applied this, It almost felt dry and tangled while washing, which was the opposite of what I expected. Once I began to towel dry my hair, this got even worse. My hair seemed full of knots and tangles and felt almost straw-like to the touch. I was slightly concerned that it may have given me the opposite of what I was looking for, but once my hair dried all the way and I was able to brush it, I was amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt softer and full of body. You could actually see a difference in how it laid and how thick it looked. The biggest change I noticed was the shine. My hair felt silky and it even had some sight curl to it, which I had never seen it do before. I noticed the change easily indoors, but once I stepped out in the sun, the change was stunning. The shine coming off of my head was amazing and it felt so much more healthy and alive to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product several more times since the initial use and each time it feels strange during, and right after use, but wonderful once it is clean and dry. I am assuming this has to do with the nutrients in the shampoo seeping into my hair. Whatever the cause, I love how this improved the look and feel of my hair and I will be using this shampoo every time I wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I was provided with a bottle of this for review purposes. Receiving a sample has in no way influenced my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was given a Free Trial of this product, and I am so happy that I was! After just one week of use, I notice my dandruff went away and my hair always feels really clean after every use. I highly recommend this Dead Sea Mud Shampoo to anyone who wants healthy hair with natural ingredients!!!</li>
            <li> after seeing good reviews I brought this item. The smell is really good but it doesn&#x27;t meet the expectations in my first attempt. After using couple of weeks still facing with dandruff. The cost is also high compare to remaining products. I wont recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Quite above the standard ...</li>
            <li> It seems to help my psoriasis better than the other stuff I have used.  It also doesn&#x27;t ruin my hair.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Good clean scalp without too much lather. I could tell the difference within a couple of uses as my scalp was nice and dry without being overly dry. Also this has a nice smell to it opposed to the chemical feel and smell of the traditional anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Works great! I intend to buy another after this bottle is gone!</li>
            <li> First, the scent. I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on the perfume that it reminds me of, but it smells so good!! I want it bottled to wear everyday! Dead Sea Mud Shampoo is not just a pretty scent, but the shampoo is fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo doesn&#x27;t feel grainy or like mud, it is however brown until you start massaging it into your hair and scalp then turns white. I definitely get plenty of rich soft suds. My hair has TONS of BODY and SHINE since I&#x27;ve started using Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I have very thin, lifeless, color treated hair. Dead Sea Mud Shampoo doesn&#x27;t stain my blonde highlights. It doesn&#x27;t change the color of my hair in the least. My hair is soft! FULL and my scalp is totally and completely itch and flake free. My hair feels awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry scalp like I do, this is one great shampoo to try!! The shampoo contains Chamomile, and Olive Oil, which keeps your hair from drying out, as it keeps natural moisture in scalp. I felt a difference from the first shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> I have a delicate scalp it seems. A lot of shampoos I use make my head break out in itchy bumps and it is very uncomfortable. Sometimes my neck and ears will even break out. This shampoo was used after I had a break out in progress. I was a little concerned, but after a day the breakouts were healing and no new ones happening. I have used this for over a week and my hair is super soft, and smells incredible.&lt;br /&gt;No breakouts on my neck or ears! I am a big fan of the Adovia mud products, having tried a few lately. I would definitely suggest these!&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a free bottle of this shampoo from the company to try. Even though it was free, this did not bias my opinion.</li>
            <li> After trying many other shampoos for dandruff, I am truly amazed how fast it cleared it. I am sensitive to many products. I&#x27;ve tried other dandruff shampoos, and they just dried my scalp &amp; hair more! This shampoo not only leaves my scalp flake &amp; itch free, but it leaves my hair smelling good, soft, and moisturized! I love it :)</li>
            <li> So when I first heard about this Dead Sea Mud Shampoo I was a little bit puzzled. How was mud going to clean my hair? Seems a bit contradictory if you ask me! But boy oh boy does this shampoo work amazingly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color of the shampoo had me worried at first, I have platinum blonde hair, and this was black shampoo. If any residue was going to be left behind it would show up like crazy on my hair. I was so surprised with the results. First the whole shampooing part felt amazing. Very light shampoo that really deep cleans my hair and scalp, but left it feeling soft. After washing, my hair wasn&#x27;t stained black, it was perfectly fine! No residue or color staining at all! After my hair dried, it had a lot of extra bounce and volume, which is nice considering I have baby fine flat blah hair. My scalp felt so clean, and almost tingly feeling. My hair also had a nice fresh chamomile scent that I would get hints of throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair daily, and currently I am using this, and I do recommend using a conditioner with this, as it by itself can get a little dry feeling after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly like this product and give it 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> I loved the way the shampoo lathers up. It does a great job and I don’t have any complaints about it. It does work great and my hair felt nice and clean after using it along with another conditioner that I own. The Dead Sea Mud Shampoo from Adovia is one I would use again. You can check out rest of my review at According2Mandy.com</li>
            <li> I admit I wasn&#x27;t so sure about this shampoo but am quite happy with the results. I had gotten a sunburn on my scalp from not being careful obviously and used the shampoo this morning ( my scalp was so itchy and painful ) Once you get past the black color and the name of it you are good, trust me. It lathers great, has a floral smell and rinses out nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly it cleaned my hair without drying it, made it feel soft look healthy and shiny. My scalp is not itchy at all and feels soothed. Also I would like to add they do not test on animals ( I know it&#x27; mentioned in the product description but I feel strongly enough about it to mention it as well )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This shampoo left my hair flake-free, smelling amazing as well as full and stronger than ever. I cannot get enough of this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely not your “usual” shampoo and for that, I am truly thankful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dead Sea Mud Shampoo from Adovia leaves your hair feeling clean. You feel like your hair is stripped down just enough to get all of the excess oils out of it, and leave your hair feeling healthy. My daughter is 13 and her face and hair have a lot of extra oils, currently. She is using this shampoo twice a week and it is definitely helping to keep the oiliness under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers up incredibly and easily and is great for the whole family. Yes, the shampoo itself is brown from the mud that’s added to it, but it has the feel of a silken mousse. I for one, feel that the floral scent that’s added is not necessary, but most people will enjoy the bouquet smell as well. The shampoo is easy to rinse out and the bottle lasts a long time because so little is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter and I have both been using it and enjoying the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo and would highly recommend it. I would not suggest it for daily use as it could strip too much from your hair, but everyone is different. After using it, you would get a feel for how often to use this in your beauty regiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I reviewed Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo recently and have nothing but positive things to say about this product. First off, I have problems with dandruff and an itchy, flaky scalp most of the year. I have tried everything on the market, including Head and Shoulders and Selsun Blue, with no success. I feel dirty and gross when I have dandruff because I am a very clean person with good hygiene habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try Adovia’s shampoo to hopefully find some relief for my scalp issues and be free from embarrassment. Adovia’s shampoo contains dead sea mud, chamomile, and olive oil to provide intense hydration to the scalp and it contains many enriching minerals as well. As I have tried many different brands in the past, I’ll admit I was expecting this shampoo to fail as well. I used the shampoo in the shower and from the minute it touched my scalp, I felt an instant soothing sensation and was deeply refreshed, but I figured that did not mean the product was working. Boy, was I wrong! After one use of this fantastic product in the evening, I noticed my scalp was less irritated and the amount of flakes I experienced throughout the next day were dramatically reduced. After just one week of using this shampoo, I kid you not, my dandruff was a thing of the past!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have suffered for years with this embarrassing condition and had no idea all this time, that a cure was not far away at all. I could not be more pleased with my results and this brand. I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers from slight to severe dandruff and scalp irritation issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works very quickly, and although $23 may sound like a lot to pay for one bottle of shampoo, if you are like me, you would be willing to pay over $100 to get rid of these problems! People travel all the way to the actual Dead Sea in the Middle East to reap these benefits but you can get them delivered in a bottle and satisfaction is guaranteed! &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has Psoriasis very bad.  While this doesn&#x27;t help with the large flakes and sores like some other shampoos, she has found that this leaves her hair feeling wonderful and the smell is nice.  So she alternates this and her other shampoo!  It has become a part of her daily regimen!</li>
            <li> I got this at a great discount and I am liking it so far. I like that it gives a good amount of suds and does not irritate my scalp or cause more dandruff. I leave it in for a few minutes and that makes all the difference.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t just nourish my hair, but also my scalp leaving my hair clean, soft, and touchable and my scalp flake free and nourished. I highly recommend this to anyone! It&#x27;s great if you are looking to naturally give your hair and scalp a pick me up-especially if you style or dye your hair regularly.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clear dandruff... seems to make it worse. Time to try another... yay.. not.... Hopefully something in the near future works.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo! It makes my hair soft and silky, and my hair looks healthy. The (mostly) healthy ingredient list is a HUGE plus - Dead Sea Mud, Olive Oil, Vitamin E and Aloe Vera. My only disappointment is that is does have a fragrance in it. There really is no need to have Sea Mud, Olive Oil, Vitamin E mixed with a perfume.  I&#x27;m usually sensitive to smells from fragrance, but thankfully the scent is light and hardly noticeable. The fragrance aside, I like the shampoo and would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I noticed positive changes after only the first few uses. My scalp is no longer dry and my hair is softer and even seems stronger :)</li>
            <li> I have tried several Adovia dead sea products. Their quality is amazing and this product is no different. I like that this doesn&#x27;t leave heavy residue in my hair like some other shampoos do. It adds moisture to my dry hair with daily use. The color of the products is different, but don&#x27;t let them scare you. This is a wonderful product I will buy again!</li>
            <li> Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo strikes a great balance for my hair: clean, yet moisturized. My scalp feels clean, yet not dry and stripped. There’s not any itchy feeling. My hair is soft and manageable, with no fizziness. It rinses clean without any residue. My husband normally uses tea tree oil shampoo for dandruff. He’s constantly searching for products to relieve his itchy, irritated scalp. He’s been impressed by Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo. I must mention that this does not seem compatible with color-treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $23 for a 7.4 oz. bottle of shampoo, it may seem a little pricey. However, a bottle is lasting my husband and me awhile. It lathers nicely, and you don’t need to use a lot each time.&lt;br /&gt;This review is my honest opinion, provided in response to receiving a free bottle of product for review purposes.</li>
            <li> This stuff not only  increased my itchy scalp, it dulled my hair dramatically.  I hope they will make good on their 100% unconditional guarantee.  I want my money back.</li>
            <li> This product was actually very interesting. I was really excited to have tried this product for the first time. The color was a little different than other shampoos I have tried. The smell was wonderful I loved the smell it had and how it left my hair smelling wonderful I give it a 10 right there. I have natural curly hair so I have a full set of hair I had to use a little more than a quarter size amount. I rubbed it in and massaged it in my hair and it felt good. It didn&#x27;t make my hair feel totally silky smooth but I liked how it says relieves dandruff.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea mud.  Yup you have heard of it I am sure.  It&#x27;s supposed to be really great stuff.  I have heard of it for skin, but never thought of using as a shampoo.  So I was excited.  I will say I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to always use conditioner in my hair.  When I got this in was perfect timing.  I was just about out of shampoo, so it was perfect to test this one out.  I did notice the first time that my hair seemed softer.  I did not use any conditioner at all.  I wanted to test out just the shampoo.  I did use for 3 weeks straight.  just this shampoo, no conditioner at all.  After the 3 weeks, it seems I don&#x27;t really need to use the conditioner as much.  I am excited to try out the dead sea mud conditioner and see what I am in for with my hair with that . i am expecting some great results.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I have noticed after I hit the age of 40 is that my skin really seems to have changed. I find that my skin texture is drier and that includes my scalp. Whereas before I would have characterized my hair as “normal”, I now find my hair is dry and brittle, and my scalp is very irritable. This is something that I only noticed recently, that my scalp is really itchy at times, although there is no obvious cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with that in mind, I was happy to be able to review Adovia Mineral Mud Shampoo. After reading the list of ingredients, I was very intrigued, and just a bit curious. I have used products that contained mineral ingredients (like a mud based facial mask), but never have I tried such a product on my hair. For that matter, I have never seen a product that had these types of ingredients in a shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The majority of ingredients listed on the bottle are natural in origin, I was pleased to see. In addition to dead sea mud, Adovia Mineral Mud Shampoo contains chamomile, olive oil, aloe vera, grapeseed oil, shea butter oil and carrot seed oil. Although the color of the shampoo makes you think that it has the consistency and texture of mud, it is very much the same type of texture and viscosity as any other shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked using this shampoo. Over the weeks, I found that it helps to alleviate the annoying scalp itch that I have been experiencing so often. My hair feels softer and manageable, and there was no discernible fragrance that could cause chemical sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This type of shampoo is ideal for people with scalp dermatitis, psoriasis and overall dryness. It is also a great choice for people who have trouble with scalp dandruff. This shampoo is formulated with natural ingredients, and is unlikely to be problematic for people with sensitive skin or allergies.</li>
            <li> I was given a bottle of shampoo to review and I tried to approach it with an open mind. I will admit, that I had a mixture of skepticism and intrigue. After all, I have never washed my hair in mud! Well, believe it or not the mud did a great job of cleaning my hair! It has a nice, pleasant scent and I was happy to have my hair smelling like it after wash. It did a great job of not only cleaning, but also making my hair feel and look great. It was also quite soothing to my scalp which has a tendency to become dry. It is definitely on the pricier side so I was glad that a little bit of the shampoo did the trick.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> *I received this to review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a few weeks now.  I like how it feels like it washes clean, my scalp is less itchy, and my hair looks great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is well moisturized and a little goes a long way.  I do not get bad cases of dandruff at the moment, just small little flakes,and this took case of that. No flakes on my black.  It did work for my issues.  :)</li>
            <li> I have scalp psoriasis and this helps but I still have my issues.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect! It seems to clarify the hair without stripping it of its much needed natural oils like most clarifying shampoos have been known to do! I have used it with and with out a conditioner and either way this product makes your hair smooth and healthy looking. If you would like my full in-depth review you can find it here![...]&lt;br /&gt; But all in all I say if you are thinking about it, buy it you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve reviewed two of Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud products and both times I went into it slightly skeptical. If there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve learnt, it&#x27;s this--EMBRACE Dead Sea Mud! Next time, I won&#x27;t hesitate to smear it anywhere on my body!&lt;br /&gt;I looked at this in the bottle and thought...wow, it has MUD in it. Will it feel muddy in texture? Will it smell dank, like dirt or mud? Will it leave my hair feeling somehow not quite so clean? The answer to all these questions, as I presently found out, is a resounding NO. The shampoo does indeed contain mud and looks as it does in the photo below but it smells clean and slightly floral; it left my scalp and hair feeling clean, soft to the touch and refreshed; and, surprisingly, I even noticed a little less fallout of hair in the shower. Although, I would still like to use my Head &amp; Shoulders to supplement this shampoo, since after a couple of days, I did notice the itchiness in my scalp returning, overall, I&#x27;m a big fan of this product! Love it and will continue to use it regularly!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like reviews that say - this product cured me in a day - Well, this product really has worked on my psoriasis scaly, flaky, dry itchy scalp where no other product has worked. It actually did make a difference within a shampoo or two. I have been shampooing with this product everyday since purchasing it a few weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light nice scent to it (and I don&#x27;t like scents) A little goes a long way and it foams up nicely for a nice cleaning. I also use this with the Scalp Shampoo Massage Brush (light blue) made in the USA (see my other review of that product) I truly believe that the shampoo and the brush have made all the difference in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have psoriasis on my scalp in places but it is truly 90% better than it has been since using these two products.</li>
            <li> so the first time i used this, i honestly wasn&#x27;t impressed. maybe i didn&#x27;t use enough, or what, i don&#x27;t know. but the second time i used it, WOW!!!!&lt;br /&gt;now, i naturally have soft hair. it&#x27;s thin, but i have a LOT of it. i used to wear it so long i could sit on it. now it&#x27;s in a very short bob. only a few inches. i have a bunch of toddlers, i simply don&#x27;t have time to wait six hours for hair to dry to get anything done. so i haven&#x27;t really run my fingers through my hair to enough its touch in a few years.&lt;br /&gt;now i can&#x27;t keep my fingers out of my hair. it&#x27;s softer than it&#x27;s ever been. it&#x27;s rich and luscious. i think my husband&#x27;s wish of me growing out my hair is now going to be a reality. i simply cannot wait to have mounds and mounds of it again. i don&#x27;t know what this stuff did, but i am now a believer!!!!&lt;br /&gt;my only disappointment is that it seems like i have to use a lot of it each application. maybe i&#x27;ll be able to adjust the amount in future washings. i am simply blown away by this product, and i have half a mind to run around to everyone i know and tell them about it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;i received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Switched to this shampoo after using another dandruff shampoo that was all natural and organic. That shampoo worked for me for about a week and a half. Now I started using this one. It&#x27;s been a week and I&#x27;ve notice a difference so I&#x27;m hoping it continues to work. I plan to use this as a every other day shampoo.</li>
            <li> If I could give this 500 stars I would! Thank you!!! Thank you so much for making this shampoo. I&#x27;ve had really bad and really stubborn scalp psoriasis for 4 years now. The only thing that worked really was a steroid topical that is just way too harsh and in the long run you end up with steroid rebound which is 10x worse when you stop it. I have searched far and wide for shampoos or creams that will help my extremely flaky, red, dry scalp. This stuff is the ONLY thing that has done all of this and more! I only bought the shampoo, but will be buying the shampoo + conditioner on a regular basis as you definitely need a conditioner with the shampoo. I cannot thank you enough for this stuff!!!!!</li>
            <li> I found that to make the most out of this shampoo I had to really massage it into my scalp and use a conditioner. Noticeable improvement in the dry scalp. Very pleased .  Update: They ran out of this shampoo and my dandruff returned. I got the new bottle and noticed the formula is less thick, which is a good thing since it was a bit thick before. This way it lasts longer and is easier to wash with. Dry and itchy scalp have improved again. I am now using both the Adovia Shampoo and Adovia Deep Conditioner. Both are excellent products.</li>
            <li> I am always up for trying a different item, especially shampoo! I used to have quite the collection of shampoos (changing between the brands every week or so), until we bought our house and completely ran out of room to store everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I had the opportunity to try the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo, I jumped on the chance. I don&#x27;t have an overly itchy scalp or dandruff, but my hair has been drier than usual because of the post-pregnancy hormones. I figured it would be a good test to see how my hair reacts to this more natural shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just my first time trying it, I immediately noticed that my hair was softer than before. It still had a bit of frizz when I dried and straightened it, but it was noticeably better. After a week of using it, I have tried having my hair both straight and curly (naturally), and I really do think that it has helped to manage the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dead sea mud shampoo itself has a interesting smell (almost metallic), which matches the look of it (a gun metal color). The ingredients don&#x27;t look 100% natural, but I don&#x27;t know of many shampoos that are totally natural. It lathers just fine, and I don&#x27;t feel like I have to use a lot to get my hair totally clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a $24 price tag (and free shipping) on Amazon, it&#x27;s not the cheapest or most expensive shampoo out there (for 7.4 fl oz), but I am convinced that it is a good one. Of course, I can&#x27;t speak to the flaky scalp or dryness, but I know what it has done with my hair in just a week. I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> Great for highly stress people. Your scalp can get a little itchy and your hair gets dry. Your hair and scalp feels great afterwards. My hair is shiny and soft again. I noticed my head was not itchy for days.&lt;br /&gt;I also have autoimmune problem causing dry hair and scalp. So this has been a wonderful surprise. First time using it my hair was soft. I left it on for a least 5 -10 and rinse it off last. You could put it on before your shower do a few things then rinse. So worth it! Love the mud....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingret’s are wonderful these are just a Few. Olive Oil &amp; Shea Butter carrot oil sweet almond oil &amp; Cocamidopropyl betaine is an organic compound derived from coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to trying the conditioner.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and its conditioner saved my scalp from psoriasis and it is somewhat volumizing as well.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying to grow my hair longer for about 6 months. In that process, I learned that the key to longer hear is healthier hair. I decided to try the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo as a part of this process. I have very sensitive skin and found that using this shampoo caused irritation of my scalp. I chose to discontinue use after about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers</li>
            <li> I received this from Tomoson for my review and am absolutely loving it. I love it and the conditioner both equally as much. My scalp is not itchy at all anymore and these products have left my hair significantly more moisturized and feeling healthy again. I would definitely repurchase this item.</li>
            <li> How your hairstyle turns out depends on what you&#x27;re using to wash your mane. Many shampoos promise to hydrate, add volume, intensify your natural curls, and more. Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo steps up and will manage to rescue your tresses. This shampoo contains natural ingredients such as:&lt;br /&gt;*Dead Sea Mud&lt;br /&gt;*Chamomile&lt;br /&gt;*Olive Oil&lt;br /&gt;These ingredients work diligently to bring deep hydration  and moisture to the scalp, relieving itching and flakiness. The pros of this product are endless:&lt;br /&gt;*Contains Vitamin E that helps to strengthen the hair root&lt;br /&gt;*Dead Sea formula works to relieve Dermatitis, Psoriasis, and other scalp conditions including dandruff&lt;br /&gt;*Hair is left feeling naturally moisturized , and more manageable&lt;br /&gt;*Works wonders on dry color treated hair&lt;br /&gt;My hair and scalp are very dry, so I was excited to pour a little bit of this product out into my hand to view the Dead Sea shampoo for myself. The product was dark gray in color, and had a wonderful scent-not one that I could pin-point as smelling like anything in particular, but it was pleasant nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the product to my scalp and massaged gently for several minutes. Rinsed, and applied again and let set for 5 min-before rinsing thoroughly. My hair felt so clean and soft after washing. There was no residue and my strands were thanking me for introducing them to this amazing shampoo. I also have a sensitive scalp, but experienced no irritation or adverse effects after my wash. I would recommend this product to anyone. I also only needed a very small amount-the lather is plentiful, so realize this shampoo will last you quite a while-use it sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adovia Dead Sea Mud Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Add them to your beauty regimen immediately-it&#x27;s not too late!</li>
            <li> I recently received a complimentary bottle of Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo for review and it arrived in good timing because my daughter has been suffering from an itchy scalp, so she would be my perfect test-subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo with Dead Sea Minerals contains Olive Oil, Shea Butter, Vitamin E, and Chamomile and is specifically designed to help aid in the treatment of itchy scalp, dandruff, and Scalp Psoriasis &amp; Seborrhea Dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my daughter as a test subject because I wasn’t sure if the shampoo would be okay on my color-treated hair or not. The bottle says “For all hair types”, but I just was hesitant and couldn’t find information on it. However, I had a salon appointment shortly after I received the bottle and so I caved and tried it out since I was getting my hair touched up anyway, and I’m happy to report that the time I used it did not fade or discolor my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as my daughter’s scalp, her itchiness has subsided since she’s been consistently using it, so we are very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> Was looking for cancerogenic and estrogen free shampoo - big disappointment - not all ingredients are listed on this page. The product contains Sodium Coceth Sulfate and Sodium Benzonate!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t notice a change in my psoriasis.  Use conditioner after.</li>
            <li> I have use the shampoo, and it has not help my scalp at all.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am always on the look out for quality hair care products that are good for textured hair. I have gone through so many different shampoos and conditioners all claiming to smooth, hydrate, nourish, blah blah blah. I have heard of some that &amp;#34;really work&amp;#34; but to pay the prices they want I may as well go to the salon. I am not trying to spend $70-80 to wash my own damn hair. Uh uh...no way! Well, the Adovia folks seem to feel the same way I do! They have made an amazing Dead Sea Mud shampoo and a Dead Sea Salt conditioner that work fabulously with textured hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter and I are both mixed. Her hair is very curly and mine is like a wave-curl. Both of us tend to get very dry and although you can always run your fingers through our hair, sometimes it looks like a sheep&#x27;s ass. Not attractive. I am so glad to have been given the opportunity to try out the Dead Sea shampoo and conditioner for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Dead Sea shampoo and conditioners her curls stayed soft and bouncy and when it was time to comb through them we had very few tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for my comparison from what Adovia says and what I experienced:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo: Adovia Says:&lt;br /&gt;Helps to relieve itching from dry, flaky scalp, and dandruff&lt;br /&gt;Helps to relieve symptoms of scalp psoriasis and seborrhea dermatitis&lt;br /&gt;Made with pure and natural Dead Sea mud for an infusion of essential minerals into scalp and hair&lt;br /&gt;Specially formulated for dry, itchy scalps, and dandruff&lt;br /&gt;Also contains olive oil, shea butter, vitamin E, and chamomile for a natural formula that gets results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo: Twisted Mommy Says:&lt;br /&gt;I tend to get head itch and it can be quite annoying. Since using the shampoo, no head itch.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to get a bit of flaky scalp/dandruff, none of that either.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it is made with what it says and at this point I totally trust Adovia (which is why I keep using their stuff) so I&#x27;ll just go on and believe that the stuff they say is in it, is in fact in it.&lt;br /&gt;It absolutely works for dry and itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have finally found my shampoo and conditioner. I most definitely recommend this for anyone, but if you are of the textured hair ilk this shampoo and conditioner combo is DEFINITELY for you! Now I need Adovia to make a detangler, a leave in conditioner, and a daily moisturizer and I will be a seriously happy mom with an even happier curly kid who no longer goes through ouchies when its time to get her hair washed.ey say is in it, is in fact in it.&lt;br /&gt;It absolutely works for dry and itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have finally found my shampoo and conditioner. I most definitely recommend this for anyone, but if you are of the textured hair ilk this shampoo and conditioner combo is DEFINITELY for you!

            <li> While my hair did feel amazing after using this product I didn&#x27;t enjoy the small at all. i don&#x27;t think i would use it again.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo. It has a nice scent - not overpowering, but definitely &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smelling. It does leave my hair feeling very clean, but I&#x27;m not overly impressed with the dandruff relief. I&#x27;ve used the shampoo for weeks and don&#x27;t notice a difference there.</li>
            <li> The only shampoo I can use to relieve scalp psoriasis symptoms</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s all in this but wow...I had a severe itchy scalp and no other shampoos or conditioners worked. THIS STUFF IS AMAZING. That&#x27;s all I can say.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this hasn&#x27;t helped with my scalp psoriasis at all. I don&#x27;t like using it either because the smell is awful. It sticks with my hair and I end up smelling it all day...</li>
            <li> not happy that it has sulfates in it (hence the 4 stars) but my hubby LOVES this enough to steal it from me regularly.  the smell is very strong but even so i do not have problems with it bothering my senses like other chemical-y shampoo smells do.  i have used natural products for years now and this one mixed with my argon oil shampoo works well enough.  would give it another star and buy it again if they took out the sulfates.</li>
            <li> Really great product! I&#x27;m the last person to give reviews on Amazon but this shampoo truly deserves every star it gets. I am using it to keep my psoriasis under control and it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I extensively read the online reviews of this product before purchase and was hopeful based upon the positive input. However, I&#x27;ve decided those positive reviews must be solicited and financially awarded because this product actually made my flaking and itching worse. May not have been a direct result of the product as it smells very nice and lathers well, but more from the lack of an actual active ingredient to control my symptoms. I used the product exclusively for three weeks (2/3 of the bottle) so I feel confident in the effort I put to &amp;#34;give it a chance&amp;#34;.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the product unless you&#x27;re just looking for a product that smells good.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shampoos I have ever used! I absolutely love it! My hair is clean and not built up with any additives, and for the first time in 2 years it is growing again! I wish I could afford to use the conditioner too, but for now I wont use anything else.I received the products mentioned  for free using  Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe are good</li>
            <li> If you have eczema or psoriasis or just an irritating itch that you can&#x27;t get rid of. This is the shampoo for you. I couldn&#x27;t go without washing my hair for two or three days. WHen I bought this shampoo I could go for like a week and a half to two weeks without washing it. LOVE it. A bit expensive but worth the money</li>
            <li> This product was overpriced and did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help scalp at all</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! Doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, leaves it soft for days without getting oily. I have fine color treated hair.</li>
            <li> My son LOVE&#x27;s this shampoo!!!! This is perfect for him as he has dry scalp and makes his hair feel soft and not oily like some others do. I will ALWAYS buy this when in stock. This shampoo is also great for after getting a shave cut as my breaks out from clippers and this helps relieve and make the bumps go away as well.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, the feel, and the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I can not recommend this product to anyone because it is falsely advertised. It contains WHEAT, which was not disclaimed. In fact, there was no ingredients list listed on the ad. Only when it arrived did I see all of the ingredients. 3 of which I am allergic to. Prof. Beauty Group does not hold up their money back guarantee 100%. I am still struggling with them over a month to get this returned and to get a refund. This is not an all natural product. When I purchased this, I wasn&#x27;t anticipating wheat because I&#x27;ve never known shampoo to contain wheat. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to contain sulfates and propylene glycol either since I searched for an organic, sulfate-free dandruff shampoo. I will NEVER buy anything from Prof. Beauty Group again after this. They have poor customer service. I also won&#x27;t be buying anything again if I don&#x27;t first know the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I cannot even begin to tell you how happy I am that I found Adovia! I am quickly becoming addicted to every product I try! I just wish i&#x27;d known about this stuff sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner for a few days now, and what a difference it&#x27;s made! My hair is extremely silky, shiney and has a wonderful scent that lasts (even 24 hours later)! I still have a lot left but went ahead and ordered 3 more bottles of the shampoo, as well as the conditioner. I didn&#x27;t want to risk running out. This stuff is like liquid gold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t find anything locally that&#x27;s even remotely close to the quality that Adovia offers. No store bought shampoo or conditioner even comes close. I&#x27;ve tried so many brands over the years. Everything from the standard stuff you can find anywhere, to products that are only carried in top salons. There&#x27;s just nothing like it out there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: If you have a few extra bucks, be sure to try the Adovia dead sea mud mask. My face feels and looks amazing!</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells awesome and works great. Every time you sweat it smells like you just washed your hair. My husband, children, and I use it. We all have different hair textures too. We have had a dry scalp after the winter. Since using this shampoo we have noticed a huge difference. No more flakes and no more dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So, tonight was my first time using this product, I am totally shocked! I was expecting it to be somewhat of a thick, clumpy, product with a not so great smell. Well, it came out like a regular shampoo would, also, it has a nice clean scent to it! I was wondering if this would lather or not, which it did so I was happy about that as well. My hair now feels so soft and clean after using this! I am hoping this clears up dandruff too because I really suffer with that and head and shoulders dont even seem to help!</li>
            <li> Id suffered with dandruff for years. I think ive tried even brand and kind of shampoo and treatments for it but nothings work. Ive been using this one for about a week. Im happy to say i have very little if not none dandruff. This works. It also smells really good and leaves your hair looking great.</li>
            <li> Got this for husband, and it has made his dandruff worse!</li>
            <li> Did not work at all for me. LOTS of sulfates. In my search I give every shampoo I try a month and this has not improved my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> have been dandruff free since using.</li>
            <li> works wonderfully and smells great.</li>
            <li> this is great, love hoe&#x3D;w healthy my hair feels good stuff try it</li>
            <li> Good quality product, but unfortunately didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo based on all of the reviews saying that it cured their &amp;#34;very bad&amp;#34; scalp psoriasis.  Many of them saying they saw improvement after the first few uses.  I did not see any improvement in my scalp psoriasis.  It&#x27;s still just as bad as when I started using it and the bottle is almost gone.  The shampoo smells very good and it makes my hair feel very clean and soft.  It&#x27;s pricey for just a bottle of shampoo but I spent the money hoping it would work as the reviews said it would and it did not.  However, I can&#x27;t knock the overall product because it is a nice shampoo.  Just don&#x27;t buy it for the purpose of curing your scalp psoriasis like I did and you&#x27;ll be very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Will re-order.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great and left my hair feeling smooth and healthy.  I normally have very oily hair and I felt like this helped my ahir not feel caked with oil as quickly. Lifesaver!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Got rid of summer itchy scalp and flaking in one shampoo ! Yet it is mild on my skin .!  Love it.  Makes my silver hair shine</li>
            <li> This shampoo feels soothing and moisturizing, makes my hair really soft. It&#x27;s not thick like mud, it is like the regular shampoo consistency and smells clean.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. It has a very nice scent and makes my hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, not too dry on your hair.</li>
            <li> Smells good and lathers nicely. Doesn&#x27;t work for itchy or dry scalp. At all.</li>
            <li> Their are so many things I love about this shampoo. I do want to say they I received a free product trial for it so I could make and informed blog post about it but WOW this stuff dose so much for my hair . I live in Florida and the humidity makes it so I have to flat iron my hair and use a lot of styling products . using a harsh shampoo really makes my hair look bad so I was o happy that using this shampoo my hair is shinny lovely and so easy to manage . I am always looking for a shampoo that will keep my hair looking nice no matter how much I do to it and this Dead sea mud shampoos it really effective in keeping my hair nice..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to see for yourself stop by my blog or YouTube channel I did a video review because I wanted everyone to see how nice my hair is looking now ..its amazing !</li>
            <li> I already tried the Face Mask and the Soap and so I was not surprised that I loved the shampoo as well. Don´t be fooled by the dark color of the Shampoo! It does not foam dark- it lathers completely into a white foam and you need only a tiny bit of it. The Shampoo and the Conditioner both have a pleasant mild fresh scent- not overwhelming- just clean and nice. BTW: I recommend using also the conditioner: The conditioner really makes my hair shiny and hydrated. I am dandruff free at the moment so this will be my new anti dandruff solution. I love that it is a natural and cruelty free product. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial. &lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;TOP55601b6cb010f2bac68c5724c939c533\\&quot; rel&#x3D;\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was not real sure what to expect when i got this product, you know \\&quot;dead sea mud\\&quot;, but i love this the shampoo lathers nicely, left my hair soft and clean feeling, lightly scented but not too feminine- even my husband gave it a try! i have issues with a dry scalp but oily hair and this product helped with the itchy dry scalp and did not add extra oil to my hair! i would strongly suggest you try this product if you have issues with your scalp, it is super gentle and only lightly scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOM55601b6cb010f2bac68c5724c939c533\\&quot; rel&#x3D;\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;Tomoson.com&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I have problems with dandruff since I was little, and nothing has helped! I bought this, and WOW it has greatly reduced it! I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks and going to order some more when I&#x27;m almost done with my current bottle.</li>
            <li> Makes your scalp too dry</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for a family member with dry scalp and a dandruff problem. Adovia dead sea mud shampoo works. This is like a facial mud mask only for your hair!  Her scalp is not as dry and dandruff has lessened. We expect to see continued  results as time goes on.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve never in my life had this much fun with a product! Today i got the dead sea mud shampoo and i expected it to do nothing really i was expecting the usual shampoo ho hums, but that was NOT the case, i used it twice and i recommend using the conditioner Balsam with it together, years of damage were gone, the rinse and repeat yes do so! my hair is color treated and you know you can never ever get all of the extra color out of your hair and it always leaves your hair icky lifeless and just down right disgusting! You also know how long haired woman like myself lose there hair and have issues with dandruff, i call it cradle cap like babies have, Your not going to believe this But no all the damage i had split ends, lifeless hair, dandruff, itchy scalp GOODBYE! Say goodbye to that and hello to soft spun silk hair. i am running my finger through my hair as we speak and no knots! My hair is so so soft it even shines i just can&#x27;t believe how this product with it&#x27;s sister conditioner made my hair there should be a higher rating than love it, there should be one that says squeel because that is exactly what i did when my hair dried! *This product was given to me for review by Adovia in no way has this compromised my review of the product* Enjoy your hair!</li>
            <li> Looks like mud but smells really nice. My skin feels clean and fresh after shampooing with this</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited to try Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo after reading about it. I tend to buy shampoos that are organic or contain a lot of herbs or other natural ingredients but sometimes the shampoos don&#x27;t live up to my expectations. That was not the case with Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo. Now you might be wondering why anyone would want to wash their hair with dead sea mud to start with. Dead sea mud has been used for centuries for it&#x27;s healing properties. It contains the highest concentration of minerals found in mud anywhere in the world and these minerals are essential for proper skin function. They also help to regulate moisture retention as well as hydration. In fact, people travel from all over the world to experience the effects of the mud at the Dead Sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo claimed to give fast, natural relief from itchy, dry, flaky scalp, scalp psoriasis, seborrhea dermatitis and dandruff. I have an itchy, dry, flaky scalp and some shampoos really irritate my scalp. At the time I tried it I wasn&#x27;t really thinking about the possibility that it would stop my scalp from itching all the time but it did. Since the first use I have not had any itchiness on my scalp. That is a real plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a very pleasant smell that is not overly strong. Some of the ingredients listed include dead sea mud, dead sea water, chamomile, algae extract, papaya extract, dead sea salt, aloe vera gel, wheat germ oil, grape seed oil, sweet almond oil, carrot seed oil, olive oil and shea butter. It&#x27;s no wonder it made my hair so soft and shiny. In fact, I didn&#x27;t even have to deal with tangles when I combed my wet hair. That says a lot. Even after my hair was dry it remained tangle-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy hair and some shampoos weigh my hair down so badly that it looks straight. I am happy to say that Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo did not do this. The waves clearly show even after my hair is dry. I do not feel the use of a conditioner is necessary with this shampoo but I typically do not use conditioner anyway. For those who prefer using a conditioner Adovia Mineral Balsam Conditioner is recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend that you give this product a try especially if you have been less than satisfied with the other shampoos you have used.  To give you an idea of how long a bottle might last, I use about a quarter size puddle of this shampoo each time I wash my hair and my hair is below my shoulders. I get a good, rich lather from this amount of shampoo. I do not have to wash my hair twice either - but I do wash it everyday. Not because I feel this shampoo requires that but because that is just what I do living on a farm. My hair gets lots of dirt and debris in it on a daily basis. Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo removed all of that with no problem and left my hair squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dead Sea Salts and Mud have been featured on CNN, in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times.  Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo is available on Amazon.com or through their website Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice.air is dry.

            <li> My husband and I have used the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo for a couple weeks. I mostly got it for my husband because he has occasional yet minor dandruff. It may just be the change in the weather but, my scalp was feeling irritated too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo is not a dandruff shampoo, it does say it will provide relief for a dry or irritated scalp. I was pretty sure that was all my husband and I needed. It has worked great and I even like it as a regular everyday shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, my husband and I would use a dandruff shampoo occasionally to clear up our dandruff or irritated scalp and then return to our regular (not anything special) shampoo. We wanted to try something different than what we had been using which were just the brands available at the supermarket for dandruff. I liked that the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo was not medicated, doesn&#x27;t smell funny and doesn&#x27;t make your head tingle. The tingle of other shampoos was something that made me think it was doing something, but also worried me a little as to what it really was doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo without conditioner on my long hair and it has been surprisingly still manageable and my hair appears to be in good condition. I&#x27;m happy with the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo and I now have the Mineral Balsam Conditioner and I am exited give it a try too!</li>
            <li> My hair felt super soft after using this shampoo. I was a little unsure about the color of the shampoo, but it smells nice and lathers up well in my long fine hair. I&#x27;ve been using products with dead sea minerals on my skin and have loved the results, so it&#x27;s nice to try a shampoo with dead sea minerals too!</li>
            <li> This is a product I have recently received that I was very intrigued about and was anxious to try. I once received a Dead Sea hand and nail care set as a gift and it was among the best hand care products I have ever used, so I REALLY wanted to try this shampoo!  I received a bottle of Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo to use and review and I can say I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It is quite different from what we are used to because it is dark colored and comes out of the bottle looking, well like mud or dirt. It doesn&#x27;t small all fruity and isn&#x27;t full of fake chemicals to give it a sweet fragrance. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it just doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering fragrance trying to make it smell like something it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;As I have gotten.... age-enhanced, my scalp and hair have changed. I have never had any issues with flakes or itchiness before, but have suffered both within the last year or so and no shampoo has helped or eliminated these issues and some of them have left my hair feeling rough and dry. After just 2 or 3 washes with the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo, there were no flakes on my darker clothes and the itchy scalp was vanquished! I didn&#x27;t know what I expected, but I didn&#x27;t expect to see results so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Adovia Dead Sea Mud Shampoo is formulated with natural ingredients such as Dead Sea Mud, Chamomile &amp; Olive Oil to bring deep hydration and moisture to the scalp, relieving itching and flakiness. Dead Sea Mud has been known for centuries for it&#x27;s healing properties and people travel from all over the world to come and experience it&#x27;s effects at the Dead Sea. Dead Sea Mud contains the highest concentration of minerals found in mud anywhere in the world. These minerals are all essential for proper skin function and help to regulate moisture retention as well as hydration.&lt;br /&gt; I absolutely love what this shampoo has done for my hair and scalp. It just feels better. This shampoo has proven to be very effective for me and I am very, very pleased with the results.ults.</li>
            <li> Interesting stuff. Bought it for my son, and he says his scalp has improved. My daughter, however, wouldn&#x27;t touch the stuff.</li>
            <li> Since the first use this shampoo has reduced my scalp psoriasis. It doesn&#x27;t make it go away, but it isn&#x27;t as thick and itchy by the end of (and throughout) the day. It reduces the itchy feeling by probably 70%. It also smells really nice, but not overpowering! I am careful not to condition my scalp though too which also reduces the itchy feeling. It leaves my hair soft without needing a condition over my scalp.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been blessed to get to try a few of the Adovia Mineral Skin Care products but this is by far my favorite! I have been fighting a losing battle with Scalp Psoriasis since I was in my teens. I have tried both over the counter and prescription products over the years to try to have relief. Adovia Mineral Skin Care Dead Sea Mud Shampoo has been a saving grace in my battle with flare-ups. It works and is not harsh on my scalp or hair. It helps to keep both the itching and flaking(or as i call it snowing) away. It has a light clean scent that does not smell like medical. It leaves my hair soft and ready to style! And a little does along away-So for the price this bottle lasted me well over a month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item description:&lt;br /&gt;Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Shampoo is specially formulated with natural ingredients such as Dead Sea Mud, Chamomile &amp; Olive Oil to bring deep hydration and moisture to the scalp, relieving itching and flakiness.

Dead Sea Salts and Mud have been featured on CNN, in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times. Dead Sea Mud contains the highest concentration of minerals found in mud anywhere in the world. Finally the benefits of Dead Sea mud and salt are presented to you in shampoo form! These minerals are all essential for proper skin function and help to regulate moisture retention as well as hydration. You complete satisfaction is guaranteed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> As for me, I don&#x27;t really struggle with itchy scalp any more, and when I first started using this product, I was concerned how well it would clean my hair.  I have thick hair, and I do use hairspray and mousse to style my hair.  My hair is about shoulder-length, and I normally follow my shampoo with a conditioner to &amp;#34;tame&amp;#34; it.  For the purposes of this review, I did not do that.  I used just the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed immediately with how well this shampoo cleaned my hair, felt, and smelled!  And no worries about having dry hair--this stuff worked really well!  I am still using it.  In fact, I did use another shampoo just to compare, and this Dead Sea Mud shampoo works really well.  I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, my scalp still inches.</li>
            <li> I have bad dandruff and normal dandruff shampoo isn&#x27;t very effective to manage it. This shampoo has been the exception. I use it three to four times a week and I can wear black shirts without shame - it&#x27;s a really fantastic product and I will purchase it again (in perpetuity) in the future.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this dandruff shampoo by adovia.</li>
            <li> great product, great price, fast ship.</li>
            <li> Very impressed.  Very effective, clean scent, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT MAKE MY SCALP SO CLEAN</li>
