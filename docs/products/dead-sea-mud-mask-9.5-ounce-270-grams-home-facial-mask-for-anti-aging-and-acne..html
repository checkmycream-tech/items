            <li>Too soon to give it a fair review, but I will say when I used it, it left my skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a good mask for deep cleaning.</li>

            <li>Leaves my skin really fresh and it feels rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>my skin was very red and warm.</li>
            <li>still fun for a girls night in.</li>
            <li>This is based on my own personal experience.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I was worried at first, because when I took the mask off (15 min)</li>
            <li>Since the mud settles after packaging, there is about a tablespoon of water sitting on top of the mud in the jar when you first open it.</li>
            <li>The first one they sent had been cracked on the cap.</li>
            <li>When I first received this mud mask, the lid was cracked and it had leaked all over.</li>
            <li>I went back to murad, they products seem to produce a better result for me.</li>
            <li>I went through many mud masks throughout the years but ever since I bought this one, i was left speechless.</li>
            <li>If you just want a decent mask go for it, but if you want the real deal take my word for it and spend a little more on a product from Israel, the results are worth it!!</li>
            <li>I contacted IQ Natural and they shipped another one quickly and in tact after apologizing for the first one.</li>
            <li>so when I saw all the positive reviews on this product, I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li>If you have any open cuts on your face it might tingle but other than that its a great product.</li>
            <li>My skin breaks out anything if I put on a certain brand of makeup that my skin doesn&#x27;t agree with</li>
            <li>When I received the product I really didn&#x27;t expect a 2.0 bottle</li>
            <li>maybe cause I didn&#x27;t pay too much attention to what I was ordering.</li>
            <li>My skin always feels so soft and calm after use.</li>
            <li>And I really see my skin is clearing up..</li>
            <li>Real sea</li>
            <li>and it made my skin softer and it gently exfoliates the skin while rinsing off.</li>
            <li>other than that it does everything it claims leaving you clean and refreshed !</li>
            <li>, that said it was better to start rinsing the mudd mask off, BEFORE it has completely dried, to avoid drying out the skin too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only Okay for me because my skin is apparently too sensitive to use the mask.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I love the mud mask it tingles a little when applied</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed my acne getting a little better.</li>
            <li>Helped with my skin issues but seems to dry quickly in the container.</li>
            <li>McGlinchey, a facialist and the creator of MV Organic Skincare, a line of organic skin-care products developed for people with high skin sensitivities (Emma Watson and Maggie Gylenhall are both fans).</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product I could tell a difference in the tightness of my skin and within the third application my acne had improved almost 100%.</li>
            <li>This product left my face feeling smooth, and help dry up some persistent acne.</li>
            <li>After it dried, I rinsed it off with warm water and found my skin to be VERY dry.</li>
            <li>By the time I get ready to wash the mask off, Ive noticed that the areas where I have blemishes have turned white.  </li>
            <li>soft mud in a jar.</li>
            <li>you have  sensitive  </li>
            <li>I question whether it is truly dead sea mud, seeing as I have a much more expensive dead sea mud mask from Israel that is of much better quality and works much better at clearing my skin</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend to anybody who has the same problem I&#x27;ve had, totally worth it.</li>
            <li>First time only left on 10 minutes then rubbed off like suggested.</li>
            <li>I love the mask but only advise is to use it no more than twice a month</li>
            <li>Open it over the sink and pour off the water when you first open it.</li>
            <li>the mask is very tiny, but I guess it will last for a while, as I did not have to take too much of the mask to put it on my face.</li>
            <li>You only need a little bit and it will most definitely go a long way.</li>
            <li>tried twice of this mud, first time when I put on my face, I didn&#x27;t feel nothing, but after 5-8min, I started feeling not right, but I thought this supposed to be like it</li>
            <li>you can feel the tingling and then when the mask drys and you wash it off my skin feels so soft and my pores are looking smaller</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous products to get rid of my adult acne and nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li>When I received this product, the top was broken and the contents had spilled into the surrounding container.  </li>
            <li>if you use it too much it does have the potential to dry out your skin !</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will burn a little the first  couple  of times you use</li>
            <li>so I left it on my face and bared w/ the burning feel until the mud got dry completely, after I washed it off</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to have to send the whole mess back to them before I could get another jar.  </li>
            <li>This was new since I have never had this experience with any other mud mask.</li>
            <li>I bought this Dead sea mud mask and put it on for about 10 minutes, next day my face was clear and soft.</li>

            <li> I thought I was going to have to send the whole mess back to them before I could get another jar.  </li>
            <li> This was new since I have never had this experience with any other mud mask.</li>
            <li> I bought this Dead sea mud mask and put it on for about 10 minutes, next day my face was clear and soft.</li>
            <li> But then there&#x27;s the dry phase, which draws out moisture from the surface of your skin, causing dehydration and irritation.&amp;#34; Not only does skin then feel dry, tight, and sometimes itchy, but when you counteract it by slathering on extra face cream, you&#x27;re just smothering your freshly cleansed skin.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> To which I said, &amp;#34;Wha?&amp;#34; I mean, that&#x27;s the fun part‚Äîwaiting and watching for the clay to crack and flake.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone w/ sensitive skin type, so I have to be very careful on everything that I put on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like the burn it gives me making it known it really is working hard</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve gotten into my late 20&#x27;s, I have become really blemish prone.  </li>
            <li> , my face was so red, and hurt, and my acne prone skin did not get improved at all, the 2nd time experience was the same as well, after that, I stop using is, it&#x27;s a waste of a money.</li>
            <li> Did this at night as other had said it would leave skin red.</li>
            <li> Second time used for total of 15 minutes and put on little heavier.</li>
            <li> #34;You should never let a clay mask dry fully.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Then you have the start of the dry phase, which exercises your capillaries and stimulates blood flow as the mask cools and contracts.</li>
            <li> Only con would be the jar is little smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Only reason I gave it an average review.</li>
            <li> Made my skin dry out, it did not help with my patchiness and did not help lessen the appearance of redness, spots, or other soin imperfections.  </li>
            <li> Still the same mess, no benefits for my face, other than overdrying.</li>
            <li> Ingredients 100% Dead Sea Mud, the only ingredient.</li>
            <li> Received product in the expected time.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when opening it, over a sink or something.</li>
            <li> Secondly when I tried it my skin felt a burning sensation as it dried..</li>
            <li> you need to be careful when using this mask !</li>
            <li> Container is smaller than it looks but a very small amount goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I got it the other day</li>
            <li> I used a fan brush to apply a thin layer, so the tiny jar may just last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To start off, when I first opened it to begin using, I immediately was unhappy.</li>
            <li> There is a bit of a burning sensation from the high salt content (similar to sitting in an Epsom salt/ muscle soak bath), but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving it on over night or there will be little crumbled pieces all over.  </li>
            <li> As McGlinchey applied her MV Signature Mineral Mask, made with sun-dried clay, she doled out this little bit of advice: &amp;</li>
            <li> Well, I used this product several times, hoping that my opinion would change, but alas it has not.</li>
            <li> I added a few drops of lavender oil and that helps a lot.  </li>
            <li> It quickly dried up a break out on my chin.</li>
            <li> (the brand is Deluvia Dead Sea, if you were wondering).</li>
            <li> First of all things started bad since the jar came cracked and the product was all over the packaging that it came with..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very little, so I suggest buy two.</li>

            <li> Everyday feels like a spa day!</li>
            <li> I did not realize how small the product was when purchasing it</li>
            <li> Packaged nicely, small jar but contains a lot of mud.</li>
            <li> It takes a very small amount to cover face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it comes in and settles on the bottom, leaving thin layer of water/mud.</li>
            <li> They just expressed how sorry they were and shipped me another one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but this isn&#x27;t for me.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it is satisfying quality for that price</li>
            <li> Love it. Helped with my skin issues but seems to dry quickly in the container.</li>
            <li> Ingredients 100% Dead Sea Mud, the only ingredient. Safe to leave on overnight. I like it.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve gotten into my late 20&#x27;s, I have become really blemish prone.  At night after I wash my face, I place the mask on the areas where I have a pimple that is forming or that I have popped (which you should not do, pop pimples that is lol) and I leave it on for an hour or so.  Word of caution after a while the mask starts to crumble so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving it on over night or there will be little crumbled pieces all over.  If you don&#x27;t mind, go for it.  By the time I get ready to wash the mask off, Ive noticed that the areas where I have blemishes have turned white.  Once I was it off the redness of the blemishes forming have subsided and the ones that Ive popped are not longer irrated and red and by the morning a scab has formed to cover it.  Great product and I will order again when this runs out.</li>
            <li> This product did what it said it would do . It help try up all the oil on my face and help with my acne, I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> The mask is pretty good, it makes my face feel smooth.</li>
            <li> I like this mask, it feels good on skin and after. I use it after glycolic peel, dont know if it ok, but did not have any reactions, no allergy. I like it!</li>
            <li> love it good facials mask.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! You can feel it tightening the skin. First time only left on 10 minutes then rubbed off like suggested. Did this at night as other had said it would leave skin red. Skin was only red for about 15 minutes after then went away. Second time used for total of 15 minutes and put on little heavier. Skin was red again but goes away. Make sure you drain off the excess water and stir up before using as suggested by others. Using this about 2 - 3 times week and have noticed change in skin texture, pores and softening. Received product in the expected time. Only con would be the jar is little smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Great, you can feel it working.</li>
            <li> recommended üëç top quality</li>
            <li> When I received the product I really didn&#x27;t expect a 2.0 bottle maybe cause I didn&#x27;t pay too much attention to what I was ordering. Anyway, I love the mud mask it tingles a little when applied but that&#x27;s the sign that its working. But I will purchase again hopefully they sell it in a bigger bottle. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Well, I used this product several times, hoping that my opinion would change, but alas it has not. To start off, when I first opened it to begin using, I immediately was unhappy. Despite trying to get into a &amp;#34;sea mask&amp;#34; consistency, it was still liquid and went all over the place. Then after using the product for several days, there was no improvements. Still the same mess, no benefits for my face, other than overdrying. While it may work for some, this is definitely not for me</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t order this again. It came in a plastic container that looked like.cheap Tupperware. Not to mention the product looked like crap. \\&quot;literally\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to return it and they said I can&#x27;t. So it went in the trash.</li>
            <li> you need to be careful when using this mask ! if you use it too much it does have the potential to dry out your skin ! other than that it does everything it claims leaving you clean and refreshed ! I love the mask but only advise is to use it no more than twice a month</li>
            <li> This is a good mask for deep cleaning. It takes a very small amount to cover face.&lt;br /&gt;Order packed well. On time delivery.</li>
            <li> Excellent product with a fair price for what it promises. have not tested it, but from what I read will work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin really fresh and it feels rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way this stuff smells but I love what this stuff does for my skin.  I added a few drops of lavender oil and that helps a lot.  I recommend it if you are like me starting to age and not liking what nature is doing with your skin. I use it about once a week. I am loving the results.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this face mask.  My skin always feels so soft and calm after use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, but I have a warning: It&#x27;s filled to the brim in the container it comes in and settles on the bottom, leaving thin layer of water/mud. When I opened it, it splashed everywhere. Just be careful when opening it, over a sink or something. Totally easy to clean up, no stains or anything like that. Nice smooth mud!!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and it broke my face out</li>
            <li> I like this product. Can feel it tightening my skin as its working</li>
            <li> It worked well for me, almost like a mini-peel. There is a bit of a burning sensation from the high salt content (similar to sitting in an Epsom salt/ muscle soak bath), but nothing too bad. I was worried at first, because when I took the mask off (15 min) my skin was very red and warm. I thought I might have done some damage, but I put on an aloe based moisturizer, and within an hour my skin looked and felt great. I used a fan brush to apply a thin layer, so the tiny jar may just last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A side note - Since the mud settles after packaging, there is about a tablespoon of water sitting on top of the mud in the jar when you first open it. Open it over the sink and pour off the water when you first open it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this product. It&#x27;s a gift for my sister. The first one they sent had been cracked on the cap. I contacted IQ Natural and they shipped another one quickly and in tact after apologizing for the first one.</li>
            <li> DOES WHATS PROMISED AND DRIES QUICKLY FOR THOSE OF US WHO DONT HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO SIT ARUND AND WAIT</li>
            <li> Its a good face cleaner i just dont get enough of it</li>
            <li> smells horrid and dont see any difference</li>
            <li> you can feel the tingling and then when the mask drys and you wash it off my skin feels so soft and my pores are looking smaller</li>
            <li> My face feels amazing and I can already see improvement. Container is smaller than it looks but a very small amount goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> just used this mask, liked the smell and the feel of it after washing it. the mask is very tiny, but I guess it will last for a while, as I did not have to take too much of the mask to put it on my face. First application seemed good, lets see how well it goes from here on.</li>
            <li> Wonderful firm feeling after rinsing off mask!</li>
            <li> This is one of those time will tell products. Too soon to give it a fair review, but I will say when I used it, it left my skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> soft mud in a jar. I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvements in my skin since using it. I suppose its more of a placebo thing. still fun for a girls night in.</li>
            <li> Product is not as much as good like reviews</li>
            <li> First of all things started bad since the jar came cracked and the product was all over the packaging that it came with.. Secondly when I tried it my skin felt a burning sensation as it dried.. I have only used it twice and only a small amount remains since Mose did spill out ..</li>
            <li> When I first received this mud mask, the lid was cracked and it had leaked all over. I contacted the seller and even sent picture&#x27;s of it. To my surprise, this company sent me another one, without asking me to send it back. The second one came in perfect condition. They also sent a free sample of another mask. I have to say, this is VERY good customer service! I also liked the mud mask. I read a blog, that said it was better to start rinsing the mudd mask off, BEFORE it has completely dried, to avoid drying out the skin too much. That made it seem to work wonderfully! **HERE IS THE link to the article**&lt;br /&gt;http://www.allure.com/beauty-trends/blogs/daily-beauty-reporter/2013/04/right-way-to-use-clay-face-mask.html&lt;br /&gt;WHICH STATES:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Sharon McGlinchey, a facialist and the creator of MV Organic Skincare, a line of organic skin-care products developed for people with high skin sensitivities (Emma Watson and Maggie Gylenhall are both fans). As McGlinchey applied her MV Signature Mineral Mask, made with sun-dried clay, she doled out this little bit of advice: &amp;#34;You should never let a clay mask dry fully.&amp;#34; To which I said, &amp;#34;Wha?&amp;#34; I mean, that&#x27;s the fun part‚Äîwaiting and watching for the clay to crack and flake. &amp;#34;There are three phases of a clay mask,&amp;#34; McGlinchey continued. &amp;#34;There&#x27;s the damp phase where your skin drinks in the beneficial minerals from the outside. Then you have the start of the dry phase, which exercises your capillaries and stimulates blood flow as the mask cools and contracts. But then there&#x27;s the dry phase, which draws out moisture from the surface of your skin, causing dehydration and irritation.&amp;#34; Not only does skin then feel dry, tight, and sometimes itchy, but when you counteract it by slathering on extra face cream, you&#x27;re just smothering your freshly cleansed skin.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> When I received this product, the top was broken and the contents had spilled into the surrounding container.  I emailed the sellers and told them what happened.  I thought I was going to have to send the whole mess back to them before I could get another jar.  Nope!  They just expressed how sorry they were and shipped me another one.  I got it the other day and it was shipped in a box with the packing pop corn in it.&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleased with this product as well.  It quickly dried up a break out on my chin. My skin is softer too. Everyday feels like a spa day!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty ok, couldn&#x27;t really tell the difference</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous products to get rid of my adult acne and nothing seemed to work. The first time I used this product I could tell a difference in the tightness of my skin and within the third application my acne had improved almost 100%. I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask twice a week since 4 month. And I really see my skin is clearing up..I love this product and will order this again..</li>
            <li> Item did arrive on time,However, this product is just a basic mud mask. I question whether it is truly dead sea mud, seeing as I have a much more expensive dead sea mud mask from Israel that is of much better quality and works much better at clearing my skin (the brand is Deluvia Dead Sea, if you were wondering). If you just want a decent mask go for it, but if you want the real deal take my word for it and spend a little more on a product from Israel, the results are worth it!! But this one is simply Blah!!</li>
            <li> Works well.&lt;br /&gt;Will remove  pimples  for sure.&lt;br /&gt;If you have  sensitive  skin dont use.&lt;br /&gt;It will burn a little the first  couple  of times you use it.&lt;br /&gt;Its truly  a great  mask.  Real sea mud.&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
            <li> This product left my face feeling smooth, and help dry up some persistent acne. I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Feels great and my face is notably smoother after I use it!!</li>
            <li> I wasnt too impressed with this product.  Made my skin dry out, it did not help with my patchiness and did not help lessen the appearance of redness, spots, or other soin imperfections.  I went back to murad, they products seem to produce a better result for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of masks so when I saw all the positive reviews on this product, I had to give it a try. This is based on my own personal experience. When I opened the product, the liquid (yes, liquid) was on top of the rim. After applying the not-so-thick mask, the skin on my face started to burn. This was new since I have never had this experience with any other mud mask. I thought it was because it was a different product and it contained different ingredients. After it dried, I rinsed it off with warm water and found my skin to be VERY dry. I have combo skin so this shouldn&#x27;t have happened. I didn&#x27;t find this mask helpful. It made my skin hurt - even the morning after. I&#x27;m sorry, but this isn&#x27;t for me. I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> I went through many mud masks throughout the years but ever since I bought this one, i was left speechless. My skin breaks out anything if I put on a certain brand of makeup that my skin doesn&#x27;t agree with and I got acne worst than a teenager! I bought this Dead sea mud mask and put it on for about 10 minutes, next day my face was clear and soft. I definitely recommend to anybody who has the same problem I&#x27;ve had, totally worth it. The shipping takes no time. :)</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes my face feel smooth and I&#x27;ve noticed my acne getting a little better. If you have any open cuts on your face it might tingle but other than that its a great product. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Made my skin feel tighter. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how small the product was when purchasing it but I used it onc and it made my skin softer and it gently exfoliates the skin while rinsing off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very little, so I suggest buy two. It worked well.</li>
            <li> The thing is pretty nice and it works good but the problem is that when u put it on face it starts to sting or burn to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only Okay for me because my skin is apparently too sensitive to use the mask. Packaged nicely, small jar but contains a lot of mud. I&#x27;d recommend to anybody who knows they won&#x27;t have a problem with the mask. I had it on for about one minute and my face started to burn. Only reason I gave it an average review.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone w/ sensitive skin type, so I have to be very careful on everything that I put on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I tried twice of this mud, first time when I put on my face, I didn&#x27;t feel nothing, but after 5-8min, I started feeling not right, but I thought this supposed to be like it so I left it on my face and bared w/ the burning feel until the mud got dry completely, after I washed it off, my face was so red, and hurt, and my acne prone skin did not get improved at all, the 2nd time experience was the same as well, after that, I stop using is, it&#x27;s a waste of a money.</li>
            <li> I use this before bed and in the mornings. Depending on your skin sensitivity you may only want to use at bed or in the morning. You only need a little bit and it will most definitely go a long way. Made my skin feel and look great!</li>
            <li> I like the burn it gives me making it known it really is working hard</li>
            <li> product seems to work fine and i would purchase again. you can feel the product penetrating pores when in use</li>
