            <li>I smelled it at a perfume shop one day and fell in love.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this fragrance many times.</li>
            <li>in my opinion this one smells better&amp;#34; its very light, fresh and clean its like fresh out the shower delicious!!</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite scents, very light and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>I love fine fragrance.</li>
            <li>honestly, I felt like I had to put on a ton of this on to get a good overall scent without overwhelming me or my colleagues.  </li>
            <li>but it can be a bit too strong</li>
            <li>and it is ALWAYS delivered quickly in secured packaging!</li>
            <li>Very crisp and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I really love this scent I had bought this originally at the mall and paid a pretty penny for it, when I saw it online and a better price,</li>
            <li>It gives you Fresh Fragrance like you get after taking shower :)</li>
            <li>Fresh scent, LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>so fresh and lovely</li>
            <li>wear this occasionally - primarily around the house after a shower.  </li>
            <li>Like the fragrance,  slightly sweet and not too strong.  </li>
            <li>this was my new FAVORITE!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I get many compliments and have yet to find anyone else wearing the same perfume, which is nice</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this perfume at a perfume shop at the mall and absolutely fell in love.</li>
            <li>Love the scent so much I&#x27;m going to purchase again and again from amazon...</li>
            <li>When I am ready to buy more, I will purchase it here.</li>
            <li>This scent is sure to be loved by most, if you like subtle, non-floral, non musk scents.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean and fresh smell.</li>
            <li>so if your in to clean fresh smells not overpowering</li>
            <li>, I prefer the more light soft scents.</li>
            <li>and how quickly I received it.</li>
            <li>Even my daughter (adult) commented how much she liked it</li>
            <li>The aroma is strong with its blend of woods, I like to use it mainly during the day</li>
            <li>stuff is pretty cool...</li>
            <li>It is just such a clean refreshing smell.  </li>
            <li>I will buy this over &amp; over and the price is right.</li>
            <li>but if you looking for the one with cheap price and smells decent you can go for this.</li>
            <li>And this is from someone who is very sensitive to scents and despises strong, soaking scents that smell up an office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My new favorite scent spicy and woodsy absolutely intoxicating</li>
            <li>It stays on for a few hours and is pleasant for anytime wear.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast and it was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Now Izzy is my second favorite.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t want to smell like everyone else;)</li>
            <li>Love this Fragrance and you cannot beat the low price!</li>
            <li>She puts this on first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the general comments are true.</li>
            <li>I was at a perfume store and I was purchasing acqua di gioia (which I really like) and he suggested that I try this instead.</li>
            <li>Light and airy, not a total assault on the senses.  </li>
            <li>it smells just like the dolce &amp; gabbana light blue &amp;#34;which</li>
            <li>This is such a light, airy, pleasing fragrance.  </li>
            <li>initially bought this fragrance in a perfume shop and paid far more than I did here.</li>
            <li>also not very expensive.</li>
            <li>I love it and could use it exclusively although I have tons of other colognes and perfumes.</li>
            <li>I only wear clean scents.</li>
            <li>This scent is similar (in some ways) to the light, subtle allure appeal of a Caroline Herrera 212 Sexy (with less of some of the top floral notes).</li>
            <li>just refresh with a few more sprays...</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever throw it to the side for what&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li>I live this one.</li>
            <li>but since I live about 100 miles from the city I checked amazon to see if they carry it; not only was it available but about one third the price!</li>
            <li>I told the sales person the fragrance I usually wear and based on that he gave me a sample of Beaute D&#x27;Orient….I instantly fell in LOVE!</li>
            <li>and it just feels very very light - almost like half the bottle was mixed with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a very light fragrance and hard to find.</li>
            <li>so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for less than half the price of what I normally pay for it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not a heavy scent like a Chanel scent, however, I do find that it has staying power.</li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance USE to be Issey Miyake for at least 15 years until I smelled Beaute D&#x27;Orient in 2007.</li>
            <li>That said, I was astonished and pleasantly surprised when people commented whenever I wore the perfume.</li>
            <li>By early afternoon, its like I never put this on.  </li>
            <li>My first bottle is almost empty now and I&#x27;ll be reordering soon.</li>
            <li>I usually use higher end fragrances with a respective higher price tag.</li>
            <li>Came on time &amp; it&#x27;s exactly what I expected !</li>
            <li>so be careful not to spray on too much.</li>
            <li>If you guys are looking for a soft, sensual scent for your woman, this is definitely it!</li>
            <li>This perfume is a much subtle fragrance of Dolce and Gabana Light Blue.</li>
            <li>But the scent is not long lasting.</li>

            <li> If you guys are looking for a soft, sensual scent for your woman, this is definitely it!</li>
            <li> This perfume is a much subtle fragrance of Dolce and Gabana Light Blue.</li>
            <li> But the scent is not long lasting.</li>
            <li> The smell does not last long</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last a long time but</li>
            <li> Obviously some of the scent longevity is different per person, but this is widely due to the hormonal variance of the wearer.</li>
            <li> Although the fragrance doesn&#x27;t stay for long, but who cares&lt;br /&gt;husband</li>
            <li> it would last a little bit longer then a few hours.</li>
            <li> Just a little should do the trick.</li>
            <li> It fades after just a few hours tops unless you keep reapplying.</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for a few years now, since they recommended it.</li>
            <li> While it is described on some sites as woody, floral, amber, etc -- those notes are not grand</li>

            <li> I like this perfume but it can be a bit too strong so be careful not to spray on too much. Just a little should do the trick. More of a day perfume.</li>
            <li> Beaute d&#x27;Orient is at the top two of my fragrances.  I love it and could use it exclusively although I have tons of other colognes and perfumes.</li>
            <li> I always get complimented on this fragrance -- men/women -- doesn&#x27;t matter. This scent is similar (in some ways) to the light, subtle allure appeal of a Caroline Herrera 212 Sexy (with less of some of the top floral notes). I&#x27;ve read a lot of comments about it not having lasting power. It is similar in distinction (that is, recognizeable) like the Lacoste Pour Femme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a heavy scent like a Chanel scent, however, I do find that it has staying power. Obviously some of the scent longevity is different per person, but this is widely due to the hormonal variance of the wearer. Not every scent will react to each person the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the general comments are true. This scent is sure to be loved by most, if you like subtle, non-floral, non musk scents. While it is described on some sites as woody, floral, amber, etc -- those notes are not grand overtones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that this review helps you understand this great perfume. It&#x27;s a staple of mine and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever throw it to the side for what&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li> Great product, this was a gift.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance USE to be Issey Miyake for at least 15 years until I smelled Beaute D&#x27;Orient in 2007. Now Izzy is my second favorite. I went into a perfume store with my daughter to browse. I told the sales person the fragrance I usually wear and based on that he gave me a sample of Beaute D&#x27;Orient….I instantly fell in LOVE! I did not have to smell it twice to know this was my new FAVORITE! Now I order it on Amazon.com and it is ALWAYS delivered quickly in secured packaging!</li>
            <li> initially bought this fragrance in a perfume shop and paid far more than I did here. I usually use higher end fragrances with a respective higher price tag. That said, I was astonished and pleasantly surprised when people commented whenever I wore the perfume. Even my daughter (adult) commented how much she liked it and it is always on her request for birthday presents. Very pleasant and refined, nonobtrusive.</li>
            <li> This perfume I like it because its scent stays all day. also not very expensive. The aroma is strong with its blend of woods, I like to use it mainly during the day</li>
            <li> This perfume is a much subtle fragrance of Dolce and Gabana Light Blue. I like this one much better. Not overpowering.</li>
            <li> The smell does not last long but it smells great.  It requires a lot on to get the full appreciation of the wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Smells phenomenal. Great price too.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this perfume at a perfume shop at the mall and absolutely fell in love. I got the sampler vial but since I live about 100 miles from the city I checked amazon to see if they carry it; not only was it available but about one third the price! My first bottle is almost empty now and I&#x27;ll be reordering soon. I get many compliments and have yet to find anyone else wearing the same perfume, which is nice, I don&#x27;t want to smell like everyone else;)</li>
            <li> Came on time &amp; it&#x27;s exactly what I expected !</li>
            <li> Smells even better then I remember!!&lt;br /&gt;😄👏👍</li>
            <li> My new favorite scent spicy and woodsy absolutely intoxicating</li>
            <li> My husband Loves it. It gives you Fresh Fragrance like you get after taking shower :)&lt;br /&gt;you can skip taking shower :) for the Price its a good buy. Although the fragrance doesn&#x27;t stay for long, but who cares&lt;br /&gt;husband will complement atleast once a day :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t say this is the best perfume but if you looking for the one with cheap price and smells decent you can go for this. Will not dissappoint you for sure.</li>
            <li> Love this Fragrance and you cannot beat the low price! If I purchase this locally, it goes for $40-$60. This is an awesome deal!</li>
            <li> Like the fragrance,  slightly sweet and not too strong.  But the scent is not long lasting.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. It is a very light fragrance and hard to find. I get alot of complimets on this.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this perfume it&#x27;s lite and smells so good. It doesn&#x27;t last a long time but that&#x27;s ok just refresh with a few more sprays...</li>
            <li> This is another one of y favorites here. I would also reccomeend this to any one of my friends. I love fine fragrance. If anyone buy  me anything try these for my choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mad that I paid around 60$ in the perfume store for this! Love the scent so much I&#x27;m going to purchase again and again from amazon... Trust me 20$ is a steal!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents, very light and clean smelling. Just wish it had longer staying power. It fades after just a few hours tops unless you keep reapplying.</li>
            <li> This is a great fragrance for every day.  Not too overpowering and always gets complimented by both women &amp; men. Love it!  I will buy this over &amp; over and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Beautiful  scent and bottle</li>
            <li> Love the perfume! It&#x27;s a clean and fresh smell. I always get compliments on it. I have been using this perfume for a few years now, since they recommended it. I don&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> Fresh scent, LOVE IT. so fresh and lovely it&#x27;s inspiring to make you want to look better than ever!</li>
            <li> This is one of my wife&#x27;s favorite scent so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for less than half the price of what I normally pay for it! If you guys are looking for a soft, sensual scent for your woman, this is definitely it!</li>
            <li> This is one if my Wife&#x27;s favorite scent.  She puts this on first thing in the morning.  I live this one.</li>
            <li> I only wear clean scents. I don&#x27;t like girly-girl scents, I prefer the more light soft scents. I was at a perfume store and I was purchasing acqua di gioia (which I really like) and he suggested that I try this instead. I loved it.....and I paid $59.00 for 10 oz. When I am ready to buy more, I will purchase it here. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really love this perfume.  It is just such a clean refreshing smell.  Light and airy, not a total assault on the senses.  It lasts all day and I get compliments all the time.  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. And the best price. I have bought about 12 bottles since 2012.. for gifts and myself</li>
            <li> Very crisp and refreshing. Definitely a good perfume for daytime. The price is unbeatable!&lt;br /&gt;Wish it would last a little bit longer then a few hours.</li>
            <li> this has to be one of the best smelling perfumes I have ever worn!!! every day I get at least 1-3 compliments... even tho it smells just like the dolce &amp; gabbana light blue &amp;#34;which in my opinion this one smells better&amp;#34; its very light, fresh and clean its like fresh out the shower delicious!! and the price is great!! so if your in to clean fresh smells not overpowering this is the one for you trust me you wont regret it</li>
            <li> One of my favorites!!!</li>
            <li> stuff is pretty cool...</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this perfume! I smelled it at a perfume shop one day and fell in love. It was $60 there though. This is a great deal. Shipping was super fast and it was exactly what I ordered. It has a very sexy alluring smell to it</li>
            <li> I love it!!! I bought four bottles to give out as Mother&#x27;s Day gifts to my faly and friends.  Exellent fragance.  Excellent price too.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Much less expensive than in the stores. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I really love this scent I had bought this originally at the mall and paid a pretty penny for it, when I saw it online and a better price, I coudn&#x27;t pass it up.  I am very pleased with this product!!!!! and how quickly I received it.</li>
            <li> This is such a light, airy, pleasing fragrance.  It isn&#x27;t overwhelming at all; and has a wonderful clean smell.  Recommended as a great gift to any girl who loves clean smells without the potent stank some parfumes have!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this fragrance many times. It stays on for a few hours and is pleasant for anytime wear.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest - I received a scent paper sample of this while shopping at one of the Premier outlets in PA and loved how it smelled.  The markups on the perfumes at those outlet stores are ridiculous so I thought to find this scent online.  I was happy to find a nice size bottle for an attractive price - I was looking forward to receiving this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got it, I planned to wear it the following day to work and honestly, I felt like I had to put on a ton of this on to get a good overall scent without overwhelming me or my colleagues.  By early afternoon, its like I never put this on.  I can&#x27;t put my finger on it but it did not last at all and it just feels very very light - almost like half the bottle was mixed with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear this occasionally - primarily around the house after a shower.  Its a pleasant scent but just too light and non-lasting for my taste.  And this is from someone who is very sensitive to scents and despises strong, soaking scents that smell up an office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it three stars for the price (great price), the look of the bottle and the quick receipt of the order.</li>
