            <li>I have tried many eye products in my lifetime.</li>

            <li>and I don&#x27;t love it any more.</li>
            <li>Love this for a nighttime eye cream.  </li>
            <li>This has to be one of the most stickiest eye balm/cream I&#x27;ve used...</li>
            <li>sometimes it seems like it creates more bags because it so sticky..</li>
            <li>I am in love with this very rich and emollient eye cream.</li>
            <li>I am sooo happy and surprised to find them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It is a huge help in the war against crepe eyes.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a HUGE fan and it was $93...</li>
            <li>but overall happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super emollient and reduced the fine lines around my eyes after about 3 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Works great, lasts a LONG time.</li>
            <li>The skin is also so soft and smooth!!</li>
            <li>Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>It feels fantastic, I&#x27;m already beginning to see, feel a difference, the sensitive skin around the eye feels a lot more tighter, throughout the day &amp; night.</li>
            <li>It was my number one product to recommend to people, but it has fallen down the line greatly.</li>
            <li>and it really make a difference to the texture of the fine lines under your eyes...</li>
            <li>It has an amazing colour and texture, although you must use it very very sparingly as it is a big like vaseline.  </li>
            <li>It was like it filled in this one fine line I obsess over (haha) by the next morning.  </li>
            <li>Love it on the upper eye lid.  </li>
            <li>my first use, I was like...</li>
            <li>for those of saying it is sticky, you are using way way way to much.  </li>
            <li>Very creamy and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cool-looking.</li>
            <li>I have ben using it for about 6 weeks now and certainly will continue to use this eye cream (as well as their other products which I love).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other eye products over the years but nothing has topped this.</li>
            <li>I find it does irritate my eyes more than other products</li>
            <li>they just aren&#x27;t that beneficial, COSMEDIX eye crystals provides visual benefits right away!</li>
            <li>A small amt is suffiecient as it has a bit of a greasy texture going on but nicely blends into the skin.</li>
            <li>But - I don&#x27;t have to put concealer under there any more because the dark circles are all but gone!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>(not sure how make up would sit on the top).  </li>
            <li>It does take a little getting used too but the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is sticky, sometimes i mix it with natural Jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;Works around mouth and eyes.  </li>
            <li>When you put it on it does create a slight colour under your eyes (green or purple depending on the light) and really shines, hence I do not use this when I am going out</li>

            <li> My \\&quot;dermatologist\\&quot; (AKA... cosmetic aestethician) suggested this for use under my eyes because I have a problem with crinkly skin - even though I am in my very early thirties - and a big problem with dark circles - which, I think is hereditary AND is caused by never sleeping.</li>
            <li> It is very, very sticky, like a thick Karo syrup.</li>
            <li> THIS one is what I can not do without!!!IT is a thick consistency providing more help for thin skin and wrinkles around the eyes and can even be used above lip line,and I use it between eyebrow furrows for extra help there!</li>
            <li> , I kept up with it - using that every night (in tiny amounts - you only need a LITTLE</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been sleeping any more than usual (unfortunately)</li>
            <li> I have gone back to this eye serum few times...</li>
            <li> This is not real Cosmedix.</li>
            <li> After you learn to use the pump (press down only slightly, about a 1/4 pump)</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;ll see a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Requires very little product to be used so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> hands down</li>
            <li> It can be expensive, but you only use a tiny drop.</li>
            <li> I could tell a subtle difference the next day.  </li>
            <li> It is very heavy and thick so use only at night.</li>
            <li> just a very small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Too heavy for daytime use for my tastes.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles are basically non-existent now!!</li>
            <li> I went from not leaving the house without makeup to wearing very little makeup after I started using these products.</li>
            <li> I use a small drop divided between both eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed as I had high hopes for this product, but I did not see any results despite repeated use.</li>
            <li> which sucks beyond reason...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> The texture is very thick and glossy.</li>
            <li> Frustrating.  </li>
            <li> This is fake.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SO expensive :(</li>
            <li> whoa... this stuff is CRAZY looking!</li>
            <li> I have to shake the bottle to get some product on the base of the pump, unscrew the cap and wipe the product from the base of the pump.  </li>
            <li> And they were VERY bad!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Where have you been all my life? This eye cream is so awesome...</li>
            <li> It feels fantastic, I&#x27;m already beginning to see, feel a difference, the sensitive skin around the eye feels a lot more tighter, throughout the day &amp; night. It has a beautiful colour to it as well. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have gone back to this eye serum few times...I try something new but it never works...this serum does give your eye area a shine but it goes away...</li>
            <li> This is not real Cosmedix. This is fake. STAY AWAY</li>
            <li> this product is a knock off.  i have used this product for years and it is the most amazing eye cream ever invented.  for those of saying it is sticky, you are using way way way to much.  a bottle lasts me 8 to 9 months and i use it am and pm.  the product from this seller however is NOT CosMedix Opti-Crystal.  Stay away unless you like being deceived and ripped off.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is beautiful. It has an amazing colour and texture, although you must use it very very sparingly as it is a big like vaseline.  When you put it on it does create a slight colour under your eyes (green or purple depending on the light) and really shines, hence I do not use this when I am going out (not sure how make up would sit on the top).  I use it when staying at home and every night and it really make a difference to the texture of the fine lines under your eyes... yes it actually appears to minimise them. Only eye cream I have tried, which has been sooo many, that actually appears to work. I have ben using it for about 6 weeks now and certainly will continue to use this eye cream (as well as their other products which I love).</li>
            <li> I am in love with this very rich and emollient eye cream. I can always trust Cosmedix  to create the most effective and top of the line products. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream ever! It&#x27;s super emollient and reduced the fine lines around my eyes after about 3 weeks of use. This is one of the only beauty products I continue to purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye treatment! I will always use this!</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye products in my lifetime. I believe this one us the best ever. It can be expensive, but you only use a tiny drop. The texture is very thick and glossy. It does take a little getting used too but the results are fantastic. I will never use another type.</li>
            <li> After you learn to use the pump (press down only slightly, about a 1/4 pump), you&#x27;ll see a little goes a long way.  patting it on and not rubbing it in works best.  Love it on the upper eye lid.  But here&#x27;s a GREAT TRICK:  IT&#x27;S AWESOME ON THE LIPS.  After putting on eyes, rub finger over lips.</li>
            <li> A product I have used for over 10 years. It is a huge help in the war against crepe eyes.</li>
            <li> This Product definitely works and makes lines disappear.  It is sticky, sometimes i mix it with natural Jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;Works around mouth and eyes.  Still waiting for results on my neck.</li>
            <li> amazing product, visible results and faster results if use of estetitian!</li>
            <li> After trying almost all themajor brands of eye repair cremes-Kinerace, clayton shagal, Vivite,Obagi- you name it- hands down THIS one is what I can not do without!!!IT is a thick consistency providing more help for thin skin and wrinkles around the eyes and can even be used above lip line,and I use it between eyebrow furrows for extra help there! A small amt is suffiecient as it has a bit of a greasy texture going on but nicely blends into the skin. AMAZING! Most eye creams you DO NOT re buy b/c they just aren&#x27;t that beneficial, COSMEDIX eye crystals provides visual benefits right away! I have used for yrs. Now and never have found Anything close to this!!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. I&#x27;ve tried many other eye products over the years but nothing has topped this.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  I use a small drop divided between both eyes.  Very creamy and moisturizing.  I love Cosmedix products!! I am sooo happy and surprised to find them on Amazon.  I went from not leaving the house without makeup to wearing very little makeup after I started using these products.</li>
            <li> They have changed this product with the change in the company and I don&#x27;t love it any more. It was my number one product to recommend to people, but it has fallen down the line greatly. I am looking for a new product to replace this one.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best under-eye serum I&#x27;ve used!  It&#x27;s thick so it&#x27;s definitely a night time product but it&#x27;s awesome! I could tell a subtle difference the next day.  It was like it filled in this one fine line I obsess over (haha) by the next morning.  Now that I&#x27;ve used it a couple months I can definitely see a difference!</li>
            <li> I am veru please with the Cosmedix Opti Crystal . This product was indicate by a friend and I am very happy wiht it</li>
            <li> Do not like this item at all. It is very, very sticky, like a thick Karo syrup. No absorption so I cannot see the value of using it.</li>
            <li> This did not do anything for me. It is goopy and sticky and reminds me of the stuff that is put in newborns eyes when they are born. I&#x27;m disappointed as I had high hopes for this product, but I did not see any results despite repeated use.</li>
            <li> Love this for a nighttime eye cream.  This one doesn&#x27;t seem chemically at all and just a very small amount goes a long way.  Too heavy for daytime use for my tastes.  10/24/15 Updated changing from 4 stars to 3 stars, again, the packaging/pump/dispenser, broke.  Stopped pumping.  I have to shake the bottle to get some product on the base of the pump, unscrew the cap and wipe the product from the base of the pump.  Frustrating.  Please, Cosmedix, put your products in bottles with pumps that work.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product. I saw results in about 4 weeks. It is not a miricle product but you do get results. Requires very little product to be used so it lasts a long time. It is very heavy and thick so use only at night. I would not recommend for someone with acne. I find it does irritate my eyes more than other products but overall happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for several weeks &amp; I don&#x27;t see any difference in my eye area. I would not purchase this item again</li>
            <li> My \\&quot;dermatologist\\&quot; (AKA... cosmetic aestethician) suggested this for use under my eyes because I have a problem with crinkly skin - even though I am in my very early thirties - and a big problem with dark circles - which, I think is hereditary AND is caused by never sleeping. Oops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I never had anything help. I even tried those things that electrocute you while you smear that \\&quot;serum\\&quot; around!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon my first use, I was like... whoa... this stuff is CRAZY looking! It&#x27;s really cool-looking. Extra-terrestrial... I thought it was too greasy. I definitely could not use it during the day. I wasn&#x27;t a HUGE fan and it was $93...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I kept up with it - using that every night (in tiny amounts - you only need a LITTLE and that helps with the greasy factor) and I use something else during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been a Godsend!! I am so impressed with it!! My dark circles are basically non-existent now!! And they were VERY bad!! I haven&#x27;t been sleeping any more than usual (unfortunately) so it has to be this stuff!! The skin is also so soft and smooth!! It helps when I wear makeup on my skin around my eyes - it looks so much better! But - I don&#x27;t have to put concealer under there any more because the dark circles are all but gone!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought more!! It&#x27;s SO expensive :( which sucks beyond reason... but, honestly, I scrape together whatever I can to try to afford it because it is SO EFFECTIVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get some!! You won&#x27;t be sorry :)</li>
            <li> Works great, lasts a LONG time.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the most stickiest eye balm/cream I&#x27;ve used... sometimes it seems like it creates more bags because it so sticky.. I think the trick to this , is put it on and give it time to soak in before going to bed. You cant use during day as it has a vasoline type texture and doesnt work well under makeup.</li>
    </ol>
