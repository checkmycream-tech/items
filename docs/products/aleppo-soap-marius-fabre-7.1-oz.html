            <li>The texture and feel of the soap itself is nice</li>
            <li>this price, the soap should be really, really spectacular quality.</li>
            <li>will say that there truly is none nicer, and it did wonderful things for my skin - and was more pleasant to smell than the Marseille, and left a slightly more pleasant</li>
            <li>My skin seems much softer with incredibly even tone.  </li>
            <li>I discovered aleppo soap in a most amusing way - via the \\&quot;How to Archer\\&quot; book.  </li>
            <li>I can only tell you that I have been really impressed by how nicely this product has worked on my skin.    </li>
            <li>and I was able to cut it into three separate pieces.</li>
            <li>and It&#x27;s never looked better.</li>
            <li>and I like it a lot better than shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for no plastic at all, but this is still much better for the environment than shaving cream cans.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>So glad I discovered it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I wish he came in smaller bars that would be perfect.</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t leave water in a soap dish.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I love Savon D&#x27;Alep.</li>
            <li>This soap has palm oil and many more</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend--and if you are able to use this for everything, it&#x27;s a great money-saver!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better than [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is incredibly vintage and classy looking (see pics)</li>
            <li>It gets one nice and clean, but what I didn&#x27;t like about</li>
            <li>The high olive and laurel oil contents are great for the skin.</li>
            <li>It really is that good, and my skin/hair had never felt better.</li>
            <li>but it works great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I love this soap, so much that I ordered three more bars!</li>
            <li>it was certainly fine.</li>
            <li>I like it very much !!</li>
            <li>The only thing is it is not as close of a shave, but still looks great.</li>
            <li>how well I enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li>This is a great facial soap.</li>
            <li>Also, it smells great, OK -- it&#x27;s not a high end cologne when you stick your nose to it, but it smells clean and as an added benefit it ends up fragrancing your bathroom even just sitting in a soap</li>
            <li>THANKS!!!</li>
            <li>particular soap is really nice quality .&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great choice for those of you who would like to go more natural and no waste.</li>
            <li>The higher the percentage of laurel oil, the better the soap.</li>
            <li>After my first use, my skin looked better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty certain that sodium palmitate is derived from palm oil, and that kind of oil should not be in this soap in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I have received as gift from Japan first, this time i give same soap to my firend, she is so happy.</li>
            <li>But after rinsing off, I can&#x27;t smell any trace of it, and my husband hasn&#x27;t complained...which I think is the true test.</li>
            <li>and if they are true to Aleppo soap or not.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this ingredient list means it&#x27;s &#x27;true&#x27; aleppo soap or not.  </li>
            <li>Nice soap for a natural solution.</li>
            <li>Even though this soap is made in France, for me it is superior to the one actually made in Syria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you use it though; the smell dissipates quickly from your skin.  </li>
            <li>Feeling and being clean while using products that are natural is very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast service!!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty agressive!  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing magical or exciting or new about this.</li>
            <li>At first, I was worried it might be stripping my skin because it literally gives you a &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27; feeling after use.  </li>
            <li>It is a very good olive oil soap, I have purchased similar from Greece and this feels the same.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the smell of old paint cans when you take the lid off and the oil has separated to the top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great soap, and a little vintage!</li>
            <li>It is very soft and keep the skin moist after shower.&lt;br /&gt;The soap easily melt.  </li>
            <li>I believe it is important to only use the finest products on your body and this soap is most certainly it.</li>
            <li>soap is very large and is cut into cubes</li>
            <li>I love this soap,fragrance free and very moisturizing!I&#x27;ve actually been washing my hair with this for about 3 weeks</li>
            <li>this price, the bar is about twice what it sells for in Paris, but cost is always higher when you buy something rare for your area.</li>
            <li>Given that the book was surprisingly accurate in many other ways, I decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bar is rather large, which has taken a bit of practice to handle, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty impress with the quality of the soap.  </li>
            <li>First bought this soap in support of Syria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second</li>
            <li>Also it leave your skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Save the airfare and get that French smell, feel and clean rinse from this great hard to find soap.</li>
            <li>Still lasting strong.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a lot of lather when you use it, but it still spreads out over a large area.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a large brick of soap and could be cut into two pieces to make it easier to grab hold of.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little amazed, honestly.    </li>
            <li>I am told by the importer this is real Aleppo soap from Syria, so I have updated my review.</li>
            <li>It does have an unusual smell.  </li>
            <li>It has a very \\&quot;natural\\&quot; smell to it.  </li>
            <li>There is no need to worry about smelling weird/bad to someone you get very close with.  </li>
            <li>Over all I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It gently cleans my skin and leaves me feeling refreshed and ready to get dressed and go.</li>
            <li>had it been available last week.  </li>
            <li>Clearly this list is in French, as is most of the label.  </li>
            <li>Results have been so positive that I hIghly recommend the Savon d&#x27;Alep.</li>
            <li>It is nice and slick and really allows me to get a close shave without razor burn.</li>
            <li>This soap is lovely, large and firm.</li>
            <li>I always moisturize with a light cream after washing, but even before I put it on, my face does not feel overly dry.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my body and my face (occasionally) and people rave about how soft and smooth my skin is.</li>
            <li>only cons with alepo soaps in general is the strong smell.</li>
            <li>Great soap but expensive.</li>
            <li>I will say it doesnt melt away like normal soaps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money definitely.</li>
            <li>It seems drier than before I had used it, and I don&#x27;t know if that is normal.  </li>
            <li>I live it</li>
            <li>The scent is very natural and earthy as well.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin and this soap agrees with my skin type.</li>
            <li>My face and neck are clear of zits!</li>
            <li>This bar of soap is really large compared to normal American bars of soap</li>
            <li>That being said, I have spent more on other face cleaners so I can&#x27;t complain too much.  </li>
            <li>It was fine for a few days on my hair but after a while my hair was matted and yucky.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean, but not stripped down.</li>
            <li>My skin no longer looks dull and its tone is more even.</li>
            <li>Had the bar two months now, and I&#x27;m surprised</li>
            <li>Soft to the skin.</li>
            <li>Looking up this reference, I learned about the old tradition of using olive oil used in Aleppo soap, marseille soap, and Castile soap.</li>
            <li>Early on, I wanted to stop using it because it smells like hay/</li>
            <li>It smells natural... ;</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t justify buying nothing but this, and I did a direct comparison to the also olive oil based Marseille soap...  </li>
            <li>Since it doesn&#x27;t have a perfume scent, it&#x27;s equally useful for either male or female users in the house.  </li>
            <li>Only after many weeks are we into the green of the soap.  </li>
            <li>dish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from dry skin and eczema which is how I got into trying this soap in the first place</li>
            <li>They last so long it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I like to keep my personal hygiene routine pretty simple.</li>
            <li>- this is my main concern when selecting a facial product.</li>
            <li>It seems as though it will last a lot longer than a normal bar of soap.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very soft and much healthier than any other I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>you are the type of person that likes to scrub themselves clean in the shower and you can get past the smell of hay, get this soap.</li>
            <li>main reason I bought this soap was to see if it will help my acne prone skin, especially the acne on my back and chest.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the bar for about a month already and barely looks used.</li>
            <li>I started using this soap after a French friend recommended it for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I live in a climate that is very dry and this soap is not harsh or stripping at all.</li>
            <li>Intrigued, I wanted to try all of these soaps for comparison and decided to start with the Aleppo first since its the oldest and the forebear to the other two, and the only one to also include laurel oil in its ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried looking up some of the other ingredients that are said to be in my soap, but I didn&#x27;t have much luck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some shampoos are just too harsh or drying for me or cause flaking,even those made for dry scalp, but now my scalp is so clean and it doesn&#x27;t itch.</li>
            <li>I tried this product, mainly on the recommendations from other reviewers.  </li>

            <li> Even though this soap is made in France, for me it is superior to the one actually made in Syria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you use it though; the smell dissipates quickly from your skin.  </li>
            <li> Feeling and being clean while using products that are natural is very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast service!!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty agressive!  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing magical or exciting or new about this.</li>
            <li> At first, I was worried it might be stripping my skin because it literally gives you a &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27; feeling after use.  </li>
            <li> It is a very good olive oil soap, I have purchased similar from Greece and this feels the same.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of the smell of old paint cans when you take the lid off and the oil has separated to the top.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great soap, and a little vintage!</li>
            <li> It is very soft and keep the skin moist after shower.&lt;br /&gt;The soap easily melt.  </li>
            <li> I believe it is important to only use the finest products on your body and this soap is most certainly it.</li>
            <li> soap is very large and is cut into cubes</li>
            <li> I love this soap,fragrance free and very moisturizing!I&#x27;ve actually been washing my hair with this for about 3 weeks</li>
            <li> this price, the bar is about twice what it sells for in Paris, but cost is always higher when you buy something rare for your area.</li>
            <li> Given that the book was surprisingly accurate in many other ways, I decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bar is rather large, which has taken a bit of practice to handle, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty impress with the quality of the soap.  </li>
            <li> First bought this soap in support of Syria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second</li>
            <li> Also it leave your skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Save the airfare and get that French smell, feel and clean rinse from this great hard to find soap.</li>
            <li> Still lasting strong.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a lot of lather when you use it, but it still spreads out over a large area.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a large brick of soap and could be cut into two pieces to make it easier to grab hold of.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little amazed, honestly.    </li>
            <li> I am told by the importer this is real Aleppo soap from Syria, so I have updated my review.</li>
            <li> It does have an unusual smell.  </li>
            <li> It has a very \\&quot;natural\\&quot; smell to it.  </li>
            <li> There is no need to worry about smelling weird/bad to someone you get very close with.  </li>
            <li> Over all I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It gently cleans my skin and leaves me feeling refreshed and ready to get dressed and go.</li>
            <li> had it been available last week.  </li>
            <li> Clearly this list is in French, as is most of the label.  </li>
            <li> Results have been so positive that I hIghly recommend the Savon d&#x27;Alep.</li>
            <li> It is nice and slick and really allows me to get a close shave without razor burn.</li>
            <li> This soap is lovely, large and firm.</li>
            <li> I always moisturize with a light cream after washing, but even before I put it on, my face does not feel overly dry.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my body and my face (occasionally) and people rave about how soft and smooth my skin is.</li>
            <li> only cons with alepo soaps in general is the strong smell.</li>
            <li> Great soap but expensive.</li>
            <li> I will say it doesnt melt away like normal soaps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money definitely.</li>
            <li> It seems drier than before I had used it, and I don&#x27;t know if that is normal.  </li>
            <li> I live it</li>
            <li> The scent is very natural and earthy as well.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin and this soap agrees with my skin type.</li>
            <li> My face and neck are clear of zits!</li>
            <li> This bar of soap is really large compared to normal American bars of soap</li>
            <li> That being said, I have spent more on other face cleaners so I can&#x27;t complain too much.  </li>
            <li> It was fine for a few days on my hair but after a while my hair was matted and yucky.</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean, but not stripped down.</li>
            <li> My skin no longer looks dull and its tone is more even.</li>
            <li> Had the bar two months now, and I&#x27;m surprised</li>
            <li> Soft to the skin.</li>
            <li> Looking up this reference, I learned about the old tradition of using olive oil used in Aleppo soap, marseille soap, and Castile soap.</li>
            <li> Early on, I wanted to stop using it because it smells like hay/</li>
            <li> It smells natural... ;</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t justify buying nothing but this, and I did a direct comparison to the also olive oil based Marseille soap...  </li>
            <li> Since it doesn&#x27;t have a perfume scent, it&#x27;s equally useful for either male or female users in the house.  </li>
            <li> Only after many weeks are we into the green of the soap.  </li>
            <li> dish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from dry skin and eczema which is how I got into trying this soap in the first place</li>
            <li> They last so long it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I like to keep my personal hygiene routine pretty simple.</li>
            <li> - this is my main concern when selecting a facial product.</li>
            <li> It seems as though it will last a lot longer than a normal bar of soap.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very soft and much healthier than any other I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> you are the type of person that likes to scrub themselves clean in the shower and you can get past the smell of hay, get this soap.</li>
            <li> main reason I bought this soap was to see if it will help my acne prone skin, especially the acne on my back and chest.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the bar for about a month already and barely looks used.</li>
            <li> I started using this soap after a French friend recommended it for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I live in a climate that is very dry and this soap is not harsh or stripping at all.</li>
            <li> Intrigued, I wanted to try all of these soaps for comparison and decided to start with the Aleppo first since its the oldest and the forebear to the other two, and the only one to also include laurel oil in its ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried looking up some of the other ingredients that are said to be in my soap, but I didn&#x27;t have much luck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some shampoos are just too harsh or drying for me or cause flaking,even those made for dry scalp, but now my scalp is so clean and it doesn&#x27;t itch.</li>
            <li> I tried this product, mainly on the recommendations from other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> Give or take a couple other &#x27;natural&#x27; ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I will agree that the price is a little high.  </li>
            <li> so I had a hard time holding it at first.</li>
            <li> so it last a long time.</li>
            <li> It also will last a long time, verses shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This beats my old shampoo hands down.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark, curly, med thick for reference and my routine is simple :after washing my hair with this soap I towel dry and while still damp I rub a few drops of olive oil in my hands and apply to the ends of my hair,It&#x27;s that easy and my curls are silky and shiny!</li>
            <li> I skeptically shampooed with it, and it does leave hair squeaky clean, but I still use my same conditioner.</li>
            <li> The bar was a lot bigger than I expected</li>
            <li> The bar lasts a really long time.  </li>
            <li> Well the bar is made of old dried olive oil.</li>
            <li> I ended up just buying a small bottle of real shampoo after a few days in spite of the weight in my pack.</li>
            <li> However, when I received it, the bar was only half the size I&#x27;m used to, meaning the price just doubled again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product did exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> Every receive as expected.</li>
            <li> My skin never feels tight and dry after usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, it is odorless which is what I am suppose to use due to my arthritis.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m just used to the essential oils in my usual organic soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricier than the other soaps out there</li>
            <li> It should not read Aleppo if it has other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I think one bar will last me at least six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now I am scared that it may end up irritating my skin, which has not been clear in years.  </li>
            <li> Price-wise, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Then I blow dry and style my hair as usual.</li>
            <li> No longer do I get out of the shower and feel like my skin is tight.</li>
            <li> My skin is less dried out.</li>
            <li> Yes the smell takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with a little trepidation because there seems to be some question on the ingredients</li>
            <li> I was relieved to see a stamp on the soap, but I can&#x27;t make out any of the letters on it, which makes me a little suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to reduce the waste in your home, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Ive used this soap for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I wish it were a few dollars cheaper like its aleppo competitors.  </li>
            <li> you are curious about this soap, you owe it to yourself to try it at least once.  </li>
            <li> I badly needed a soap that wouldn&#x27;t dry out my face and wouldn&#x27;t aggravate my sensitive &amp; acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> No more buying liquid in plastic bottles every few months.  </li>
            <li> It is hard soap</li>
            <li> I did see a review that complained about that.  </li>
            <li> The articles I read suggested savons d&#x27;alep with at least 30% bay laurel oil for problem (eczema, etc.)</li>
            <li> and I have found this to be the least drying of Marseille (Olive Oil), Bronners and Aleppo (Olive + Bay Leaf Oil) soaps.</li>
            <li> No more soap for me!</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and use volumizing shampoo usually.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product approximately once a day for the past 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Has a weird green color to it as the time moves on</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to everyone who is tired of having to use lotion after every bath or shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not especially good or bad - it&#x27;s just soap.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, my worries were in vain.  </li>
            <li> It left me feeling sticky and squeaky and it hurt my eyes terribly.</li>
            <li> It has not helped my skin problems and it stinks like an automotive repair shop.</li>
            <li> but I cant get past the horrible stink.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I made a bad judgment by purchasing this soap.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am told by the importer this is real Aleppo soap from Syria, so I have updated my review. It is a very good olive oil soap, I have purchased similar from Greece and this feels the same.</li>
            <li> I am pretty impress with the quality of the soap.  It is hard soap so it last a long time.</li>
            <li> This soap works GREAT for shaving. My husband started to use it on his face and does not break out from it and it gives a nice shave. The only thing is it is not as close of a shave, but still looks great. It is made in France and is in the Sun the 9 months. It also will last a long time, verses shaving cream. This is a great choice for those of you who would like to go more natural and no waste. It&#x27;s a great soap, and a little vintage!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful olive oil and laurel soap.</li>
            <li> Fabulous soap!!! Fast service!! THANKS!!!</li>
            <li> I believe it is important to only use the finest products on your body and this soap is most certainly it.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap to take on the Camino de Santiago. Needed a multi-purpose bar that could work for hair, body and laundry. It was fine for a few days on my hair but after a while my hair was matted and yucky. It worked great as a shower soap and for hand laundry it was certainly fine. I ended up just buying a small bottle of real shampoo after a few days in spite of the weight in my pack.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing soap for my hair..  I live it</li>
            <li> Very happy with this soap</li>
            <li> Had the bar two months now, and I&#x27;m surprised how well I enjoy using it.  Since it doesn&#x27;t have a perfume scent, it&#x27;s equally useful for either male or female users in the house.  The bar is rather large, which has taken a bit of practice to handle, but it&#x27;s worth it.  Only after many weeks are we into the green of the soap.  Probably won&#x27;t need to purchase another bar of soap until the holiday season.</li>
            <li> No skin problems. Appears to moisturize. Excellent for shaving in the shower. No odor. Purchased for than once, including last purchase of 6 bars.</li>
            <li> I have received as gift from Japan first, this time i give same soap to my firend, she is so happy.</li>
            <li> This soap is very smooth and silky! The bar was a lot bigger than I expected and I was able to cut it into three separate pieces. The scent is very natural and earthy as well.</li>
            <li> Great soap but expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it!</li>
            <li> This product did exactly as I expected. It leaves my skin very soft and much healthier than any other I&#x27;ve used. No dryness since I began using it. It is not scented at all, but does not leave my skin with any kind of odor. I would recommend it to everyone who is tired of having to use lotion after every bath or shower. No need to with Aleppo</li>
            <li> I use the soap daily. I like it. My skin is less dried out. It lathers up nicely. I do not use it on my face.</li>
            <li> I love this soap,fragrance free and very moisturizing!I&#x27;ve actually been washing my hair with this for about 3 weeks and It&#x27;s never looked better.Some shampoos are just too harsh or drying for me or cause flaking,even those made for dry scalp, but now my scalp is so clean and it doesn&#x27;t itch.My hair is dark, curly, med thick for reference and my routine is simple :after washing my hair with this soap I towel dry and while still damp I rub a few drops of olive oil in my hands and apply to the ends of my hair,It&#x27;s that easy and my curls are silky and shiny!</li>
            <li> good cleaning produce use for morning</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and I like it a lot better than shaving cream. It is nice and slick and really allows me to get a close shave without razor burn. My husband loves it for his face too! If you&#x27;re trying to reduce the waste in your home, this is the product for you. It only comes with the paper sleeve and plastic shrinkwrap as packaging. I was hoping for no plastic at all, but this is still much better for the environment than shaving cream cans.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful soap.  I am going to purchase more!</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It produces a great lather and the tub rinses out easily when bathing.  So glad I discovered it on Amazon.  Also, it is odorless which is what I am suppose to use due to my arthritis.</li>
            <li> What a treat and I know it is so good for my skin. It feels wonderful! I wish he came in smaller bars that would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Not as moisturizing as I thought it would be.  The bar lasts a really long time.  2 weeks for me but I&#x27;m pretty agressive!  Just need something with a nicer scent.  I think I&#x27;m just used to the essential oils in my usual organic soap.</li>
            <li> I´ve been used alepo soap for years now, because i have  oily skin and this soap helps to control oil. also works good agains spots to help them dry.&lt;br /&gt;This particular soap is really nice quality .&lt;br /&gt;the only cons with alepo soaps in general is the strong smell.</li>
            <li> Nice smell. Soft to the skin. My face and neck are clear of zits! Really great product. My husband loves it too.</li>
            <li> Every receive as expected. Those soap are great for shaving, shower. They last so long it is worth the price. Also it leave your skin clean and soft. I like it very much !!</li>
            <li> wonderful product, love it</li>
            <li> I bought this soap, since my eczema irritates me.  It is very soft and keep the skin moist after shower.&lt;br /&gt;The soap easily melt.  Make sure you don&#x27;t leave water in a soap dish.  That is only reason I put 4 stars.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Still lasting strong. Has a weird green color to it as the time moves on but it works great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> First bought this soap in support of Syria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second one I bought was because it makes my skin feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also sent some as gifts for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, even my husband likes it!</li>
            <li> Ive used this soap for a few weeks now. It has not helped my skin problems and it stinks like an automotive repair shop. I will say it doesnt melt away like normal soaps. I will probably use it for my dog. The texture and feel of the soap itself is nice but I cant get past the horrible stink.</li>
            <li> I came by this soap after reading A Tree Grows in Brooklyn of all things and its brief mention of using fats to make soap. Looking up this reference, I learned about the old tradition of using olive oil used in Aleppo soap, marseille soap, and Castile soap. Intrigued, I wanted to try all of these soaps for comparison and decided to start with the Aleppo first since its the oldest and the forebear to the other two, and the only one to also include laurel oil in its ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it. Yes the smell takes a little getting used to. It reminds me of the smell of old paint cans when you take the lid off and the oil has separated to the top. Well the bar is made of old dried olive oil. But after rinsing off, I can&#x27;t smell any trace of it, and my husband hasn&#x27;t complained...which I think is the true test. I like that I&#x27;ve had the bar for about a month already and barely looks used. Now, the best part, and where I think this soap is like gold, is how wonderfully it works on hair! I skeptically shampooed with it, and it does leave hair squeaky clean, but I still use my same conditioner. Then I blow dry and style my hair as usual. It&#x27;s like the best hair day ever! My hair feels clean, but not stripped down. I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but its the greatest thing for your hair. I have thin hair and use volumizing shampoo usually. This beats my old shampoo hands down. Now I feel like I&#x27;m in one of those hair shampoo commercials with the silky bouncy hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> This product came as pictured.  I did see a review that complained about that.  It does have an unusual smell.  It has a very \\&quot;natural\\&quot; smell to it.  When you use it though; the smell dissipates quickly from your skin.  There is no need to worry about smelling weird/bad to someone you get very close with.  There isn&#x27;t a lot of lather when you use it, but it still spreads out over a large area.  This bar of soap is really large compared to normal American bars of soap and it is cut into a cube shape so it can be tricky to hold.  Over all I really like it.  It seems as though it will last a lot longer than a normal bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, so much that I ordered three more bars! It gently cleans my skin and leaves me feeling refreshed and ready to get dressed and go.</li>
            <li> Save the airfare and get that French smell, feel and clean rinse from this great hard to find soap. I am so hooked.</li>
            <li> It cleans well without over drying our skin. No longer do I get out of the shower and feel like my skin is tight. It&#x27;s pricier than the other soaps out there but the block does last awhile.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing magical or exciting or new about this. It&#x27;s just soap! It gets one nice and clean, but what I didn&#x27;t like about it was the residue it left in my shower. No more soap for me! Back to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap.</li>
            <li> I tried this product, mainly on the recommendations from other reviewers.  I badly needed a soap that wouldn&#x27;t dry out my face and wouldn&#x27;t aggravate my sensitive &amp; acne prone skin.  I ordered this product with a little trepidation because there seems to be some question on the ingredients and if they are true to Aleppo soap or not.  So here are my thoughts:    I have been using this product approximately once a day for the past 3 weeks.  At first, I was worried it might be stripping my skin because it literally gives you a &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27; feeling after use.  Needless to say, my worries were in vain.  I always moisturize with a light cream after washing, but even before I put it on, my face does not feel overly dry.  My skin seems much softer with incredibly even tone.  This product has also done wonders for clearing up those \\&quot;sniper pimples\\&quot; that tend to pop up on my face from time to time.  I&#x27;m a little amazed, honestly.    For those who want to know what ingredients are on the label, I can tell you that my label looks identical to the one pictured.  The ingredients are listed as follows, in order:  sodium oleate, sodium linoleate, sodium palmitate, aqua, sodium linolenate, olea europaea oil, unsaponifiables, sodium laurate, sodium myristate, sodium arachidate, sodium hydroxide, origine vegetale.  Clearly this list is in French, as is most of the label.  I don&#x27;t know if this ingredient list means it&#x27;s &#x27;true&#x27; aleppo soap or not.  I can only tell you that I have been really impressed by how nicely this product has worked on my skin.    I will agree that the price is a little high.  I wish it were a few dollars cheaper like its aleppo competitors.  That being said, I have spent more on other face cleaners so I can&#x27;t complain too much.  I will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I love Savon D&#x27;Alep. It was recommended to me by a friend in Paris as a cure for razor burn. To this day, it is the only soap or shaving cream that prevents razor burn for me. The high olive and laurel oil contents are great for the skin. The higher the percentage of laurel oil, the better the soap. This bar claims 12% laurel, which is about average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price, the bar is about twice what it sells for in Paris, but cost is always higher when you buy something rare for your area. However, when I received it, the bar was only half the size I&#x27;m used to, meaning the price just doubled again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price, the soap should be really, really spectacular quality. As it is, it&#x27;s just good.</li>
            <li> Nice soap for a natural solution. The fragrance is not the reason one would purchase this soup, but it is bearable.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very good after washing with this soap every time.  My son&#x27;s skin problem is lessen with this soap.  It&#x27;s worth the money definitely.</li>
            <li> My understanding of Aleppo soap is four ingredients.  Olive and Laurel oils, water and lye.  This soap has palm oil and many more items.&lt;br /&gt;I was disapointed and will be returning it to amazon. It should not read Aleppo if it has other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I like to keep my personal hygiene routine pretty simple. I am not sold on the creamy, gunky body washes that are supposed to moisturize my skin by leaving a protective layer of rubber. Feeling and being clean while using products that are natural is very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this soap is pretty darn awesome. Early on, I wanted to stop using it because it smells like hay/the farm... But, it works so well that I don&#x27;t care. It smells natural... ;p&lt;br /&gt;The soap is very large and is cut into cubes so I had a hard time holding it at first. I bought it in September of this year and there is still a lot of it left. I think one bar will last me at least six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and this soap agrees with my skin type. I use it on my body and my face (occasionally) and people rave about how soft and smooth my skin is. I live in a climate that is very dry and this soap is not harsh or stripping at all. My skin never feels tight and dry after usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are the type of person that likes to scrub themselves clean in the shower and you can get past the smell of hay, get this soap. It is really good stuff.</li>
            <li> I did NOT like this soap. It left me feeling sticky and squeaky and it hurt my eyes terribly.</li>
            <li> This soap is lovely, large and firm.</li>
            <li> I think I may regret ordering this product.  For one thing, the wrapper on the soap I received is not the same as what is displayed for the customers to view.  My soap does not even tell me what percent of bay laurel is in it, even if the percentage may be shown on the product&#x27;s page here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also found on several websites that there are only four basic ingredients to this soap.  Olive oil, bay laurel oil, sodium hydroxide, and water. Give or take a couple other &#x27;natural&#x27; ingredients.  But my package says that the ingredients are: sodium oleate, sodium linoleate, sodium palmitate, aqua, sodium linolenate, olea europaea oil unsaponifiables, sodium laurate, sodium myristate, sodium arachidate, and sodium hydroxide.  I don&#x27;t know if all of these ingredients are meant to be part of Aleppo soap.  I&#x27;m pretty certain that sodium palmitate is derived from palm oil, and that kind of oil should not be in this soap in my opinion.  I tried looking up some of the other ingredients that are said to be in my soap, but I didn&#x27;t have much luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason I bought this soap was to see if it will help my acne prone skin, especially the acne on my back and chest.  Now I am scared that it may end up irritating my skin, which has not been clear in years.  I was relieved to see a stamp on the soap, but I can&#x27;t make out any of the letters on it, which makes me a little suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face with it once already.  It seems drier than before I had used it, and I don&#x27;t know if that is normal.  The number of ingredients freaks me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I made a bad judgment by purchasing this soap.  I&#x27;d love it if someone would prove me wrong.</li>
            <li> This is just soap.  It&#x27;s not especially good or bad - it&#x27;s just soap.  Do not believe the reviews that say you can use it on your hair.  Yuck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For washing your body, this is a good product.  Price-wise, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This soap has a neutral olive oil scent.&lt;br /&gt;It is a large brick of soap and could be cut into two pieces to make it easier to grab hold of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 12 dollars which may seem like a lot of money, but this soap is so dense that it looks as though it will last a couple years at my bathroom sink!  No more buying liquid in plastic bottles every few months.  When all is said and done, I will have saved money!</li>
            <li> I started using this soap after a French friend recommended it for my sensitive skin. The articles I read suggested savons d&#x27;alep with at least 30% bay laurel oil for problem (eczema, etc.) skin like mine. This soap has 12% but still works great. I&#x27;ve used it on my hair, hands, body, and face and have most noticeably seen improvements in the health of my face! My skin no longer looks dull and its tone is more even. After my first use, my skin looked better. I definitely recommend--and if you are able to use this for everything, it&#x27;s a great money-saver!</li>
            <li> I discovered aleppo soap in a most amusing way - via the \\&quot;How to Archer\\&quot; book.  Given that the book was surprisingly accurate in many other ways, I decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is indeed legendary, and I&#x27;ve used none nicer.  I can&#x27;t justify buying nothing but this, and I did a direct comparison to the also olive oil based Marseille soap...  This is nicer, but not enough to justify the difference to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that there truly is none nicer, and it did wonderful things for my skin - and was more pleasant to smell than the Marseille, and left a slightly more pleasant feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are curious about this soap, you owe it to yourself to try it at least once.  It really is that good, and my skin/hair had never felt better.</li>
            <li> This is the best Aleppo soap I&#x27;ve used to date.  It&#x27;s even better than [[ASIN:B000FPVMC0 Syrian Soap 200g - Olive Oil Soap from Mesopotamia(1 bar)]] which I would have bought had it been available last week.  I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t!  Even though this soap is made in France, for me it is superior to the one actually made in Syria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is incredibly vintage and classy looking (see pics) so it demands attention from anyone walking into your bathroom.  Also, it smells great, OK -- it&#x27;s not a high end cologne when you stick your nose to it, but it smells clean and as an added benefit it ends up fragrancing your bathroom even just sitting in a soap dish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from dry skin and eczema which is how I got into trying this soap in the first place and I have found this to be the least drying of Marseille (Olive Oil), Bronners and Aleppo (Olive + Bay Leaf Oil) soaps.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial soap. Since December 2012 I have used this soap and I have found that it helps with controlling the production of pimples and facial scars (from pimples) - this is my main concern when selecting a facial product. Results have been so positive that I hIghly recommend the Savon d&#x27;Alep.</li>
