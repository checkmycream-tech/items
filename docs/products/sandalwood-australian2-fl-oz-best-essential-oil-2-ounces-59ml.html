            <li>Nice saddle wood smell to this oil.</li>
            <li>witha richer sweeter scent like rose</li>
            <li>I received this as part of a promotion to share my honest thoughts</li>
            <li>and I feel nice and relaxed.</li>
            <li>Smells good not too strong, mix well with Rosemary and Neroly.</li>
            <li>Just  the thing to make an old Hippy happy!</li>
            <li>Note quite what I wanted but still better than most out there.....</li>
            <li>br /&gt;I received this for free for the purpose of an honest review.</li>
            <li>This oil is so lovely and has so many skin care benefits.</li>
            <li>For the most part anyway.</li>
            <li>A milder scent in Australian but wonderful quality and price is greta!!!</li>
            <li>I received this in the mail free as a gift too!</li>
            <li>They are a great, all natural way to help with so many things.</li>
            <li>Very cool.</li>
            <li>This stuff really smells good.</li>
            <li>Smells good.not ad strong as others</li>
            <li>Although this smells great, the scent does not last.  </li>
            <li>: I received this product for free to facilitate review.</li>
            <li>Slightly more fresh than Indian, crisper notes.</li>
            <li>This scent is nice but not reallt authentic so is better mixed</li>
            <li>I use it in my beard, it smells fantastic all day.</li>
            <li>got free for giving my review</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and outdoor wood-ish something I really like.</li>
            <li>in next, it has a great cool smell about it that reminds you of freshness.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect at first.</li>
            <li>The smell was amazing, it made my yard smell more like the outdoors than it already did, and it actually kept the bugs away.</li>
            <li>It smells sweet and almost foral.</li>
            <li>How ever the carrier oil does not have a sweet smell to it</li>
            <li>It was on the sweet candy side.</li>
            <li>reason I give it four stars is that my lid won&#x27;t fit right, and it leaked some out on the way here.</li>
            <li>When I saw this Australian Sandalwood Essential Oil by Sun Organics, I knew that it was the perfect oil for my outdoor uses.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this oil that I will be getting more for all my essential oil needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The packaging was well done and arrived quickly as it was sent priority mail which is always pleasing to know as it gets to me quickly</li>
            <li>I only hope what they claim is correct (organic, 100%) Very pleased.</li>
            <li>My very favorite of all the essential oils</li>
            <li>I like the smell very much!</li>
            <li>The price is right for wanting to try new things and so far we&#x27;ve seen good results</li>
            <li>And the product size is such an amazing value.</li>
            <li>Worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>Nice price for a bottle of australian sandalwood blended oil.</li>
            <li>Delivery right on time.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice decent size bottle with a soft plastic dropper which I really like because it let me get just the right amount.  </li>
            <li>it has a soft odor, not as strong as i thought it would be</li>
            <li>Will order some more in the future.</li>
            <li>Yes, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I love essential oils</li>
            <li>There are so many uses for essential oil, that everyone should be getting them.</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE REAL STUFF!  </li>
            <li>But I did open the bottle with enclosed pipette, and fell in love with the scent.  </li>
            <li>In addition to that, I&#x27;m sure the dilution, if any at all, is pretty big...</li>
            <li>this is my first oil product.  </li>
            <li>I had returned the first one and this one as well.</li>
            <li>This bottle however is very subtle, and gentle when you smell it.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great in my diffuser and fills up a room quickly.</li>
            <li>I think this isn&#x27;t as pure as some of the  sandalwood oils I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very calming and relaxing.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant because of the price and reviews.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not weak</li>
            <li>This smells a bit different than other Sandalwood I have purchased, but it is still nice.  </li>
            <li>Pure Essential Oils are not supposed to be cloudy!!!This is not 100% pure nor organic.</li>
            <li>Very nice scent, long lasting, slight oily residue but absorbs into the skin after about 4 min.</li>
            <li>I was having a huge BBQ and didn&#x27;t want bugs bothering us, but at the same time I didn&#x27;t want outside to smell all girly or fruity</li>
            <li>Lasts pretty long too.</li>
            <li>I can live with Australian Sandalwood any day!  </li>
            <li>I am new to essential oils, but was given the opportunity to sample this.</li>
            <li>No other compensation was received.</li>
            <li>I have placed a small daub of this essential oil behind my ears or on my wrists just because I loved the scent so much.</li>
            <li>I am really liking sandalwood and look forward to finding out its other uses.</li>
            <li>It is slightly diluted (apparent when sniff-comparing against 100% pure oil)</li>
            <li>is a large 2 oz dark amber glass bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am really liking sandalwood and look forward to finding out its other uses.</li>
            <li> It is slightly diluted (apparent when sniff-comparing against 100% pure oil)</li>
            <li> is a large 2 oz dark amber glass bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is not uncut and is how it would be expected if you added your own carrier base.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> A true essential oil will not leave any residue on a piece of paper after 24 hours, but a fake one will leave an oily residue, as did all the Sun Essential oils I bought.</li>
            <li> sandalwood is so expensive now that I&#x27;m not surprised that the blend is so very mild.</li>
            <li> This is not a good substitute for Pure Australian Sandalwood.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely mixed with a carrier oil and is definitely not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> so I just add a little extra.</li>
            <li> Carefully removed the bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> I received an order, on promotion, of a few of Sun Organics Essential Oils.</li>
            <li> It IS NOT PURE, it is in some sort of non specified carrier oil.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed if you are looking for sandlewood smell without the price of the actual sandlewood.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to find other uses for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer</li>
            <li> Was very careful.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but kinda of expensive for a small bottle like this.</li>
            <li> After about 10 diffusions, the smell is much too perfumey, like definitely a fake Aussie Sandalwood.  </li>
            <li> Trying it on a face remedy for getting rid of dark spots on the skin!</li>
            <li> I made 8 little candles with this oil, and placed them throughout the yard and lit them.</li>
            <li> I have also added a few drops into my wax warmer air freshener and used it to make homemade soaps.</li>
            <li> Not strong smelling at all</li>
            <li> This product came leaking I lost a lot if product also the dropper was bent pretty bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong either!</li>
            <li> As I move around I catch random whiffs of it all day long.</li>
            <li> The only scent I was a little disappointed in was the vanilla.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very weak smell.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy the fake sandalwood oil.</li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> Not too bad a price for the size.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product, it smells absolutely delightful...Yummy!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased sandalwood oil before so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect at first. The name does not do the smell justice at all. It smells sweet and almost foral. The scent is not overbearing. Smells like the Asian handheld wood fans I used to use as a kid. Will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> This is not uncut and is how it would be expected if you added your own carrier base. If you want to take guess work out of that, this is for you. Smell is nice</li>
            <li> Amazing fragrance!!! Very pleased with this product. Will order some more in the future.</li>
            <li> This product works well for me, and I got it a couple of days after I ordered it. Great!</li>
            <li> Amazing price for the quality and quantity.</li>
            <li> This smells a bit different than other Sandalwood I have purchased, but it is still nice.  Worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> Note quite what I wanted but still better than most out there..... It IS NOT PURE, it is in some sort of non specified carrier oil. How ever the carrier oil does not have a sweet smell to it so I like it.</li>
            <li> Not a real essential oil, it has been mixed with a carrier oil, as proven by a drop test. A true essential oil will not leave any residue on a piece of paper after 24 hours, but a fake one will leave an oily residue, as did all the Sun Essential oils I bought. These are FAKES.</li>
            <li> Excellent...on-time delivery...perfect!</li>
            <li> Yes, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed if you are looking for sandlewood smell without the price of the actual sandlewood.  I can live with Australian Sandalwood any day!  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> after about 10 minutes of heat all you smell is oil</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> Although this smells great, the scent does not last.  I am a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful smelling scent!&lt;br /&gt;Most sandalwood I get is overpowering. This bottle however is very subtle, and gentle when you smell it.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great in my diffuser and fills up a room quickly. It&#x27;s very calming and relaxing. Even soothing.&lt;br /&gt;This is a large 2 oz dark amber glass bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it had come with a dropper lid, but that doesn&#x27;t change my vote.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I give it four stars is that my lid won&#x27;t fit right, and it leaked some out on the way here. I have to make sure this is upright at all times, or it will leak more.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, a great bottle, for the price! Awesome scent as well&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free for the purpose of an honest review. My opinion is my own and is not influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> great quality for a great price</li>
            <li> My house smells like a million dollars..thank you!!</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful! Trying it on a face remedy for getting rid of dark spots on the skin! Hope it works...</li>
            <li> Sooo happy I decided to buy this! I was very hesitant because of the price and reviews. It smells great! And it&#x27;s not weak (like I was anticipating) You can&#x27;t beat the price. I only hope what they claim is correct (organic, 100%) Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have placed a small daub of this essential oil behind my ears or on my wrists just because I loved the scent so much. As I move around I catch random whiffs of it all day long. Very cool. I have also added a few drops into my wax warmer air freshener and used it to make homemade soaps. Can&#x27;t wait to find other uses for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product for free to facilitate review. No other compensation was received. All opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Not strong smelling at all</li>
            <li> This oil is so lovely and has so many skin care benefits. And the product size is such an amazing value. I will definitely order from them in the future.</li>
            <li> This product came leaking I lost a lot if product also the dropper was bent pretty bad but it&#x27;s still useable, no invoice to contact seller to report my issue . The product does smell good and is a good value and very quick shipping</li>
            <li> Australian sandalwood is DA BOMB. Slightly more fresh than Indian, crisper notes. Came with a plastic pipette to dispense from bottle that does not include a dropper insert... No complaints from me on that!</li>
            <li> the smell is different than what i was expecting but it works well with my woody scented sugar scrub. will buy again.</li>
            <li> I thought it smelled like pine.</li>
            <li> This does have some sort of filler but smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love essential oils and I use them in all aspects of life. They are a great, all natural way to help with so many things. When I saw this Australian Sandalwood Essential Oil by Sun Organics, I knew that it was the perfect oil for my outdoor uses. I was having a huge BBQ and didn&#x27;t want bugs bothering us, but at the same time I didn&#x27;t want outside to smell all girly or fruity, I still wanted it to smell like the outdoors, yet keep bugs away. I made 8 little candles with this oil, and placed them throughout the yard and lit them. The smell was amazing, it made my yard smell more like the outdoors than it already did, and it actually kept the bugs away. There are so many uses for essential oil, that everyone should be getting them. I am so pleased with this oil that I will be getting more for all my essential oil needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> My very favorite of all the essential oils</li>
            <li> 7/3. Just opened the delivery box. Carefully removed the bubble wrap. My hand was saturated with scent immediately. The bottle was oily and the scent of concentrated sandalwood permeated the air. NO LABEL on the bottle. Was very careful. Want a refund.</li>
            <li> Nice saddle wood smell to this oil.</li>
            <li> I received an order, on promotion, of a few of Sun Organics Essential Oils. Each came with a dispenser. The packaging was well done and arrived quickly as it was sent priority mail which is always pleasing to know as it gets to me quickly and I believe safer than regular mail. The only scent I was a little disappointed in was the vanilla. It was on the sweet candy side. The Sweet Orange is my favorite, it smells wonderful and the Wintermint in next, it has a great cool smell about it that reminds you of freshness. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Smells great, just like the sandalwood smell I always remembered.  It is slightly diluted (apparent when sniff-comparing against 100% pure oil) so I just add a little extra.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell.</li>
            <li> This smells so good, but both bottles were leaking. They need to put tape around the lid.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good but it leaked!!!!! it&#x27;s was all over in the box...</li>
            <li> Smells good.not ad strong as others</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE REAL STUFF!  don&#x27;t buy the fake sandalwood oil. This is an awesome product + fabulous for your skin. re: your skin on sandalwood, google for an article that talks about how your skin has olfactory receptors (smell receptors) annnnnd w/ this amazing stuff your skin will heal 30-45% faster (per the article)</li>
            <li> I have not yet used this essential oil.  But I did open the bottle with enclosed pipette, and fell in love with the scent.  Purchased to use in my homemade sandalwood powder homemade soap.</li>
            <li> Amazing product:)))!!!!!</li>
            <li> This scent is nice but not reallt authentic so is better mixed witha richer sweeter scent like rose</li>
            <li> Very weak smell. Now, I expected this as Australian Sandalwood is nowhere near as fragrant as Indian. But, once you open this product the smell begins to diminish. After about a month there is no scent left. For the most part anyway.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Best sandalwood i have ever smelled. I use it in my beard, it smells fantastic all day. And it is organic, which is a must for me.</li>
            <li> I think this isn&#x27;t as pure as some of the  sandalwood oils I&#x27;ve purchased.  The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last well.</li>
            <li> I posted before how great this was.  This update:  After about 10 diffusions, the smell is much too perfumey, like definitely a fake Aussie Sandalwood.  In addition to that, I&#x27;m sure the dilution, if any at all, is pretty big...there is no residue left after the diffuser runs out, and the smell does not linger.   This is not a good substitute for Pure Australian Sandalwood.  Too chemical.</li>
            <li> got free for giving my review and i got to say it is absolutely a great wrinkle product</li>
            <li> I am new to essential oils, but was given the opportunity to sample this. My daughter has been using it as a compress for sinus problems and has had great results with it alleviating congestion. The price is right for wanting to try new things and so far we&#x27;ve seen good results</li>
            <li> Nice price for a bottle of australian sandalwood blended oil.</li>
            <li> Smells good not too strong, mix well with Rosemary and Neroly.</li>
            <li> A milder scent in Australian but wonderful quality and price is greta!!!</li>
            <li> this is my first oil product.  it has a soft odor, not as strong as i thought it would be but maybe i&#x27;m remembering patchouli oil from my youth. lol</li>
            <li> Smells great, and at this price is a really good value.  Glad I purchased!</li>
            <li> Just  the thing to make an old Hippy happy!</li>
            <li> Sandalwood is great and relaxes the body and mind. It has been used for centuries for meditation. I decided this would be perfect for making candles. The smell is nice and outdoor wood-ish something I really like. I received this as part of a promotion to share my honest thoughts and I really like it. It comes in a nice decent size bottle with a soft plastic dropper which I really like because it let me get just the right amount.  I used the candles in the bathroom while taking a bath and the scent was amazing it is a great mood setter and I feel nice and relaxed. I am really liking sandalwood and look forward to finding out its other uses.</li>
            <li> Not too bad a price for the size. Delivery right on time.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent, long lasting, slight oily residue but absorbs into the skin after about 4 min.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail free as a gift too! I like the smell very much! Just like Sandalwood smells! It&#x27;s not strong either! I can&#x27;t wait to find out how u make something with it!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Jfaris</li>
            <li> sandalwood is so expensive now that I&#x27;m not surprised that the blend is so very mild.</li>
            <li> This stuff really smells good. Lasts pretty long too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is garbage. This is the second product I have bought from Sun Organics and it turned out cloudy. Pure Essential Oils are not supposed to be cloudy!!!This is not 100% pure nor organic. It is definitely mixed with a carrier oil and is definitely not worth it at all. I had returned the first one and this one as well. So disappointing.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but kinda of expensive for a small bottle like this.</li>
