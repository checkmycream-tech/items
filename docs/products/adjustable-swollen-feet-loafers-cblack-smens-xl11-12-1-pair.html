            <li>worked for my mother, she was satisfied.</li>
            <li>The company&#x27;s return policy is outstanding</li>
            <li>Just &#x27;OK&#x27;.....hard to keep on my husband&#x27;s feet...</li>
            <li>actually more pliable than pictured, almost like slippers.</li>
            <li>He really liked how comfortably they fit.</li>
            <li>These are the most comfortable slippers I have ever put on my feet.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on and adjustable if needed</li>
            <li>The shoes themselves are attractive and appear as if they would be comfortable if I could actually wear them.  </li>
            <li>Made in a way that you cannot strap your foot in comfortably and you can walk comfortably</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not as comfortable as another pair I bought for him.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the fact to my toes are covered.   </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit correctly won&#x27;t tell anybody get them.</li>
            <li>The velcro  on these shoes makes is very easy to get on my Dad&#x27;s feet, no matter how much they are swollen.</li>
            <li>only can get size 11-12....not good.</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t a lot of support on the sole but good for the price.</li>
            <li>Finally my mom is able to walk comfortable with secured shoes without the fear of falling.</li>
            <li>There are many others out there but not similar quality!</li>
            <li>I liked these,  but was unable to adjust them well enough for a good fit.  </li>
            <li>They run large,  and are adjustable as promised.</li>
            <li>What ever your size get one size larger and enjoy.</li>
            <li>They work really well</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>My husband wants me to return them.</li>
            <li>They were very flimsy.</li>
            <li>My dad can&#x27;t fit into any regular sized house shoes because his feet are severely swollen.</li>
            <li>So many adjustable slippers are really only patially adjustable--the toe area is fixed</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for these slippers,  but for $12.99 you get what though pay for.</li>
            <li>Was not what I expected to be cheaply made</li>
            <li>Not as wide as they made them sound.</li>
            <li>The shoes were not what we expected, they are very cheaply made with thread strands hanging from several places, also the size is not what it claims to be</li>
            <li>His feet are very swollen and these shoes worked very well for him going outside.  </li>
            <li>If your only problem is swollen feet,  then these are a very reasonable solution.</li>
            <li>After a couple days enough of the thread came loose that he no longer felt comfortable wearing them.</li>
            <li>Very light weight and stiff in the sole.</li>
            <li>And I am over sixty yrs old.</li>
            <li>I purchased these for my 80y year old father.  </li>
            <li>I bought them for my 91 year old father.</li>
            <li>and you are back toguessing what the chinese sizing really means.</li>
            <li>I bought these as a second pair for my 97 year old uncle who has considerable feet swelling issues.</li>
            <li>They were not expensive but still not worth what I paid for them.</li>

            <li> Too small.</li>
            <li> but they are sized too small.  </li>
            <li> They are sized too small.  </li>
            <li> Not safe for the elderly no support.</li>
            <li> They were not safe because they kept opening up and falling off his feet.</li>
            <li> They were hard to adjust but they surved the purpose.  </li>

            <li> no problems worked great and the price was good for the product !</li>
            <li> adjust to the size i need on different days</li>
            <li> It was just what I Wanted</li>
            <li> ordered size XL 11-12 but they are more like a 9-10. Beware! Very light weight and stiff in the sole.</li>
            <li> If you wear a size 9, get a size ten. What ever your size get one size larger and enjoy. These are the most comfortable slippers I have ever put on my feet. And I am over sixty yrs old.</li>
            <li> i take a size 10-11.....only can get size 11-12....not good.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for these slippers,  but for $12.99 you get what though pay for. They run large,  and are adjustable as promised. Just not very comfortable,  or sturdy for unstable walkers. I bought these for my Father in law,  he liked the concept, but not the quality.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my husband, one in black and the other tan colored. They work really well and when his feet getting swollen can be adjusted. He doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;walk out of them&amp;#34; as he does with some slipper types. I count that a plus.</li>
            <li> Not worth $13. Not worth the return postage. Yea. I suppose that about says it all. Price considered, I still couldn&#x27;t recommend these &amp;#34;loafers&amp;#34; to anyone. I&#x27;ll just toss &#x27;em in the Good Will bin at the grocery store parking lot.</li>
            <li> They were hard to adjust but they surved the purpose.  I would not order them again.  Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is a very uncomfortable shoe when swollen and does not adjust as described. I gave them to my daughter who has a normal size foot, she tried it then gave it back stating it is too hard on the inside. Made in a way that you cannot strap your foot in comfortably and you can walk comfortably</li>
            <li> This shoe/slipper met all my requiremente. So many adjustable slippers are really only patially adjustable--the toe area is fixed and you are back toguessing what the chinese sizing really means. Not this slipper</li>
            <li> I have purchased item before that a furrier lining. These have a thinner felt lining.</li>
            <li> my elderly uncle enjoysmthe comfort of this slipper and the adjustability aides in stability. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The velcro  on these shoes makes is very easy to get on my Dad&#x27;s feet, no matter how much they are swollen. Have 2 pairs as they seem to run big and had to by smaller size.</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected to be cheaply made</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband and he doesn&#x27;t like them. They&#x27;re not as comfortable as another pair I bought for him.</li>
            <li> I dislike these shoes immensely and never wear them!&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of money! The engineering of these shoes are horrible&lt;br /&gt;and the cushion needed isn&#x27;t there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD NOT recommend these shoes and will never buy from this company again!</li>
            <li> junk see photo after 2 weeks............</li>
            <li> I bought these slippers for my diabetic Dad. He really liked how comfortably they fit. Within 2 weeks the thread holding the sole to the slipper came loose. After a couple days enough of the thread came loose that he no longer felt comfortable wearing them.</li>
            <li> They stretch beyond their size. Would not reorder</li>
            <li> I only have trouble getting the flaps tight enough.  If you don&#x27;t pull the flap hard enough, they will come off.  Otherwise, it is a good slipper.  I will use them for winter.  I enjoy the fact to my toes are covered.   I have a pair of similar loafers where my toes are not covered.   They are excellent for summer.             Jack Toussaint</li>
            <li> Too small. Says 12 but not</li>
            <li> Finally my mom is able to walk comfortable with secured shoes without the fear of falling.</li>
            <li> Not as wide as they made them sound.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to bother to return these but they are sized too small.  I wear an 11 1/2 shoe so I chose the 11-12 size selection.  There is not a larger selection.  They are sized too small.  The shoes themselves are attractive and appear as if they would be comfortable if I could actually wear them.  They were received on time so I am only rating the fact of the sizing.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a second pair for my 97 year old uncle who has considerable feet swelling issues. He loves them. They&#x27;re the only shoes he wears now.</li>
            <li> PERFECT!  Amazing quality great price.  There are many others out there but not similar quality!</li>
            <li> worked for my mother, she was satisfied.</li>
            <li> Did not hold up to hard wear.</li>
            <li> Good value, nice slip-in for patient use,  the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is it doesn&#x27;t wash well.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my 80y year old father.  His feet are very swollen and these shoes worked very well for him going outside.  There wasn&#x27;t a lot of support on the sole but good for the price.</li>
            <li> I liked these,  but was unable to adjust them well enough for a good fit.  A sore on the bottom of one of my feet was the culprit.  If your only problem is swollen feet,  then these are a very reasonable solution. The company&#x27;s return policy is outstanding so I was only out the one-way shipping charge</li>
            <li> The shoes were not what we expected, they are very cheaply made with thread strands hanging from several places, also the size is not what it claims to be they were very small even though it says it 11-12 shoe size it isn&#x27;t. My husband wants me to return them. Construction terrible, size terrible even looks terrible. We are not satisfied at all !</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my brother who has swollen legs and feet from health issues . He says they are wonderful for him right now and comfortable .</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit correctly won&#x27;t tell anybody get them. Not safe for the elderly no support.</li>
            <li> They are my second pair</li>
            <li> These were awful. They were very flimsy. There was no support. The Velcro on one shoe just would not stay closed. I bought them for my 91 year old father.He could not wear them . They were not safe because they kept opening up and falling off his feet.They looked awful too. They were called loafers but were a very cheap slipper.They were not expensive but still not worth what I paid for them.</li>
            <li> Just &#x27;OK&#x27;.....hard to keep on my husband&#x27;s feet...actually more pliable than pictured, almost like slippers.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on and adjustable if needed</li>
            <li> My dad can&#x27;t fit into any regular sized house shoes because his feet are severely swollen. He loves these &amp; wears them everywhere. They are adjustable &amp; he says they are comfy.</li>
