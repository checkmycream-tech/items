            <li>The best drugstore beauty item.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent concealer that I use on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best blemish concealer and best for eliminating blemishes, too.  </li>
            <li>very good under eye concealer</li>
            <li>Covers beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Product is great.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased to be able to get in on-line, and 2 in pack is very good value.</li>
            <li>/flakes very easily.</li>
            <li>This is the best product of ever used to clear acne from my face.</li>
            <li>Would strongly recommend to anyone with blemish prone skin!</li>
            <li>I just LOVE it</li>
            <li>So it was an alright concealer alone, but with powdered foundation on top, an even better concealer, by like 5%-10%.   </li>
            <li>I like the wand better than a stick or pot concealer, too.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m buying a bunch to have a backup-stock :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Almay concealer for many years and used to buy it in Boots</li>
            <li>This was actually more liquidy than my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Never</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this concealer.</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of the best spot concealers I&#x27;ve ever used, and it&#x27;s relatively cheap.  </li>
            <li>The sponge applicator is particularly good as it makes dabbing on the concealer much easier than using roll up sticks or brushes.</li>
            <li>It contains salicylic acid and goes on easily with a sponge tip.</li>
            <li>Great for gay men with a little bit of a twinkle in their eye and a sparkle in their step.  </li>
            <li>I love the package, it&#x27;s so light and easy to carry &amp; use while at the same time containing a lot.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and Almay products are great for anyone with a sensitive anything.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a concealer to match my very fair skin tone that doesn&#x27;t turn orange throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I love  this product very much that is why I ordered it, but the one  photographed is not the one you sent, you sent the blemish free which is different.  </li>
            <li>I have used other skin clearing make-up products containing salicylic acid like this concealer, but they did not feel as good, cover up so well or clear up &amp; prevent my breakouts so quickly and efficiently.  </li>
            <li>It feels light and actually makes my skin feel good as opposed to other concealers, which feel cakey and irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>Too bad.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work as a blemish remover, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t work as a concealer.</li>
            <li>One lasts me about a month or two depending on how much I use it, and I put it on almost every day.  </li>
            <li>And I wasn&#x27;t hoping for much</li>
            <li>I have medium acne, so I would say I have like 5-8 major pimples each month, and have a fair amount of dark spots/scarring from previous acne.</li>
            <li>You call that a clear complexion?</li>
            <li>Only gets 4 stars because it dries sooo fast, I have to put it on a dab and blend, dab and blend.</li>
            <li>otherwise it doesn&#x27;t look as natural.</li>
            <li>I find it ironic that this is called &amp;#34;Clear Complexion&amp;#34; despite the fact that I have applied this to a pimple on my face, and it&#x27;s still red.</li>
            <li>If you put it on and blend immediately, it offers practically complete coverage of zits that isn&#x27;t too drying, and helps to heal the zits faster at the same time.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Ive had acne problems for a long time and this item makes the acne concealed</li>
            <li> Anywho, I applied this product on the dark spots and it concealed about 85%-95% of the spots.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s helped clear up my complexion, but I do know that it doesn&#x27;t make zits worse.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and am prone to breakouts and this dries up the area effectively, not clogging it further.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too expensive, only $7.99.  </li>
            <li> If you have a small pimple, add a dab of this for coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 1% salicylic acid doesn&#x27;t do anything except cause flakiness, which is hardly what I am looking for in a concealer.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Almay to complain and they never bothered to respond.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also hard to find an oil-free concealer that doesn&#x27;t slip and slide around blemishes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I say cover or conceal, I mean it&#x27;s redness or darkness.   </li>
            <li> Almay Clear Complexion concealer covers up the worst pimples, stays put all day, and doesn&#x27;t change color as it oxidizes.</li>
            <li> At that price the product is too expensive.</li>
            <li> Sad day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to run out</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed after using Almay.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using Almay skin clearing concealer for years.  It&#x27;s my number one beauty item!  I have sensitive skin, and Almay products are great for anyone with a sensitive anything. It&#x27;s hypoallergenic and non-comadegenic (meaning it&#x27;s not oily and will not cause acne).  I love the package, it&#x27;s so light and easy to carry &amp; use while at the same time containing a lot.  One lasts me about a month or two depending on how much I use it, and I put it on almost every day.  It feels light and actually makes my skin feel good as opposed to other concealers, which feel cakey and irritate my skin.  I have used other skin clearing make-up products containing salicylic acid like this concealer, but they did not feel as good, cover up so well or clear up &amp; prevent my breakouts so quickly and efficiently.  I just LOVE it and it&#x27;s not too expensive, only $7.99.  The best drugstore beauty item.  It works wonders. I give it 10 stars!!!</li>
            <li> I have medium acne, so I would say I have like 5-8 major pimples each month, and have a fair amount of dark spots/scarring from previous acne. I decided to use this product, since it is an oil-free concealer and supposedly the yellow labels on almay products are \\&quot;healing makeups\\&quot;, reducing bacteria or something along those lines....  Anywho, I applied this product on the dark spots and it concealed about 85%-95% of the spots. Then I applied the concealer on smaller pimples and it concealed about 60%-85%. And I wasn&#x27;t hoping for much but, the larger pimples about 30%-50%. When I say cover or conceal, I mean it&#x27;s redness or darkness.   So it was an alright concealer alone, but with powdered foundation on top, an even better concealer, by like 5%-10%.   I find it also cakes/flakes very easily.</li>
            <li> Only gets 4 stars because it dries sooo fast, I have to put it on a dab and blend, dab and blend. otherwise it doesn&#x27;t look as natural. If you put it on and blend immediately, it offers practically complete coverage of zits that isn&#x27;t too drying, and helps to heal the zits faster at the same time. I like the wand better than a stick or pot concealer, too. This is definitely one of the best spot concealers I&#x27;ve ever used, and it&#x27;s relatively cheap.  I&#x27;d hate to run out so I&#x27;m buying a bunch to have a backup-stock :)</li>
            <li> This is an excellent concealer that I use on my face. It is non-greasy. It contains salicylic acid and goes on easily with a sponge tip.</li>
            <li> I love  this product very much that is why I ordered it, but the one  photographed is not the one you sent, you sent the blemish free which is different.  But I will keep it and use it.  The one photographed has been discontinued and I thouht you had some, that is why I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Almay concealer for many years and used to buy it in Boots but they don&#x27;t seem to stock it anymore. I&#x27;m pleased to be able to get in on-line, and 2 in pack is very good value. The sponge applicator is particularly good as it makes dabbing on the concealer much easier than using roll up sticks or brushes.</li>
            <li> I find it ironic that this is called &amp;#34;Clear Complexion&amp;#34; despite the fact that I have applied this to a pimple on my face, and it&#x27;s still red. You call that a clear complexion? Because I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would do what it claimed on the packaging. Too bad.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work as a blemish remover, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t work as a concealer. I get maybe 30% coverage. This was actually more liquidy than my liquid foundation. The 1% salicylic acid doesn&#x27;t do anything except cause flakiness, which is hardly what I am looking for in a concealer.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Almay to complain and they never bothered to respond.&lt;br /&gt;Just buy something else.</li>
            <li> very good under eye concealer</li>
            <li> Product is great. Covers beautifully.  However the purchase included a package of 2 but only 1 was shipped. At that price the product is too expensive.</li>
            <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Never any issues with my eye allergies.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason works on drying out zits.  If you have a small pimple, add a dab of this for coverage.&lt;br /&gt;It disappears in a day or two!!</li>
            <li> This is the best product of ever used to clear acne from my face. Ive had acne problems for a long time and this item makes the acne concealed so know one knows you even have acne while treating it. I will buy this product aslong as i have acne</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this concealer. I&#x27;ve tried EVERY concealer out there - from cheap to really expensive. It&#x27;s hard to find a concealer to match my very fair skin tone that doesn&#x27;t turn orange throughout the day. It&#x27;s also hard to find an oil-free concealer that doesn&#x27;t slip and slide around blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Almay Clear Complexion concealer covers up the worst pimples, stays put all day, and doesn&#x27;t change color as it oxidizes. I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s helped clear up my complexion, but I do know that it doesn&#x27;t make zits worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, now.  It&#x27;s the best blemish concealer and best for eliminating blemishes, too.  I would never consider another product, now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product religiously for years to cover up my blemishes. I have oily skin and am prone to breakouts and this dries up the area effectively, not clogging it further. Would strongly recommend to anyone with blemish prone skin!</li>
            <li> Great for gay men with a little bit of a twinkle in their eye and a sparkle in their step.  LOL</li>
            <li> This product did not help my acne, and also made me oily. I was very disappointed after using Almay. Sad day.</li>
