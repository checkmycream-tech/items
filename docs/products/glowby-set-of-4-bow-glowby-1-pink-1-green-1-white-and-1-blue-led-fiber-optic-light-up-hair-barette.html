            <li>It&#x27;s a great product in theory, but construction needs to be improved.</li>
            <li>The Hair Barrette is great for tweens.</li>
            <li>While the clips themselves are great</li>
            <li>and they are surprisingly bright and batteries can be replaced once they run</li>
            <li>The plaatic bow lights up bright and ovwrwhelmes the fiber optics a bit</li>
            <li>My daughter and I loved this product.  </li>
            <li>But everyone seems to think they look peetty good.  </li>
            <li>She loved wearing them, too.</li>
            <li>My daughter and her friends all loved these.  </li>
            <li>They are cute in their hair.  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Really looks great at night.</li>
            <li>These were a huge hit with my kids at Halloween.  </li>
            <li>I saw these and was so excited..</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>I consider that significant approval.</li>
            <li>They stayed in and were bright enough to see from quite a distance.  </li>
            <li>A straight barrett or clip would be better.</li>
            <li>My niece loved them but the barrettes holding them in place were a little cheap.  </li>
            <li>I got these because they look fun and plan on wearing to disneyland.</li>
            <li>They are fun to play with.  </li>
            <li>These barrettes are pretty cool, butt they have to be clipped just right for them to work.</li>
            <li>They are cute and fun however the batteries are super hard to change out (if at all)</li>
            <li>That said, the bow clip can be hidden under certain stylings, so I still love them.</li>
            <li>The whole strands light up, as opposed to the red and pink, where only the tips light up.</li>
            <li>Bought these for the girls for New Years party.</li>
            <li>wore them for New Years and will wear them for the Neon Splash Dash as well (braided into my hair).</li>
            <li>The way the latch snaps back under the protruding bit you use to fasten in the hair allows you to save the light to use later.</li>
            <li>for the EPIC</li>
            <li>I only marked one star off because I&#x27;m not a fan of the bow barrett.</li>
            <li>Used a free gift card to get these, if  not, I&#x27;d be pretty mad....</li>

            <li> Then, one stopped working after 20 minutes, another had the fiber optic fringe &amp;#34;fall out&amp;#34; for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d wanted to create a rainbow effect but what I actually got was a white, a red, a pink, and one that cycled and flashed through colors.</li>
            <li> The white and green are by far the brightest.</li>
            <li> With my black hair, the pink gets lost, but the blue and white POP...</li>
            <li> I received White, Green, Red, and Pink.</li>
            <li> The pink was hard to see, but the blue looked cool.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> Not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> not sure about the other colors, because I didn&#x27;t get to see those.</li>
            <li> The clip was a little tricky to work with.</li>
            <li> Also, two for them quit working after a few uses.</li>
            <li> 3 of 4 worked but one was dead because there was no protection from it switching on in shipment  </li>
            <li> I was super disappointed to not get the advertised colors.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for late nights at Bonnaroo.</li>

            <li> These barrettes are pretty cool, butt they have to be clipped just right for them to work. Also, two for them quit working after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I saw these and was so excited.. couldn&#x27;t wait to get them! Then, one stopped working after 20 minutes, another had the fiber optic fringe &amp;#34;fall out&amp;#34; for no apparent reason. It&#x27;s a great product in theory, but construction needs to be improved. Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> These were a huge hit with my kids at Halloween.  They can even be trimmed for children with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> Bought these for the girls for New Years party. The pink was hard to see, but the blue looked cool.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about the other colors, because I didn&#x27;t get to see those.</li>
            <li> Used a free gift card to get these, if  not, I&#x27;d be pretty mad.... Two of the three didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> These are the coolest things! My daughter wears them as much as possible. The batteries can be replaced, although we have not had to (and she wears them A LOT!) Worth the price!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I loved this product.  We purchased them for a Glow Run.  It stuck to my hair well, but for some reason my daughter lost hers during the run.</li>
            <li> I only marked one star off because I&#x27;m not a fan of the bow barrett. A straight barrett or clip would be better. I&#x27;m just not a girly girl. That said, the bow clip can be hidden under certain stylings, so I still love them. You can even cut them like hair to match the length you need which is a big plus and they are surprisingly bright and batteries can be replaced once they run down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore them for New Years and will wear them for the Neon Splash Dash as well (braided into my hair). Go with these, not a knockoff brand.</li>
            <li> The way the latch snaps back under the protruding bit you use to fasten in the hair allows you to save the light to use later.</li>
            <li> 3 of 4 worked but one was dead because there was no protection from it switching on in shipment  But everyone seems to think they look peetty good.  The plaatic bow lights up bright and ovwrwhelmes the fiber optics a bit</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter&#x27;s nighttime outside dance performance.  They stayed in and were bright enough to see from quite a distance.  She loved wearing them, too.</li>
            <li> Wore it to Mardi Gras and it was a hit. Even strangers asked me where I got it. wore several at once</li>
            <li> Exceeded expectations for the price. The Hair Barrette Can be turned off undoing clip. The Hair Barrette is great for tweens.</li>
            <li> Muy buen producto, era exactamente lo que esperaba.&lt;br /&gt;Una vez mas, sin ningún tipo de problemas en el envío y plazo.</li>
            <li> The clip was a little tricky to work with. It was kind of disappointing. Not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I got these because they look fun and plan on wearing to disneyland. With my black hair, the pink gets lost, but the blue and white POP... so keep that in mind</li>
            <li> My niece loved them but the barrettes holding them in place were a little cheap.  She did not seem to care anyway.</li>
            <li> My daughter and her friends all loved these.  They are cute in their hair.  We are also giving these as gifts.  Love them.</li>
            <li> They are cute and fun however the batteries are super hard to change out (if at all) and when I received mine one of them had already started to die.</li>
            <li> I use them as stocking stuffers at Christmas and along with birthday gifts.  They are fun to play with.  Will do it again.  Recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought these for late nights at Bonnaroo. They are going to be a blast. I received White, Green, Red, and Pink. The white and green are by far the brightest. The whole strands light up, as opposed to the red and pink, where only the tips light up. I will update once I&#x27;ve used them to see how they hold up.</li>
            <li> Really looks great at night.</li>
            <li> These were a gift for my Granddaughter, who wore them to school the very next day. Her note to me said*Thanks for the EPIC Glowbies*. I consider that significant approval.</li>
            <li> While the clips themselves are great I was super disappointed to not get the advertised colors.  I&#x27;d wanted to create a rainbow effect but what I actually got was a white, a red, a pink, and one that cycled and flashed through colors.</li>
