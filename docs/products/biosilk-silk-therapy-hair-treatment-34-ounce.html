            <li>I love the larger size offered as well...</li>
            <li>I used to resort to a pretty sticky gel that would hold my curl</li>
            <li>My mother and I had the smaller size bottles  and were glad to see we could save by getting the 34 oz.</li>
            <li>Thanx so much!</li>

            <li>It keeps my hair soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li>I have a bit of a healthy hair obsession, and have tried numerous treatments, nothing works like Biosilk.  </li>
            <li>This bottle might last me a lifetime. :-)</li>
            <li>Be aware that the ingredients in the large bargain size</li>
            <li>I love this product for my flyaway, long curly hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a great deal and much cheaper than buying the smaller bottles sold in department and other stores.  </li>
            <li>I been searching 20 years for something to satisfy me and my hair, my hair has a life of its own being thicker then a lions mane and curly as can be without being a black woman</li>
            <li>Biosilk infuses into my hair, managing the frizz and maintaining a healthy looking dry curl.  </li>
            <li>I shampoo my hair with my favorite hair shampoo, rinse, and towel dry.  </li>
            <li>I was paying $29 and that was a better price for the 12oz bottle than just buying the single Silk Therapy alone.  </li>
            <li>the price for the amount is really amazing, Only Amazon can find such deals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product is used very sparking.</li>
            <li>I also noticed how all of the \\&quot;fuzziness\\&quot; on my hair was gone, and that it didn&#x27;t seem to tangle as much.  </li>
            <li>For that tousled-hair look that&#x27;s really \\&quot;in\\</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>Even stays smooth on the second day.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very silky.  </li>
            <li>it straight without drying it out.</li>
            <li>this product really helps in keeping my hair healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like this because it&#x27;s very lightweight.</li>
            <li>If I add a cream gel, my hair gets really curly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>And I highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li>bottle is much thinner.</li>
            <li>Really helps with my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I was tired of paying $40 for 1/3 of this size and finally found a presentation with great price for the size!</li>
            <li>makes hair silkier-  makes hair shinier and softer-  is best for long hair and can be used on dry or wet hair-</li>
            <li>It helps my long hair stay silky, and makes it easy to brush out after a bath.</li>
            <li>No discernible scent so safe for fragrance-free environments and works well with any number of other products &amp; brands.</li>
            <li>have tried many other products now and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m questioning if it is a knock off for a few reasons such as: the bottle was completely filled to the top</li>
            <li>love this to keep the frizz down esp with the warmer months coming</li>
            <li>The large bottle was well worth the price as I have smaller bottles</li>
            <li>Makes my hair shinier, more pliable, and causes less breakage.</li>
            <li>In addition, it makes your hands very soft after you put this product in your hair!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend product.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well, leaves my hair soft and silky without feeling or looking greasy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use anything else except my normal shampoo and conditioner.  </li>

            <li>It gives my hair a moisture without greasing it down, makes it easy to brush through, helps protect the ends.  </li>
            <li>Very natural solution and makes sense.</li>
            <li>it makes it very soft and touchable, which I like.  </li>
            <li>She stands about 5&#x27;7\\&quot; and her hair goes past her waistline to almost the bottom of her &#x27;cheeks&#x27; :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Biosilk for a long time now, and this bottle is so huge that it&#x27;s lasting me years!</li>
            <li>My daughter has very curly hair, damages easily, and hard to controll.</li>
            <li>I love Biosilk but it took a long time for me to get it in the mail, I may try a different vendor next time.</li>
            <li>Bought large bottle to refill smaller one for travel.</li>
            <li>put a little on my hands and put in my hear to keep it soft and tangle free.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it provide a natural shine, but it makes it very managable to style.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years I have natural curly hair and it works wonders for the frizz..</li>
            <li>I also use on my legs to help them silky an soft</li>
            <li>Keeps my naturally curly hair from going all frizzy.</li>
            <li>This stuff turns it to soft silky hair.</li>
            <li>It not only works very well</li>
            <li>It might be pricey, but you don&#x27;t use much at all, just a nickel sized amount for me, and my hair reaches to my lower back.</li>
            <li>so i just kept the old bottle and poured this on into it for easier storage.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair silky soft (don&#x27;t overuse it, or it will make it oily).  </li>
            <li>Because of the cost in the stores, I began ordering it online where you can get the bigger bottles with a much lower price per ounce.</li>
            <li>My daughters are biracial and it is often difficult to find a good product for their curly hair.</li>
            <li>Little pricy but worth it!</li>
            <li>I know because when I use too much it leaves it flat and nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The main reason for this is that the solution in the larger 34 oz.</li>
            <li>I love using Biosilk and have been a regular user for the past year.  </li>
            <li>and I received exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I normally buy the smaller bottle cause</li>
            <li>I apply Biosilk both on wet, clean hair, and to my dry hair before and after styling.</li>
            <li>but since you use so little it is well worth it</li>
            <li>I finally figured out the problem that with age you loose much of your natural oil.</li>
            <li>I tried gel, sprays etc for several years and they worked but my hair did not look natural.</li>
            <li>and soft when I use it regularly.  </li>
            <li>This serum has strengthened my hair and improved its resiliency and makes it feel thick and smooth.</li>
            <li>but right after I put about a quarter size puddle in my hair while wet down to my roots to my ends, and that&#x27;s all I have to do each day.</li>
            <li>I find that when I put  a little too much (probably) it attracts dirt and dust to my hair.</li>

            <li> I discovered this serum 20 years ago, my sister who is a stylist brought home sample&#x27;s, it is mostly used on people with curly hair.</li>

            <li> that keeps your strands silky smooth and strengthens, repairs and revitalizes.</li>
            <li> Great product and so convenient to get this big amount at one time.</li>

            <li> and so light</li>

            <li> My hair has never been more healthy and less frizzy!</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased this product, but I&#x27;ve never had anything work better on my hair.  </li>

            <li> I love the larger size offered as well...</li>
            <li> I used to resort to a pretty sticky gel that would hold my curl</li>
            <li> My mother and I had the smaller size bottles  and were glad to see we could save by getting the 34 oz.</li>
            <li> Thanx so much!</li>
            <li> Only requires the size of a dime and your hair is silky smooth!</li>
            <li> It keeps it soft and frizz free.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I have a bit of a healthy hair obsession, and have tried numerous treatments, nothing works like Biosilk.  </li>
            <li> This bottle might last me a lifetime. :-)</li>
            <li> Be aware that the ingredients in the large bargain size</li>
            <li> I love this product for my flyaway, long curly hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a great deal and much cheaper than buying the smaller bottles sold in department and other stores.  </li>
            <li> I been searching 20 years for something to satisfy me and my hair, my hair has a life of its own being thicker then a lions mane and curly as can be without being a black woman</li>
            <li> Biosilk infuses into my hair, managing the frizz and maintaining a healthy looking dry curl.  </li>
            <li> I shampoo my hair with my favorite hair shampoo, rinse, and towel dry.  </li>
            <li> I was paying $29 and that was a better price for the 12oz bottle than just buying the single Silk Therapy alone.  </li>
            <li> the price for the amount is really amazing, Only Amazon can find such deals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product is used very sparking.</li>
            <li> I also noticed how all of the \\&quot;fuzziness\\&quot; on my hair was gone, and that it didn&#x27;t seem to tangle as much.  </li>
            <li> For that tousled-hair look that&#x27;s really \\&quot;in\\</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended!  </li>
            <li> Even stays smooth on the second day.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very silky.  </li>
            <li> it straight without drying it out.</li>
            <li> this product really helps in keeping my hair healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like this because it&#x27;s very lightweight.</li>
            <li> If I add a cream gel, my hair gets really curly.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> And I highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> bottle is much thinner.</li>
            <li> Really helps with my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying $40 for 1/3 of this size and finally found a presentation with great price for the size!</li>
            <li> makes hair silkier-  makes hair shinier and softer-  is best for long hair and can be used on dry or wet hair-</li>
            <li> It helps my long hair stay silky, and makes it easy to brush out after a bath.</li>
            <li> No discernible scent so safe for fragrance-free environments and works well with any number of other products &amp; brands.</li>
            <li> have tried many other products now and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m questioning if it is a knock off for a few reasons such as: the bottle was completely filled to the top</li>
            <li> love this to keep the frizz down esp with the warmer months coming</li>
            <li> The large bottle was well worth the price as I have smaller bottles</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shinier, more pliable, and causes less breakage.</li>
            <li> In addition, it makes your hands very soft after you put this product in your hair!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend product.  </li>
            <li> This product works very well, leaves my hair soft and silky without feeling or looking greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use anything else except my normal shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The wind can blow it and the curls will go right back.  </li>
            <li> It gives my hair a moisture without greasing it down, makes it easy to brush through, helps protect the ends.  </li>
            <li> Very natural solution and makes sense.</li>
            <li> it makes it very soft and touchable, which I like.  </li>
            <li> She stands about 5&#x27;7\\&quot; and her hair goes past her waistline to almost the bottom of her &#x27;cheeks&#x27; :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Biosilk for a long time now, and this bottle is so huge that it&#x27;s lasting me years!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very curly hair, damages easily, and hard to controll.</li>
            <li> I love Biosilk but it took a long time for me to get it in the mail, I may try a different vendor next time.</li>
            <li> Bought large bottle to refill smaller one for travel.</li>
            <li> put a little on my hands and put in my hear to keep it soft and tangle free.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it provide a natural shine, but it makes it very managable to style.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for years I have natural curly hair and it works wonders for the frizz..</li>
            <li> I also use on my legs to help them silky an soft</li>
            <li> Keeps my naturally curly hair from going all frizzy.</li>
            <li> This stuff turns it to soft silky hair.</li>
            <li> It not only works very well</li>
            <li> It might be pricey, but you don&#x27;t use much at all, just a nickel sized amount for me, and my hair reaches to my lower back.</li>
            <li> so i just kept the old bottle and poured this on into it for easier storage.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair silky soft (don&#x27;t overuse it, or it will make it oily).  </li>
            <li> Because of the cost in the stores, I began ordering it online where you can get the bigger bottles with a much lower price per ounce.</li>
            <li> My daughters are biracial and it is often difficult to find a good product for their curly hair.</li>
            <li> Little pricy but worth it!</li>
            <li> I know because when I use too much it leaves it flat and nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The main reason for this is that the solution in the larger 34 oz.</li>
            <li> I love using Biosilk and have been a regular user for the past year.  </li>
            <li> and I received exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I normally buy the smaller bottle cause</li>
            <li> I apply Biosilk both on wet, clean hair, and to my dry hair before and after styling.</li>
            <li> but since you use so little it is well worth it</li>
            <li> I finally figured out the problem that with age you loose much of your natural oil.</li>
            <li> I tried gel, sprays etc for several years and they worked but my hair did not look natural.</li>
            <li> and soft when I use it regularly.  </li>
            <li> This serum has strengthened my hair and improved its resiliency and makes it feel thick and smooth.</li>
            <li> but right after I put about a quarter size puddle in my hair while wet down to my roots to my ends, and that&#x27;s all I have to do each day.</li>
            <li> I find that when I put  a little too much (probably) it attracts dirt and dust to my hair.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way and if you use too much, your hair can look oily.</li>
            <li> I am 6&#x27;5&amp;#34; with long wavy hair to the middle of my back.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s only half way through the bottle so far.  </li>
            <li> not sure it really hydrates</li>
            <li> I do use a flat iron and this seems to protect it.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> and it really helps soften up the hard soles of the feet and the back of the elbow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she stated its the same as the one she has always bought from numerous other places, online or locally).</li>
            <li> This should last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> The container is larger than I had expected as well.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely order again!</li>
            <li> they are amazed with how long my hair is</li>
            <li> but it left my hair looking wet and synthetic.</li>
            <li> It helps to make the hair soft, silky and fluffy.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist uses it at the salon, so I got some a long time ago to use at home.  </li>
            <li> I also use this on my daughter who has thick, perfectly straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried using other similar products and they change the texture of my hair to course and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> She has very long hair</li>
            <li> Works well with dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I use Biosilk Silk Therapy as my leave-in conditioner and let my hair air dry.  </li>
            <li> Wish it were cheaper, but this Biosilk is a liver-saver for my dry, brittle hair.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses this product after washing and towel dry the hair.  </li>
            <li> Their coats are shine and silky soft after putting a small amount to their coat.</li>
            <li> wash my hair everyday and have perms put into too because I&#x27;m not fortunate enough to have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It smooths down like nothing else Ive tried and smells terrific.</li>
            <li> You only need a little as it goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I use it on my hair wet and dry.</li>
            <li> I live in the south where there is a lot of humidity, and applying a little of this every day helps to tame the frizz for my hair.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.  </li>
            <li> This product does leave hair feeling soft and silky but after repeated uses I found that it weighs hair down and makes it a look oily and slick.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry scalp and am extremely prone to dandruff .</li>
            <li> I apply it before, during and little after using a flat iron on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Wasting money on other similar products because they do not work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use it to soften up my skin much because of how expensive I felt the other bottles were</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years on my long thick hair as it is the only product that doesn&#x27;t grease up.</li>
            <li> a little goes A LONG WAY.  </li>
            <li> This product costs 60 bucks for a SMALL bottle at your local retailer.  </li>
            <li> I use other products to shape, a gel to make curls, etc.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair that can become frizzy if not treated correctly.  </li>
            <li> I cant imagine using any other product, I am hooked on it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other product but this and Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed to control frizz.</li>
            <li> In my mid 50s my hair became very dry and hard to manage.</li>
            <li> Would recommend getting a smaller bottle to put it in as this one is large and difficult to get just the small dab needed.  </li>
            <li> After towel drying my hair I rub in a small amount about mid length down to the tips and then comb through to distribute.  </li>
            <li> It helped to smooth out my hair so it didn&#x27;t look so bad.</li>
            <li> A very few drops go a long ways.</li>
            <li> It is not needed, or like others have said it will weight down your hair and leave it greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Biosilk Silk Therapy for years now and have suffered the cost of the bottles until a year and a half ago when I discovered the tri pack of conditioner, shampoo and the Silk Therapy.</li>
            <li> or it can weigh it down a little bit.</li>
            <li> I use it to tame down my frizzy curls.  </li>
            <li> like it was when I was a little girl.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse, curly hair, but this literally did make my hair feel like silk.  </li>
            <li> I use this Biosilk almost everyday.</li>
            <li> and when I use it I notice I do not have to wash hair everyday.</li>
            <li> My wife needed a refill as she uses this almost everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few leave-in hair products that I use</li>
            <li> Arrived within a few days</li>
            <li> ( use a round brush it helps stop the breakage)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products when I didn&#x27;t want to fork over the cost of it and have always felt sorry and went back to it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff -</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it makes my frizzy curls tame.</li>
            <li> No sticky mess!</li>
            <li> It takes just a dime size amount to do my long &amp; very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> A 34 ounce bottle usually lasts over a year, sometimes eighteen months depending on the length of my hair.</li>
            <li> I am still not sure about it.</li>
            <li> After shampooing, I can hardly get my fingers through it.</li>
            <li> I have crazy frizzy curly hair and have used biosilk for the last 15 + years.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s hair is thick, curly, and manageable.  </li>
            <li> (Some have stated in the past that the solution can be thin and diluted</li>
            <li> The dandruff not only looks terrible but also caauses extreme itchiness on my scalp and also part of my forehead where it falls.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair.  </li>
            <li> and I was not about to pay $100 for it although this product is always expensive.  </li>
            <li> Quite expensive though, &amp;</li>
            <li> Sadly they don&#x27;t have anymore.  </li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended Biosilk but it can be difficult to find in stores and very expensive when you do.</li>
            <li> I used this when my hair got burned by a bad perm.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this is the best stuff ever!!  It takes just a dime size amount to do my long &amp; very thick hair.  And any left over on your hands can be applied to your hands &amp; arms.</li>
            <li> In my mid 50s my hair became very dry and hard to manage. I tried gel, sprays etc for several years and they worked but my hair did not look natural. I finally figured out the problem that with age you loose much of your natural oil. Asking my hair dresser gave me the answer. This product is used very sparking. A very few drops go a long ways. It took about a week of daily use and then my hair came back to life. A great product, pricy but since you use so little it is well worth it and the results are wonderful. Very natural solution and makes sense.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.  Gives hair such a great shine and sleekness.  Bought large bottle to refill smaller one for travel.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years I have natural curly hair and it works wonders for the frizz..This product was a great size for the price so glad I found it on Amazon saves me bunches of money!!!!</li>
            <li> I discovered this serum about a year ago.  My hair is very fine and curly and breaks very easily just in the combing.  This serum has strengthened my hair and improved its resiliency.  I don&#x27;t have to use anything else except my normal shampoo and conditioner.  I&#x27;ve made this a permanent part of my hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> I use this Biosilk almost everyday. I have curly hair and it makes my frizzy curls tame. This big bottle has lasted me a year. Great Value!</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased this product, but I&#x27;ve never had anything work better on my hair.  I have very thick, coarse, curly hair, but this literally did make my hair feel like silk.  I also noticed how all of the \\&quot;fuzziness\\&quot; on my hair was gone, and that it didn&#x27;t seem to tangle as much.  For that tousled-hair look that&#x27;s really \\&quot;in\\&quot; right now, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> great product. came as described.</li>
            <li> Great product and good price! Use as body lotion too!</li>
            <li> I love Biosilk but it took a long time for me to get it in the mail, I may try a different vendor next time.</li>
            <li> This hair product is good at keeping your hair smooth....  If you are familiar with this product...BUY IT...This product costs 60 bucks for a SMALL bottle at your local retailer.  This 34 oz...lasts me about a year..and its a great product...</li>
            <li> I been searching 20 years for something to satisfy me and my hair, my hair has a life of its own being thicker then a lions mane and curly as can be without being a black woman haha. When my friend put this product in my hair about a year ago I heard angels sing.  I used to keep conditioner only in my hair because that&#x27;s all I could do, my hair would get immune to anything else, I still put conditioner in my hair and leave it in because I wouldn&#x27;t be Ble to comb it other wise but right after I put about a quarter size puddle in my hair while wet down to my roots to my ends, and that&#x27;s all I have to do each day. It&#x27;s been a year and never have I needed anything else. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily because my hair without it is extremely dry, this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I have always loved using this product and being able to purchase it at such a reasonable price is wonderful.  The service I received was outstanding and very prompt.  I will definately purchase from this vendor again!</li>
            <li> product arrived on time and in the condition described. was well-packaged. no leaks, cracks, etc. would order again.  as for the product itself, i love biosilk - have been using it for some time now. this is by far the best deal i&#x27;ve gotten on it thus far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m questioning if it is a knock off for a few reasons such as: the bottle was completely filled to the top, the liquid seemed separated, it doesn&#x27;t smell the same, and the bottle looked reused and discolored. I don&#x27;t think I will use another supplier from NY.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair care product and you just can&#x27;t beet the price for the quantity that you order</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have been using this product for years and it is a great way to protect your hair from over processing.  Not only does it provide a natural shine, but it makes it very managable to style.  I highly recommended!  Great for detangling hair!</li>
            <li> love this stuff and have used this for years.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and it arrived in great condition!  The container is larger than I had expected as well.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely order again!</li>
            <li> I used this when my hair got burned by a bad perm. It helped to smooth out my hair so it didn&#x27;t look so bad.</li>
            <li> Love the way biosilk makes my hair feel.  Would recommend getting a smaller bottle to put it in as this one is large and difficult to get just the small dab needed.  This size bottle should last me a year or 2.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love Biosilk Silk Therapy.  My hairstylist introduced me to the 34 oz. and I was not about to pay $100 for it although this product is always expensive.  I really liked the fact that Amazon provided me the same product at a fraction of the price.  I love the way it leaves my hair and the de freeze effect no matter what the weather is!</li>
            <li> Love this for keeping those fly-away gray hairs in place! Quite expensive though, &amp; this is a great price compared to local stores.</li>
            <li> This product adds shine and silkiness to any hair.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and love it.  This is the best price I have found anywhere for the size.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed...just go easy...a little goes A LONG WAY.  Enjoy</li>
            <li> i have been using this stuff for 20 years started using it when my mom got it from JC Penny they just stopped carrying it so i have to order from here. its way better then any stuff out there for your hair better than sleek and shine and ya only have to use a dime size drop. dosent leave your hair greesey and even makes your hands soft and smells great love it i will always use this stuff.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product for my wife and she loves it!!! She say is one of the best hair product she has ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Biosilk for making wonderful products she also have tried the shampoo and conditioner but for her the best product you have is the Biosilk Silk Therapy!!!!!</li>
            <li> I havent personally bought it from amazon but I have bought it at walmart &amp;&amp; it works awesome I bleach my hair probably like 4 times a month &amp;&amp; it feels awesome its as if i never even dyed it try it it really does work !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> If you want to get rid of fuzzy&#x27;s this is the product.  It&#x27;s the best with no buildup or plastic looking hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been more healthy and less frizzy! I apply Biosilk both on wet, clean hair, and to my dry hair before and after styling. The oil seal protects my hair from heat damage. The smell is absolutely amazing! Worth the purchase price alone! But with my coarse, medium curly hair the benefits are just as great as the smell. I highly recommend this product. A 34 ounce bottle usually lasts over a year, sometimes eighteen months depending on the length of my hair. Right now my hair is to my shoulder blades. It&#x27;s always touchable soft and perfectly shiny, without appearing oily. I&#x27;ve been told it can be used on the skin as well, but I find I need face lotion as well. I am so glad I found this product!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Prevents hair from drying out.Silk-infused  that keeps your strands silky smooth and strengthens, repairs and revitalizes. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my flyaway, long curly hair.  It gives my hair a moisture without greasing it down, makes it easy to brush through, helps protect the ends.  My hair seems to drink it in.  Great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a styling gel. It does nothing to style my hair, just helps make my hair manageable.  I use other products to shape, a gel to make curls, etc.  Biosilk protects and calms my hair.  Hope this is useful.  And is smells great, not too strong but has a clean, nice fragrance.  It is one of the things I literally can&#x27;t do without.</li>
            <li> Biosilk Silk Therapy is by far the very best product we have ever purchased. My daughter has very curly hair, damages easily, and hard to controll. We ran out of biosilk for about six months. My daughter had to have 8 inches of damage cut off her hair. WE WILL NEVER RUN OUT OF BIOSILK EVER AGAIN. Love, love, love this product. A+++++++++++++</li>
            <li> I have been using Biosilk Therapy for years.  I am hooked on it.  I use it right after I shower...put a little on my hands and put in my hear to keep it soft and tangle free.  I also use on my legs to help them silky an soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen such a Big bottle of Biosilk!, what a great deal! I love this product. Biosilk is great product you don&#x27;t have to use much and when I use it I notice I do not have to wash hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Great product and so convenient to get this big amount at one time. It will be a year&#x27;s worth of quantity.</li>
            <li> Best product I have found yet for keeping my very curly/wavy hair neat and frizz free.  Even stays smooth on the second day.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Keeps my naturally curly hair from going all frizzy. Be mindful of the instructions. A little does go a long way and if you use too much, your hair can look oily. No discernible scent so safe for fragrance-free environments and works well with any number of other products &amp; brands. I use it at home and keep a smaller bottle in my swim bag.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and every time I go to get my hair trimmed they are amazed with how long my hair is and I don&#x27;t have  as many split ends a person that doesn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> For 34 ounces, it&#x27;s a great buy compared to the smaller bottles sold in hair salons. Would make this purchase again any day.  Hopefully this purchase will last a while.  Highly recommend product.  Works well with dry hair.  Makes it shine too, smells great.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. This is the best price I have found on it. Thanks.</li>
            <li> this is the second time purchase of this biosilk therapy from the same porvider.  The cheapest in price from the Amazon list of this product!  Very fast in delivery!</li>
            <li> My wife needed a refill as she uses this almost everyday. Amazon had the cheapest price around for the size and the bottle came sealed and with no issues, She was very happy. (Some have stated in the past that the solution can be thin and diluted, I asked her about it and she stated its the same as the one she has always bought from numerous other places, online or locally).</li>
            <li> I have used this products several years, my hair looks better, smooth, shinier. I love it, I have recommended it to my cousin and she likes it too.</li>
            <li> Biosilk Therapy Hair Treatment is great and I&#x27;m glad that I found out about the product. It leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny without feeling oily and I have noticed healthy hair growth since using the product.  It&#x27;s one of the few leave-in hair products that I use and I plan to purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> This products does wonders for my frizzy hair without leaving it greasy.  I love the smell of it as well.</li>
            <li> Great for all hair types.  I have thin hair.  I apply it before, during and little after using a flat iron on my hair.  Leaves hair very silky.  Smells great too. Good on my curly hair..helps softens it.</li>
            <li> I am still not sure about it. I find that when I put  a little too much (probably) it attracts dirt and dust to my hair. The second day my hair is not as nice, in fact it looks good if I do not brush it. I have waved hair naturally and this product gives nice curls but as soon as I brush it, my hair does not look good and I ma not sure it really hydrates, I think it is more &amp;#34;cosmetic&amp;#34; than nourishing.</li>
            <li> Great product! My daughters are biracial and it is often difficult to find a good product for their curly hair. It maintains beautiful moisturized curls and also easily allows them to flat iron it straight without drying it out. My hair dresser recommended Biosilk but it can be difficult to find in stores and very expensive when you do. I love the larger size offered as well... Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> The Biosilk arrived very quickly and packaged well. There was no loss of this wonderful product. Silk is a great descriptive word -- that&#x27;s just how it feels as I apply it to my hair!</li>
            <li> This product works very well, leaves my hair soft and silky without feeling or looking greasy. Just make sure to use it on the ends of your hair and not on the roots or it can weigh it down a little bit.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best purchases I made in 2009. I have used it every day since October and still am only about 10 percent through the bottle. Makes my hair shinier, more pliable, and causes less breakage. I didn&#x27;t know if it would be worth it but it turns out to have been quite a bargain for the value.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair that can become frizzy if not treated correctly.  I used to resort to a pretty sticky gel that would hold my curl but it left my hair looking wet and synthetic. Biosilk infuses into my hair, managing the frizz and maintaining a healthy looking dry curl.  I love it!</li>
            <li> My mother and I had the smaller size bottles  and were glad to see we could save by getting the 34 oz. bottle and dividing it.</li>
            <li> I received the product in a timely manner!  I have been using this product for years and am very happy with it!  Thanx so much!</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my hair feel soft and smells nice. Got this for a great price!</li>
            <li> I have used this since 1999...Only requires the size of a dime and your hair is silky smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying for years. Best hair product I&#x27;ve ever found. This was a replacement for my last big bottle that lasted four years</li>
            <li> I get my coarse white hair dyed and highlighted every 5 weeks. After shampooing, I can hardly get my fingers through it. It feels like I went to the barn and grabbed a handful of hay. This stuff turns it to soft silky hair. There&#x27;s nothing else I&#x27;ve ever found that works this well.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff and it keeps her hair healthy and smooth. Amazon had it on here for a great price and it lasts her well over a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Biosilk and just wanted a larger supply.  It&#x27;s a wonderful conditioner for my gray hair.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> LUV luv luv this product! I have been using it for years on my long thick hair as it is the only product that doesn&#x27;t grease up. I do use a flat iron and this seems to protect it. You only need a little as it goes a long way!  Farouk was one of my father&#x27;s childhood friends and I would buy any product he uses!</li>
            <li> No complaints here would order from them again and would recommend this to my family &amp; friends. My mother and I love it; it feels great and does not leave a greasy/oily film on your head. Thank you again for everything!</li>
            <li> I’ve purchased this product from the same seller twice.  It is the same product that you would buy in a salon.  Prior to purchasing it on Amazon, I bought this product for over 10 years at a local salon.  This works great on my fine, curly hair.  It keeps it soft and frizz free.  I also use this on my daughter who has thick, perfectly straight hair.  Her hair stays frizz free and it helps with the tangles.</li>
            <li> This seller is fair and honest. Great products at a fabulous price! Thank you! Bio silk serum is the best for curly frizzy hair. It softens and leaves you hair looking shiny and healthy, without the clumpy product feel or look.</li>
            <li> Biosilk is wonderful for getting the frizz out of your hair.  It goes on easily and&lt;br /&gt;leaves a nice shine to your hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product from almost 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;I perm and color treat my hair. this product really helps in keeping my hair healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many other products now and then but I always come back to this one.Nothing works like this one.&lt;br /&gt;Its non greasy, gives a good shine to the hair.can be used on the skin too.After applying on the hair, I rub the left over on my arms.It smells good and so light you wont even notice it on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;And the price for the amount is really amazing, Only Amazon can find such deals.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. I cant imagine using any other product, I am hooked on it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as promised and well packeged.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product like 7 years ago. The only product I put in my hair and go!</li>
            <li> Arrived within a few days and I received exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It keeps me from developing split ends for more than 1 year and keeps my hair soft and silky without frizz.</li>
            <li> I have crazy frizzy curly hair and have used biosilk for the last 15 + years. Over the years I have tried using other similar products and they change the texture of my hair to course and unmanageable.  I always come back to biosilk. It keeps my hair soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li> When I discovered Bio Silk, my hair was suffering from a thyroid deficiency - Yikes! - falling out and fuzzy.  Bio Silk is a hair restorer.  It eliminates split ends and drabness.  My hair is shiny, growing back (Yay!) and soft when I use it regularly.  My husband&#x27;s hair is thick, curly, and manageable.  Just a tiny bit goes a long way.  You know why it&#x27;s called Bio Silk.  The perfect name for a perfect product.</li>
            <li> I like this because it&#x27;s very lightweight. It smells great and makes my hair really easy to comb through. I use it on my hair wet and dry.</li>
            <li> Great product I&#x27;ve used for years. Fantastic fragrance, too! As the bottle says, it&#x27;s intended for hair, but also nourishes skin.</li>
            <li> Product smelled good and is lasting a long time, good price for my order when I need more i will order from them again</li>
            <li> This is a great deal and much cheaper than buying the smaller bottles sold in department and other stores.  It sounds like a lot to spend; but if you can afford to splurge and spend a bit more all at once, then this is the best way to go...This should last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> Frankly I was looking for such 34 Oz bottle and could not find it, this is an excellent deal, with best price so far, it is real deal, and I received it on time in pristine condition,  I recommend you to get the larger size 34 oz.</li>
            <li> Have used for years. Great for a body lotion or hair.  Works great on legs for someone to pull on support hose after&lt;br /&gt;a hip operation or knee surgery.</li>
            <li> I discovered this serum 20 years ago, my sister who is a stylist brought home sample&#x27;s, it is mostly used on people with curly hair. I have lots of hair but it is fine and Flat and breaks very easily just in the combing.( use a round brush it helps stop the breakage)  This serum has strengthened my hair and improved its resiliency and makes it feel thick and smooth. I have looked at other products and found this to be the best for the buck. DO NOT USE A LOT!!! It is not needed, or like others have said it will weight down your hair and leave it greasy. I know because when I use too much it leaves it flat and nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is the BEST for people with eczema; My friend even used it on her dogs skin problems&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others claim to be good&lt;br /&gt;Avada 27.00 for 2.4oz&lt;br /&gt;PAUL MITCHELL: SUPER SKINNY SERUM 27. For 8.5 oz ( better buy over the aveda ) but just ok&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is better&lt;br /&gt;I have tried them all; and with a sister who gets the stuff for free it is easy to try them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had found three 24oz bottles on close out 7 years ago in my local kroger for 5.00 a bottle. Now it is time to buy more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Biosilk Silk Therapy for years now and have suffered the cost of the bottles until a year and a half ago when I discovered the tri pack of conditioner, shampoo and the Silk Therapy. I was paying $29 and that was a better price for the 12oz bottle than just buying the single Silk Therapy alone.  This seems like it is a lot of money but mathmatically you will save A LOT by buy it this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair everyday and have perms put into too because I&#x27;m not fortunate enough to have naturally curly hair.  The stylists are always amazed at how great my hair is, no split ends, no dry shafts.  When they find out that I use this they don&#x27;t even bother trying to sell me their salon products because obviously it works and works well.  I don&#x27;t even use conditioner on a regular basis, just a quarter size, or larger as my hair gets longer, of Silk Therapy and it does the trick and makes my hair smell super on top of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  I&#x27;ve tried other products when I didn&#x27;t want to fork over the cost of it and have always felt sorry and went back to it.  Wasting money on other similar products because they do not work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use it to soften up my skin much because of how expensive I felt the other bottles were but now I don&#x27;t mind and it really helps soften up the hard soles of the feet and the back of the elbow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this size!</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair look sleek, shiny and healthy. It is worth every penny.  Just make sure you do not use to much product because it can make you hair look greasy. With just a wee amount this product last forever and will make your hair look great.  I don&#x27;t use any other product but this and Shampoo and Conditioner. My hair no longer needs gel or moose to smooth it out!</li>
            <li> I truly love, love, love this product!  I have wavy/curly hair and I&#x27;ve tried many, many, products over the years to try to get my curl more defined.  Nothing worked until I tried Biosilk Silk Therapy.  What a difference!  I shampoo my hair with my favorite hair shampoo, rinse, and towel dry.  I use Biosilk Silk Therapy as my leave-in conditioner and let my hair air dry.  Sometimes I don&#x27;t even have to use any additional products and my hair has nice beach look waves.  My hair looks healthy and glossy.  If I add a cream gel, my hair gets really curly.  I love Biosilk!  I also use it on my skin, especially after I have shaved my legs.  The fragrance is really nice too.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I use Biosilk Silk Therapy on regular day basis. It makes my hair all shaped-up the way I want it. I&#x27;m very happy with this product! Plus, you&#x27;re saving tones of money, buying this product in such volume! And I highly recommend it to everyone! You may also go ahead and order Biosilk 33.8 oz Liter Pump (sold by Amazon!) You&#x27;re gonna need it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and people always compliment me on the way my hair smells.  I use it to tame down my frizzy curls.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff - it makes it very soft and touchable, which I like.  The wind can blow it and the curls will go right back.  NO FRIZZ!  In addition, it makes your hands very soft after you put this product in your hair!  No sticky mess!</li>
            <li> My fiancee loves this.  She has very long hair and this keeps it looking healthy and vibrant even in her 40&#x27;s (don&#x27;t tell her I said that!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to add that I purchased this August 2013 and the price was $53.99 through Empire Shop here on Amazon.  Sadly they don&#x27;t have anymore.  Even at the current price it&#x27;s a great deal compared to the store.  She&#x27;s only half way through the bottle so far.  She stands about 5&#x27;7\\&quot; and her hair goes past her waistline to almost the bottom of her &#x27;cheeks&#x27; :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People have told her there are people out there that would kill for her hair, ask her for what she does, what products she uses, etc.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years on skin &amp; hair. It is wonderful &amp; that&#x27;s why I purchase it in bulk size. Amazon has always been great to work with &amp; provided everything they have promised with each purchase I have made. Thank you, DC</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different hair products Biosilk Therapy is the best by far!!!!! It not only works very well but it is the most awesome smelling hair product ever. No kidding this is a wonderful product! !!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice item arrived on time</li>
            <li> I have a bit of a healthy hair obsession, and have tried numerous treatments, nothing works like Biosilk.  It makes my hair feel smooth and shiny like it was when I was a little girl.  After towel drying my hair I rub in a small amount about mid length down to the tips and then comb through to distribute.  It might be pricey, but you don&#x27;t use much at all, just a nickel sized amount for me, and my hair reaches to my lower back. This bottle might last me a lifetime. :-)</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed to control frizz. Easy to use and smells good. Buying the larger size saves quite a bit of $, also.</li>
            <li> Wish it were cheaper, but this Biosilk is a liver-saver for my dry, brittle hair.  It smooths down like nothing else Ive tried and smells terrific.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it! for years she bought a 4oz bottle from her hair dresser for about the same price as the 34oz bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Biosilk for a long time now, and this bottle is so huge that it&#x27;s lasting me years! I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My huband uses it as well. The large bottle was well worth the price as I have smaller bottles &amp; I just refill them. This not only makes my hair soft and managable but smells so good. It is one of the best hair treatments I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Be aware that the ingredients in the large bargain size Biosilk Silk Therapy is different from the smaller bottle. Compare for yourself. Also, one reviewer said she liked the smaller bottle better because she could pour out a smaller amount. The main reason for this is that the solution in the larger 34 oz. bottle is much thinner.</li>
            <li> I normally buy the smaller bottle cause it is easier to store but i couldn&#x27;t beat the price on this so i just kept the old bottle and poured this on into it for easier storage. love this to keep the frizz down esp with the warmer months coming</li>
            <li> I love using Biosilk and have been a regular user for the past year.  I have a very dry scalp and am extremely prone to dandruff . The dandruff not only looks terrible but also caauses extreme itchiness on my scalp and also part of my forehead where it falls. Biosilk keeps all this away and the best thing is that it is non greasy and keeps my hair looking healthy and normal</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product after washing and towel dry the hair.  It helps to make the hair soft, silky and fluffy. It&#x27;s also perfect for my three dogs after washing their paws and bears. I have two miniature schnauzers with log bears.  Their coats are shine and silky soft after putting a small amount to their coat. No need for conditioning if you use it for washing dogs.</li>
            <li> I use this EVERY day.  My hair stylist uses it at the salon, so I got some a long time ago to use at home.  I live in the south where there is a lot of humidity, and applying a little of this every day helps to tame the frizz for my hair. Not to say it will work the same on everyone&#x27;s hair.  Don&#x27;t use on your roots or it will make your hair oily.  I get compliments ALL the time about how good my hair smells.  My fiancee loves the fragrance as well. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years.  It makes your hair silky soft (don&#x27;t overuse it, or it will make it oily).  When I run out, my hair is so much different.  Because of the cost in the stores, I began ordering it online where you can get the bigger bottles with a much lower price per ounce.</li>
            <li> makes hair silkier-  makes hair shinier and softer-  is best for long hair and can be used on dry or wet hair-</li>
            <li> an item or product that gives the best value for money an item or product that gives the best value for money out of all its competitors. out of all its competitors.</li>
            <li> Little pricy but worth it!</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying $40 for 1/3 of this size and finally found a presentation with great price for the size!, I have been using this product for years and my hair has never felt healthier and without frizz!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  It helps my long hair stay silky, and makes it easy to brush out after a bath.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my hair shiny and smooth</li>
            <li> Great product at a great value. Most sources for this product charge a great deal more, so this is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Really helps with my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I am 6&#x27;5&amp;#34; with long wavy hair to the middle of my back.  I couldn&#x27;t comb through my hair without this product.  And I am complimented on the smell all the time.</li>
            <li> This product does leave hair feeling soft and silky but after repeated uses I found that it weighs hair down and makes it a look oily and slick. I found that it works better on skin.</li>
            <li> Great and awesome it comes in large quantity</li>
    </ol>
