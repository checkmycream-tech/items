            <li>The final test was still to come, however... and I am happy to say that even through three happy endings to her oratory skills, the lipstick was -still- on her lips and not on the microphone!  </li>
            <li>It stays on for many hours, and there are great colors available.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to remove with make-up remover.</li>

            <li>Love this color from Revlon</li>
            <li>Was happy to find it at Amazon and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite lipstick.</li>
            <li>This is the best lip stain ever, it says on for over a day, the next day I will still have some on unless I scrub it off!!</li>
            <li>I love this lip color it stays on until I take it off .  </li>
            <li>I have used this lipstick for years and love how it stays on all day.</li>
            <li>I love Revlon Colorstay Liquid Lipstick.  </li>
            <li>I love this all day lipcolor.  </li>
            <li>I love this lipstick.  </li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this color in the stores anymore, thankfully I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the ordering was easy, amazon makes life easy</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>BUT, when opened, both seemed fine.</li>
            <li>order came quickly!</li>
            <li>Received product in a timely manner, packaging was good, produce was sealed and in good condition, however, one of the tubes seems a little dated.</li>
            <li>No longer available in Australia, so buying it from US via Amazon was fabulous.</li>
            <li>Oh well&lt;br /&gt;Purchased now while available.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still available through Amazon.</li>
            <li>So put a lot on, rub your lips quickly, then let it set, it feels smooth after that.</li>
            <li>Color stays on pretty much the whole day, great color.  </li>
            <li>True I don&#x27;t like putting on lip color every hour.</li>
            <li>The application process is more precise with the wand than used to be true with the solid stick lipstick.  </li>
            <li>but now like this one as it&#x27;s a deeper color but still kind of neutral overall.</li>
            <li>She ate a -burger- with this stuff on and it all stayed right on her lips where it was meant to.</li>
            <li>would like to subscribe very much for your dear to me</li>
            <li>Imagine my dismay when I went to 3or4 different stores and could no longer find my favorite, evidently it had been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>and it still looks pretty good 8 hours later, after eating several times.  </li>
            <li>I tell you that my shipment in the very beauty and magnificence</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put on too much, or it can get blotchy.  </li>
            <li>love the lipstick, last all day, lips are soft.  </li>
            <li>Apply lightly for more natural look or harder for deep red/pink.</li>
            <li>A little more red than brown, but still very pretty!</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s not usually one for lipstick because she hates having to reapply it every twenty minutes.</li>
            <li>When I first purchased this lipstick at my local pharmacy</li>
            <li>This is a very natural looking dark red color, more a stain than an opaque color.  </li>
            <li>I do use a clear gloss overtop.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It really does last through the day, meals etc.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect that I had finally found the right shade of lip color, I was never happy with any of the other shades I had chosen, but finally my all time favorite at last.  </li>
            <li>At first it may seem a little drying to the lips, but your body soon adjusts to that.  </li>
            <li>I love this color, and its hard to find!!</li>

            <li> I have such a hard time finding lipstick that stays on and this lipstick solves that problem.  </li>
            <li> I put a thin coat on in the mornings around 7 a.m., put some gloss over it (Moxie by Bare Essentials!)</li>

            <li> I recommend this to those who want a truly long lasting lip color that doesn&#x27;t look fake.  </li>

            <li> It has been my everyday lipstick ....</li>

            <li> Love this lipstick... First thing I put on in the morning and have to remove it at night - great formula for me! No longer available in Australia, so buying it from US via Amazon was fabulous.</li>
            <li> Beautiful  color, stays on many  hours. There&#x27;s  still a tint of color at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> My wife picked this up for sale at the local store. She&#x27;s not usually one for lipstick because she hates having to reapply it every twenty minutes. Well, let me tell you this one stays on. There&#x27;s no need for reapplication here. She ate a -burger- with this stuff on and it all stayed right on her lips where it was meant to. Then, we spent some sloppy make out time, and still the lipstick held true! The final test was still to come, however... and I am happy to say that even through three happy endings to her oratory skills, the lipstick was -still- on her lips and not on the microphone!  I could not recommend this lipstick enough. Ladies, your man will thank you. And men, you&#x27;ll be happy you bought this for her.</li>
            <li> Love that color, keep making it, stores don&#x27;&#x27;t have it anymore!</li>
            <li> Terrific! I have such a hard time finding lipstick that stays on and this lipstick solves that problem.  When I put it on in the morning, I can still see it at night, it is still on!  I did not find it drying at all.</li>
            <li> Dries my lips. Color is more pinikish on me.</li>
            <li> Love this. Was discontinued in stores.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this lipstick at my local pharmacy I really didn&#x27;t expect that I had finally found the right shade of lip color, I was never happy with any of the other shades I had chosen, but finally my all time favorite at last.  Imagine my dismay when I went to 3or4 different stores and could no longer find my favorite, evidently it had been discontinued.  So glad I could find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> So put a lot on, rub your lips quickly, then let it set, it feels smooth after that. They have never made my lips dry. I&#x27;ve always put chap stick before, even with these. I don&#x27;t usually reapply either, these I didn&#x27;t have to. I have some Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Hibiscus tinted lip balm that I put on later in the day, even over this lipstick, didn&#x27;t affect the color at all. A little more red than brown, but still very pretty!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for many years.  Sorry it&#x27;s being phased out.  It has been my everyday lipstick .... Oh well&lt;br /&gt;Purchased now while available.</li>
            <li> Love this color from Revlon and I cannot find it at any retail store, as I think it has been discontinued.  Was happy to find it at Amazon and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel good on my lips, and doesnt stay on good. I would not purchase this again!</li>
            <li> This stuff stays put!  I like it best of every lipstick I&#x27;ve tried.  Sometimes it&#x27;s still on the next morning.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t buy this in the store anymore it&#x27;s been discontinued. It&#x27;s my favorite lipstick. Stays on all day and&lt;br /&gt;my lips don&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
            <li> I love this color, and its hard to find!! This is the best lip stain ever, it says on for over a day, the next day I will still have some on unless I scrub it off!!</li>
            <li> dear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to subscribe very much for your dear to me and I want to be a client I have you to&lt;br /&gt;And I tell you that my shipment in the very beauty and magnificence</li>
            <li> Received product in a timely manner, packaging was good, produce was sealed and in good condition, however, one of the tubes seems a little dated. Signs of cracking in the tube usually means it&#x27;s aged a little. BUT, when opened, both seemed fine.</li>
            <li> I did not like the color so I gave it to my daughter, it stays on well. I wish it had been a lighter color</li>
            <li> I love this lip color it stays on until I take it off .  It lasts for 12 hrs. Color stays. True I don&#x27;t like putting on lip color every hour.</li>
            <li> I have used this lipstick for years and love how it stays on all day. The color is perfect for me and I cannot find it anywhere anymore. Very happy to be able to get it through Amazon. Came within a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Would consider ordering again. Color stays on pretty much the whole day, great color.  Very easy to remove with make-up remover.</li>
            <li> I like this brand and this specific type of liquid lipstick and was getting a different color but now like this one as it&#x27;s a deeper color but still kind of neutral overall. I recommend this to those who want a truly long lasting lip color that doesn&#x27;t look fake.  It really does last through the day, meals etc.</li>
            <li> love the lipstick, last all day, lips are soft.  order came quickly! I love the ordering was easy, amazon makes life easy</li>
            <li> I love Revlon Colorstay Liquid Lipstick.  It stays on for many hours, and there are great colors available.  At first it may seem a little drying to the lips, but your body soon adjusts to that.  I was just sick that Revlon discontinued selling this product in the market I live in.  Thank goodness it&#x27;s still available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this all day lipcolor.  I do use a clear gloss overtop.&lt;br /&gt;This is my shade.  And hard to find!</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick.  It is shiny and stays on all day.  I put it on in the morning and it still looks pretty good 8 hours later, after eating several times.  Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day. Love the color. Apply lightly for more natural look or harder for deep red/pink.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN WEARING THIS LIPSTICK FOR A LONGTIME AND AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IT HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup freak, especially lipstick.  Revlon ColorStay is the best stuff I can find if you like all-day wear that doesn&#x27;t chap your lips. I&#x27;ve tried all the expensive stuff and nothin matches up.  I put a thin coat on in the mornings around 7 a.m., put some gloss over it (Moxie by Bare Essentials!) and at 3:00 it&#x27;s still there!  Even after coffee and lunch.  I have about 8 tubes of this stuff in all kinds of shades. I like experimenting with it as a base and trying different glosses for the finish. Thank you Revlon!</li>
            <li> Love the color! Add a little gloss over it so it&#x27;s not so drying. . .</li>
            <li> This lipstick is great - It stays on all day and is a beautiful color.  I couldn&#x27;t find this color in the stores anymore, thankfully I was able to find it on Amazon. Love it.</li>
            <li> not sure if the one I received was just old or expired but I threw it away after trying it... didn&#x27;t even keep it on for an hour.</li>
            <li> This is a very natural looking dark red color, more a stain than an opaque color.  The application process is more precise with the wand than used to be true with the solid stick lipstick.  Don&#x27;t put on too much, or it can get blotchy.  The product will last longest  if you let it dry and apply a second coat.  I&#x27;ve had it last for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Best lipstick I&#x27;ve ever used!  Stays on all day and color lasts till you take it off.</li>
            <li> its perfect, the color stays on all day and at the end of the day, you can remove it with baby oil.</li>
            <li> This is THE perfect color for me and it appears to be discontinued. I can not find it anymore. Please reconsider Revlon!</li>
            <li> A very long wearing; long lasting lipstick. Revlon colorstay is a very good product.  I can no longer buy it at the store as Revlon changed to a mineral lipstick that does not last.</li>
