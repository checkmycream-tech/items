            <li> Sorry I wanted so long to give them a try; expected to be sensitive to retinol, but no problems.</li>
            <li> I will say this, the creams are a bit heavy when applied and the eye gel, tends to crystallize, so it feels grainy when applied.</li>
            <li> , that is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> use Oil of Olay- don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> this is a miracle in a small bottle.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really get rid of any wrinkles  :(</li>
            <li> Not extremely impressed with products.  </li>
            <li> Sorry I meant to give this product 5 stars which I feel it does deserve.</li>
            <li> The day cream has a horrible after taste.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love these products. Quality and price are on point for me.</li>
            <li> It is too soon to tell. Since the items depends on regular use of product. Maybe when I am out of the product and evaluate the results of using it. At that time I will be able to give an honest review. I will say this, the creams are a bit heavy when applied and the eye gel, tends to crystallize, so it feels grainy when applied. I will still use it and only time will tell if the Retinol lives up to its reputation.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Five full size products at a great price, and they all work very well. I have already purchased a second time. My new skincare system!</li>
            <li> Works just as well as products that cost 4 times as much. I wish the Retinol serum came in a larger size.  It gets used up faster than the other products.</li>
            <li> The product was received on time and we were satisfied with the all items.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good skin cleansing product and makes your skin soft, but nothing amazing or fantastic. Doesn&#x27;t really get rid of any wrinkles  :(</li>
            <li> These products are amazing and work!! Arrived quickly and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Best I have ever used</li>
            <li> I love everything they have!!! I have used the serum, face wipes, eye gel,  day and night cream and I love the results!!  No one believes that I am 45 years old and I will continue using these, great price as well!</li>
            <li> nice stuff  I love L De L and im a man  I look great  and I know it is the retinol  lol hahahahah I wont age</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in MY skin within 2 days.  Wrinkles on my 73-yr.-old face seemed softer( no kidding! Just like all the ads say!) The price for the package was great, but I wish there had been more explicit usage instructions included for the women who haven&#x27;t yet tried these products.  The Night Cream is lovely and thick and I also used it on my &amp;#34;crepey&amp;#34; forearm skin!!</li>
            <li> I love how this cream makes my skin look and feel. It works better than the expensive creams that I have used at half the price. I am 52 yrs. old and everyone comments on how nice my skin looks. Its not greasy and absorbs quickly into the skin. I use all of the products twice a day and will continue to use them. I would definitely recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be getting standard sizes; some were smaller.  This is my fault as I didn&#x27;t read it all carefully.  I have been using the product for almost a year now and really like it, but I will be buying them separately from now on.</li>
            <li> Sorry, thought this would be a great product for my skin.  After 3 days of use. Every pore on my face burned. Had to stop using it! Maybe others will love it, but it&#x27;s not for me.....</li>
            <li> Not extremely impressed with products.  I&#x27;ll give it another three weeks...do not like tge eye gel, that is a waste of money. Use Aloe Vera if you want an eye opener ir softener. The day cream and night cream are okay....I dont feel either give any feel to brag to my skin about..</li>
            <li> I loved the product and thank the seller on the speed of delivery</li>
            <li> I love this product and you can&#x27;t beat the price, the product feels nice on face and hands and also you can use in hair lightly . Sorry I meant to give this product 5 stars which I feel it does deserve.</li>
            <li> Best face products I&#x27;ve ever used!  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I want to say excellent,  but. we will see in 20_30 days</li>
            <li> this is a miracle in a small bottle.It makes my face and neck supple and smooth.I am lost for words,its just amazing!!!</li>
            <li> This product is very good it makes my face feels very soft and younger looking.</li>
            <li> I have been using this before and purchased this specific set for my mom on mother&#x27;s day. I think it is wonderful and actually works.</li>
            <li> The facial cleanser leaves a film on my face. The day cream has a horrible after taste. If it get it too close to my lips or nose I have an after taste in my mouth and my nose (it&#x27;s like I smell it till I wash my face again). The day cream leaves a waxiness on my skin. They serum bottles were less than half full. Save your money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the packaging of these products and the price for the varietal assortment. Since I use many retinol products, it is nice to supply oneself with the variety offered. And the units of vitamin A are at the upper threshold compared to most products I survey. It&#x27;s a good deal and represents well what I expect from your company.&lt;br /&gt;J.W Harris</li>

            <li> This is a product that works well for me .  The shipping time was accurate</li>
            <li> I had these products a week an am happy with the results I&#x27;m already seeing. Soaks in well, tighter skin and reduced puffiness under eyes. Makeup goes on smoothly over for great coverage. I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
            <li> Love, love these products.  Sorry I wanted so long to give them a try; expected to be sensitive to retinol, but no problems.</li>
            <li> I like these products - they are the only things that I have purchased for my skin where I can really tell a difference after using them.</li>
            <li> Am still using my first shipment and so far so good.  I really think it is helping to keep my skin wrinkle free.  I was lucky to have inherited good genes so I have just some wrinkles between my lips and nose, otherwise at 77 I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles to speak of.  Sure wish I could find something to take care of the upper lip area.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.</li>
