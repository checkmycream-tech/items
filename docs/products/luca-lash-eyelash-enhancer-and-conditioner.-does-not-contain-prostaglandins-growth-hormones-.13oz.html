            <li>you want longer lashes that can be seen, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product and plan to continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I am happy to have a safer option to grow my lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not going to give you the result I experienced.</li>
            <li>People have been telling me I look great</li>
            <li>After months of faithful use, I experienced no &amp;#34;enhancement&amp;#34; of my eyelashes whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>This is the best and most effective eye lashes conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>good product</li>
            <li>I checked the reviews on Amazon and it seemed like a good buy.  </li>
            <li>but it was good for about 6 months.  </li>
            <li>it &#x27;s not a bad product just not the best.</li>
            <li>Thought, \\&quot;well its kind of pricey, but so was latisse\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I felt that I was on the right track and surely would notice great improvement within 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>I would purchase again, don&#x27;t know if I will if it stays at $20 more than what I paid for it though.</li>
            <li>(yikes, I love my hazel eyes), but I am happy to report this stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>Look for a reputable retailer selling it at it&#x27;s SRP.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps you have to use it for more than a month to see a change, BUT, i&#x27;ve used rapidlash before and noticed a change within a week.</li>
            <li>But I do the top and the bottom.</li>
            <li>After the 1st week or so I noticed that my lashes curled better when using an eyelash curler and</li>
            <li>I have seen some difference in more eyelashes since I started using this product about a month ago.</li>

            <li>Don&#x27;t always believe \\&quot;More for Less\\&quot; as it surely did not apply to this purchase.  </li>
            <li>If the conditioner can help to thicken my lashes, that we even be better, or may be it will take some more time before I can see the effect.</li>
            <li>but this is just ok.  </li>
            <li>Its easy to use</li>
            <li>I still apply mascara, but one quick sweep does so much more than it used to.  </li>
            <li>I purchased mine through nomorerack and gulped a bit even at their deeply discounted price, but it proved to be a great investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I will not pay full price when my $20.</li>
            <li>but I am thrilled with this result so far!  </li>
            <li>All good enough reasons to steer me to nontoxic LUCA.</li>
            <li>That worked wonders for full lashes..</li>

            <li>have been using it for about a month and have to say my eyelashes are much fuller and somewhat longer than before.........</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see much change in length.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for and in this case you would have to apply 2 x a day for it to work really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products that work better</li>
            <li>Thought Luca Lash would work really well given the high price, but haven&#x27;t noticed a change at all.</li>
            <li>I am 63 years old and after a life-time of using mascara and eyelash curlers, my lashes were pretty scraggly.  </li>

            <li>When not wearing mascara my lashes look exactly the same as they looked before using this product.</li>
            <li>It is not a dramatic change, but my lashes are definitely fuller - not longer -</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive eyes, and I was hesitant on paying 60 dollars for this stuff.</li>
            <li>and my lashes are nearly invisible.  </li>
            <li>So far I believe it&#x27;s working.</li>

            <li> is one of the few products on the market that does not use prostaglandin or prostaglandin analogs, and it works.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks I noticed increased eyelash length and by three weeks there was marked increase in eyelash length and number.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have bin using this product every night for over 2 months now, and I don&#x27;t feel the difference, as if I&#x27;m applying water on my eyelashes...</li>
            <li> Oh yeah you want longer lashes that can be seen, this is perfect. You must be vigilant and not quit putting it on. It works people it works. Crazy if you don&#x27;t try it for the purpose for which it&#x27;s meant. Trust a stranger&#x27;s opinion just once; the stuff works!</li>
            <li> After being tired of getting crud in my eye every single day decided to try something to make my pathetic eyelashes grow a bit longer.........this stuff seems to work though it is quite expensive........my eyes burn for a few minutes after putting this on (so to prevent this i put it on and just sit in my chair with my eyes closed for about 3 minutes to keep it from getting in my eyes as its drying)......have been using it for about a month and have to say my eyelashes are much fuller and somewhat longer than before.........good product if you can afford it!</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive eyes, and I was hesitant on paying 60 dollars for this stuff. I recently bought Jan Marini and I hated it. I have bought this stuff and my eyelashes are popping out every which way. I have trichotillomania and this luca lash is really making my eyelashes grow! I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on Feb. 17, 2012 and I have already started noticing some extra length, hopefully it will continue to work and help my lashes to fill in also. If the price goes back to what I paid for it I would purchase again, don&#x27;t know if I will if it stays at $20 more than what I paid for it though.</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and after a life-time of using mascara and eyelash curlers, my lashes were pretty scraggly.  This product exceeded my expectations.  I knew it would not be as potent as the stuff that makes you grow lashes in possibly wrong places and may dye your irises brown (yikes, I love my hazel eyes), but I am happy to report this stuff really works.  I have been using it on my eyebrows (I don&#x27;t know if they recommend it, but I thought, why not?)and on my eyelashes.  I noticed the fuller eyebrows first.  Then I noticed the little baldy spots fill in on my eyelashes.  My brows and lashes are silkier, fuller, and longer.  I&#x27;m not imagining this.  My lashes have never been as long and full as they are now.  Does not sting my eyes.  Results are fast too, I noticed a difference in just a few weeks.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product and plan to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I stopped wearing lash extensions a few weeks ago and used LUCA to hopefully thicken them up so they would look good once all my extensions had fallen out. I am shocked in just 3 weeks how full my lashes are! The length is still growing in and will take likely 2 or 3 more weeks  but I am thrilled with this result so far!  I have pale green eyes and am too afraid to try Latisse and my good friend had a horrible allergic reaction to Latisse. All good enough reasons to steer me to nontoxic LUCA. I am happy to have a safer option to grow my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update  4/12/2013  I have since learned from the manufacturer that this seller has counterfiet tampered with products so it&#x27;s not going to give you the result I experienced. Look for a reputable retailer selling it at it&#x27;s SRP.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. I will go back yo Revitalash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so jaded and skeptical about miracle beauty products, but this stuff leaves me speechless (well, almost).  Like another reviewer, I started with my eyebrows, and noticed a difference within a week. With advancing age, my lashes have become almost invisible, but about a week and a half after daily use, I SAW lashes.  ON ME!  After three weeks, my rabbity eyelashes are defined (with a little help from Lancôme) and dare I say it, lush.  My eyebrows are fuller and I can even  feel the difference when I touch them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes are naturally pale, and it&#x27;s taken experimentation with various mascaras to make me a believer, but I&#x27;m telling you this stuff works!  I purchased mine through nomorerack and gulped a bit even at their deeply discounted price, but it proved to be a great investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went about my errands today sporting only mascara.  WOO-HOO!  People have been telling me I look great (not that I&#x27;m vain or anything) and I&#x27;m a customer of Lucalash for as long as I can get it  at a discount.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spend a lot of money on beauty products, but when I saw Luca lash on nomorerack for $19.00 I checked the reviews on Amazon and it seemed like a good buy.  I used to have very long and full lashes.  Now,  I&#x27;m mid 50&#x27;s and my lashes are nearly invisible.  I have used Luca  Lash for about a month and am seeing a lot of new growth.  It is not a dramatic change, but my lashes are definitely fuller - not longer - but I expect that will come with time.  I still apply mascara, but one quick sweep does so much more than it used to.  I&#x27;m pretty sure I will not pay full price when my $20. tube runs out - but we&#x27;ll see.  BTW- I do not experience any eye irritation from this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this everyday for about a month.  Nothing. Zilch. Nada. No change.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps you have to use it for more than a month to see a change, BUT, i&#x27;ve used rapidlash before and noticed a change within a week. But if you keep using rapidlash, I think your eyelashes get used to it and eventually stop working.  but it was good for about 6 months.  Thought Luca Lash would work really well given the high price, but haven&#x27;t noticed a change at all.</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t fulfill what it claims to do. Expensive for nothing I used it for more than 4 weeks on a daily basis with no results.</li>
            <li> I like it, but I bought mine from No more rack. [...]&lt;br /&gt;It was only 21.00, I bought 4 of them but you have to check that place like every day. I have seen this stuff there 3 times. That is the only thing I have seen there that is cheaper than Amazon. Everything else is higher or about the same. My eyelashes have grown thicker and longer and I have got compliments on them from even my husband. So, I know it works. Just apply it like eyeliner. Right where your eyelashes are growing out of your eyelids. One swipe across each eyelid and your done. Some people only do their top eye. But I do the top and the bottom.</li>
            <li> I have been using Luca Lash for exactly 7 weeks. After the 1st week or so I noticed that my lashes curled better when using an eyelash curler and when applying mascara my lashes actually appeared longer. I felt that I was on the right track and surely would notice great improvement within 6 weeks. I never saw any further improvement. When not wearing mascara my lashes look exactly the same as they looked before using this product. Although they have become stronger I am sorry to say they are not longer or thicker. If you are looking for eye lash conditioning then this is your product but if you are looking for longer thicker lashes you may want to continue your research. I will finish the tube of Luca Lash and get back to you if I notice any growth at all.</li>
            <li> I have seen some difference in more eyelashes since I started using this product about a month ago. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Luca Lash for about a week now. So far I believe it&#x27;s working. My eye lashes looks and feels stronger. Will give another update in a few weeks. So far, I love this product.</li>
            <li> After months of faithful use, I experienced no &amp;#34;enhancement&amp;#34; of my eyelashes whatsoever.  I&#x27;m sure it has probably worked for others, but it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I have reviewed and followed lash growth products for the past year or so and have been concerned about side effects.&lt;br /&gt;LUCA is one of the few products on the market that does not use prostaglandin or prostaglandin analogs, and it works.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks I noticed increased eyelash length and by three weeks there was marked increase in eyelash length and number. my only problem has been remembering to use it every night.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Coolbreeze</li>
            <li> I have been a Latisse user in the past with remarkable results in the growth of longer and thicker lashes.  Yes, it did leave a bit of darkness on my lids for a while but nothing that could not be easily hidden with makeup.  A few months ago,  I thought I would try to save some $$$&#x27;s and researched similar product lines on Amazon.  I decided to give Luca Lash a try.  Have been using it faithfully since I received it a few months ago.  There has been absolutely no change in the length, thickness and overall condition of my lashes.  I would not reccomend this product.  Don&#x27;t always believe \\&quot;More for Less\\&quot; as it surely did not apply to this purchase.  A waste of my hard earned money!</li>
            <li> This is the best and most effective eye lashes conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. After using it for about a month, I can actually see that my lashes have lengthened extensively. Even my friends keep telling me that my lashes are very long. If the conditioner can help to thicken my lashes, that we even be better, or may be it will take some more time before I can see the effect.</li>
            <li> I thing my lashes have gotten a little thicker but I don&#x27;t see much change in length. Its easy to use and I have hade no adverse effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products that work better but this is just ok.  You get what you pay for and in this case you would have to apply 2 x a day for it to work really well. it &#x27;s not a bad product just not the best.</li>
            <li> I was used to using latisee before i got pregnant... That worked wonders for full lashes.. But then I was pregnant and wanting my lashes to be full again. I researched a product that did not contain prostaglandins and what not. I found this... Thought, \\&quot;well its kind of pricey, but so was latisse\\&quot;. So I bought it. No results. Spent too much money and time on this. Boo.</li>
            <li> I bought lucalash about 3 months ago after having my lashes become short and brittle after using lash extensions. I tried out luca lash and have been using it ever since. I have barely any results. My lashes are still short and thin. I won&#x27;t buy this again, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It did not work and I followed the directions. Nothing, nada, no new lashes or longer lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Rapid Lash and it did work.</li>
