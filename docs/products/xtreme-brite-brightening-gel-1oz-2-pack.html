            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>you can send me more your shopping stuff thank you</li>
            <li>I have seen better results with this than ANYTHING else I have ever used before.</li>
            <li>i was waiting for more than 2 week</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used this product before I would recommend but there are products that work much better.</li>
            <li>I use this about once a day (mostly in the morning after my shower) for about two weeks</li>
            <li>, i start peeling on the sides, but its more like flacky skin and does not hurt or anything...</li>
            <li>I loved this gel the first time i used it worked</li>
            <li>Its actually works great</li>
            <li>but it still work, so i think it is more suitable for sensitive area.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent and it absorbs quickly after being applied.</li>
            <li>I use it once a day on my armpits and after two weeks they are completely white!,no irritations and nice scent.</li>
            <li>I use this product more then twice a day, I literally rub it on every time I go into the bathroom because I wanna see results fast &amp;</li>
            <li>i didnt find a quick result.</li>
            <li>I know that i only used one tube and it takes more than that to get the results i was looking for (IF the product works as well as alot of the reviews that i have read says), but that darkness i got after the first tube almost made me wanna chop my armpits off!</li>
            <li>After i used the first tube, I saw a change in my skin but the results were not drastic.</li>
            <li>Definitely will order more.</li>
            <li>The only good thing that I can say about this product, is that it did dry up my cystic acne.  </li>
            <li>Used it religiously for a couple months for under arm darkness because of all the great reviews, turned out to be a waste of money.</li>
            <li>I also really like about the BRIGHTENING GEL</li>
            <li>really well stoped using it</li>
            <li>, it works fast</li>
            <li>and it has shown remarkable results especially when comes to lightening my dark armpits.</li>
            <li>When i first used it i could NOT believe that my underarms actually got lighter within the first two-three times</li>
            <li>After reading reviews on this product, I had high hopes that it would lighten my hyperpigmentation.  </li>
            <li>The first few days of using the product was fine.</li>
            <li>I saw no improvement plus it burnt my skin and made it extremely sensitive, couldn&#x27;t even wax or shave !&lt;</li>
            <li>I honestly had high hopes for this product, I mean I&#x27;ve only had it for about a week now but even so people have claimed to see a difference within days.</li>
            <li>Anytime I get a breakout or have a scar I use it immediately and the bump is gone within 1 to 3 days, depending on how deep or large.</li>
            <li>I have struggled wIth acne and acne scars on and off since I was about 13 years old.</li>
            <li>I try it for over tow month but not everyday.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s too early to tell.</li>
            <li>Not recommended for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>(I read several reviews and this was a popular complaint).</li>
            <li>final thing, I have found that using Acne Free facial wash (the basic orange and white bottle) morning and night along with this product MORNING AND NIGHT somehow seems to keep the acne under control and enhance the results of the Xtreme Brite Gel.</li>
            <li>However, it has been about three weeks since i stopped using the product and my skin is back to its original (dark) color that i started with.</li>
            <li>I am a 35 year old carmel colored African American woman and I have been using this product for just over a year and it has changed my life.</li>
            <li>Idk Im kind of skeptical recently viewing YouTube channels giving reviews on the product made it seem like a miracle gel.</li>

            <li> Idk Im kind of skeptical recently viewing YouTube channels giving reviews on the product made it seem like a miracle gel.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clog your pores like the Xtreme Brite Cream or the Xtreme Brite Acne Spots Remover (which I don&#x27;t really recommend, strangely) AND other oily/greasy products like Retin A, hydroquinone or even some other skin products I have used from dermatologists in my past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have one dark spot near my ankle both sides.</li>
            <li> been using this product for a month, sometimes i use 3 times a day and nothing, what a waste, i was really excited about the product due to all the reviews i read, i am even thinking this might be a copycat or something, if i get desperate enough again later, i will try to order directly from xtreme brite website, i just really don&#x27;t know what to think</li>
            <li> On days when I need to be extra dry, I use a homemade coconut oil deodorant.</li>
            <li> It will shed roughly every 2 to 3 weeks if you use it DAILY over several MONTHS.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that i jave sensitive skin, and since i wax</li>
            <li> I am assuming because all the dead damaged layers were finally gone.</li>
            <li> I used the product as instructed but saw absolutely NO results.</li>
            <li> As you continue to use it your skins begins to go through peel (the dead kinds begins to LITERALLY peel away in the worst areas) and heal (where it looks beautiful just after peeling) cycles.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Then after a few weeks your old skin starts to peel away slowly.</li>
            <li> I have shared this with at least 5 other family members and friends and it has done the same for them!</li>
            <li> And the scar (if any) is gone within a week because it doesn&#x27;t get a chance to get really dark or deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the dark spot disappeared and get whiter.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very sticky and leaves an uncomfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> it actually working slow</li>
            <li> About a size of a half dollar.</li>
            <li> After the 6 months, it was like I had a new face (even small wrinkles faded away)!!!</li>
            <li> I have no problems with this product, but I rated it 4 stars because I see its taking a little time for seeing the result.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my money</li>
            <li> had very high hopes as i hate having dark underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just lightened up in some areas (in patches :/  )</li>
            <li> But I mean if your still eager to purchase you will see for yourself, but don&#x27;t waste your money because of some of these BS reviews</li>
            <li> It will be subtle so don&#x27;t get your hopes WAY up at the beginning.</li>
            <li> this was the only thing that had worked before :(</li>
            <li> I admit I am addicted and cannot stop using this product.</li>
            <li> and it gives me horrible itching and red burning lil bumps that hurt im.so</li>
            <li> But, I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but i still keep putting it on in hopes that it will start to work, but who am i kidding its been over 30 days already! :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After reading reviews on this product, I had high hopes that it would lighten my hyperpigmentation.  But, I was disappointed.  The only good thing that I can say about this product, is that it did dry up my cystic acne.  I might try out this product in the cream, to see if it is stronger.</li>
            <li> I love this gel! It has a light scent and it absorbs quickly after being applied. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> i love it and i don&#x27;t mind shopping with u again you can send me more your shopping stuff thank you</li>
            <li> I am a 35 year old carmel colored African American woman and I have been using this product for just over a year and it has changed my life. I have seen better results with this than ANYTHING else I have ever used before. I have struggled wIth acne and acne scars on and off since I was about 13 years old. I have shared this with at least 5 other family members and friends and it has done the same for them! You begin noticing a smoothness in your skin within about 3 to 5 days. It will be subtle so don&#x27;t get your hopes WAY up at the beginning. Then after a few weeks your old skin starts to peel away slowly. As you continue to use it your skins begins to go through peel (the dead kinds begins to LITERALLY peel away in the worst areas) and heal (where it looks beautiful just after peeling) cycles. It will shed roughly every 2 to 3 weeks if you use it DAILY over several MONTHS. My skin went through the peel and heal process for about 6 months before it stopped peeling. I am assuming because all the dead damaged layers were finally gone. After the 6 months, it was like I had a new face (even small wrinkles faded away)!!! I admit I am addicted and cannot stop using this product. Anytime I get a breakout or have a scar I use it immediately and the bump is gone within 1 to 3 days, depending on how deep or large. And the scar (if any) is gone within a week because it doesn&#x27;t get a chance to get really dark or deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I also really like about the BRIGHTENING GEL is that it dries on your skin within a minute and practically disappears with no greasy residue - especially when you put it on within seconds after washing and drying your face. It doesn&#x27;t clog your pores like the Xtreme Brite Cream or the Xtreme Brite Acne Spots Remover (which I don&#x27;t really recommend, strangely) AND other oily/greasy products like Retin A, hydroquinone or even some other skin products I have used from dermatologists in my past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final thing, I have found that using Acne Free facial wash (the basic orange and white bottle) morning and night along with this product MORNING AND NIGHT somehow seems to keep the acne under control and enhance the results of the Xtreme Brite Gel.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing. when i use it i didnt find a quick result. i was waiting for more than 2 week but then i find the result that i hope under my armpit. it actually working slow but it still work, so i think it is more suitable for sensitive area. i recommend it to my sisters...</li>
            <li> I used the product as instructed but saw absolutely NO results.</li>
            <li> The product is really really good! I use it once a day on my armpits and after two weeks they are completely white!,no irritations and nice scent.</li>
            <li> The first few days of using the product was fine. Everything was going good and the product smells amazing! After about a week, the product caused me to have a tingling sensation on my skin. I purchased two tubes and I was using the product to lighten my underarms. After i used the first tube, I saw a change in my skin but the results were not drastic. I stopped using the product for a while because i wanted to see if my skin would become darker after i stopped using it (I read several reviews and this was a popular complaint). Within a week my skin became darker than it was initially. This PISSED me off lol. However, it has been about three weeks since i stopped using the product and my skin is back to its original (dark) color that i started with. I know that i only used one tube and it takes more than that to get the results i was looking for (IF the product works as well as alot of the reviews that i have read says), but that darkness i got after the first tube almost made me wanna chop my armpits off! lol!  I would recommend this product to others because everyone is different. What doesnt work for me just might work for someone else!</li>
            <li> Great product , good price, easy to use and affordable. I would recommend it to a friend. Definitely will order more.</li>
            <li> I try it for over tow month but not everyday. Its actually works great the dark spot disappeared and get whiter. Love it. I have no problems with this product, but I rated it 4 stars because I see its taking a little time for seeing the result.</li>
            <li> This product does work but is not permanent.  Not only that, it will stop working after a while.  Meaning you will not get the same results with continued used.  If you&#x27;ve never used this product before I would recommend but there are products that work much better.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s too early to tell. I need to use it a bit longer. Just lightened up in some areas (in patches :/  )</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of 2 xtreme brightening gel and I received them on the 15th of July and I&#x27;ve been using them ever since then and I haven&#x27;t gotten any results at ALL. It was a waste of my money and I wished I had never bought them.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Does the job.</li>
            <li> I honestly had high hopes for this product, I mean I&#x27;ve only had it for about a week now but even so people have claimed to see a difference within days. Idk Im kind of skeptical recently viewing YouTube channels giving reviews on the product made it seem like a miracle gel. I use this product more then twice a day, I literally rub it on every time I go into the bathroom because I wanna see results fast &amp; still nothing not even a shade lighter. I wanna say this product does not work &amp; it&#x27;s very sticky and leaves an uncomfortable feeling. But I mean if your still eager to purchase you will see for yourself, but don&#x27;t waste your money because of some of these BS reviews</li>
            <li> IT DOES WORK, BUT IM JUST NOT CONSISTANT WITH PUTTING IT ON</li>
            <li> It DO NOT brighten or fades discoloration. I have one dark spot near my ankle both sides. About a size of a half dollar. I use it as described. See no result in 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> I use this gel to lighten the darkness in my underarm. I use this about once a day (mostly in the morning after my shower) for about two weeks and I already see some improvement. I will continue using it. I find that for the most part I do not have the need to use a deodorant while using this gel which is great. I know that some deodorants have ingredients that could darken your underarms. On days when I need to be extra dry, I use a homemade coconut oil deodorant. You can google the recipe.</li>
            <li> I loved this gel the first time i used it worked really well stoped using it and i feel my underarms are darker then before so def have to maintain using it here and there..i just bought again the 2 pack and i started using same as before a lil bit in the am and before bed i dont know if its something diffrent in the ingredients but this time it did not work at all and it gives me horrible itching and red burning lil bumps that hurt im.so upset this was the only thing that had worked before :(</li>
            <li> been using this product for 2 weeks and it has shown remarkable results especially when comes to lightening my dark armpits. i would recommend this</li>
            <li> This product DOES work... When i first used it i could NOT believe that my underarms actually got lighter within the first two-three times i applied it. It smells great, and it applies transparant. The only negative is that i jave sensitive skin, and since i wax, i start peeling on the sides, but its more like flacky skin and does not hurt or anything...the important thing is that it works!!</li>
            <li> Great product,,,üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç</li>
            <li> I had hyperpigmentation and it is helping me a lot!! I love it! I can see my blemishes going away already!! I am purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> been using this product for a month, sometimes i use 3 times a day and nothing, what a waste, i was really excited about the product due to all the reviews i read, i am even thinking this might be a copycat or something, if i get desperate enough again later, i will try to order directly from xtreme brite website, i just really don&#x27;t know what to think and i dunno why but i still keep putting it on in hopes that it will start to work, but who am i kidding its been over 30 days already! :( had very high hopes as i hate having dark underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rated 1 star just because it delivered a day before it said.</li>
            <li> excellent product, it works fast and i&#x27;m very pleased with the results</li>
            <li> Used it religiously for a couple months for under arm darkness because of all the great reviews, turned out to be a waste of money. I saw no improvement plus it burnt my skin and made it extremely sensitive, couldn&#x27;t even wax or shave !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t work for me, maybe it might for u. Not recommended for people with sensitive skin.</li>
