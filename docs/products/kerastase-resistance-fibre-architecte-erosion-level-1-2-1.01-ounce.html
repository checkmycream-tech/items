            <li>Top of the line.</li>

            <li>The product was great - my hair really did feel stronger and shinier.</li>
            <li>I expect Amazon to better protect its customers.</li>
            <li>I love this for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful to treat frizzy hair prior to straightening it.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells and the way my hair feels after I flatiron it.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to look like a frizzy bleach-blonde :)</li>
            <li>its a sure thing...</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>leaves in in better condition.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for color-treated, dry hair.</li>
            <li>I have color-treated fine shoulder-length hair that easily tangles and has seen better days.  </li>
            <li>I can detangled easy now.</li>
            <li>Kerastase products in general are really great</li>
            <li>It takes about 3-5 minutes or so before I notice my hair relax, becomes easy to comb, and feels as light and airy as a feather.  </li>
            <li>My hair salon uses this on my hair, and I love the super smooth shiny result, so I bought a tube.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair a smooth finish and yet light and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>and this product manages to protect my hair well and keep it smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>Love this product, it&#x27;s so worth the money,</li>
            <li>Smooth and Shiney....</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Great product if you flat iron or curl your hair.</li>
            <li>This product is great if you flat iron your hair</li>
            <li>Today I passed by a salon and saw it, told her my story and purchased it there for the original price.</li>
            <li>Also, should it be a price anything below the original sales price</li>
            <li>Excellent product, keeps my hair free of split ends for at least 4 months.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but I have a drawer full of pricey stuff that doesn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t cheap, but the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li>and I think that&#x27;s a true testament to the performance of this product.</li>
            <li>Even though I am more on the sceptical side she explained me very, very convincingly that Kerastase does not approve selling through any channels other than their approved salons and that they NEVER EVER go on sale.</li>
            <li>a teaspoon is 5ml, so if i&#x27;m lucky i&#x27;ll use this product up after washing my hair 6 times, that&#x27;s Â£6 each time.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and this is my favorite product to use when straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>However, I stress THIS PRODUCT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.</li>
            <li>and I believe it leaves the hair looking nice after even after the next wash.</li>
            <li>Therefore I need to use about just under a teaspoon worth -</li>
            <li>Fibre Architecte truly helps to improve the dry ends, hair feels soft and looks great.</li>
            <li>Right now I am considering to copy paste my review to other popular Amazon Kerastase products as well so that people are aware of the risk.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product many times and I will definitely keep repurchasing.</li>
            <li>really works!  </li>
            <li>silkie soft, smooth hair</li>
            <li>I was iffy about spending so much but kerastase products are worth it.</li>
            <li>very helpful in the recovery of extreamly damaged hair !</li>
            <li>The difference is noticeable after the first use.</li>
            <li>My other favorite product for super damaged hair is Philip Kingsley Elasticizer.</li>
            <li>Make sure your hair is dry, then apply</li>
            <li>This serum has not only kept my hair from breaking off, but left me with shiny, healthy looking hair!</li>
            <li>Speedy delivery - absolutely hassle-free.</li>
            <li>So it really disappear when you use it, but your hair looks much shiner... like silk.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t feel like the real deal.</li>
            <li>My hair has stopped breaking and shown much improvement since I started used this product.  </li>
            <li>but &#x27;just a drop&#x27; really isn&#x27;t going to do much,</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use to much in one area or it will be oily.</li>
            <li>so upset I was really looking forward to trying this product</li>
            <li>This product left my hair feeling so smooth.</li>
            <li>In researching this product, I found the price linked today is higher than going to the manufacturer&#x27;s site directly.  </li>
            <li>I feel the container was kind of small.</li>
            <li>and my hair stays nice and soft for a few months longer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The price is way too high.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>after 4 bottles of this product i can honestly say that the green gel runs out very quickly leaving you with just the heavy oily serum.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was not so expensive, but it does work great on my hair to give it a non-greasy shine.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, the process puts a great deal of strain on the hair follicles.  </li>
            <li>If applied daily w bust line length hair, you could easily go thru the entire bottle by end of a month.</li>
            <li>it is 100% fake or at the very least old.&lt;br /&gt;Now, as I mentioned at the beginning, am I a sceptical person and can see that the hair salon seller has her own agenda and most likely wants to sell her products with a nice margin and does not want me to go to amazon and get it cheaper....</li>
            <li>It does what it claims to do, repairs split ends and prevents new ones.</li>
            <li>I got new product that was delivered on time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a new haircut, in that it repairs the ends of the hair</li>
            <li>I live in Georgia and this stuff has saves my hair from humidity and heat.</li>
            <li>I always try new things and have stayed with this one for a while.</li>
            <li>This leave in treatment is light enough to use every day (I also have very fine and thin hair).</li>
            <li>I have baby fine, very straight, but thick hair.</li>
            <li>I usually refuse to spend more than 25 on a styling product, but this is the exception.</li>
            <li>This serum comes out clear of the dual chambers.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair silk and soft with lots of body.</li>
            <li>When bought directly from a salon, it has a cellophane wrapping.</li>
            <li>Which means I basically paid nearly $2 per drop considering my $50 purchase lasted me 30 days.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working so far.</li>
            <li>I get a chance I will reach out to Kerastase and ask them directly and update you guys.</li>
            <li>thinking the tubes weren&#x27;t filled all the way or dried out.  </li>
            <li>but her story was very convincing and I am left wondering and definitely hesitant to  buy any further Kerastase products at Amazon before I was not able clarify this matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the price is kind of a joke, but it is one of the few things that has helped my fine, thin hair grow long.  </li>
            <li>This product is light weight enough yet oily enough to weigh this down on the ends and repair the damage that had been done overnight.</li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have one huge complaint that you should know before buying though.  </li>
            <li>And is supposed to be white and clear.</li>
            <li>, the packaging is strange because you can&#x27;t tell how much of the product is left in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>People constantly ask if my hair color is natural now</li>
            <li>i will continue to buy it because as my stylist says \\&quot;it&#x27;s like a haircut in a bottle.\\&quot;  it gives my hair that impossibly soft texture you only get after you leave the salon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap but the price is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>So, she swore that if I see products on amazon that they are most likely fake or at the very least passed the expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;She went on saying that it is a well known problem that they come in original-style packaging but are filled not with the real stuff.</li>
            <li>I use a round brush and flat iron to try to get the ends to smooth down, but never could.</li>

            <li> In researching this product, I found the price linked today is higher than going to the manufacturer&#x27;s site directly.  </li>
            <li> I feel the container was kind of small.</li>
            <li> and my hair stays nice and soft for a few months longer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The price is way too high.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> after 4 bottles of this product i can honestly say that the green gel runs out very quickly leaving you with just the heavy oily serum.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was not so expensive, but it does work great on my hair to give it a non-greasy shine.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the process puts a great deal of strain on the hair follicles.  </li>
            <li> If applied daily w bust line length hair, you could easily go thru the entire bottle by end of a month.</li>
            <li> it is 100% fake or at the very least old.&lt;br /&gt;Now, as I mentioned at the beginning, am I a sceptical person and can see that the hair salon seller has her own agenda and most likely wants to sell her products with a nice margin and does not want me to go to amazon and get it cheaper....</li>
            <li> It does what it claims to do, repairs split ends and prevents new ones.</li>
            <li> I got new product that was delivered on time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a new haircut, in that it repairs the ends of the hair</li>
            <li> I live in Georgia and this stuff has saves my hair from humidity and heat.</li>
            <li> I always try new things and have stayed with this one for a while.</li>
            <li> This leave in treatment is light enough to use every day (I also have very fine and thin hair).</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, very straight, but thick hair.</li>
            <li> I usually refuse to spend more than 25 on a styling product, but this is the exception.</li>
            <li> This serum comes out clear of the dual chambers.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair silk and soft with lots of body.</li>
            <li> When bought directly from a salon, it has a cellophane wrapping.</li>
            <li> Which means I basically paid nearly $2 per drop considering my $50 purchase lasted me 30 days.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working so far.</li>
            <li> I get a chance I will reach out to Kerastase and ask them directly and update you guys.</li>
            <li> thinking the tubes weren&#x27;t filled all the way or dried out.  </li>
            <li> but her story was very convincing and I am left wondering and definitely hesitant to  buy any further Kerastase products at Amazon before I was not able clarify this matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the price is kind of a joke, but it is one of the few things that has helped my fine, thin hair grow long.  </li>
            <li> This product is light weight enough yet oily enough to weigh this down on the ends and repair the damage that had been done overnight.</li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have one huge complaint that you should know before buying though.  </li>
            <li> And is supposed to be white and clear.</li>
            <li> , the packaging is strange because you can&#x27;t tell how much of the product is left in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> People constantly ask if my hair color is natural now</li>
            <li> i will continue to buy it because as my stylist says \\&quot;it&#x27;s like a haircut in a bottle.\\&quot;  it gives my hair that impossibly soft texture you only get after you leave the salon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap but the price is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> So, she swore that if I see products on amazon that they are most likely fake or at the very least passed the expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;She went on saying that it is a well known problem that they come in original-style packaging but are filled not with the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I use a round brush and flat iron to try to get the ends to smooth down, but never could.</li>
            <li> Very pricey, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> you wont be sorry, worth every penny !!</li>
            <li> and before I use the flat iron.</li>
            <li> It protects it from the flat iron.</li>
            <li> The serum makes my hair silky and soft with out weighing it down.</li>
            <li> She promised me that with a drop a day it would last a \\&quot;very long time.\\</li>
            <li> Over the last year and a half, I had extensions, went from blond to deep red, then back to blond.</li>
            <li> I died my naturally blonde hair black for ten years, and in January, decided to go back to blonde.  </li>
            <li> My long hair is bleached from medium brown to platinum blonde and the ends can be very dry and</li>
            <li> but when I received them the individual boxes were not sealed and slightly crushed.  </li>
            <li> and it only seems to last for a month and half.</li>
            <li> It helps tame my flyaways and my hair is soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I am having the same problem that other reviewers.</li>
            <li> My hair was so dry</li>
            <li> I use it after I blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> My hair was dry, damaged without life because the highlights .</li>
            <li> i brought this issue up each time to my hairdresser because i feel like it&#x27;s a waste because without the combo of the two serums mixed, i don&#x27;t get the same effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 years and you only have to use such a small amount it lasts for months.</li>
            <li> It was extremely affordable on AMAZON, but there was a long wait for it.</li>
            <li> The only downside is for the amount of serum its a little costly.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels healthier and shinier after blow drying and flat ironing, with noticeably less breakage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a rough sleeper</li>
            <li> And if you add heat later it Still sets the look though I&#x27;d recommend the kerastase protective cream (also in the green range).</li>
            <li> That said, it&#x27;s incredibly expensive and since it&#x27;s so new, my hairdresser couldn&#x27;t tell me how long it would last!</li>
            <li> probably used the serum maybe ten times, and only squirt out a small dab, less than the size of a dime onto the palm of my hand, and it&#x27;s gone.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I blow-dry my hair every other day</li>
            <li> No matter what, you run out of one chamber before the other.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy a product at amazon due to the additional shipping fees.</li>
            <li> and my hair is noticably stronger, healther and alot less</li>
            <li> i have long thick hair that gets a little poofy at the bottom, this serum flattens it immediately even when i apply it</li>
            <li> Good, but in like 4&amp;#34; pump it finished, :( why to expensive.</li>
            <li> I use it every day not greasy at all, I got one for me and one for my little girl.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s deceptive but don&#x27;t be fooled - this is not worth the money!</li>
            <li> For so little product.</li>
            <li> This product along with Living Proof no frizz shamp and cond makes my hair so silky and gives it a little weight so it doesn&#x27;t look all fried and fluffy.</li>
            <li> Im using this product already a few years.</li>
            <li> Although I saved a few dollars, I would rather have confidence that the product had not been tampered with.  </li>
            <li> Whichever--don&#x27;t waste your money, I didn&#x27;t notice any benefit of using this product.</li>
            <li> I found it on Amazon for almost half the retail price !</li>
            <li> one is a oilier base serum and the other half is a green gel that&#x27;s much lighter.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too small.</li>
            <li> Pump a small amount in the palm of you hands and rub them together before running your hands through your hair in the places you need it.</li>
            <li> The packaging is very heavy</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my hair stylist and is hard to find in the USA.</li>
            <li> I find it hard to believe that&#x27;s all you get for $35.  </li>
            <li> i have been addicted to this serum for the past year since my hairdresser recommended it to me.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick, below the shoulder length hair, i&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> Havent seen a dramatic change yet.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with Kerastase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s CRAZY expensive.  </li>
            <li> but nothing will come out from the green side, very disappointed and a waist of money</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this all ravaged my hair!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect product. Im using this product already a few years. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. delivered timely!</li>
            <li> Great product if you flat iron or curl your hair. Leaves your hair silk and soft with lots of body.</li>
            <li> Just one drop of this product in the morning and my hair is amazingly shiny and healthy looking ! Lovely smell and texture. It&#x27;s not cheap but the price is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Over the last year and a half, I had extensions, went from blond to deep red, then back to blond. Unfortunately this all ravaged my hair! This leave in treatment is light enough to use every day (I also have very fine and thin hair). It helps tame my flyaways and my hair is soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my hair stylist and is hard to find in the USA. It was extremely affordable on AMAZON, but there was a long wait for it. It does what it claims to do, repairs split ends and prevents new ones. Keeps your hair healthier for longer!!! Worth it!!!</li>
            <li> best stuff to put on fried hair before putting heat to it; really smoothes the hair. Make sure your hair is dry, then apply</li>
            <li> Smooths and calms split ends.  Great product.  Speedy delivery - absolutely hassle-free.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with Kerastase. This product it&#x27;s great. I apply it on damp hair before blow drying, and it keeps my fly-aways and split ends at bay. The only bad thing  it is that the presentation it&#x27;s too small. I blow-dry my hair every other day and it only seems to last for a month and half.</li>
            <li> Best product around. I have naturally curly hair, and this is my favorite product to use when straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product - I ordered two - but when I received them the individual boxes were not sealed and slightly crushed.  Although I saved a few dollars, I would rather have confidence that the product had not been tampered with.  When bought directly from a salon, it has a cellophane wrapping.</li>
            <li> I got new product that was delivered on time.  This product is great if you flat iron your hair it protects your hair and brings out shine</li>
            <li> My hair salon uses this on my hair, and I love the super smooth shiny result, so I bought a tube. Haven&#x27;t used it on myself yet, and glad to hear only a drop is necessary. It&#x27;s pricey, but I have a drawer full of pricey stuff that doesn&#x27;t deliver. At $42, I won&#x27;t use it daily, but I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily. Judging from salon use on my hair, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.  It gives my hair a smooth finish and yet light and bouncy.  I love this stuff.  It only takes a dab.  It is the best hair product.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shine and more manageable.  The only thing is the price.  But, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I continuously lighten my hair. The fact that its chemically processed does not help my fine curly hair from splittingAside from Fusio dose and Booster Ionium, the Resistance Fibre Architecte is the best help for split ends. The only downside is for the amount of serum its a little costly. However, I stress THIS PRODUCT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY. If applied daily w bust line length hair, you could easily go thru the entire bottle by end of a month. Smells great and really seems to stop or keep split ends at bay. This is a keeper in my products department! Another great product from Kerastase. The vendor I purchased it from did a great job on packaging and shipping it out.</li>
            <li> I use it everytime I blow my hair and I believe it leaves the hair looking nice after even after the next wash. My hairdresser is a big fan.</li>
            <li> You know when you wake up and your hair is all sensitised, like straw? I&#x27;m a rough sleeper and I sleep on a silk pillow and still wake up with a head of matted stringy hair. This product is light weight enough yet oily enough to weigh this down on the ends and repair the damage that had been done overnight. It&#x27;s like a new haircut, in that it repairs the ends of the hair so it sits where you intended to style it. And if you add heat later it Still sets the look though I&#x27;d recommend the kerastase protective cream (also in the green range).</li>
            <li> It is like a serum, not an oil. So it really disappear when you use it, but your hair looks much shiner... like silk.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, keeps my hair free of split ends for at least 4 months.  I&#x27;ve used this product many times and I will definitely keep repurchasing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I&#x27;ve used for about 3 months now and my hair is noticably stronger, healther and alot less breakage.&lt;br /&gt;It really works!  I have shoulder length hair and I use about dime size every day and bottle lasts about 1 month.</li>
            <li> This product has been amazing for my fine hair. I am a very low maintenance person who hates spending money on beauty products, but I splurge on this because it helps fix my split ends. I don&#x27;t have to get my hair cut as often and my hair stays nice and soft for a few months longer. I recommend this to anyone with damaged hair or split ends. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  It&#x27;s CRAZY expensive.  I think the price is kind of a joke, but it is one of the few things that has helped my fine, thin hair grow long.  It smoothes the hair and stops split end breakage.  LOVE it!  No to find it cheaper somewhere--I would give it 5 stars if it were not for that price...it&#x27;s $40 for ONE OUNCE!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I flat-iron my hair every morning and this product manages to protect my hair well and keep it smooth and shiny.  I have found that it truly does work best if you use the Kerastase shampoos/conditioners; especially the ones that provide heat protection.  Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I wish it was not so expensive, but it does work great on my hair to give it a non-greasy shine.</li>
            <li> Meh. No matter what, you run out of one chamber before the other. Nothing else works like it, though. Top of the line. No frizz, ultra pampered. It&#x27;s just that it feels like I am getting ripped off.</li>
            <li> This is a great product</li>
            <li> Best product of its kind</li>
            <li> Stars reflect difference in price.  In researching this product, I found the price linked today is higher than going to the manufacturer&#x27;s site directly.  Google Kerastase USA. Let the buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I feel this product makes my hair stronger with heat styling.</li>
            <li> I use this to help protect my hair from heat tools. So far so good. Kerastase products in general are really great and while you can&#x27;t &amp;#34;tell&amp;#34; that it&#x27;s working... there&#x27;s no burning smell as I iron my hair or anything like that</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t love it, but I will try it a couple more times to be sure.</li>
            <li> I am having the same problem that other reviewers. The product isn&#x27;t the same that Ive been buying for years. This serum comes out clear of the dual chambers. And is supposed to be white and clear. This doesn&#x27;t feel like the real deal. I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it&#x27;s so worth the money, silkie soft, smooth hair I use it every day not greasy at all, I got one for me and one for my little girl. Smells so so good.</li>
            <li> Totally love this product, the serum its really amazing.  I would buy another one.  I feel the container was kind of small.</li>
            <li> My hair has stopped breaking and shown much improvement since I started used this product.  I am on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Moisturizes and adds shine w/o being greasy.</li>
            <li> The product was great - my hair really did feel stronger and shinier. That said, it&#x27;s incredibly expensive and since it&#x27;s so new, my hairdresser couldn&#x27;t tell me how long it would last! She promised me that with a drop a day it would last a \\&quot;very long time.\\&quot; Well, it&#x27;s a month later, and using only 1 drop per day, it&#x27;s all gone. Which means I basically paid nearly $2 per drop considering my $50 purchase lasted me 30 days. The packaging is very heavy so it&#x27;s deceptive but don&#x27;t be fooled - this is not worth the money!</li>
            <li> Scam artist! Amazon needs to remove them and help us get our money back. I ordered on 11/16 &amp; still no product or tracking. What a joke. I will be calling my credit card company today.&lt;br /&gt;Has anyone had any luck with getting Amazon to help in this matter? If so I would appreciate any tips. I expect Amazon to better protect its customers.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t cheap, but the results are worth it.  I died my naturally blonde hair black for ten years, and in January, decided to go back to blonde.  Needless to say, the process puts a great deal of strain on the hair follicles.  This serum has not only kept my hair from breaking off, but left me with shiny, healthy looking hair!</li>
            <li> I like this alot. Seems to be working so far. Havent seen a dramatic change yet. I hope so soon!</li>
            <li> Perfect for color-treated, dry hair. Fibre Architecte truly helps to improve the dry ends, hair feels soft and looks great.</li>
            <li> I was iffy about spending so much but kerastase products are worth it. My hair was so dry and this has made it softer than ever before. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy a product at amazon due to the additional shipping fees. Today I passed by a salon and saw it, told her my story and purchased it there for the original price. Even though I am more on the sceptical side she explained me very, very convincingly that Kerastase does not approve selling through any channels other than their approved salons and that they NEVER EVER go on sale. So, she swore that if I see products on amazon that they are most likely fake or at the very least passed the expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;She went on saying that it is a well known problem that they come in original-style packaging but are filled not with the real stuff. Also, should it be a price anything below the original sales price it is 100% fake or at the very least old.&lt;br /&gt;Now, as I mentioned at the beginning, am I a sceptical person and can see that the hair salon seller has her own agenda and most likely wants to sell her products with a nice margin and does not want me to go to amazon and get it cheaper.... but her story was very convincing and I am left wondering and definitely hesitant to  buy any further Kerastase products at Amazon before I was not able clarify this matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get a chance I will reach out to Kerastase and ask them directly and update you guys. Right now I am considering to copy paste my review to other popular Amazon Kerastase products as well so that people are aware of the risk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick, below the shoulder length hair, i&#x27;m sorry but &#x27;just a drop&#x27; really isn&#x27;t going to do much, if anything. Therefore I need to use about just under a teaspoon worth - a teaspoon is 5ml, so if i&#x27;m lucky i&#x27;ll use this product up after washing my hair 6 times, that&#x27;s Â£6 each time. hmmmmmm.....</li>
            <li> My hair was breaking off at the ends and I use this serum treatment to stop the hair breakage problem.  The serum makes my hair silky and soft with out weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I love this for my hair.  Makes it feel softer and smoother after a highlights session.  Wouldn&#x27;t trade for anything.</li>
            <li> Wonderful to treat frizzy hair prior to straightening it. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Considering the price of this stuff--and the number of squirts i got--it&#x27;s a total rip-off.&lt;br /&gt;I probably used the serum maybe ten times, and only squirt out a small dab, less than the size of a dime onto the palm of my hand, and it&#x27;s gone.  I find it hard to believe that&#x27;s all you get for $35.  That&#x27;s like $3.50/use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking the tubes weren&#x27;t filled all the way or dried out.  Whichever--don&#x27;t waste your money, I didn&#x27;t notice any benefit of using this product.</li>
            <li> Good, but in like 4&amp;#34; pump it finished, :( why to expensive. For so little product. Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> I have color-treated fine shoulder-length hair that easily tangles and has seen better days.  I saw the reviews for this product, and of course, had to try it.  I use one pump of it, spread between both hands and pat it throughout my towel-dried hair.  It takes about 3-5 minutes or so before I notice my hair relax, becomes easy to comb, and feels as light and airy as a feather.  The product seems to moisturize and at the same time makes my hair shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the packaging is strange because you can&#x27;t tell how much of the product is left in the bottle.  It&#x27;s a big bottle for only a tiny bit of product.  The price is way too high.  I found it on Amazon for almost half the retail price !</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells and the way my hair feels after I flatiron it. It&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. I live in Georgia and this stuff has saves my hair from humidity and heat. Love it!</li>
            <li> I started out buying this at the salon and it&#x27;s more expensive there so I ordered it from Amazon. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 years and you only have to use such a small amount it lasts for months. I use it after I blow dry my hair and before I use the flat iron. Pump a small amount in the palm of you hands and rub them together before running your hands through your hair in the places you need it. Don&#x27;t use to much in one area or it will be oily. It protects it from the flat iron. Makes your hair shiny and healthy!</li>
            <li> My long hair is bleached from medium brown to platinum blonde and the ends can be very dry and almost cotton candy like. This product along with Living Proof no frizz shamp and cond makes my hair so silky and gives it a little weight so it doesn&#x27;t look all fried and fluffy. People constantly ask if my hair color is natural now and I think that&#x27;s a true testament to the performance of this product. Now I don&#x27;t have to look like a frizzy bleach-blonde :) I&#x27;m a product junkie and I&#x27;ve tried them all, this is the best. I usually refuse to spend more than 25 on a styling product, but this is the exception. My other favorite product for super damaged hair is Philip Kingsley Elasticizer.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my hair!!</li>
            <li> very helpful in the recovery of extreamly damaged hair ! its a sure thing...you wont be sorry, worth every penny !!</li>
            <li> This product is superb for using heated styling tools on relaxed hair. The difference is noticeable after the first use. My hair looks and feels healthier and shinier after blow drying and flat ironing, with noticeably less breakage.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I recommend for those who have hair with split ends.</li>
            <li> Great product, Received the items very fast and great price. Would definitely use them again.</li>
            <li> Smells great, protects the hair from heat.  I always try new things and have stayed with this one for a while.</li>
            <li> Im so upset I was really looking forward to trying this product, I can only get the white side to come out but nothing will come out from the green side, very disappointed and a waist of money</li>
            <li> i have been addicted to this serum for the past year since my hairdresser recommended it to me.  i will continue to buy it because as my stylist says \\&quot;it&#x27;s like a haircut in a bottle.\\&quot;  it gives my hair that impossibly soft texture you only get after you leave the salon.  i have long thick hair that gets a little poofy at the bottom, this serum flattens it immediately even when i apply it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have one huge complaint that you should know before buying though.  when you squirt out the serum, it comes from two different sides.  one is a oilier base serum and the other half is a green gel that&#x27;s much lighter.  after 4 bottles of this product i can honestly say that the green gel runs out very quickly leaving you with just the heavy oily serum.  i brought this issue up each time to my hairdresser because i feel like it&#x27;s a waste because without the combo of the two serums mixed, i don&#x27;t get the same effect.</li>
            <li> It s awesome! My hair was dry, damaged without life because the highlights . It helped me a lot. I can detangled easy now.</li>
            <li> Great product and Excellent Delivery Service</li>
            <li> This product left my hair feeling so smooth. I colored for the first time and this serum is the one keeping my tips healthy and beautiful! I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Smooth and Shiney....just the way it looks when  I come from the hair salon. I have baby fine, very straight, but thick hair. I use a round brush and flat iron to try to get the ends to smooth down, but never could. Until now. This stuff is like a miricule. I only use a tiny bit, if Only I found this years ago. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Great  serum for damaged hair. leaves in in better condition.  Very pricey, but a little goes a long way. Will definetly purchase again</li>
