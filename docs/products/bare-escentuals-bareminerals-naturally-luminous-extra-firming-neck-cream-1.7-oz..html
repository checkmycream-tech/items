            <li>I am 57 and have tried many products for the neck area.  </li>
            <li>Love this product but this time when I used it</li>
            <li>Great price fast shipping</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want something with a strong perfume type scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a slight diminishing of wrinkles and am very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>After using this for two weeks, the fine, crepe paper-like wrinkles on my chest and neck began to disappear.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is great, it&#x27;s my second purchase.</li>
            <li>Cream goes on smooth and is quickly absorbed and non greasy.</li>
            <li>This cream absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy feel to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I apply after my facial routine, and it feels really nice going on.  </li>
            <li>for instant results not that effective.</li>
            <li>thanks for such a good product...</li>
            <li>soaks right into my skin.</li>
            <li>neck tight in a good way</li>
            <li>Very gentle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for several years now and just love the feel of it and the results.</li>
            <li>There are probably products similar that would do ok as well.</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>The smell is soft and clean like soap and water.</li>
            <li>I cant say I have seen anything really miraculous.</li>
            <li>and it really lifts sagging neck or face skin.</li>
            <li>Fast forward about 3 months I decide to give it another go.</li>
            <li>thanks for the prompt service</li>
            <li>I am quite sensitive to many products and this one does not make my neck red.  </li>
            <li>I find it to be quite stinky and have to immediately spray down with body spray to be able to stand myself....</li>
            <li>This is so much better than more expensive creams.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Four is about as high as I ever give</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am 32 years old, and do not yet need anything to be lifted and firmed, however it&#x27;s never too early for prevention.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had reactions to anything or had sensitive skin before</li>
            <li>Although my skin is not loose, I do have 2 lines in my neck, and this cream softened them after just the 2 uses.  </li>
            <li>It is one of the few out there that is pure, all-natural, and PARABEN-FREE!</li>
            <li>Firmness is slightly getting more obvious, I have used the cream several months and will stick with it because I think it will continue to provide subtle but noticeable improvement.</li>

            <li> there is not much about Bare Minerals that I don&#x27;t like!</li>
            <li> The cream is thick but sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li> so it was all very strange.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin (oily around the nose and chin - dry on my cheeks and neck.)  </li>
            <li> I used this for almost two months and one day my neck was itchy and red and felt like it was burning a little bit.</li>

            <li> It is a bit expensive, but totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> Really love this product - found out just how much after trying something else:(  Would have given it all 5 stars, but the lid was cracked and broken in a spot</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I am about half way through the jar.</li>
            <li> I have noticed after a few months of use my neck is softer, less crapey, and the lines are diminished.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet after a few weeks of applying morn and night.</li>
            <li> It looks brighter, less dull.  </li>
            <li> I feel like you get a small amount for the price</li>
            <li> I use it twice daily and have been tickled silly with the results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still hoping because of all the positive reviews. :(</li>
            <li> Mystery solved :(</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want to smell like a dirty wash cloth either!  </li>
            <li> It stinks!</li>
            <li> Too bad!</li>
            <li> This neck cream smells AWFUL!  </li>

            <li> I love this neck cream.  I am 32 years old, and do not yet need anything to be lifted and firmed, however it&#x27;s never too early for prevention.  I noticed the difference in the look of my skin tone in only 2 uses.  It looks brighter, less dull.  Although my skin is not loose, I do have 2 lines in my neck, and this cream softened them after just the 2 uses.  I had a blush brush laying around that wasn&#x27;t being used, so I used it to &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; on the lotion, in upward strokes and let it soak in.  I apply after my facial routine, and it feels really nice going on.  It has a sort of cooling thing going on.  The smell takes some getting used to, it smells like the forest after it rained.  A lot of people complain about that, but I don&#x27;t mind it at all.  I prefer that to the smell of chemicals.  I recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than more expensive creams.</li>
            <li> I am about half way through the jar. I cant say I have seen anything really miraculous. Seems to hydrate well enough.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a couple days. Packaged appropriately.  Love this product. If used regularly, can definitely tell a difference - lines diminish &amp; firms neck area. Been using for several months. A must have!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> it did not do anything for me, i will not recommend it. it is not like it says extra Neck firming.</li>
            <li> Really love this product - found out just how much after trying something else:(  Would have given it all 5 stars, but the lid was cracked and broken in a spot and I had to tape it back together.</li>
            <li> Love this neck cream.  Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  I am quite sensitive to many products and this one does not make my neck red.  I like the feel it, it is a tad thicker than some, but love it.</li>
            <li> This neck cream can also be used on the face.  Very gentle and it really lifts sagging neck or face skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great, it&#x27;s my second purchase. No urge to switch.</li>
            <li> I bought this quite a while ago but felt now I should put something up. I used this for almost two months and one day my neck was itchy and red and felt like it was burning a little bit. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what it was. I started using an eczema cream, went to the doc and eventually it went away. Since I had used it for a while before the rash I didn&#x27;t think it was from this. Fast forward about 3 months I decide to give it another go. Immediately within the next day my neck was on fire again! Mystery solved :( I&#x27;ve never had reactions to anything or had sensitive skin before so it was all very strange. Too bad!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it really&lt;br /&gt;work in a month y see results and y feel&lt;br /&gt;your neck tight in a good way&lt;br /&gt;I will use any of there lines great company&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I feel like you get a small amount for the price and it hasn&#x27;t made a difference.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet after a few weeks of applying morn and night. I&#x27;m still hoping because of all the positive reviews. :(</li>
            <li> Four is about as high as I ever give and if I could I would give 4.5. Cream goes on smooth and is quickly absorbed and non greasy. Firmness is slightly getting more obvious, I have used the cream several months and will stick with it because I think it will continue to provide subtle but noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> Very exceptional neck cream!  So great, I use it on my face and chest as well!</li>
            <li> I think this product helps but not as well as some of the reviews I read. That being said....there is not much about Bare Minerals that I don&#x27;t like!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin (oily around the nose and chin - dry on my cheeks and neck.)  This cream absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy feel to my skin.  I&#x27;ve noticed a slight diminishing of wrinkles and am very happy with the product.  A little goes a long way!  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product may work well overtime. Have only been using it a few weeks. for instant results not that effective.</li>
            <li> Another wonderful bare minerals product that does what it says it does without ANY animal testing or animal by-products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for several years now and just love the feel of it and the results.</li>
            <li> This neck cream smells AWFUL!  On another sight all the reviews say that the pros are it works but the cons are the smell.  I don&#x27;t want something with a strong perfume type scent but I don&#x27;t want to smell like a dirty wash cloth either!  It stinks!</li>
            <li> Love this neck cream!  I couldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to write an online review, but this product is terrific.  After using this for two weeks, the fine, crepe paper-like wrinkles on my chest and neck began to disappear.  I use it twice daily and have been tickled silly with the results.  It is a bit expensive, but totally worth it.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell whether this product works well or not.  There are probably products similar that would do ok as well.</li>
            <li> I wish it was cheaper, but I guess I like it enough to order it again and again. (hope it&#x27;s just not my imagination) but I do feel it works!</li>
            <li> Purchased to kick my skin care regime up a notch!  So glad I did.  I like the texture and the cream soaks right into my skin.</li>
            <li> This product does a wonderful job at smoothing up the crepe paper neck lines.....if you can get beyond the smell.  I find it to be quite stinky and have to immediately spray down with body spray to be able to stand myself....but it works!</li>
            <li> The best neck cream I have used.  I am 57 and have tried many products for the neck area.  This smooths out lines and firms as well as you can expect with a cream</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I am a big BE fan and have been using their products for 5 years. Love this product but this time when I used it it felt different! Made my skin drier and my skin felt crepey. This one is going back.</li>
            <li> Great price fast shipping</li>
            <li> Wonderful neck cream.</li>
            <li> Used it for years. Really works!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I will continue to buy it when needed..thanks for such a good product... thanks for the prompt service</li>
            <li> LOVE this neck cream! It is one of the few out there that is pure, all-natural, and PARABEN-FREE! The smell is soft and clean like soap and water. The cream is thick but sinks in quickly. I have noticed after a few months of use my neck is softer, less crapey, and the lines are diminished. Thank you bareMinerals!!</li>
