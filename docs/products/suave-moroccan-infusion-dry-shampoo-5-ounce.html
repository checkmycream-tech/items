    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>For best use, shake product during application.</li>
            <li>Good price point!</li>
            <li>I have heard great things about the smell of the Keratin one by</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great if you need to do a bit of teasing but your hair is a bit oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has this great herbal, musky scent that lingers well.</li>
            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>It works great,smells great and saves you money.</li>
            <li>Still, for the price it is a great product to have on hand.</li>
            <li>in all, a great product at a good price.</li>
            <li>It took a bit, but it sucked up a good amount of the oil.</li>
            <li>It is no problem in fair hair with fair skin though.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t look too good with my otherwise shining locks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved the way my hair felt after using this</li>
            <li>, so I thought this would be a good</li>
            <li>Nice, lightweight spray with a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I had been very pleased with the Suave Moroccan products, so thought I might as well give this a shot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so very glad</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the performance</li>
            <li>So many cowlicks!</li>
            <li>The smell was nice</li>
            <li>If dispenser clogs, rinse in warm water.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Gives a nice shine without feeling oily.</li>
            <li>shampoo smells nice.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Absorbs oils (then you brush it out) VERY easy to use:</li>
            <li>To give you an idea of my hair type, I have semi-oliy very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The thing I liked the most is that this product smelled really nice, and it made your hair smell really clean.</li>
            <li>It reminds me strongly of some of the aerosol type hair sprays that were so popular 30 years ago.</li>
            <li>If you like powdery smells and have lighter hair, this may work better for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>and I have yet to find one I LOVE.</li>
            <li>It made her hair about 80% better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one drawback is when spraying this, the fragrance is a bit overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li>For the most part, I do-- but of course, there are times when I just can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I love Suave&#x27;s Moroccan Infusion line.</li>
            <li>I am glad I tried it but don&#x27;t see buying it</li>
            <li>thought this version was just ok.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>There were also many hits for \\&quot;hair</li>
            <li>so I have been trying to go longer between shampoos to avoid drying my hair out even more.</li>
            <li>The can does have more than three good-sized uses in it.</li>
            <li>It did better on my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>My hair did smell better, and looked acceptable.</li>
            <li>- so pleased that this one is now a staple in my hair care cabinet.</li>
            <li>think this is a perfect product for teens that have oily hair that maybe need to touch up their hair after gym class or band practice, or perhaps a camping trip with a special new someone.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as it does right after a shower,</li>
            <li>Probably a good substitute and better for people who have a real use for something like this (tighter schedules, etc).</li>
            <li>have very fair hair, and the powder is white.  </li>
            <li>is my favorite cheap go</li>
            <li>It serves its purpose well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However the propane scent was too strong to tolerate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of amber and this musky fragrance is STRONG.  </li>
            <li>This blasts fine powder into hair, and the propane and butane turn to foam and then disappear.  </li>
            <li>Just a fine mist that you can&#x27;t help but inhale.</li>
            <li>Dry shampoo seems like a great idea in concept, and I know some people really love the stuff</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t work well on very straight, very fine hair.</li>
            <li>But I tried both on my daughter to see how it worked on light brown hair.</li>
            <li>does a good job absorbing the oil, but it&#x27;s not like actually getting a good shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant, just strong, although it does dissapate after awhile.</li>
            <li>The entire line smells really nice, and this has been my favorite Suave line ever.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance reminds me a bit of an oriental amber.&lt;br /&gt;The dry shampoo itself is great for touch ups and added volume between shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Dry shampoo is also great to add texture , body and volume to clean hair, so it is a versatile product to have on hand.</li>
            <li>I use it even when my hair is clean to add volume.</li>
            <li>Overall leaving my hair full of body, soft to the touch, and looking great between washes!</li>
            <li>But most of them leave my hair feeling powdery and gunky, no matter how much I try to brush them out.</li>
            <li>I have tried some that really were lovely.</li>
            <li>It smells like most aerosol sprays, and then scent does fade fast.  </li>
            <li>Using it with my hair (waist length, fine, very straight)-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use when I don&#x27;t have a lot of time at home and need to be out and about on an errand or other engagement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a little more separated than my hair is after a good shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I love the Moroccan Infusion shampoo and conditioner that are made by Suave, I had high hopes for this, but, due to the strong chemical smell, I couldn&#x27;t even give it a fair shake on my head.</li>
            <li>I prefer clean, citrus, or fresh scents.  </li>
            <li>This dry shampoo does remove some of the hair oils, and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, my hair looks light and pretty clean after I&#x27;ve brushed it.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a dry shampoo at a good price, give this a try.</li>
            <li>My husband says it smells \\&quot;good, very good\\&quot; after it has been in my hair for about 10 minutes, so I am assuming it must lose more of the feet smell and turn into more of the subtle fragrance you can smell underlying.  </li>
            <li>So I thought this would be a great place to save a little money.</li>
            <li>thing I want to point out is this shampoo comes out in a very forceful aerosol stream that sends huge clouds of product into the air.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a useful product.</li>
            <li>It smoothed my hair out nicely; just left it</li>
            <li>It gives me some nice volume and lets me get away with only washing my hair 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li>Of course that kind of hair tends to weigh down easily</li>
            <li>This dray shampoo is good in a pinch and like most cheaper dry shampoos, it will leave a white residue if applied to close.</li>
            <li>I also found it really easy to apply this product, and especially since it&#x27;s aerosol, it was pretty easy to not accidentally overdo it.</li>
            <li>This Suave dry shampoo smells really good and absorbs the oil very well.</li>
            <li>good points is that it does make your hair feel thicker, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down either.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo works really nicely.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions on the can and to be honest, it took longer to apply the product than it would have to shampoo, condition and blow dry!</li>
            <li>just pretty darn close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you first spray it on, it makes your hair look gray, like a coating of gray powder.</li>
            <li>I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend to someone with a sensitivity to perfumes!</li>
            <li>It may be too heavy for some, but those who love deep, rich scents will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually love the salon products created by Suave because you just can&#x27;t beat the price and overall, they really do work well.</li>
            <li>This is pretty neat product and can be really helpful for those days when your hair is in need of a shower</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo smells amazing, and left my hair full of body.</li>
            <li>Turns out there is a class action lawsuit against them for their keratin smoothing treatment, which has caused major hair loss for many.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that gets greasy fast but has a decent amount of natural body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dull my hair at all and the smell is fairly pleasant.</li>
            <li>Dry shampoos are okay in a pinch, when I just don&#x27;t have the time</li>
            <li>It definitely worked for making my hair seem more normal after not washing, but I think just knowing</li>
            <li>love dry shampoo and use it to extend my blowouts.</li>
            <li>Suave Moroccan Infusion Dry Shampoo is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I tried using more dry shampoo each time, but the lack of effect didn&#x27;t change.  </li>
            <li>So your hair doesn&#x27;t actually smell as strong as the air does when your done.</li>
            <li>The fragrance and whatever propellant they put in it are strong enough that I want to hold my breath while spraying it.</li>
            <li>As with any dry shampoo, you really want to make sure to rub it in well</li>
            <li>You spray it into the hair, and a fine white powder comes out and is supposed to hit the roots, where you massage it in, and it absorbs the oil.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, straight, blonde hair that is prone to drying out if I wash it too much, but it also gets greasy if I don&#x27;t wash every day.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers find it pleasant, but to me it seems like an obvious musty, powdery scent.  </li>
            <li>So the oil in her hair really shows up.</li>
            <li>The drawback is that if you don&#x27;t rub it in really well, it will leave your roots looking like they have been dusted with baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I real time saver</li>
            <li>To my surprise, it really did soak up the oil.  </li>
            <li>what really got to me was the smell.  </li>
            <li>I found it useful on days when I was too busy to wash my hair</li>
            <li>So between washes with water, I use this oil absorbing</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really expect it to work well on my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent of this one</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got dark hair/skin, you might want to try it first to make sure it doesn&#x27;t show up and make you look like you have dandruff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing that it may work better for people who aren&#x27;t so sensitive, or who have bigger bathrooms in which to disperse the odor!</li>
            <li>It was certainly better than other brands that I have used that make my hair feel &amp;#34;crusty,&amp;#34;  but as a lady with baby fine hair, it still didn&#x27;t do the job well enough.  </li>
            <li>I might have still used it for emergencies right before I was heading out if it weren&#x27;t for the smell, which deters me completely from using this again.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the smell is a bit overpowering - nice smell but strong.</li>
            <li>and she has to wash her hair every single day with a strong clarifying shampoo, or else her hair looks like it hasn&#x27;t been washed for a week.</li>
            <li>It was frustrating because it is such a great product, if only it was more invisible.</li>
            <li>will try the Suave \\&quot;Dry Shampoo\\&quot; process to see if that works better \\&quot;Spray directly on oily roots.</li>
            <li>It leaves no white cast at all, isn&#x27;t overly wet when it is first applied, gives a great subtle lift to the root area and its extremely cheap at Walmart.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s important to work this into hair before the powder sets dry.  </li>
            <li>However the fragrance gets more into the air and less into the hair.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t look less oily or have more body.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes they give samples on their main website.</li>
            <li>or else you will end up being able to see the white powder/residue, especially if you have darker colored hair.</li>
            <li>Application is super simple, I basically shake the can, spray on lifted areas of my hair,massage through roots evenly, and to finish brush through my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not incredibly sensitive to strong smells, but I am sensitive enough that powerful perfume or chemical smells set me off on sneezing fits.</li>
            <li>If you have asthma or other respiratory problems, I strongly urge you not to purchase this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does apply very easily, and doesn&#x27;t leave a bunch of white powder like other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I will probably be purchasing more of this dry shampoo in the future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The dry shampoo is clay based and isn&#x27;t white, so it blends in more with your hair color.</li>
            <li>Luckily for me, I have grey hair.</li>
            <li>It seemed alright at first - went in easily, ok smell, but by the end of the day my hair looked greasier than it would with other dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li>This dry shampoo, like the other Suave dry shampoo products, works great for a one day touch up when you can&#x27;t shampoo.</li>
            <li>But considering the whole really itchy thing, it didn&#x27;t let me go longer between regular washings.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and my scalp is no exception.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really great for oily hair because it does absorb the oil well, and it will keep you from having to shampoo your hair everyday, which can be a real timesaver if you have really thick hair.</li>
            <li>For oil-prone hair, apply on first day hair is washed to give extra volume and texture as well as to absorb oil throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I also have a pretty short bob, around chin length.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have tried tons of other dry shampoos from the cheapest of the cheap to the more expensive brands, and while Evo Water killer is still my favorite</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to have on hand on those days you are late and don&#x27;t have time to do a full wash and style as well as on those days that your hair is just limp and grumpy.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day, and Suave&#x27;s regular dry shampoo in the silver and with yellow top</li>
            <li>the only real drawback aside from the cloud of aerosol is that it does leave a matte finish, so it takes away some of the natural shine.</li>
            <li>My hair just needs washed to make it light and fluffy again.</li>
            <li>If you dont have sensitive skin you might like this product</li>
            <li>but if you do be near a shower just in case.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well it worked.</li>
            <li>I thought that I might have just not used as much, but I started noticing it every time I choose this specific kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually ended up with my scalp feeling really itchy after both times</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really feel like it made a big difference with the oil either, though I didn&#x27;t have the dulling look or graying effect</li>
            <li>I prefer this dry shampoo over the Suave Keratin Infusion Color Care Dry Shampoo (that one smells too strong when sprayed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tired this on my own hair and also on my daughters.</li>
            <li>I ended up having to use a lot more than I have of other brands to fluff up the greasies.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with a dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid dry shampoo user</li>
            <li>Her hair looked like it had been doused in cooking oil, but this spray  made her hair fluffy and looked clean.</li>
            <li>those that have issues with white residue, it may help to use a boar hair brush first, then use a pick/rake-type comb to lift the hair back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>My hair has been lightened from dark brown to light blonde, so I tend to not have issues with oily hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the body I usually have with my clean hair and my naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Batiste long ago, and this was a smell improvement, but I&#x27;ve sampled other dry shampoos that I thought smelled better than this.  </li>
            <li>all, I would get this kind again if the regular Suave one was not available, or if the only other option was tresseme (not my fav.)</li>
            <li>This particular dry shampoo does everything</li>
            <li>This eliminates the hassle of completely eliminating any white residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the second dry shampoo that I have used or ever tried and I had the exact same reaction.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t brush out completely and leaves behind an invisible fine powder that can be felt if you run your hands thorough your hair.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, I sprayed as directed, and my dark hair was covered by white powder.  </li>
            <li>I have dark semi-coarse hair that I wear straight.  </li>
            <li>This stuff took my dull, limp, and very fine hair and not only took the oily look away, but gave my hair lift and made it look like thicker and fuller as well!</li>
            <li>A few spritz of this and the oil is toned down and her hair gets is nice and fluffy again.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It works great,smells great and saves you money.</li>
            <li> Still, for the price it is a great product to have on hand.</li>
            <li> in all, a great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> It took a bit, but it sucked up a good amount of the oil.</li>
            <li> It is no problem in fair hair with fair skin though.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look too good with my otherwise shining locks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> and I have yet to find one I LOVE.</li>
            <li> It made her hair about 80% better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one drawback is when spraying this, the fragrance is a bit overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li> For the most part, I do-- but of course, there are times when I just can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love Suave&#x27;s Moroccan Infusion line.</li>
            <li> I am glad I tried it but don&#x27;t see buying it</li>
            <li> thought this version was just ok.  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li> There were also many hits for \\&quot;hair</li>
            <li> so I have been trying to go longer between shampoos to avoid drying my hair out even more.</li>
            <li> The can does have more than three good-sized uses in it.</li>
            <li> It did better on my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> My hair did smell better, and looked acceptable.</li>
            <li> - so pleased that this one is now a staple in my hair care cabinet.</li>
            <li> think this is a perfect product for teens that have oily hair that maybe need to touch up their hair after gym class or band practice, or perhaps a camping trip with a special new someone.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as it does right after a shower,</li>
            <li> Probably a good substitute and better for people who have a real use for something like this (tighter schedules, etc).</li>
            <li> have very fair hair, and the powder is white.  </li>
            <li> is my favorite cheap go</li>
            <li> It serves its purpose well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However the propane scent was too strong to tolerate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of amber and this musky fragrance is STRONG.  </li>
            <li> This blasts fine powder into hair, and the propane and butane turn to foam and then disappear.  </li>
            <li> Just a fine mist that you can&#x27;t help but inhale.</li>
            <li> Dry shampoo seems like a great idea in concept, and I know some people really love the stuff</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work well on very straight, very fine hair.</li>
            <li> But I tried both on my daughter to see how it worked on light brown hair.</li>
            <li> does a good job absorbing the oil, but it&#x27;s not like actually getting a good shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unpleasant, just strong, although it does dissapate after awhile.</li>
            <li> The entire line smells really nice, and this has been my favorite Suave line ever.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance reminds me a bit of an oriental amber.&lt;br /&gt;The dry shampoo itself is great for touch ups and added volume between shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Dry shampoo is also great to add texture , body and volume to clean hair, so it is a versatile product to have on hand.</li>
            <li> I use it even when my hair is clean to add volume.</li>
            <li> Overall leaving my hair full of body, soft to the touch, and looking great between washes!</li>
            <li> But most of them leave my hair feeling powdery and gunky, no matter how much I try to brush them out.</li>
            <li> I have tried some that really were lovely.</li>
            <li> It smells like most aerosol sprays, and then scent does fade fast.  </li>
            <li> Using it with my hair (waist length, fine, very straight)-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to use when I don&#x27;t have a lot of time at home and need to be out and about on an errand or other engagement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a little more separated than my hair is after a good shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I love the Moroccan Infusion shampoo and conditioner that are made by Suave, I had high hopes for this, but, due to the strong chemical smell, I couldn&#x27;t even give it a fair shake on my head.</li>
            <li> I prefer clean, citrus, or fresh scents.  </li>
            <li> This dry shampoo does remove some of the hair oils, and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, my hair looks light and pretty clean after I&#x27;ve brushed it.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a dry shampoo at a good price, give this a try.</li>
            <li> My husband says it smells \\&quot;good, very good\\&quot; after it has been in my hair for about 10 minutes, so I am assuming it must lose more of the feet smell and turn into more of the subtle fragrance you can smell underlying.  </li>
            <li> So I thought this would be a great place to save a little money.</li>
            <li> thing I want to point out is this shampoo comes out in a very forceful aerosol stream that sends huge clouds of product into the air.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a useful product.</li>
            <li> It smoothed my hair out nicely; just left it</li>
            <li> It gives me some nice volume and lets me get away with only washing my hair 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> Of course that kind of hair tends to weigh down easily</li>
            <li> This dray shampoo is good in a pinch and like most cheaper dry shampoos, it will leave a white residue if applied to close.</li>
            <li> I also found it really easy to apply this product, and especially since it&#x27;s aerosol, it was pretty easy to not accidentally overdo it.</li>
            <li> This Suave dry shampoo smells really good and absorbs the oil very well.</li>
            <li> good points is that it does make your hair feel thicker, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down either.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works really nicely.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions on the can and to be honest, it took longer to apply the product than it would have to shampoo, condition and blow dry!</li>
            <li> just pretty darn close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you first spray it on, it makes your hair look gray, like a coating of gray powder.</li>
            <li> I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend to someone with a sensitivity to perfumes!</li>
            <li> It may be too heavy for some, but those who love deep, rich scents will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually love the salon products created by Suave because you just can&#x27;t beat the price and overall, they really do work well.</li>
            <li> This is pretty neat product and can be really helpful for those days when your hair is in need of a shower</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo smells amazing, and left my hair full of body.</li>
            <li> Turns out there is a class action lawsuit against them for their keratin smoothing treatment, which has caused major hair loss for many.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair that gets greasy fast but has a decent amount of natural body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dull my hair at all and the smell is fairly pleasant.</li>
            <li> Dry shampoos are okay in a pinch, when I just don&#x27;t have the time</li>
            <li> It definitely worked for making my hair seem more normal after not washing, but I think just knowing</li>
            <li> love dry shampoo and use it to extend my blowouts.</li>
            <li> Suave Moroccan Infusion Dry Shampoo is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I tried using more dry shampoo each time, but the lack of effect didn&#x27;t change.  </li>
            <li> So your hair doesn&#x27;t actually smell as strong as the air does when your done.</li>
            <li> The fragrance and whatever propellant they put in it are strong enough that I want to hold my breath while spraying it.</li>
            <li> As with any dry shampoo, you really want to make sure to rub it in well</li>
            <li> You spray it into the hair, and a fine white powder comes out and is supposed to hit the roots, where you massage it in, and it absorbs the oil.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, straight, blonde hair that is prone to drying out if I wash it too much, but it also gets greasy if I don&#x27;t wash every day.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers find it pleasant, but to me it seems like an obvious musty, powdery scent.  </li>
            <li> So the oil in her hair really shows up.</li>
            <li> The drawback is that if you don&#x27;t rub it in really well, it will leave your roots looking like they have been dusted with baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I real time saver</li>
            <li> To my surprise, it really did soak up the oil.  </li>
            <li> what really got to me was the smell.  </li>
            <li> I found it useful on days when I was too busy to wash my hair</li>
            <li> So between washes with water, I use this oil absorbing</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really expect it to work well on my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this one</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got dark hair/skin, you might want to try it first to make sure it doesn&#x27;t show up and make you look like you have dandruff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that it may work better for people who aren&#x27;t so sensitive, or who have bigger bathrooms in which to disperse the odor!</li>
            <li> It was certainly better than other brands that I have used that make my hair feel &amp;#34;crusty,&amp;#34;  but as a lady with baby fine hair, it still didn&#x27;t do the job well enough.  </li>
            <li> I might have still used it for emergencies right before I was heading out if it weren&#x27;t for the smell, which deters me completely from using this again.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the smell is a bit overpowering - nice smell but strong.</li>
            <li> and she has to wash her hair every single day with a strong clarifying shampoo, or else her hair looks like it hasn&#x27;t been washed for a week.</li>
            <li> It was frustrating because it is such a great product, if only it was more invisible.</li>
            <li> will try the Suave \\&quot;Dry Shampoo\\&quot; process to see if that works better \\&quot;Spray directly on oily roots.</li>
            <li> It leaves no white cast at all, isn&#x27;t overly wet when it is first applied, gives a great subtle lift to the root area and its extremely cheap at Walmart.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s important to work this into hair before the powder sets dry.  </li>
            <li> However the fragrance gets more into the air and less into the hair.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look less oily or have more body.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes they give samples on their main website.</li>
            <li> or else you will end up being able to see the white powder/residue, especially if you have darker colored hair.</li>
            <li> Application is super simple, I basically shake the can, spray on lifted areas of my hair,massage through roots evenly, and to finish brush through my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not incredibly sensitive to strong smells, but I am sensitive enough that powerful perfume or chemical smells set me off on sneezing fits.</li>
            <li> If you have asthma or other respiratory problems, I strongly urge you not to purchase this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does apply very easily, and doesn&#x27;t leave a bunch of white powder like other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I will probably be purchasing more of this dry shampoo in the future.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The dry shampoo is clay based and isn&#x27;t white, so it blends in more with your hair color.</li>
            <li> Luckily for me, I have grey hair.</li>
            <li> It seemed alright at first - went in easily, ok smell, but by the end of the day my hair looked greasier than it would with other dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li> This dry shampoo, like the other Suave dry shampoo products, works great for a one day touch up when you can&#x27;t shampoo.</li>
            <li> But considering the whole really itchy thing, it didn&#x27;t let me go longer between regular washings.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and my scalp is no exception.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really great for oily hair because it does absorb the oil well, and it will keep you from having to shampoo your hair everyday, which can be a real timesaver if you have really thick hair.</li>
            <li> For oil-prone hair, apply on first day hair is washed to give extra volume and texture as well as to absorb oil throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I also have a pretty short bob, around chin length.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of other dry shampoos from the cheapest of the cheap to the more expensive brands, and while Evo Water killer is still my favorite</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to have on hand on those days you are late and don&#x27;t have time to do a full wash and style as well as on those days that your hair is just limp and grumpy.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day, and Suave&#x27;s regular dry shampoo in the silver and with yellow top</li>
            <li> the only real drawback aside from the cloud of aerosol is that it does leave a matte finish, so it takes away some of the natural shine.</li>
            <li> My hair just needs washed to make it light and fluffy again.</li>
            <li> If you dont have sensitive skin you might like this product</li>
            <li> but if you do be near a shower just in case.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well it worked.</li>
            <li> I thought that I might have just not used as much, but I started noticing it every time I choose this specific kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually ended up with my scalp feeling really itchy after both times</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really feel like it made a big difference with the oil either, though I didn&#x27;t have the dulling look or graying effect</li>
            <li> I prefer this dry shampoo over the Suave Keratin Infusion Color Care Dry Shampoo (that one smells too strong when sprayed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tired this on my own hair and also on my daughters.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to use a lot more than I have of other brands to fluff up the greasies.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I am an avid dry shampoo user</li>
            <li> Her hair looked like it had been doused in cooking oil, but this spray  made her hair fluffy and looked clean.</li>
            <li> those that have issues with white residue, it may help to use a boar hair brush first, then use a pick/rake-type comb to lift the hair back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> My hair has been lightened from dark brown to light blonde, so I tend to not have issues with oily hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the body I usually have with my clean hair and my naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Batiste long ago, and this was a smell improvement, but I&#x27;ve sampled other dry shampoos that I thought smelled better than this.  </li>
            <li> all, I would get this kind again if the regular Suave one was not available, or if the only other option was tresseme (not my fav.)</li>
            <li> This particular dry shampoo does everything</li>
            <li> This eliminates the hassle of completely eliminating any white residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the second dry shampoo that I have used or ever tried and I had the exact same reaction.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t brush out completely and leaves behind an invisible fine powder that can be felt if you run your hands thorough your hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I sprayed as directed, and my dark hair was covered by white powder.  </li>
            <li> I have dark semi-coarse hair that I wear straight.  </li>
            <li> This stuff took my dull, limp, and very fine hair and not only took the oily look away, but gave my hair lift and made it look like thicker and fuller as well!</li>
            <li> A few spritz of this and the oil is toned down and her hair gets is nice and fluffy again.</li>
            <li> Not the same as a real shampoo, but if I&#x27;m having a lazy Sunday or the like, I can skip the daily shampoo and not look</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps this product would be better for those with lighter colored hair and who, for some reason, can&#x27;t take a few extra minutes to wash and dry -- maybe those who have really thick, oily hair and who might have an urgent need when traveling perhaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost the entire can and the product meets my minimum expectations of dry shampoo, i.e. removing the appearance of oily roots without leaving white residue.  </li>
            <li> After shaking vigorously, I barely depress the button for like a second, to make short bursts from eight inches away.  </li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t turn my roots ashy or overly white (I am blonde with darkish blond/light brown roots so a subtle lightening of my roots doesn&#x27;t hurt but that grey look is not hot), gives a decent volume and smells decent.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that the hair loss was only on the places where I sprayed the dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, if you like the shampoo, the dry shampoo smells different.  </li>
            <li> After my last kiddo, I developed all sorts of random allergies, so now I only try something new, be it food or product, one at a time, and then I keep track of any changes over the next couple of weeks/months.  </li>
            <li> If you have dark hair, I recommend bumble and bumble dry shampoo for brunettes or clear dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> flat out didn&#x27;t notice a difference with the dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> loss\\&quot; and \\&quot;Suave\\&quot; just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t going crazy.  </li>
            <li> Beauty magazines and blogs are always raving about dry shampoo, so I&#x27;ve been wanting to try it a long time.  </li>
            <li> I color my hair and like the option of dry shampoo to extend time between washing.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been around the dry shampoo block once or twice</li>
            <li> All dry shampoos have done that to me though.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> On those occasions, I use this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> But the Suave dry shampoo was a disappointment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> noticed no difference between this and the Keratin infusion Dry Shampoo by Suave.  </li>
            <li> The Suave Moroccan Infusion Dry Shampoo I would recommend if you are needing your hair to be refreshed between washes without water.</li>
            <li> dry</li>
            <li> My hair also became dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> loss\\&quot;  and \\&quot;Suave dry</li>
            <li> I have been using the Suave dry shampoo once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but since I&#x27;m waiting between shampoos, my scalp gets a yucky feeling and that feeling goes away as soon as I spray the Suave dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I tried using the dry shampoo on three separate occasions, each with day-old hair.  </li>
            <li> Her hair has such oil problems she almost needs a shower half way through the day.</li>
            <li> The spray helped refresh hair for about half a day before the hair went back to a half-greasy, half-chalky state making everything look like a rat&#x27;s nest.</li>
            <li> The last time I tried a dry shampoo was back in the 70&#x27;s - remember that stuff that left your hair white and scary looking?</li>
            <li> This works just as well as any other dry shampoo I have used.</li>
            <li> Then I brush it all out and hair is less oily but soft and less weighed down.</li>
            <li> A small amount of this product does go a long way, and you only need to put it on your roots anyway.</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised with Suave products lately.</li>
            <li> My previously healthy, shiny, and thick hair started to thin and fall out after using this for a few months.  </li>
            <li> the scent, this is your average dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality is about on par with got2be dry shampoo, but it costs slightly less that got2be.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any difference from the &amp;#34;Morrocan Infusion&amp;#34;, whatever that is, from the other Suave dry shampoo products I&#x27;ve used previously.</li>
            <li> As stated, the product does cause hair to feel softer, probably due to the powder.  </li>
            <li> I can usually get through a day if I wash my hair in the morning, but any longer than 24 hours later my hair starts to look greasy.  </li>
            <li> or some other brand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not a huge fan of dry shampoos but this the Suave is the nicest one that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It feels lighter and doesn&#x27;t leave a white powder, at least none that I can see in my blond hair.</li>
            <li> My nearly shoulder-length hair is color-treated and thin and doesn&#x27;t tend to be oily, and the color is a medium to dark brown (a 5 or 6 color).</li>
            <li> Her hair gets this greasy look all the way down to the tips.</li>
            <li> Cleans hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Use sparingly to cut down on visible powder in your hair.</li>
            <li> It takes the oil down, but my hair gets a mind of</li>
            <li> This Suave Moroccan Infusion Dry Shampoo is a step up from those that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I tried this dry shampoo on a morning before work instead of washing my hair in the shower as usual.</li>
            <li> few hours later, though, when the sun was shining down on my head, I noticed that the hair was still really dull.  </li>

            <li> I color my hair and like the option of dry shampoo to extend time between washing.  I have dark semi-coarse hair that I wear straight.  I&#x27;ve used almost the entire can and the product meets my minimum expectations of dry shampoo, i.e. removing the appearance of oily roots without leaving white residue.  After shaking vigorously, I barely depress the button for like a second, to make short bursts from eight inches away.  Usually I spray this on my roots before going to bed and brush out in the morning.  It&#x27;s hard to explain, but if I look closely my shiny hair does seem to come through a slight cast of dullness.  As stated, the product does cause hair to feel softer, probably due to the powder.  It also did not alter the body that I had in my hairstyle.  I will not buy this product again, however, because of the smell.  Other reviewers find it pleasant, but to me it seems like an obvious musty, powdery scent.  I&#x27;ve tried Batiste long ago, and this was a smell improvement, but I&#x27;ve sampled other dry shampoos that I thought smelled better than this.  I prefer clean, citrus, or fresh scents.  If you like powdery smells and have lighter hair, this may work better for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that have issues with white residue, it may help to use a boar hair brush first, then use a pick/rake-type comb to lift the hair back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I had a coupon offer for this, so bought it in store at a discounted price.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been around the dry shampoo block once or twice and I have yet to find one I LOVE. That means it works well, doesn&#x27;t turn my roots ashy or overly white (I am blonde with darkish blond/light brown roots so a subtle lightening of my roots doesn&#x27;t hurt but that grey look is not hot), gives a decent volume and smells decent. This particular dry shampoo does everything well BUT it smells like stinky, sweaty feet that someone tried to cover up with body spray. I am NOT at all picky with scent but this sucker is smelly. I can&#x27;t smell my roots after I put it on but the scent lingers in the room for about 10 mins. My husband says it smells \\&quot;good, very good\\&quot; after it has been in my hair for about 10 minutes, so I am assuming it must lose more of the feet smell and turn into more of the subtle fragrance you can smell underlying.  It leaves no white cast at all, isn&#x27;t overly wet when it is first applied, gives a great subtle lift to the root area and its extremely cheap at Walmart. I have heard great things about the smell of the Keratin one by Suave so I may try that next, I just tend to stay away from putting protein in my hqir as it makes ot brittle.</li>
            <li> This is to be sprayed into hair instead of washing it, for days when that is convenient.  This blasts fine powder into hair, and the propane and butane turn to foam and then disappear.  One&#x27;s hair is left non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to work this into hair before the powder sets dry.  This includes aluminum starch octenylsuccinate, an anti-caking agent, and silicon dioxide (silica) which is found in quartz.</li>
            <li> I tired this on my own hair and also on my daughters. My hair has been lightened from dark brown to light blonde, so I tend to not have issues with oily hair. My hair just needs washed to make it light and fluffy again. My daughter however is another story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s 13 and she has to wash her hair every single day with a strong clarifying shampoo, or else her hair looks like it hasn&#x27;t been washed for a week. She has thinner hair than I do, and it&#x27;s a medium brown color. So the oil in her hair really shows up. She doesn&#x27;t just get oily hair at the roots. Her hair gets this greasy look all the way down to the tips. So if there was any test for a product, her hair would be it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She washed her hair Thursday before school, and then there was no school on Friday. So she skipped her Friday shower and on Saturday I sprayed this Suave spray into her hair to see how well it would work. It took a bit, but it sucked up a good amount of the oil. It made her hair about 80% better. I was shocked actually. Her hair looked like it had been doused in cooking oil, but this spray  made her hair fluffy and looked clean. Not as good as it does right after a shower, just pretty darn close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one drawback is when spraying this, the fragrance is a bit overwhelming. It will fill a room. However the fragrance gets more into the air and less into the hair. So your hair doesn&#x27;t actually smell as strong as the air does when your done. This is pretty neat product and can be really helpful for those days when your hair is in need of a shower but you can&#x27;t get one. I plan to get a few cans of this to keep on hand for my daughter. Her hair has such oil problems she almost needs a shower half way through the day. A few spritz of this and the oil is toned down and her hair gets is nice and fluffy again.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product.  The entire line smells really nice, and this has been my favorite Suave line ever.  The fragrance reminds me a bit of an oriental amber.&lt;br /&gt;The dry shampoo itself is great for touch ups and added volume between shampoos.  You spray it into the hair, and a fine white powder comes out and is supposed to hit the roots, where you massage it in, and it absorbs the oil.  Then you brush your hair and any excess powder should come on out.&lt;br /&gt;It does a good job absorbing the oil, but it&#x27;s not like actually getting a good shampoo.  Nothing will replace a headboard and a wash if you&#x27;ve got a patient that can&#x27;t wash their hair.  That said, this will help out so that doesn&#x27;t have to happen as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a perfect product for teens that have oily hair that maybe need to touch up their hair after gym class or band practice, or perhaps a camping trip with a special new someone.  It&#x27;s also great if you need to do a bit of teasing but your hair is a bit oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a day though, I had to wash my hair because it made my scalp a bit itchy.  All dry shampoos have done that to me though.&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair hair, and the powder is white.  I could not see the powder at all.  If you&#x27;ve got dark hair/skin, you might want to try it first to make sure it doesn&#x27;t show up and make you look like you have dandruff. Sometimes they give samples on their main website. I&#x27;d maybe even email and ask for one.  It is no problem in fair hair with fair skin though.  I could not see it at all, and had my husband check- he couldn&#x27;t detect it either.</li>
            <li> I have an oily scalp and need to wash my hair every day. For the most part, I do-- but of course, there are times when I just can&#x27;t. On those occasions, I use this dry shampoo. When you first spray it on, it makes your hair look gray, like a coating of gray powder. But in a minute or two, you can brush through it and the gray disappears... and so does the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed by how this gives my hair lift, not just takes away the oil. It&#x27;s hard to tell the difference between when I&#x27;ve washed it and when I haven&#x27;t... the only real drawback aside from the cloud of aerosol is that it does leave a matte finish, so it takes away some of the natural shine. But I try to just concentrate it on the roots so that the length of my hair still has some shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> I love Suave&#x27;s Moroccan Infusion line. It has this great herbal, musky scent that lingers well. It may be too heavy for some, but those who love deep, rich scents will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the scent, this is your average dry shampoo. It serves its purpose well and is easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t brush out completely and leaves behind an invisible fine powder that can be felt if you run your hands thorough your hair.</li>
            <li> Dry shampoos are okay in a pinch, when I just don&#x27;t have the time or it&#x27;s inconvenient to wash and dry my hair. But most of them leave my hair feeling powdery and gunky, no matter how much I try to brush them out. This Suave Moroccan Infusion Dry Shampoo is a step up from those that I&#x27;ve used in the past. It feels lighter and doesn&#x27;t leave a white powder, at least none that I can see in my blond hair. While my hair doesn&#x27;t have that just washed feeling, it doesn&#x27;t feel too covered in spray. Most importantly, my hair looks light and pretty clean after I&#x27;ve brushed it. The fragrance and whatever propellant they put in it are strong enough that I want to hold my breath while spraying it. But the fragrance dissipates after a very short time so all in all it&#x27;s a useful product.</li>
            <li> I actually love the salon products created by Suave because you just can&#x27;t beat the price and overall, they really do work well. The thing I liked the most is that this product smelled really nice, and it made your hair smell really clean. The drawback is that if you don&#x27;t rub it in really well, it will leave your roots looking like they have been dusted with baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other good points is that it does make your hair feel thicker, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down either. A small amount of this product does go a long way, and you only need to put it on your roots anyway. It&#x27;s really great for oily hair because it does absorb the oil well, and it will keep you from having to shampoo your hair everyday, which can be a real timesaver if you have really thick hair. Good product.</li>
            <li> Dry shampoo seems like a great idea in concept, and I know some people really love the stuff (I wanted to, too), but it&#x27;s just not for me. It definitely worked for making my hair seem more normal after not washing, but I think just knowing I had not actually washed my hair made me feel like my hair looked worse than it did after I used this. It does apply very easily, and doesn&#x27;t leave a bunch of white powder like other brands I&#x27;ve tried. It smoothed my hair out nicely; just left it a little more separated than my hair is after a good shower. Probably a good substitute and better for people who have a real use for something like this (tighter schedules, etc).</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised with Suave products lately. I have tried some that really were lovely. This isn&#x27;t one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love dry shampoo and use it to extend my blowouts. I have tried several brands and found almost all to work well. So I thought this would be a great place to save a little money. But the Suave dry shampoo was a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed no difference between this and the Keratin infusion Dry Shampoo by Suave.  They were both abysmal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed it in and got no benefit. I ended up having to use a lot more than I have of other brands to fluff up the greasies. Then the white powder clumped and flaked everywhere. No amount of brushing would distribute it or lighten it. Luckily for me, I have grey hair. But I tried both on my daughter to see how it worked on light brown hair. You could totally see it. I could not brush it away.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and my scalp is no exception. Using shampoos and conditioners have been hit and miss over the years but this is the second time I had to jump into the shower to get it out because of the itching. This is the second dry shampoo that I have used or ever tried and I had the exact same reaction. The smell was nice but that was it for me. If you dont have sensitive skin you might like this product but if you do be near a shower just in case. Lol</li>
            <li> This works just as well as any other dry shampoo I have used. I usually use Ojon or Oscar Blandi. This Suave dry shampoo smells really good and absorbs the oil very well. As with any dry shampoo, you really want to make sure to rub it in well or else you will end up being able to see the white powder/residue, especially if you have darker colored hair. Dry shampoo is also great to add texture , body and volume to clean hair, so it is a versatile product to have on hand. This is a Suave product I would actually buy regularly. It works great,smells great and saves you money.</li>
            <li> Absorbs oils (then you brush it out) VERY easy to use: Shake can well while lifting sections of nonwet oily hair and spraying. When done I use a brush to apply thoroughly and evenly. Then I brush it all out and hair is less oily but soft and less weighed down. I real time saver when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the propane scent was too strong to tolerate. And my hair looked lifeless and dull - but less oily. I think everyone will be different depending on your hair type. I am glad I tried it but don&#x27;t see buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try the Suave \\&quot;Dry Shampoo\\&quot; process to see if that works better \\&quot;Spray directly on oily roots. Use heat from the palm of your hand to rub in excess powder. For oil-prone hair, apply on first day hair is washed to give extra volume and texture as well as to absorb oil throughout the day. For best use, shake product during application. If dispenser clogs, rinse in warm water.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I sprayed as directed, and my dark hair was covered by white powder.  I had to brush and brush to get it out, and afterwards not only was my hair tacky feeling, but it was dull, dull, dull.  Truly, every bit of shine was sucked out of it. And my gosh, the scent!  It was lingering and overpowering. I had to wash this disgusting mess out of my hair immediately.  I was already thinking of the negative review I was going to write, but a few days later I decided to give it another try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, I used it only at the temples where my hair gets greasy--the underneath portion next to my scalp.  To my surprise, it really did soak up the oil.  Not the same as a real shampoo, but if I&#x27;m having a lazy Sunday or the like, I can skip the daily shampoo and not look bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I want to point out is this shampoo comes out in a very forceful aerosol stream that sends huge clouds of product into the air.  There isn&#x27;t any way to escape it and I hack and cough.  If you have asthma or other respiratory problems, I strongly urge you not to purchase this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is ok for spot cleaning but terrible if you want to spray it all over.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a dry shampoo.  When I sprayed it on my roots, and combed it through the hair, I saw a grayish film forming that made my hair look lifeless and dull.  As I combed it through, the gray disappeared, and I breathed a sigh of relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few hours later, though, when the sun was shining down on my head, I noticed that the hair was still really dull.  It didn&#x27;t look too good with my otherwise shining locks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what really got to me was the smell.  I&#x27;m not a fan of amber and this musky fragrance is STRONG.  I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend to someone with a sensitivity to perfumes!</li>
            <li> Nice, lightweight spray with a pleasant smell. Cleans hair without weighing it down. Gives a nice shine without feeling oily. If you are looking for a dry shampoo at a good price, give this a try.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works really nicely.  I found it useful on days when I was too busy to wash my hair - I was still presentable and my hair did not look oily or gross.  I was surprised at how well it worked.</li>
            <li> To give you an idea of my hair type, I have semi-oliy very fine hair.  I can usually get through a day if I wash my hair in the morning, but any longer than 24 hours later my hair starts to look greasy.  I also have a pretty short bob, around chin length.  I am an avid dry shampoo user so I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day, and Suave&#x27;s regular dry shampoo in the silver and with yellow top is my favorite cheap go to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this version was just ok.  It was certainly better than other brands that I have used that make my hair feel &amp;#34;crusty,&amp;#34;  but as a lady with baby fine hair, it still didn&#x27;t do the job well enough.  It seemed alright at first - went in easily, ok smell, but by the end of the day my hair looked greasier than it would with other dry shampoos.  I thought that I might have just not used as much, but I started noticing it every time I choose this specific kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I would get this kind again if the regular Suave one was not available, or if the only other option was tresseme (not my fav.) or some other brand I was not familiar with.</li>
            <li> I tried this dry shampoo on a morning before work instead of washing my hair in the shower as usual. My nearly shoulder-length hair is color-treated and thin and doesn&#x27;t tend to be oily, and the color is a medium to dark brown (a 5 or 6 color). I followed the directions on the can and to be honest, it took longer to apply the product than it would have to shampoo, condition and blow dry! Taking each section, lifting it up, and spraying at the root and crown area, then brushing it out, then styling. My hair was still sort of lifeless and the worst part was, when I looked closely, I could see a whitish residue on my hair. That doesn&#x27;t work for me. I didn&#x27;t get the body I usually have with my clean hair and my naturally curly hair didn&#x27;t revive with the spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this product would be better for those with lighter colored hair and who, for some reason, can&#x27;t take a few extra minutes to wash and dry -- maybe those who have really thick, oily hair and who might have an urgent need when traveling perhaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this, I&#x27;ve decided that when my hair is dirty, I&#x27;ll just wash it as usual everyday instead of using this product!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF. However, I am confused as to why it&#x27;s nealry $12 on Amazon but less than $4 at Target? I have fine, straight, blonde hair that is prone to drying out if I wash it too much, but it also gets greasy if I don&#x27;t wash every day. I have tried tons of other dry shampoos from the cheapest of the cheap to the more expensive brands, and while Evo Water killer is still my favorite it is also $22 for a bottle that lasts about a month. Suave Moroccan Infusion Dry Shampoo is my favorite. It gives me some nice volume and lets me get away with only washing my hair 2-3 times a week. I use it even when my hair is clean to add volume. It doesn&#x27;t dull my hair at all and the smell is fairly pleasant.Would recommend this product to anyone with hair similar to mine!</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo smells amazing, and left my hair full of body. I loved the way my hair felt after using this and it made my hair easier to style. The only problem is, no matter how much I brushed, shook, fluffed, and even wiped my hair, there was a white residue that was really obvious in my hair. It was frustrating because it is such a great product, if only it was more invisible. Still, for the price it is a great product to have on hand. Use sparingly to cut down on visible powder in your hair.</li>
            <li> The Suave Moroccan Infusion Dry Shampoo I would recommend if you are needing your hair to be refreshed between washes without water. I have oily hair and if I don&#x27;t wash my hair every two days or so it starts looking undesirable and leaving my head feeling kinda icky. So between washes with water, I use this oil absorbing dry shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shampoo allows me to refresh and revitalize my hair quicker than a wash in shower ever could. It travels well leaving me without worry of leaking all over my stuff. It&#x27;s great to use when I don&#x27;t have a lot of time at home and need to be out and about on an errand or other engagement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo smells nice. It&#x27;s not overpowering in scent but just enough to recognize its present. Application is super simple, I basically shake the can, spray on lifted areas of my hair,massage through roots evenly, and to finish brush through my hair. Overall leaving my hair full of body, soft to the touch, and looking great between washes! I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> My previously healthy, shiny, and thick hair started to thin and fall out after using this for a few months.  After my last kiddo, I developed all sorts of random allergies, so now I only try something new, be it food or product, one at a time, and then I keep track of any changes over the next couple of weeks/months.  My hair didn&#x27;t fall out at first, but after a month, my hair started shedding like crazy on the days that I did shampoo.  I also noticed that the hair loss was only on the places where I sprayed the dry shampoo.  My hair also became dry and brittle.  I Googled \\&quot;hair loss\\&quot; and \\&quot;Suave\\&quot; just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t going crazy.  Turns out there is a class action lawsuit against them for their keratin smoothing treatment, which has caused major hair loss for many.  There were also many hits for \\&quot;hair loss\\&quot;  and \\&quot;Suave dry shampoo.\\&quot; Everyone is different and no product impacts everyone in the same way, but be on the look-out for hair loss when using this product.</li>
            <li> This dray shampoo is good in a pinch and like most cheaper dry shampoos, it will leave a white residue if applied to close. If you have dark hair, I recommend bumble and bumble dry shampoo for brunettes or clear dry shampoo. This eliminates the hassle of completely eliminating any white residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My preferred dry shampoo is drybar which is very expensive at $20 a pop so i thought about getting this cheaper alternative. This dry shampoo does remove some of the hair oils, and has a pleasant scent. I prefer this dry shampoo over the Suave Keratin Infusion Color Care Dry Shampoo (that one smells too strong when sprayed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is about on par with got2be dry shampoo, but it costs slightly less that got2be.  I will probably be purchasing more of this dry shampoo in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not incredibly sensitive to strong smells, but I am sensitive enough that powerful perfume or chemical smells set me off on sneezing fits. It&#x27;s not uncommon after a shower for the mix of shampoo, conditioner, deodorant and moisturizing lotion in the bathroom to set me off on a sneezing jag - and I try not to have strong-smelling products. This was just insanely hard for me to tolerate. One spray and I had to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I love the Moroccan Infusion shampoo and conditioner that are made by Suave, I had high hopes for this, but, due to the strong chemical smell, I couldn&#x27;t even give it a fair shake on my head. I&#x27;m guessing that it may work better for people who aren&#x27;t so sensitive, or who have bigger bathrooms in which to disperse the odor!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not a huge fan of dry shampoos but this the Suave is the nicest one that I&#x27;ve tried. I recently did some damage to my hair with over processing so I have been trying to go longer between shampoos to avoid drying my hair out even more. I have been using the Suave dry shampoo once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nicest things about the Suave as compared to some other brands I&#x27;ve tried like Tresemme is that it doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant scent and it does not dispense that white powder all over my hair. I can&#x27;t see this in my hair once I&#x27;ve sprayed it on. It does have scent but the scent is not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well. I don&#x27;t have oily hair but since I&#x27;m waiting between shampoos, my scalp gets a yucky feeling and that feeling goes away as soon as I spray the Suave dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo, like the other Suave dry shampoo products, works great for a one day touch up when you can&#x27;t shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t leave white residue if&lt;br /&gt;used as recommended, but it does have&lt;br /&gt;quite a bit of fragrance . It&#x27;s not unpleasant, just strong, although it does dissapate after awhile. I don&#x27;t notice any difference from the &amp;#34;Morrocan Infusion&amp;#34;, whatever that is, from the other Suave dry shampoo products I&#x27;ve used previously. Good price point!</li>
            <li> Beauty magazines and blogs are always raving about dry shampoo, so I&#x27;ve been wanting to try it a long time.  I like the Suave Moroccan Infusion Shampoo, so I thought this would be a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, if you like the shampoo, the dry shampoo smells different.  It smells like most aerosol sprays, and then scent does fade fast.  I tried using the dry shampoo on three separate occasions, each with day-old hair.  I have fine hair that gets greasy fast but has a decent amount of natural body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I flat out didn&#x27;t notice a difference with the dry shampoo.  It didn&#x27;t look less oily or have more body.  At the same time, it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel weird and it washed out easily enough.  I tried using more dry shampoo each time, but the lack of effect didn&#x27;t change.  The can does have more than three good-sized uses in it.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work well on very straight, very fine hair. Of course that kind of hair tends to weigh down easily and I didn&#x27;t really expect it to work well on my hair. It did better on my son&#x27;s hair. Using it with my hair (waist length, fine, very straight)- I needed to use quite a lot and brush it out with a boar bristle brush- then wash the smell out of my brush. My hair did smell better, and looked acceptable. Using it on my son&#x27;s thick curls, it did work with a comb, and his hair fluffed out like it does when it&#x27;s clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is the scent. It reminds me strongly of some of the aerosol type hair sprays that were so popular 30 years ago. Just a fine mist that you can&#x27;t help but inhale. It works- but I&#x27;d recommend wearing a mask to use it. I was hoping for a convenient alternative to using cocoa and arrowroot in a pinch, but this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> The last time I tried a dry shampoo was back in the 70&#x27;s - remember that stuff that left your hair white and scary looking? Well, since then, I haven&#x27;t tried another one until now. I had been very pleased with the Suave Moroccan products, so thought I might as well give this a shot. I&#x27;m so very glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dry shampoo is clay based and isn&#x27;t white, so it blends in more with your hair color. You hold your hair in parts, spray at the base where the oil is, rub in and style. Wow! This stuff took my dull, limp, and very fine hair and not only took the oily look away, but gave my hair lift and made it look like thicker and fuller as well! I am very pleased with the performance - so pleased that this one is now a staple in my hair care cabinet. It&#x27;s so nice to have on hand on those days you are late and don&#x27;t have time to do a full wash and style as well as on those days that your hair is just limp and grumpy. My only complaint is that the smell is a bit overpowering - nice smell but strong.</li>
            <li> I have dark, thick hair. Using this product noticeably dulled my hair color. The spray helped refresh hair for about half a day before the hair went back to a half-greasy, half-chalky state making everything look like a rat&#x27;s nest. I might have still used it for emergencies right before I was heading out if it weren&#x27;t for the smell, which deters me completely from using this again. The smell lingered far too long (basically until the end of the day when I finally had to take a shower to wash the smell out since it was making me sick). It screams to everyone you interact with you&#x27;re trying to cover up something with some unpleasant aerosol/deodorant type smell. It&#x27;s much less embarrassing and less nausea-inducing to just go another day with dirty, greasy hair if you don&#x27;t have time to wash.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t for me. I actually ended up with my scalp feeling really itchy after both times I tried to use this. I didn&#x27;t really feel like it made a big difference with the oil either, though I didn&#x27;t have the dulling look or graying effect others have mentioned. I also found it really easy to apply this product, and especially since it&#x27;s aerosol, it was pretty easy to not accidentally overdo it. I really like the scent of this one, it&#x27;s subtle but still adds a little something. But considering the whole really itchy thing, it didn&#x27;t let me go longer between regular washings.</li>
            <li> Eh. It takes the oil down, but my hair gets a mind of it&#x27;s own. So many cowlicks! Why?</li>
