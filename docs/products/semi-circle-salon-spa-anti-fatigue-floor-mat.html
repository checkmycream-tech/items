            <li>but I love them :) my legs don&#x27;t hurt at the end of the day like they were!</li>
            <li>Feels great to stand on and has a great low profile edge so hair and debris doesn&#x27;t find their way under the mat.</li>
            <li>We purchased these several months ago during remodeling they look great and our stylists are well pleased with them we give them 5 stars very affordable great product</li>

            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>They really are anti fatigue.  </li>
            <li>Fits perfectly with a round base styling chair and the quality is quite nice.</li>
            <li>and you can easily trip on it, kind of disappointing.</li>
            <li>They accepted the return for a full refund, but I had to pay $20 to ship it back to them, so the crummy mat ended up costing me $20, and I am left with nothing.</li>

            <li> I let it sit flat for over a week, and couldnt get the mat to lay flat.</li>
            <li> I even tried tapping them down, that too did not work.  </li>
            <li> After just a few months the edges peel upward causing a trip hazard for both the stylist and the customer.  </li>
            <li> The mat was delivered on time, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t lay flat on the floor.</li>
            <li> Was a little skeptical as the price was lower than others.</li>

            <li> Was a little skeptical as the price was lower than others. But took a chance and bought it. Fits perfectly with a round base styling chair and the quality is quite nice. Feels great to stand on and has a great low profile edge so hair and debris doesn&#x27;t find their way under the mat.</li>
            <li> good quality, ordered 1 more.</li>
            <li> I bought these for two salons I own.  After just a few months the edges peel upward causing a trip hazard for both the stylist and the customer.  I even tried tapping them down, that too did not work.  I would not buy these.</li>
            <li> I think these are great! I bought 2 for my stations they are big but I love them :) my legs don&#x27;t hurt at the end of the day like they were!</li>
            <li> Very good  an comfortable</li>

            <li> The mat was delivered on time, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t lay flat on the floor. The edges lift up all around and you can easily trip on it, kind of disappointing.</li>
