            <li> I wear this lipstick all the time!! Great product!! Love it and love the color. Would recommend to anyone.  THanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a Mary Kay consultant, but in the meantime I needed my favorite lipstick and that is Downtown Brown.  Was glad to find it on Amazon and the price was reasonable.  I got it in a timely fashion and am enjoying wearing it.  This is the only lipstick that doesn&#x27;t contribute to my lips being chapped.</li>
            <li> Nice price and new as promised</li>
            <li> Mary Kay lipstick works for me.  Keeps my lips soft and no need for other lip applications.</li>

            <li> didn&#x27;t really care for this color, extremely dark for fair skin.  I was looking for something different, this color is.</li>
            <li> Its nice, I was just hoping it was more brown, it has more of a rust look.</li>
            <li> Perfect color for me. I use this over clear Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm to give it a bit of shine. I use all lipsticks this way. It&#x27;s less sticky than a gloss and less matte and intense than lipstick. This shade is perfect right out of the tube. I apply lightly over balm and it&#x27;s the perfect, neutral shade. It can go darker if you don&#x27;t use the balm underneath. I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances and the 2 Mary Kay lipsticks I ordered do not bother my lips....Yay !!! I use this with the silver lid Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s lipbalm for ultra sensitive lips. I sometimes apply a lighter shade on top for a more nude lip. If you&#x27;re fragrance sensitive, this is recommended !</li>
            <li> Timely and exactly what I wanted.</li>

Thank you Amazon you help me get the perfect gift and had cheap prices too!!! The Mary Kay constants are useless and rip you off you spend $10 on Amazon and $20 with real Mary Kay people!!!</li>

            <li> I love my Down Town Brown lipstick by Mary K.  I have not found anything I like better.</li>
