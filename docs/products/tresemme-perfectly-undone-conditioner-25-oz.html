    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It has excellent slip, and applying it as a rinse-out</li>
            <li>and this was perfect for her.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also excellent for detangling.  </li>
            <li>I did notice that it was an excellent conditioner for detangling via finger combing before rinsing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ideally PERFECTLY (UN)DONE is a hair care system for a wavy look.</li>
            <li>;&#x27;s PERFECTLY</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finish with PERFECTLY (UN)DONE styling products.</li>
            <li>I heard great reviews,  which is why I bought it; however my hair didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>It has a great smell.</li>
            <li>My hair has a very nice, even wave going on, and no frizz.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance too!</li>
            <li>This conditioner turned out to be a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>I have used this Perfectly Undone conditioner to co-wash as well as a straight rinse-out conditioner, and it works brilliantly at both.  </li>
            <li>Good rinse... would purchase again.</li>
            <li>was good</li>
            <li>It probably would be a good conditioner though if your hair does not need lots and lots of moisture.</li>
            <li>Really good product.</li>
            <li>A nice conditioner that smells great.</li>
            <li>I think this would be a great choice for someone that washes their hair more often.  </li>
            <li>I find it to be a dupe for the Nexxus Hydralight Conditioner, but at a fraction of the cost and better fragrance!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells nice.</li>
            <li>Nice Tresemme&#x27; scent.  </li>
            <li>So glad to have another lightweight good smelling conditioner to use.</li>
            <li>Nice all around conditioner.</li>
            <li>I enjoy having good smelling hair products.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Silicones or none, most would cause irritation.</li>
            <li>so glad I purchased this conditioner and packaging</li>
            <li>We have been using Tresemme products for many years.  </li>
            <li>where she thinks more is better.</li>
            <li>I love Tresemme products and I did like this conditioner</li>
            <li>Most of the fragrance goes away as hair dries.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is ok but can be drying at times when used with the matching shampoo</li>
            <li>I love the way this conditioner leaves my hair feeling</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t make my hair more wavy</li>
            <li>I find that the conditioner does moisturize my hair, making it nice and smooth, but I&#x27;m not as sure about the wavy aspect.</li>
            <li>I hesitate to give this a 5-star, because I am still using a shampoo by a different company, and the results are probably not 100% what they will be when I switch to the Tresemme Perfectly (un)Done Shampoo.</li>
            <li>I like my hair wavy, so I got this &amp;#34;Perfectly (un)Done&amp;#34; conditioner hoping it would encourage my hair to be more wavy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go right and ahead and say it: this is one awesome conditioner and probably one I would highly recommend to those with thinner hair.</li>
            <li>This is a good conditioner that does exactly what it promises-</li>
            <li>This is becoming one of my favorite conditioners.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually my favorite out of all of the silicone free conditioners I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>The light floral fragrance is pleasant and just smells clean and fresh once your hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It washes out easily.</li>
            <li>It was easy to work a comb through it after applying and to get the tangles out of my hair.</li>
            <li>Not watery at all, easy to get to your hair without losing any of it to the shower floor.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is Hands down best conditioner I have found for my hair.  </li>
            <li>It went on smooth and rinsed out easily.</li>
            <li>I use silicone free conditioner to avoid any product build up on my strands.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my color-treated hair tangle free and lightly moisturized and my hair has plenty of volume when I blow it out.  </li>
            <li>It rinses clean, leaves my hair soft/shiny &amp; easily combed thru.  </li>
            <li>, I find I get good clumping and definition when I rinse out most of the product but still leave enough in that it feels slippery, then apply gel to set the clumps.</li>
            <li>For a mass-market hair product this is very nice, and the generous 25 ounce size should last a looong time.</li>
            <li>It would probably be great for medium to somewhat long lengths</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure (although it does not say so)</li>
            <li>As a co-wash, it emulsifies the oils on my scalp, leaving it clean but not stripped.  </li>
            <li>GREAT price for a nice silicone free conditioner, and it works just as well as the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried; nexxus, trader joe&#x27;s, and some artisanal one made with beer hops.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good value at the current price.  </li>
            <li>and even I fell in love with how thorough but gentle this was.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and fresh, never overpowering.  </li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t a huge difference right away</li>
            <li>This one is from the PERFECTLY (UN)DONE line, an advanced conditioner, enriched w/ Sea Kelp Extract, to moisturize hair without weighing it down to leave your hair full &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>It smells great and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>This is wonderfully light conditioning for anyone who wants great conditioning power without anything terribly heavy as some of the more intense conditioners tend to be.</li>
            <li>The scent is minimal &amp; a pleasant &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; salon smell that you do not notice - YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The stuff smells like you&#x27;ve come right outta</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and currently long, so PERFECTLY (UN)DONE was able to give me my tightly curled spirals (that my wife digs) with no fuss (or need for after product, although TRESemm&amp;eacute; specifically recommends their styling products as follow up</li>
            <li>Thus the reason I like the quantity with this large 25 ounce bottle!  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and provides minimal slip.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best choice for past waist length hair that needs extra moisture and protection on the ends.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is big, and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>I hope they never discontinue this formula, I&#x27;ve been using it for over 3 years straight</li>
            <li>That worked our really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is a little strong, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>Most shampoos tend to flatten my hair, but this product replaced the frizz with soft curls, which I have not seen in a long time.</li>
            <li>I went from having dry tangled ends that I couldn&#x27;t run my fingers through to soft, silky, shiny, healthy ends.  </li>
            <li>and I generally will apply some styling gel out of habit, regardless of a conditioner&#x27;s success.</li>
            <li>This one so far hasn&#x27;t caused too much irritation.</li>
            <li>The problem is that the shampoo dries my hair to a crisp and this conditioner barely does anything to replenish what the shampoo steals.</li>
            <li>I have very fine textured, waist length straight hair (typical greasy white person hair).  </li>
            <li>After only the second day, my hair was smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>I like how this conditioner feels and will definitely go with Tresemme again, but don&#x27;t expect too much out of it!</li>
            <li>All natural, I don&#x27;t dye it or even use any heat styling.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Tresemme Conditioner for several reasons:  </li>
            <li>TRESemm&amp;eacute; is a leader in hair care products with nearly 70 years experience in the field, so any product they produce is going to be a quality one.</li>
            <li>far I like it.</li>
            <li>Shiny and soft, too.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Most conditioners are ultimately not conditioning at all or are like an oil slick.  </li>
            <li>Used this morning and left my hair light, relaxed, not weighed down in anyway.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paired this Tresemme UnDone Condition with the same type of shampoo and hair lotion, to an overall positive effect.</li>
            <li>I let my hair air dry and did absolutely nothing to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  not real heavy so that it flattens waves or curls.</li>
            <li>I have medium length, naturally curly hair and this conditioner worked well on it and left it feeling soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li>Not only does this conditioner have NO HEAVY  SILICONE, but it conditions nearly weightlessly.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, straight and short hair and found the product a little heavy for my liking.</li>
            <li>I was a little unsure about taking another chance on a brand I am unfamiliar with, but nothing else has worked to my liking, and it&#x27;s not expensive, so,</li>
            <li>I often just let it air dry to get that natural wavy look.  </li>

            <li> I often just let it air dry to get that natural wavy look.  </li>
            <li> Hair is left soft and moisturized and not weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned with the different formulation in this product that it might have a strange feel when I put it on my hair but that was not the case.</li>
            <li> The frizzing has already tamed down considerably since using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have a weird hair type that doesn&#x27;t know if it wants to be wavy or straight, and tends to frizz.</li>
            <li> rinses well, and I noticed my hair dried fairly quickly naturally after using it</li>
            <li> It’s very thick and rich-textured but it rinses clean and doesn’t weigh your hair down at all.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the dry and brittle feeling, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;It adds a lot of shine and body, but after a couple of days my hair starts to feel quite dry on the ends.  </li>
            <li> The directions say to put it on only from the midpoint of hair down.  </li>

            <li> Love this conditioner.  GREAT price for a nice silicone free conditioner, and it works just as well as the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried; nexxus, trader joe&#x27;s, and some artisanal one made with beer hops.  It&#x27;s actually my favorite out of all of the silicone free conditioners I&#x27;ve tried.  I have very fine textured, waist length straight hair (typical greasy white person hair).  All natural, I don&#x27;t dye it or even use any heat styling.  I use silicone free conditioner to avoid any product build up on my strands.  This conditioner is Hands down best conditioner I have found for my hair.  I find it to be a dupe for the Nexxus Hydralight Conditioner, but at a fraction of the cost and better fragrance! I hope they never discontinue this formula, I&#x27;ve been using it for over 3 years straight</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive scalp. Conditioners will make my scalp itch like crazy. Silicones or none, most would cause irritation. This one so far hasn&#x27;t caused too much irritation. Still itch, but not every hour. Probably purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good rinse... would purchase again.</li>
            <li> im so glad I purchased this conditioner and packaging was good so now I can raise my coils curls and waves up on this product and I recommend that ever guy and gal with textured hair to try this product</li>
            <li> I have Sicilian wavy/curly hair (2B-3A) and have struggled with frizz my entire life.  I have used this Perfectly Undone conditioner to co-wash as well as a straight rinse-out conditioner, and it works brilliantly at both.  As a co-wash, it emulsifies the oils on my scalp, leaving it clean but not stripped.  It has excellent slip, and applying it as a rinse-out, I find I get good clumping and definition when I rinse out most of the product but still leave enough in that it feels slippery, then apply gel to set the clumps.</li>
            <li> I bought this @ WM. Smells nice and provides minimal slip. The problem is that the shampoo dries my hair to a crisp and this conditioner barely does anything to replenish what the shampoo steals. My already wavy hair was left straight and limp.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tresemme Shampoo,and Conditioner together on a daily basis. Both the shampoo and conditioner are milky white liquids. The conditioner has some slickness to it. After only the second day, my hair was smooth and shiny. The frizz was gone. Most shampoos tend to flatten my hair, but this product replaced the frizz with soft curls, which I have not seen in a long time.</li>
            <li> This conditioner turned out to be a pleasant surprise.  It’s very thick and rich-textured but it rinses clean and doesn’t weigh your hair down at all.  I use a little over a tablespoon on my long(ish) hair, applied from mid-shaft to the ends (I don’t need conditioning at the roots).  It leaves my color-treated hair tangle free and lightly moisturized and my hair has plenty of volume when I blow it out.  The light floral fragrance is pleasant and just smells clean and fresh once your hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this could work for a lot of hair types, though if your hair is extremely dry/coarse/damaged you might want something a bit richer.  For a mass-market hair product this is very nice, and the generous 25 ounce size should last a looong time.</li>
            <li> We have been using Tresemme products for many years.  It is a trusted brand in our house.  I really like the Tresemme Conditioner for several reasons:  Quantity, Quality and Value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My older daughter has very thick, wavy hair and this was perfect for her. She has that &amp;#34;teen girl thing&amp;#34; where she thinks more is better. Thus the reason I like the quantity with this large 25 ounce bottle!  Her hair came out shiny and manageable even after blow drying and using a straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have fine, straight and short hair and found the product a little heavy for my liking. Keep in mind, my hair type.  I don&#x27;t like the dry and brittle feeling, so I found a compromise - using less and only running my fingers through my hair with it before rinsing.  That worked our really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The only reason for 4 stars vs 5 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t appeal to all hair types.  Nice fragrance too!</li>
            <li> I love Tresemme products and I did like this conditioner but it was not enough moisture for my wavy curly hair.  My hair needs extra moisture so this did not quite give my hair enough.  It probably would be a good conditioner though if your hair does not need lots and lots of moisture.</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. It&#x27;s  not real heavy so that it flattens waves or curls. It doesn&#x27;t leave you looking like you have greasy hair.  It washes out easily.</li>
            <li> This is a good conditioner that does exactly what it promises- it leaves the wave that is in hair, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  It&#x27;s also excellent for detangling.  The directions say to put it on only from the midpoint of hair down.  Since my hair is very long, I put it on from the nape of my neck down the length of my hair.  I did notice that it was an excellent conditioner for detangling via finger combing before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice. It has a feminine fragrance with a bit of a white floral.  Most of the fragrance goes away as hair dries.&lt;br /&gt;It rinses well, and I noticed my hair dried fairly quickly naturally after using it, it seems like if anything its speeds drying just a tad.  I like that about it.&lt;br /&gt;When I did use it on my scalp (against the directions), it left the hair close to my head a bit oily.&lt;br /&gt;It adds a lot of shine and body, but after a couple of days my hair starts to feel quite dry on the ends.  I think this would be a great choice for someone that washes their hair more often.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best choice for past waist length hair that needs extra moisture and protection on the ends.  It would probably be great for medium to somewhat long lengths though.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good value at the current price.  The bottle is big, and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is ok but can be drying at times when used with the matching shampoo</li>
            <li> TRESemm&amp;eacute; is a leader in hair care products with nearly 70 years experience in the field, so any product they produce is going to be a quality one. This one is from the PERFECTLY (UN)DONE line, an advanced conditioner, enriched w/ Sea Kelp Extract, to moisturize hair without weighing it down to leave your hair full &amp; soft. Ideally PERFECTLY (UN)DONE is a hair care system for a wavy look. My hair is naturally curly and currently long, so PERFECTLY (UN)DONE was able to give me my tightly curled spirals (that my wife digs) with no fuss (or need for after product, although TRESemm&amp;eacute; specifically recommends their styling products as follow up and I generally will apply some styling gel out of habit, regardless of a conditioner&#x27;s success. The stuff smells like you&#x27;ve come right outta a pricey salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRESemm&amp;eacute;&#x27;s Suggested Application steps are to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First to start w/ TRESemm&amp;eacute;&#x27;s PERFECTLY (UN)DONE Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply to hair from mid-shaft down to the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Run a wide-tooth&lt;br /&gt;comb from roots to tips to detangle &amp; work into hair ( I always substitute fingers for this step as combs frighten me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave on 2-3 minutes then rinse thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finish with PERFECTLY (UN)DONE styling products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go right and ahead and say it: this is one awesome conditioner and probably one I would highly recommend to those with thinner hair. This is wonderfully light conditioning for anyone who wants great conditioning power without anything terribly heavy as some of the more intense conditioners tend to be. I have very thick hair and even I fell in love with how thorough but gentle this was. Lightweight is the key word here, and Tresemme doesn&#x27;t lie about it.</li>
            <li> I have medium length, naturally curly hair and this conditioner worked well on it and left it feeling soft and conditioned. It was easy to work a comb through it after applying and to get the tangles out of my hair. The scent is a little strong, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I love the way this conditioner leaves my hair feeling and I love the smell. Definitely a continued buy</li>
            <li> This is becoming one of my favorite conditioners.  It rinses clean, leaves my hair soft/shiny &amp; easily combed thru.  It does not weigh my hair down or make my scalp feel grungy.  The scent is minimal &amp; a pleasant &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; salon smell that you do not notice - YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just below chin-length hair that has quite a lot of natural wave - not really curly.  I often just let it air dry to get that natural wavy look.  This product doesn&#x27;t make my hair more wavy but what it does do, is not weigh down what I have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paired this Tresemme UnDone Condition with the same type of shampoo and hair lotion, to an overall positive effect. I find that the conditioner does moisturize my hair, making it nice and smooth, but I&#x27;m not as sure about the wavy aspect. My hair is naturally a little bit wavy, but I find the combination of these products makes it no more wavy—if anything, perhaps less wavy. I&#x27;m pretty sure (although it does not say so) they expect me to be blowdrying and styling my hair, which I do not do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I like how this conditioner feels and will definitely go with Tresemme again, but don&#x27;t expect too much out of it!</li>
            <li> Used this morning and left my hair light, relaxed, not weighed down in anyway.  Nice Tresemme&#x27; scent.  Not watery at all, easy to get to your hair without losing any of it to the shower floor.  Really good product.</li>
            <li> I heard great reviews,  which is why I bought it; however my hair didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I am always on the lookout for a lightweight conditioner. This product was just what I was looking for. It did not weigh my hair down or make it look greasy. It has a great smell. I enjoy having good smelling hair products. It makes it feel like you are at a spa whenever you wash your hair. I was concerned with the different formulation in this product that it might have a strange feel when I put it on my hair but that was not the case. It went on smooth and rinsed out easily. So glad to have another lightweight good smelling conditioner to use.</li>
            <li> I hesitate to give this a 5-star, because I am still using a shampoo by a different company, and the results are probably not 100% what they will be when I switch to the Tresemme Perfectly (un)Done Shampoo. I have been trying to find a brand I like, that isn&#x27;t overpriced, for a couple of years now. I have never used Tresemme before, except occasionally when staying at a friend&#x27;s house. I was a little unsure about taking another chance on a brand I am unfamiliar with, but nothing else has worked to my liking, and it&#x27;s not expensive, so, what the hay...&lt;br /&gt;So far I like it. I have a weird hair type that doesn&#x27;t know if it wants to be wavy or straight, and tends to frizz. I like my hair wavy, so I got this &amp;#34;Perfectly (un)Done&amp;#34; conditioner hoping it would encourage my hair to be more wavy. The frizzing has already tamed down considerably since using this conditioner. There wasn&#x27;t a huge difference right away (I&#x27;ve washed my hair using this stuff about 4 or 5 times now), but when I washed my hair today I definitely noticed the difference. I let my hair air dry and did absolutely nothing to it. My hair has a very nice, even wave going on, and no frizz. Shiny and soft, too. I like.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try the shampoo.</li>
            <li> A nice conditioner that smells great. Leaves my hair soft and manageable. Works well only all the different hair types in my family. Nice all around conditioner.</li>
            <li> Wow.  I have searched endlessly for a co-wash conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave hair weighed down or greasy.  I am unable to use Sodium Lauryl Sulfate shampoos anymore because they dried my hair out to the point that it was severely tangled and damaged on the ends.  Most conditioners are ultimately not conditioning at all or are like an oil slick.  Not only does this conditioner have NO HEAVY  SILICONE, but it conditions nearly weightlessly.  Hair is left soft and moisturized and not weighed down.  I went from having dry tangled ends that I couldn&#x27;t run my fingers through to soft, silky, shiny, healthy ends.  The scent is light and fresh, never overpowering.  I will never stop using this product.  It is now a staple.</li>
