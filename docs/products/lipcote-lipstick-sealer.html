            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>Hmm I don&#x27;t know maybe its good..</li>
            <li>I am delighted to find it on Amazon and no longer have to have it sent by a family member across the Atlantic Ocean.</li>

            <li>I am glad I was prepared for that!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think this product would work but for the price I figured I&#x27;d try it anyway.</li>
            <li>so I forget it mostly to be honest.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect this to work so effectively</li>
            <li>Ok, this product isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s so useful that I&#x27;m going to give it five stars</li>
            <li>The product also gave the lipstick a nice matte/shiny finish.</li>
            <li>dunno why this product isn&#x27;t more popular in drug stores or Sephora</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Worked nicely with my NIX lipsticks that tend to come off easy without</li>
            <li>Thank you for making this available!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it does have the staying power, I just worry about splotchy lips.</li>
            <li>It lasted perfectly through dancing and kissing my boyfriend for a total of about 6 hours.</li>
            <li>Best way I can compare this would be similar to the feel of vodka on your lips.</li>
            <li>But I cant use it more often</li>
            <li>I used lipcote for many years when I lived in the UK.. ,Couldn&#x27;t be without it ,then I came to the USA,16 years ago and couldn&#x27;t find it until now .&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>it is better</li>
            <li>that claim to last all day.&lt;br /&gt;Really great stuff!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I have used Lipcote for many many years and love it, the thing I didn&#x27;t love was two orders arriving and</li>
            <li>Yes, I love Lipcote but not 8 bottles.</li>
            <li>Not even sure if it&#x27;s safe to put on your lips.</li>
            <li>It keeps the lipstick from running and stays on most of the night or day I have been using it for 2yrs</li>
            <li>This is a must have for the ladies that love their lipstick.</li>
            <li>This lipstick sealer is OK, but doesn&#x27;t work as another brand I used to have years ago.  </li>
            <li>A lot better than nothing.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Some lipsticks work better than others and some don&#x27;t work at all, but that seems to be the differences of lip products and not the fault of this product.</li>
            <li>Oh my I&#x27;m in love with this product I wish I would&#x27;ve known about this</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait for a chance to test it with red lipstick too :D</li>
            <li>perfect for making your lipstick last all day!</li>
            <li>Lipcote is Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Nothing has worked better than this.</li>
            <li>I have used many lipstick sealer and this one is just okay.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Washes off easily with face wash though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li>This is hands down one of the best beauty products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>If you have a super creamy lipstick you love but that bleeds all over your coffee cup in the morning, you need to invest in Lipcote.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so smooth and not drying to the lips at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the cost and the wait!  </li>
            <li>I wore a bright lipstick (Urban Decay in Anarchy) to a show one night, topped with some lipcote.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it made a significant difference worth putting up with the initial burning sensation; that can&#x27;t be good for you</li>
            <li>drawbacks to the product is that it has a mild stinging sensation on your lips when applied.</li>
            <li>to eat some super greasy bar food.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>It really will keep your lipstick on all day or night, provided you don&#x27;t get a significant amount of oil (from good or other cosmetics) on your lips.</li>
            <li>once you got the right amount adjusted, you will not know you have it on.</li>
            <li>I put it on my normal routine cheap lipstick and it just wiped that and the lipstick outline on lips evaporated</li>
            <li>Worth the $, and definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for something to make your favorite lipstick last.</li>
            <li>but it is most definitely worth the extra steps.</li>
            <li>Really seals your lipstick!</li>
            <li>This product fades my lipstick and have followed the instructions exactly.  </li>
            <li>sure to blot your lips so that there&#x27;s no extra lipstick or else the coat won&#x27;t work as well</li>
            <li>Works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>For example I wore a red lipstick (KVD studded kiss lipstick in Countess if that helps) with this on top and nothing else-</li>
            <li>Pretty</li>
            <li>When I first put it on I thought it smelled like paint</li>
            <li>I only tried on lipstick once, and it works there too, but I need it most for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re willing to smooth things out, it&#x27;s worth it for the extra staying power the sealer provides.</li>
            <li>First, if you have even the most minor of cracks on your lips, this product will STING when you put it on.</li>
            <li>The stinging only lasts for a second, but it&#x27;s far from pleasant.</li>
            <li>I think gloss just might be too sticky and transfer to the brush too much..</li>
            <li>Lip stick stands on much longer for me</li>
            <li>You have to ensure you apply it as directed, and don&#x27;t use too much of it-</li>
            <li>somehow I re coated it and didn&#x27;t see much use of the product.</li>
            <li>I was very dissatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>It really works, it protects your lipstick for hours.</li>
            <li>a longtime ago I gotta tell my daughter about this thx so much</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>No domestic alternative available.</li>
            <li>Works very well to protect lipstick and keep color longer.</li>
            <li>It really burn when you put it on.  </li>
            <li>Too much on</li>
            <li>This product can, and was for me personally, very drying and caused the skin on my lips to peel.</li>
            <li>The great thing is they still look great!!!&lt;br /&gt;The product comes from England, so there is a wait to receive it, but for under $5.00, it&#x27;s far better than everything, Sephora or any of the other expensive make-up lines available at the Department stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does smell a bit funny, but it doesn&#x27;t burn my lips at all, and after it dries completely doesn&#x27;t smudge or move at all.  </li>
            <li>It does what it says...and so much better than any other I have used!</li>
            <li>I can finally wear the reds and oranges I love without smearing it all over my entire life.</li>
            <li>It goes away in ten seconds though, and it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>but it just seemed to hold my lipstick on for an hour longer than it would normally stay on.</li>
            <li>When I read the reviews I expected &amp;#34;stinging and sticky!&amp;#34;  I have tried other lipstick sealers that really do &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; ...this is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love the way it really keeps lipstick sealed but the smell and burning is too much for me to handle!!</li>
            <li>Just know when applying the Lipcote to keep your mouth stretched in a smile so the coating won&#x27;t crack.</li>
            <li>After giving up with higher priced products, I finally decided to just check what Amazon had to offer</li>
            <li>would probably last much longer</li>
            <li>Will it make your lipstick invincible and completely transfer proof?</li>
            <li>Surprised at the prompt delivery from England.</li>
            <li>Be aware that it will most likely dry your lips out after several hours or a few consecutive days&#x27; use and that it may sting when you first apply it, especially if your lips are chapped.</li>
            <li>After many hours my lips felt a little dry</li>
            <li>pat lips dry, apply lip pencil, lipstick, blot, lipstick, then with a big smile Lipcote and keep smiling for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>had to toss it out - great idea though too bad it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>Lipcote, I&#x27;ve been told is an old product made in the 1950s when the lipstick was all RED.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried it once so far</li>
            <li>It is a staple in the make-up bags of nearly every British woman!</li>
            <li>absolutely a must-have with black lipstick</li>
            <li>/&gt;Protips for keeping lipstick on come from Toxic Tears youtube video about doing black lips, but really work for any color: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;0l5OFettBT4</li>
            <li>It does have a slight burn (due to the alcohol content, I&#x27;m sure), and it will change the final color presentation on your lips slightly.</li>

            <li> When I read the reviews I expected &amp;#34;stinging and sticky!&amp;#34;  I have tried other lipstick sealers that really do &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; ...this is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love the way it really keeps lipstick sealed but the smell and burning is too much for me to handle!!</li>
            <li> Just know when applying the Lipcote to keep your mouth stretched in a smile so the coating won&#x27;t crack.</li>
            <li> After giving up with higher priced products, I finally decided to just check what Amazon had to offer</li>
            <li> would probably last much longer</li>
            <li> Will it make your lipstick invincible and completely transfer proof?</li>
            <li> Surprised at the prompt delivery from England.</li>
            <li> Be aware that it will most likely dry your lips out after several hours or a few consecutive days&#x27; use and that it may sting when you first apply it, especially if your lips are chapped.</li>
            <li> After many hours my lips felt a little dry</li>
            <li> pat lips dry, apply lip pencil, lipstick, blot, lipstick, then with a big smile Lipcote and keep smiling for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> had to toss it out - great idea though too bad it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Lipcote, I&#x27;ve been told is an old product made in the 1950s when the lipstick was all RED.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it once so far</li>
            <li> It is a staple in the make-up bags of nearly every British woman!</li>
            <li> absolutely a must-have with black lipstick</li>
            <li> /&gt;Protips for keeping lipstick on come from Toxic Tears youtube video about doing black lips, but really work for any color: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;0l5OFettBT4</li>
            <li> It does have a slight burn (due to the alcohol content, I&#x27;m sure), and it will change the final color presentation on your lips slightly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several primers that promise to make lipsticks last longer, but none of them do the trick and usually make my lipsticks go on less smoothly.</li>
            <li> But once  it  does you are left with essentially stained lips the colour of the lipstick which lasts a really long time</li>
            <li> By the end of the meal my lipstick was still in place and only needed a minor touch up on the inner corner of my lips.</li>
            <li> I assume the point of that is to dry out extra moisture in your lipstick so it doesn&#x27;t move around so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, has the potential to dry out.</li>
            <li> ill have to give it more tries</li>
            <li> keeps lipstick on for a few hours only, not  as long as I would have like it too,stings a bit when applied, would not ship direct to NZ</li>
            <li> It causes my eyebrow makeup to stay put all day long.</li>
            <li> It keeps your lipstick on for hours,I have tried other products that promise to do the same</li>
            <li> It does not last as long, only a few hours compared to the 8 hours I was used to.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put this on dry or cut lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let the coat dry</li>
            <li> In case you have problems with this product, you have to let your lips completely dry separately before the product will work.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not sticky or dry like some&lt;br /&gt;lipsticks</li>
            <li> Takes a minute or so to dry.</li>
            <li> but once it&#x27;s completely dry</li>
            <li> This product did not live up to it&#x27;s name.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not sure if it only works on quality lipsticks with different formulation or what.</li>
            <li> I am from England and I will not live without this product,it is the bomb!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have enough years left to use up all 8 bottles, not very good management.</li>
            <li> Holds the color, but cakes a bit and makes my lips look hard instead of soft and moist.</li>
            <li> Even though it came from Britain it still arrived in only a few days.</li>
            <li> have tried other 24-hour lipsticks and used as directed and found that they flake off if I choose to eat, drink, kiss my husband, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that it does take a little while to dry, and therefore is a bit tacky during that time,</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush does tend to get a little tainted with color, but not much if you wipe it on something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH IT, I&#x27;m A lipstick fan  </li>
            <li> There will be a slight burning.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, it is slightly drying</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has alcohol in it and will burn a little.</li>
            <li> However, because you&#x27;re supposed to blot the lipstick off, I did lose a little bit of pigmentation compared to it I had just the lipstick on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dried out my lips and didn&#x27;t seal my lipstick.</li>
            <li> did find that it dried out my lips quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I dried out my lips and it would peel.  </li>
            <li> I usually reapply my lipstick and lipcote after eating, but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m a messy eater.</li>
            <li> it is a big disappointment and i would never buy it again  nor suggest it toanhyone.it burns the lips and makes the lipstick very dry and does  not do its job.</li>
            <li> Also, I extended the product just past my lip line to protect the edges, which worked.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why luxury brands don&#x27;t make lipstick sealers or why they&#x27;re so hard to find.</li>
            <li> a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> really helpful if you hate reapplying.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that when you apply it, until it dries it smells bad and is tingly.</li>
            <li> A bit unpleasant, but it goes away in just a few seconds after it dried.</li>
            <li> which I found frustrating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little annoying</li>
            <li> So I was a tad bit skeptical about this working because I&#x27;ve never tried anything that would keep my lipstick together.</li>
            <li> Smells weird while it dries.</li>
            <li> I am sad that they don&#x27;t sell it in the US because I cannot imagine makeup life without it.</li>
            <li> Setting process is a bit inconvenient as well — two minutes with lips</li>
            <li> also has a weird burning sensation!</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t refund unhappy customers. :(</li>
            <li> Too bad it takes about a month to get from England to the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated lipstick, I can&#x27;t stand it smudging everywhere, and having to check every five minutes for smudges on my face and teeth.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It smells horrible and burns when applied however it did keep my lipstick in place</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product did not live up to it&#x27;s name.  It dried out my lips and didn&#x27;t seal my lipstick.</li>
            <li> When I read the reviews I expected &amp;#34;stinging and sticky!&amp;#34;  I have tried other lipstick sealers that really do &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; ...this is my new favorite! The others are going in the garbage! I am buying more! Thank you for making this available! It does what it says...and so much better than any other I have used!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put this on dry or cut lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has alcohol in it and will burn a little. Also it will smell like alcohol for a bit. I assume the point of that is to dry out extra moisture in your lipstick so it doesn&#x27;t move around so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its really helpful if you hate reapplying. Does add staying power to a degree bit isn&#x27;t perfect. Worked nicely with my NIX lipsticks that tend to come off easy without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush does tend to get a little tainted with color, but not much if you wipe it on something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tried it on lipgloss but my guess is that it won&#x27;t go well. I think gloss just might be too sticky and transfer to the brush too much..</li>
            <li> This is hands down one of the best beauty products I&#x27;ve ever used. It really will keep your lipstick on all day or night, provided you don&#x27;t get a significant amount of oil (from good or other cosmetics) on your lips. It&#x27;s also a great value for your money because one bottle lasts for quite awhile. Be aware that it will most likely dry your lips out after several hours or a few consecutive days&#x27; use and that it may sting when you first apply it, especially if your lips are chapped. I cannot recommend this product highly enough.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, whether it&#x27;s a cream or traditional stick color.</li>
            <li> It works just as I had been told. Just know when applying the Lipcote to keep your mouth stretched in a smile so the coating won&#x27;t crack.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all. Very upset  to have wasted my money. WARNING :DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> Holds the color, but cakes a bit and makes my lips look hard instead of soft and moist.</li>
            <li> Oh my, this stuff burns when you put it on. I am glad I was prepared for that! It goes away in ten seconds though, and it is well worth it. Really seals your lipstick! No transfer for hours! Washes off easily with face wash though. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> keeps lipstick on for a few hours only, not  as long as I would have like it too,stings a bit when applied, would not ship direct to NZ</li>
            <li> I used this religiously for a couple of weeks. Holy hell does it make my lipstick last. I usually reapply my lipstick and lipcote after eating, but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m a messy eater. I&#x27;m sure it does have the staying power, I just worry about splotchy lips. I will testify to it being quite kiss-proof. I wore a bright lipstick (Urban Decay in Anarchy) to a show one night, topped with some lipcote. It lasted perfectly through dancing and kissing my boyfriend for a total of about 6 hours. However, because you&#x27;re supposed to blot the lipstick off, I did lose a little bit of pigmentation compared to it I had just the lipstick on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some drawbacks to the product is that it has a mild stinging sensation on your lips when applied. Best way I can compare this would be similar to the feel of vodka on your lips. A bit unpleasant, but it goes away in just a few seconds after it dried. I have also noticed that there is some buildup in the bottle. There appears to be some debris that settles to the bottom, or floats after being shaken. It seems to be a combination skin cells/lipstick residue. However, it has not stopped me from using this product.</li>
            <li> Great and wonderful lip sealer.  Lip stick stands on much longer for me but I am one of those that its gone in 30 mins. so to get a couple of hours is great for me and for someone else would probably last much longer</li>
            <li> it is a big disappointment and i would never buy it again  nor suggest it toanhyone.it burns the lips and makes the lipstick very dry and does  not do its job. a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> This product fades my lipstick and have followed the instructions exactly.  My lipstick still comes off!</li>
            <li> If you have a super creamy lipstick you love but that bleeds all over your coffee cup in the morning, you need to invest in Lipcote.  Put your lipstick on and blot it to perfection.  Then, coat your lips with Lipcote.  There will be a slight burning.  Let the coat dry and then your lipstick should last. I was impressed with the wear since my lipstick won&#x27;t stay on my lips to save me.</li>
            <li> I bought it in the evening and I shortly received an email saying that it was on it&#x27;s way. It came within a day of ordering it. It had worked wonderfully! You can even eat and drink with it on.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to blot your lips so that there&#x27;s no extra lipstick or else the coat won&#x27;t work as well and it&#x27;ll be sticky&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, s great product!&lt;br /&gt;I dunno why this product isn&#x27;t more popular in drug stores or Sephora</li>
            <li> This keeps my Chanel lip color going. Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think this product would work but for the price I figured I&#x27;d try it anyway. Yes you do feel a bit of tingling when you apply it but the lipstick stays on all day! I&#x27;ve gone 12 hours without having to reapply lipstick. I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> This is a good product. You have to ensure you apply it as directed, and don&#x27;t use too much of it- otherwise it will be sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Eating/drinking will remove the product and your lip color will fade.&lt;br /&gt;I did find that it dried out my lips quite a bit.</li>
            <li> absolutely a must-have with black lipstick</li>
            <li> So I was a tad bit skeptical about this working because I&#x27;ve never tried anything that would keep my lipstick together. Low and behold, it held my lipstick all night! In case you have problems with this product, you have to let your lips completely dry separately before the product will work. Also, I extended the product just past my lip line to protect the edges, which worked. My lips were perfect throughout the night and no trace of my lipstick was on my date!</li>
            <li> Hmm I don&#x27;t know maybe its good..I put it on my normal routine cheap lipstick and it just wiped that and the lipstick outline on lips evaporated somehow I re coated it and didn&#x27;t see much use of the product. Now I&#x27;m not sure if it only works on quality lipsticks with different formulation or what.God knows. But I cant use it more often so I forget it mostly to be honest.</li>
            <li> I found applying with the brush included caused my lipstick to smear outside my lips.  Still had feathering and my lipstick did not last through lunch.</li>
            <li> I used lipcote for many years when I lived in the UK.. ,Couldn&#x27;t be without it ,then I came to the USA,16 years ago and couldn&#x27;t find it until now .&lt;br /&gt;Well I did and it is better then it was then thank you so much I am so very happy to find it&lt;br /&gt;thank you&lt;br /&gt;Ushwia</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this to work so effectively but it does.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and it&#x27;s not sticky or dry like some&lt;br /&gt;lipsticks that claim to last all day.&lt;br /&gt;Really great stuff!</li>
            <li> When you put it on it burns. Smells weird while it dries. But once  it  does you are left with essentially stained lips the colour of the lipstick which lasts a really long time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay i wouldn&#x27;t buy this ever everrr again</li>
            <li> I am from England and I will not live without this product,it is the bomb! It keeps your lipstick on for hours,I have tried other products that promise to do the same but they do not deliver.  Lipcote is the best :)</li>
            <li> For years I purchased Laura Geller Lipcoat and it was terrific.  The company discontinued it so I am trying Lipcote Lipstick Sealer.  It does not last as long, only a few hours compared to the 8 hours I was used to.  I have it now so I&#x27;ll use it and then see what is on the market.</li>
            <li> I was very dissatisfied with this product. I couldn&#x27;t see that it sealed my lipstick at all. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Lipcote, I&#x27;ve been told is an old product made in the 1950s when the lipstick was all RED.  It tends to sting when you brush it on, so you do need to condition her lips.  It prevents bleeding from the lipstick.  I follow the directions on the bottle, put the lipstick on, blot with kleenex, reapply and then brush on lipcote.  I use lipstick, and then a gloss, then I put on lipcote, and oh, my lips look like I&#x27;m in a make-up ad.  The great thing is they still look great!!!&lt;br /&gt;The product comes from England, so there is a wait to receive it, but for under $5.00, it&#x27;s far better than everything, Sephora or any of the other expensive make-up lines available at the Department stores.&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want to keep those lips RED--buy this product.</li>
            <li> I have used Lipcote for many many years and love it, the thing I didn&#x27;t love was two orders arriving and&lt;br /&gt;2 payments, how can we from the US send anything like this through the mail, we can&#x27;t. 8 bottles of Lipcoat,&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have enough years left to use up all 8 bottles, not very good management. Then after all the problem&lt;br /&gt;trying to even let the company know, I find the invoice I had held on to for years to buy the product from original&lt;br /&gt;supplier.  Yes, I love Lipcote but not 8 bottles.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised. Follow directions and apply lipstick, blot, then apply a second coat, and blot again. THEN apply Lipcote and your lipstick will last ALL DAY! I know this seems like a lot, but it is most definitely worth the extra steps. It does have a slight burn (due to the alcohol content, I&#x27;m sure), and it will change the final color presentation on your lips slightly. My daughter is involved in competitive cheer and I use it on her also. It lasts all day through sweating, smiling, tumbling, and flyers knocking into it. Worth the $, and definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for something to make your favorite lipstick last.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy.  I dried out my lips and it would peel.  Not even sure if it&#x27;s safe to put on your lips.</li>
            <li> It smells horrible and burns when applied however it did keep my lipstick in place</li>
            <li> It keeps the lipstick from running and stays on most of the night or day I have been using it for 2yrs and if I don&#x27;t have it I will miss it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Just made my lipstick gummy and clumped up on my lips 👎also has a weird burning sensation! had to toss it out - great idea though too bad it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Ok, this product isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s so useful that I&#x27;m going to give it five stars anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why luxury brands don&#x27;t make lipstick sealers or why they&#x27;re so hard to find. I&#x27;ve tried several primers that promise to make lipsticks last longer, but none of them do the trick and usually make my lipsticks go on less smoothly. After giving up with higher priced products, I finally decided to just check what Amazon had to offer and I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product. Will it make your lipstick invincible and completely transfer proof? No, but if you use the product correctly, it will definitely help the staying power of your lipstick immensely. For example I wore a red lipstick (KVD studded kiss lipstick in Countess if that helps) with this on top and nothing else- no lip liners, primers or stains underneath- to eat some super greasy bar food. Ever worn lipstick while eating spaetzle? Might as well slather some makeup remover on your lips. By the end of the meal my lipstick was still in place and only needed a minor touch up on the inner corner of my lips. Pretty impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always use this over my lipsticks now. There are drawbacks, however. First, if you have even the most minor of cracks on your lips, this product will STING when you put it on. The stinging only lasts for a second, but it&#x27;s far from pleasant. Secondly, it is slightly drying and I feel like it can make some lipsticks look patchy as it reduces the moisture, especially darker colors that lean towards being matte. It&#x27;s a little annoying but if you&#x27;re willing to smooth things out, it&#x27;s worth it for the extra staying power the sealer provides.</li>
            <li> I applied as instructed, and it definitely protected my lipstick. Once I applied it my lips tingled, but didn&#x27;t burn or anything. I ate, drank, and rubbed my lips and it still provided excellent protection. The product also gave the lipstick a nice matte/shiny finish. Also, the delivery was speedy. Even though it came from Britain it still arrived in only a few days. This is a must have for the ladies that love their lipstick.</li>
            <li> It really works, it protects your lipstick for hours. It&#x27;s a great product, I&#x27;m very happy that I found it.</li>
            <li> This lipstick sealer is OK, but doesn&#x27;t work as another brand I used to have years ago.  A lot better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I am sad that they don&#x27;t sell it in the US because I cannot imagine makeup life without it. Some lipsticks work better than others and some don&#x27;t work at all, but that seems to be the differences of lip products and not the fault of this product. I can finally wear the reds and oranges I love without smearing it all over my entire life. Life changing, wonderful thing.</li>
            <li> Oh my I&#x27;m in love with this product I wish I would&#x27;ve known about this a longtime ago I gotta tell my daughter about this thx so much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it once so far but this stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> It tingles a bit, which I don&#x27;t mind, but others might. Menthol tingle, akin to Vicks. Also, has the potential to dry out. Setting process is a bit inconvenient as well — two minutes with lips separated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the brush version, there&#x27;s a roller style I&#x27;d rather have, so see if your seller options it. Can&#x27;t complain too much. No domestic alternative available.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lipcote product for years. It is a staple in the make-up bags of nearly every British woman! I am delighted to find it on Amazon and no longer have to have it sent by a family member across the Atlantic Ocean. It seals any colour lipstick you choose for hours. It can even keep lipstick on through brushing your teeth as well as eating or drinking. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works very well to protect lipstick and keep color longer. Only complaint is that when you apply it, until it dries it smells bad and is tingly. Takes a minute or so to dry.</li>
            <li> It really burn when you put it on.  I didn&#x27;t see what to rave about it.  I don&#x27;t think it made a significant difference worth putting up with the initial burning sensation; that can&#x27;t be good for you</li>
            <li> I thougt this would be a miracle product but it just seemed to hold my lipstick on for an hour longer than it would normally stay on. Maybe its the type of lipstick im using... ill have to give it more tries i guess.</li>
            <li> I just started wearing red lipstick and I noticed it came off on everything so I tried this product, since it was the only one with a 5-star review.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love the way it really keeps lipstick sealed but the smell and burning is too much for me to handle!! When I first put it on I thought it smelled like paint one paints their home with.  I had my mom smell it and she said it smelled like nail polish.  I just don&#x27;t want to put something on my lips that smells like it belongs in a paint bucket!</li>
            <li> I use this for my eyebrows. It causes my eyebrow makeup to stay put all day long. Too much on may cause you to itch, but once you got the right amount adjusted, you will not know you have it on. I only tried on lipstick once, and it works there too, but I need it most for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated lipstick, I can&#x27;t stand it smudging everywhere, and having to check every five minutes for smudges on my face and teeth.  This product is amazing! It does smell a bit funny, but it doesn&#x27;t burn my lips at all, and after it dries completely doesn&#x27;t smudge or move at all.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that you have to blot your lipstick, but that&#x27;s not a fault of the product itself, it&#x27;s actually what makes it work so well.  I&#x27;ve noticed that it does take a little while to dry, and therefore is a bit tacky during that time, but once it&#x27;s completely dry it&#x27;s so smooth and not drying to the lips at all.  Would definitely recommend, and will re-order when I&#x27;m out.  Can&#x27;t wait for a chance to test it with red lipstick too :D</li>
            <li> perfect for making your lipstick last all day!</li>
            <li> Lipcote is Fantastic! I always exfoliate with a paste of sugar and olive oil (or whatever you have around) pat lips dry, apply lip pencil, lipstick, blot, lipstick, then with a big smile Lipcote and keep smiling for about 2 minutes. After about 15 you can eat and drink and go about your day and it will stay on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other 24-hour lipsticks and used as directed and found that they flake off if I choose to eat, drink, kiss my husband, etc. which I found frustrating. Nothing has worked better than this. Too bad it takes about a month to get from England to the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protips for keeping lipstick on come from Toxic Tears youtube video about doing black lips, but really work for any color: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;0l5OFettBT4</li>
            <li> Reordered for the 3rd time. Love it! Recommended to all that inquire about the \\&quot;lasting\\&quot; lipstick cover.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t do without it.  Surprised at the prompt delivery from England.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH IT, I&#x27;m A lipstick fan  so  i was hoping this  would be good ,SAVE YOURE MONEY ON THIS ONE!!!</li>
            <li> I have used many lipstick sealer and this one is just okay. Lipstick still bleeds after application, so what&#x27;s the point?</li>
            <li> This product can, and was for me personally, very drying and caused the skin on my lips to peel. Very disappointed.  I tried to return to seller for a refund but they don&#x27;t refund unhappy customers. :(</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something like this.  If you just follow the directions it works perfectly.  I wore my red lipstick for several hours and even ate stuff!  After many hours my lips felt a little dry so I just added a litle lip balm and my lips were still shiney and red.  :)</li>
            <li> It came from London, and there is nothing like it here.  It&#x27;s worth the cost and the wait!  Wish someone in the US would/could carry it.</li>
