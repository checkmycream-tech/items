    <ol>
            <li>I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I&#x27;m impressed with the job it does.</li>
            <li>Amazon was great as always, and as it is not returnable they refunded my $$ no worries</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>A great tool to have in your gym bag or purse for a touch up.</li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>I loved it a lot</li>
            <li>it can be taken anywhere without a plug in,heats upshot after a bit,and fairly inexpensive.</li>
            <li>loved the product.convenient when you don&#x27;t have electricity.heats up and works just like one with a cord.</li>
            <li>It takes a good 5 minutes to heat up.  </li>
            <li>Excellent suitable for me and very light and Soha use and its size is very appropriate</li>
            <li>So handy to use, no looking for outlets.</li>
            <li>I walked around looking a bit puffier than I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li>a lot&lt;br /&gt;Excellent suitable for me and very light and Soha use and its size is very appropriate</li>
            <li>a lot&lt;br /&gt;Excellent suitable for me and very light and Soha use and its size is very appropriate</li>
            <li>I used to use a cordless curling iron to straighten my bangs--this one works a lot better, and it&#x27;s handy to have in my purse when humidity wreaks its havoc on my hair.</li>
            <li>It was certainly better than nothing</li>
            <li>The straightener is OK, but not for someone with longer hair.</li>
            <li>It &#x27;s better then nothing.</li>
            <li>Most shows charge an arm and a leg for electricity</li>
            <li>I guess if you can deal with your hair smelling then you might be okay with this product.</li>
            <li>Much better than nothing, mind you, but I wish this had a bit more</li>
            <li>Its ok if all you need this for is an emergency situation like the electricity going out</li>
            <li>Probably a tool best for those with fine hair that has been straightened but needs a touch up later in the day.</li>
            <li>I was going to China and wasn&#x27;t sure where I&#x27;d find the right hair implements or voltage to work what I own.</li>
            <li>They are absolutely fantastic, at the gym, for a quick touch up in the car when I arrive someplace, when travelling !!</li>
            <li>(I have naturally very wavy and fairly frizzy hair).</li>
            <li>I have been a Braum butane user for 30+ years, and Conair too, and love this concept for car rides and travel - quick and easy out the door.  </li>
            <li>It turns out the airline I flew said butane canisters were prohibited, but a girl&#x27;s gotta do what a girl&#x27;s gotta do, and it made it through fine (also I figured if people are allowed a cigarette lighter, why not one butane canister?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you go in with the expectation that something is better than nothing, than the purchase will be worth it.</li>
            <li>I needed it for a week long camping trip and it did help somewhat, but it took me forever to style my hair and it wasn&#x27;t even that great when done.</li>
            <li>We tried it when we first received it and it seemed to work just fine.  </li>
            <li>If you buy products that won&#x27;t be used often, make sure you still try them several times within the 30 days to be sure they work.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping I could use it as quick touch ups on in the bathroom if needed on evenings out.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend this unless you just need to do a quick touch up.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get very hot....</li>
            <li>straightener would not be my first choice if I had a sturdy, electrical unit available.</li>
            <li>but it did not really heat up to a temperature that did much good.</li>
            <li>so I went on line to find some kind of battery operated iron, only to find that they didn&#x27;t exist.  </li>
            <li>It is good for a quick touch up, but I don&#x27;t like that you have to use two hands to press the clamp down to tighten the grip on your hair.</li>
            <li>I thought this straightener would be great for traveling; however, it barely gets hot enough to do anything.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for thinner hair rather than coarse texture and it was much better at straightening</li>
            <li>Bought this for European travel, thought it would make frizzy hair more manageable.  </li>
            <li>It did get quite hot, but was so lightweight that I had to pinch the ends together when running the straightener through my hair to get any sort of smoothness</li>
            <li>I tried it at home first</li>
            <li>I modified this flat iron by removing the top piece and then used as an iron for my demos.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice to see other sizes for where the hair gets straightened at.</li>
            <li>that is really workable on thicker or longer hair.</li>
            <li>This was a real solution for my unusual situation.</li>
            <li>but they are holding fast to their 30 day policy and told me to contact the manufacturer instead.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really do anything.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, it did make my hair look better than it would have otherwise.</li>
            <li>so I can have my hair looking somehow decent and this product does not heat up.</li>
            <li>Definitely not recommended as a primary straightener since it would be too costly to replace the butane and the product lacks heat for big straightening jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most Amazon sellers, and Amazon themselves, would have accepted a return on a defective item even past the stated return window.</li>
            <li>Never could get it hot enough to use.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>The outside got really hot but the plates inside didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>It does not get hot enough.  </li>
            <li>HI,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally wavy hair, I use this to freshen up my hair during our camping trips.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and this iron does not work well enough to straighten it.  </li>
            <li>If I am ever forced to camp, I&#x27;ll take this along for sure.</li>
            <li>The clamp is also not tight</li>
            <li>so I wetted my hair, let it air dry, use my cordless straightener and was ready when we stopped for breakfast...a lifesaver for me.</li>
            <li>I have fine thick hair...</li>
            <li>It heats up pretty quickly, and because my hair is thick and coarse; I have to go over it several times for it to straighten well.</li>
            <li>Clearly, this is not meant to be a daily hair styling tool.  </li>
            <li>I took mine on vacation, we left early and I didn&#x27;t want to take time to do my hair...</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s worth the cost for emergencies (i.e. tame frizz when you are caught out in humid weather)</li>
            <li>Not fast enough or hot enough.</li>
            <li>Does not heat very hot and does not grip real tight.</li>
            <li>In general I like Conair products (especially the infiniti line).</li>
            <li>In its defense I have super thick hair...</li>
            <li>A few days of decent hair was worth the small expense.</li>

            <li> It did not warm up!  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t straighten my hair even when I separated it really thin.</li>

            <li> It was certainly better than nothing but it did not really heat up to a temperature that did much good.I would recommend it for thinner hair rather than coarse texture and it was much better at straightening bangs tha n anything else</li>
            <li> every girl should have this in her bag</li>
            <li> The straightener is OK, but not for someone with longer hair. It does not heat up to a temp. that is really workable on thicker or longer hair. I needed it for a week long camping trip and it did help somewhat, but it took me forever to style my hair and it wasn&#x27;t even that great when done. On the other hand, it did make my hair look better than it would have otherwise. If you go in with the expectation that something is better than nothing, than the purchase will be worth it.</li>
            <li> It is not good for very thick hair, however it can do the job.  It may take a little longer to do the job, but it does work.  I like that I can travel with it and the cartridges are TSA approved for carry on.  My one complaint is that I received an EMPTY cartridge in mine when I received it...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very hot....</li>
            <li> I needed this item to use during camping.  It is NOT clear when the straightener has started to work as there is NO light to show that is lit and that is heating.  It worked well as far as my bangs, BUT it pulls hair and hurts me :-(</li>
            <li> I have been using the other Conair Cordless appliances for the past 10 years.  They are absolutely fantastic, at the gym, for a quick touch up in the car when I arrive someplace, when travelling !!</li>
            <li> Does not heat very hot and does not grip real tight. It &#x27;s better then nothing. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I used this item in a completely different way.  I demo Angelina Fibers at Quilt Shows, and it requires an iron to show how they work.  You can iron the fibers over a rubber stamp to make an applique.  Most shows charge an arm and a leg for electricity so I went on line to find some kind of battery operated iron, only to find that they didn&#x27;t exist.  I modified this flat iron by removing the top piece and then used as an iron for my demos.  Each thermacell lasted about 4 - 5 hours.  This was a real solution for my unusual situation.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas.  Clearly, this is not meant to be a daily hair styling tool.  It would be used on an as-needed basis.  We tried it when we first received it and it seemed to work just fine.  The second attempt at using it was two months after it was purchased (again, as needed basis for this tool).  It did not warm up!  I contacted the seller and explained the situation but they are holding fast to their 30 day policy and told me to contact the manufacturer instead.  If you buy products that won&#x27;t be used often, make sure you still try them several times within the 30 days to be sure they work.  Most Amazon sellers, and Amazon themselves, would have accepted a return on a defective item even past the stated return window.</li>
            <li> Bought this for European travel, thought it would make frizzy hair more manageable.  I have fine thick hair...the unit I purchased didn&#x27;t heat up (I tested it with a thermometer) above 300 - and that took 20 minutes!  I have been a Braum butane user for 30+ years, and Conair too, and love this concept for car rides and travel - quick and easy out the door.  The clamp is also not tight so you have to pinch the ends together to pull through to straighten  (there is a purposeful point for doing that on the unit so obviously engineering knew this before release), and that caught my hair and pulled it out with every stroke...ouch! Ill end up bald by the end of the trip...Amazon was great as always, and as it is not returnable they refunded my $$ no worries so I could purchase another.  I will try Braun....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it.  I bought it because I was going on a mission trip so I can have my hair looking somehow decent and this product does not heat up.</li>
            <li> This does not heat up well, and it does not grip hair tight it grips very loose. You cannot return the product because of the butane. Seller should mention item cannot be returned for a refund. This is trash and not fair.</li>
            <li> Never could get it hot enough to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent suitable for me and very light and Soha use and its size is very appropriate I loved it a lot&lt;br /&gt;Excellent suitable for me and very light and Soha use and its size is very appropriate I loved it a lot&lt;br /&gt;Excellent suitable for me and very light and Soha use and its size is very appropriate I loved it a lot</li>
            <li> HI,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally wavy hair, I use this to freshen up my hair during our camping trips.  Works great</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money! I thought this straightener would be great for traveling; however, it barely gets hot enough to do anything. Also, it smells like butane, so I guess if you can deal with your hair smelling then you might be okay with this product. You cannot return this product either- so I&#x27;m stuck with it and have no use for it as it does me no good.</li>
            <li> In its defense I have super thick hair...but it didn&#x27;t really do anything.  The outside got really hot but the plates inside didn&#x27;t and it didn&#x27;t straighten my hair even when I separated it really thin.</li>
            <li> The reason for my rating was based on it can be taken anywhere without a plug in,heats upshot after a bit,and fairly inexpensive. It would be nice to see other sizes for where the hair gets straightened at.</li>
            <li> A great tool to have in your gym bag or purse for a touch up. Probably a tool best for those with fine hair that has been straightened but needs a touch up later in the day. Definitely not recommended as a primary straightener since it would be too costly to replace the butane and the product lacks heat for big straightening jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s worth the cost for emergencies (i.e. tame frizz when you are caught out in humid weather)</li>
            <li> It is good for a quick touch up, but I don&#x27;t like that you have to use two hands to press the clamp down to tighten the grip on your hair. It heats up pretty quickly, and because my hair is thick and coarse; I have to go over it several times for it to straighten well. It&#x27;s definitely not something I could use for an all over straightner, just touch ups.</li>
            <li> Save your cash.  This product is not worth the money.  It does not get hot enough.  It took a bit of the curl out but not enough.</li>
            <li> I used to use a cordless curling iron to straighten my bangs--this one works a lot better, and it&#x27;s handy to have in my purse when humidity wreaks its havoc on my hair.</li>
            <li> loved the product.convenient when you don&#x27;t have electricity.heats up and works just like one with a cord.I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> So handy to use, no looking for outlets. I took mine on vacation, we left early and I didn&#x27;t want to take time to do my hair...so I wetted my hair, let it air dry, use my cordless straightener and was ready when we stopped for breakfast...a lifesaver for me.</li>
            <li> In general I like Conair products (especially the infiniti line). I was going to China and wasn&#x27;t sure where I&#x27;d find the right hair implements or voltage to work what I own. So I bought this straightener. It turns out the airline I flew said butane canisters were prohibited, but a girl&#x27;s gotta do what a girl&#x27;s gotta do, and it made it through fine (also I figured if people are allowed a cigarette lighter, why not one butane canister?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straightener would not be my first choice if I had a sturdy, electrical unit available. It did get quite hot, but was so lightweight that I had to pinch the ends together when running the straightener through my hair to get any sort of smoothness (I have naturally very wavy and fairly frizzy hair). I walked around looking a bit puffier than I would&#x27;ve liked. Much better than nothing, mind you, but I wish this had a bit more heft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, I don&#x27;t regret buying this. A few days of decent hair was worth the small expense. If I am ever forced to camp, I&#x27;ll take this along for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought this to take camping. I have a short A-line cut and can&#x27;t go anywhere without my hair done. I tried it at home first and I have to say I&#x27;m impressed with the job it does. It&#x27;s not my expensive home straightener but it will be better than nothing at all.</li>
            <li> Its ok if all you need this for is an emergency situation like the electricity going out but you will have a hard time styling your hair like you normally do.  It takes a good 5 minutes to heat up.  I was hoping I could use it as quick touch ups on in the bathroom if needed on evenings out.  Not fast enough or hot enough.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and this iron does not work well enough to straighten it.  I would not recommend this unless you just need to do a quick touch up.</li>
