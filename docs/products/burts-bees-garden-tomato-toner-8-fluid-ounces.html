            <li>choose Amazon! :o)</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved this toner for about 15 years now.</li>
            <li>Quality not as good as it was years ago.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved this product for YEARS</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my very favorite</li>
            <li>This is a great toner which me and my husband both love.</li>
            <li>I want more glass bottles!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I have used this stuff for years and still love it!</li>
            <li>but since i kind of started getting blemishes on my face lately&lt;</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it...</li>
            <li>This toner has a nice smell but it just doesn&#x27;t work well for my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely toner that does not sting and it very refreshing.</li>
            <li>It had a very strong alcohol smell.</li>
            <li>I have advocated the products to many people and have made many convert!</li>
            <li>Is Burt&#x27;s Bees nolonger the amazing company that started in Raleigh, NC many years ago?</li>
            <li>I also kind of love the frosted glass bottle that it comes in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years, I have not been able to find it in stores and thrilled that amazon has it.</li>
            <li>This is the best toner I have ever used on my oily and acne prone yet sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My favorite toner--gentle and effective</li>
            <li>explain the truth to what has happened to my tried and true products?!?!</li>
            <li>And though my skin still looks pretty darn tootin&#x27; great.</li>
            <li>She says that smell is very, very light.</li>
            <li>It did a great job getting oil off my face, making my skin and large pores look smoother.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a toner before because I wasnt sure what it was or that I even needed it.</li>
            <li>You will not even find a \\&quot;misting\\&quot; top to the bottle anywhere.</li>
            <li>It is more of a treatment product to apply via a cotton ball after cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best facial toner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>My husband has had oily skin issues most of his life.</li>
            <li>Now it is overwhelming with an isopropyl alcohol scent and burns my skin.</li>
            <li>Between these three products, I have have thrown away more than $50.</li>
            <li>I love that the toner cleanses my face without irritation.</li>
            <li>It made my face more oily than before</li>
            <li>It smells like a garden of tomatoes which I really love.  </li>
            <li>and it helps my moisturizer soak in better.  </li>
            <li>If you have super-sensitive skin, this isn&#x27;t the toner for you, but I&#x27;m sure most oily skins can handle this with no problem.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees products are pleasant to use and make my skin feel so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>I want a more herb scent.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>But aside from that, I really love this toner...since my store no longer carries it, I have to buy mine online....</li>
            <li>All it does is burn my skin and make it alot more oily</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>Problem: because it comes in a glass container, more and more stores no longer carry it</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this and the way it makes my skin feel -</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Today, i tried on my face, and am so pleased.</li>
            <li>It is gentle but very effective; it cleans the filmy residue from soap and the day&#x27;s dirt; also is a great mild way to clean up acne patches.</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel very clean</li>
            <li>Good quality&lt;br /&gt;I am Willing to purchase another one.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m now using a whole Burt&#x27;s Bees regimen night &amp; day, and I&#x27;ve loving my skin again!</li>
            <li>so it lasts a long time and works great !!</li>
            <li>Love all burt&#x27;s bees products great toner does not leave your skin dry and very refreshing.</li>
            <li>hope you return to the original formulations, and please let me know when you do!</li>
            <li>Nice mild smell (does not smell like tomatoes).</li>
            <li>The best part is that it is pH balanced and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry or feeling \\&quot;tight\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Might take a bit getting used to the smell of the tomato, but it feels very cool after application.</li>
            <li>I prefer alcohol free toners but for an astringent products I am ok with some grain alcohol used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer alcohol free toners but for an astringent products I am ok with some grain alcohol used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t think of a more natural product that I trusted impeccably.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that the shipping costs are cheap (</li>
            <li>Basically, if you have skin easily prone to break-outs?</li>
            <li>And this had a strong fragrant that smells perfume</li>
            <li>The alcohol smell is too strong to use.</li>
            <li>Well ok, so I was also drawn to the cool looking bottle/minimalist packaging</li>
            <li>company sent me a shipping label and said they would send a replacement for the toner, since I was fine with the rosewater toner.</li>
            <li>It smells super fresh, and works really nicely to tone my skin.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely garden smell of herbs, and the bottle is pretty, to boot!</li>
            <li>Although I primarily use the hydrating toners, there are times where I am giving facials to family or friends and doing extractions or doing extractions on myself, where I would cleanse again after</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic, and seems to help with my breakouts.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the freshness that this product makes my face feel and</li>
            <li>I miss what this company stood for and the all natural good for me</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Burts is a good line, but if you have sensitive skin, stay away from this stuff and stick to rosewater toner.</li>
            <li>I remember it smelling like the top of a tomato right after pulling it from the vine, and that smell is still there, but it comes with a huge amount of alcohol now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And just for the record it does not smell like a tomato but does have a sort of fresh \\&quot;gardeny\\&quot; aroma that is unique and appealing.</li>
            <li>Very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Natural is best for my sensitive skin.. full of garden veggies.</li>
            <li>So fresh!</li>
            <li>The other nice things about it are:  it takes excess oil off of your face and throat and it never leaves your skin feeling sticky, but just nice and clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s neither too oily, or too dry, so this toner works great for my skin.</li>
            <li>It feels clean after I apply it.</li>
            <li>but didn&#x27;t feel clean or refresh.</li>
            <li>I love this product; when my bottle accidentally broke I really missed it and ordered on on Amazon after my health food store stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>Following it&#x27;s Good reputations&lt;</li>
            <li>Buyers might want to know that this is *much* stronger than the rosewater toner; this is more of an astringent.</li>
            <li>It was cool, slightly tingly, smooth, soft, and best of all, no reaction.</li>
            <li>I have remained loyal and faithful until recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have oily, mild acne, combination skin.</li>
            <li>My T zone will be super shine if I forget to apply this toner or switch to another brand.</li>
            <li>I am allergic and/or highly reactive to most skin and hair care products.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my pores were cleaner, and my face felt cleaner and healthier after I used this the very first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tried many brands like Estee Lauder, Shishedo, Neutrogena, Clean and Clear, Ponds, etc</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell amazing, it does the job.</li>
            <li>The scent is very earthy, and my skin feels smooth after using.</li>
            <li>It really keeps my skin fresh and is really good at cleaning out the last traces of dirt and makeup from my face.  </li>
            <li>I finally bought it and this is why I ended loving it and why I would buy it again:&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li>Yet is still not overly drying like some and with an 8 ounce bottle it lasts quite a while and is well worth</li>
            <li>It also comes in handy to cleanse and freshen the skin after working outside in the yard or coming in from a humid climate.  </li>
            <li>I am convinced this is the reason my 30 year old skin stays looking 21. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I used a sample someone gave me; I really liked Burt&#x27;s Bees Toner, Garden Tomato, especially the smell.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product I bought while out of town and have not been able to find locally.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so natural and potent</li>
            <li>was nice enough.</li>
            <li>cuz right now it&#x27;s WAY 2</li>
            <li>I even use it when my skin feels dry/tight (right after the shower) and it somehow helps restore some moisture</li>
            <li>and I was right.</li>
            <li>I have used all types of toners in the past and this one by far is the best.</li>
            <li>My face really felt clean after use.</li>
            <li>It helps control my oily skin and really makes it feel clean.</li>
            <li>love how it is able to acomplish it&#x27;s astringent properties but can still be called a toner by the addition of balancing and soothing ingredients like cucumber and green tea.</li>
            <li>My husband has oily skin and mine is very dry, but this toner works nicely for us both.</li>
            <li>Hard to find product, happy to have found it.</li>
            <li>My skin overall has just become more \\&quot;balanced\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The first product I used was the Apricot Baby Oil for my then unborn baby.</li>
            <li>This was the FIRST toner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>one time, the shipping cost me almost as much as the toner!)</li>
            <li>i have oily, combination skin and when i first used the toner the oiliness of my skin lessened.</li>
            <li>and this is great for following up cleansing on days I have exercised or just had a really long day.</li>
            <li>The scent is absolute heaven!</li>
            <li>I applied with cotton balls and did not go over the same area more than twice.</li>
            <li>and i can&#x27;t wait for the hot summer days to bring the feeling of freshness to my face.. .</li>
            <li>when I could no longer afford Clinique Facial toner, I tried several options, the Tomato Toner is hands down the best  leaves me feeling clean  </li>
            <li>/&gt;And just for the record it does not smell like a tomato but does have a sort of fresh \\&quot;gardeny\\&quot; aroma that is unique and appealing.nse and freshen the skin after working outside in the yard or coming in from a humid climate.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling fresh and truly clean, without any left over residue.  </li>
            <li>It was more expensive than other toners i&#x27;ve tried but its the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and</li>
            <li>New users may NOT notice or care, but for we who have used it for years do!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% natural, gentle, doesn&#x27;t sting or burn, and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The glass bottle is just very neat.</li>
            <li>dont really use toner</li>
            <li>The real slap in the face was the Tomato toner which I discovered over 10 years ago...</li>
            <li>It cleans my face really well.</li>
            <li>Since my skin gets really oily in the summer, I need a stronger toner to keep things under control.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees Tomato toner works very well without being too drying.</li>
            <li>I really do like Burt&#x27;s Bees tomato toner.</li>
            <li>I can feel a difference and my face is much smoother.</li>
            <li>But smelling like Raid is worth it for the clear skin.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t really noticed any smell from the toner.</li>
            <li>I found it to be very drying for my skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone with problematic skin!</li>
            <li>I really like this product a lot.  </li>
            <li>I do still use my regular Bioré cleanser, but this toner is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>It dries out all the oil and makes your face dry, smooth and super clear.</li>
            <li>So while I do not use it as an everyday toner it has filled a void in my skin care product needs for that specific treatment product as a more astringent toner that is required on occasion.</li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite toner of all time.</li>
            <li>The new formula may as well be a bottle of isopropyl alcohol!</li>
            <li>but has more alcohol in it than I remember when I used it previously.</li>
            <li>mild enough for my face.</li>
            <li>I understand that popularity dictated larger production scale... but the recent changes seem more profit based rather than customer satisfaction.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is one of the ONLY products that I have used the ENTIRE bottle, and then bought more.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>But after I rubbed a cotton ball over my entire face and neck with this toner, it felt very soft and cool.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this toner.</li>
            <li>I can see why it would be a great product for those with \\&quot;troubled skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It would be suitable for teenagers and twenty-somethings who are dealing with acne, but it&#x27;s not appropriate for a middle-aged person, or for those with</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone with oily or normal skin.</li>
            <li>Only issue is that it DOES dry out my oily skin, which then proceeds to just make more oil.</li>
            <li>My skin alternates between oily and dry depending on the time of year, but this toner completely evens that out and leaves my face feeling very fresh.</li>
            <li>I even bought a variety pack to share with my children, and other than the peppermint, they may as well be cheap smelling fruity concoctions.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is lower than the price at Whole Foods, which seems to be the only retail location still stocking this, so I will absolutely be ordering again.</li>
            <li>I have oily but very (VERY) sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After applying it, my skin, especially on my cheeks started to feel hot, like they were on fire.</li>
            <li>It did not make my face dry, and left my skin feeling smooth, soft and tingly.</li>
            <li>I bought an extra one to work, and used it after lunch when my skin gets really oily and so far, it&#x27;s mitigated my development of pimples or enlarged pores.</li>
            <li>Before using this, my face was clear.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I have been washing my face more often lately and it IS winter</li>
            <li>I AM nearly 41...</li>
            <li>So far none of their products have worked for me including their Acne Toner &amp; Citrus Scrub.</li>
            <li>It really takes me back.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that breaks out</li>
            <li>Wow, someone recommended Burt Bee&#x27;s Rosewater Toner, so I tried it.</li>
            <li>I mean) which is a smell I love.</li>
            <li>so my face is pretty dry NOW</li>
            <li>It also smells really fresh, compared to other toners that smell like chemicals.</li>
            <li>toners for oily skin are more often named Astringents, they can be anything from a Which Hazel product to one with more complicated ingredients with a variety of things combined to tighten skin, close pores and break down oil and/or fight bacteria.</li>
            <li>I usually go for the hydrating toners and the refreshing facial mists.</li>
            <li>I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees for nearly 18 years -- back when you could only find the product in very specialized health food stores.</li>
            <li>Burts Bees is my new facial skin care.</li>
            <li>was running low on my Radiance Day Cream, purchased a new jar,</li>
            <li>Since this product is almost all natural, I don&#x27;t have guilt about using it regularly.</li>
            <li>Prior to using this product, I always used a separate toner and zit cream on my early thirties acne prone face.</li>
            <li>I then got some sort of rash near my eye.&lt;br /&gt;The company medical line</li>
            <li>This toner will really pull the hidden dirt out of your pores.  </li>
            <li>But careful how much you use as it can dry your skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive pale skin and it keeps my face clear, non greasy and never dry.</li>
            <li>Good for him but bad for me.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great price</li>
            <li> I had great luck with the rosewater toner and thought I&#x27;d try the tomato line because of my combination/</li>
            <li> Feels great on the face</li>
            <li> Great for acne.</li>

            <li> I have been using this toner for years and it is amazing!</li>
            <li> This toner felt and smelled amazing!</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of toners and astringents, and I truly love this one the best!  </li>
            <li> choose Amazon! :o)</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this toner for about 15 years now.</li>
            <li> Quality not as good as it was years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this product for YEARS</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my very favorite</li>
            <li> This is a great toner which me and my husband both love.</li>
            <li> I want more glass bottles!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for years and still love it!</li>
            <li> but since i kind of started getting blemishes on my face lately&lt;</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it...</li>
            <li> This toner has a nice smell but it just doesn&#x27;t work well for my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely toner that does not sting and it very refreshing.</li>
            <li> It had a very strong alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> I have advocated the products to many people and have made many convert!</li>
            <li> Is Burt&#x27;s Bees nolonger the amazing company that started in Raleigh, NC many years ago?</li>
            <li> I also kind of love the frosted glass bottle that it comes in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years, I have not been able to find it in stores and thrilled that amazon has it.</li>
            <li> This is the best toner I have ever used on my oily and acne prone yet sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My favorite toner--gentle and effective</li>
            <li> explain the truth to what has happened to my tried and true products?!?!</li>
            <li> And though my skin still looks pretty darn tootin&#x27; great.</li>
            <li> She says that smell is very, very light.</li>
            <li> It did a great job getting oil off my face, making my skin and large pores look smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a toner before because I wasnt sure what it was or that I even needed it.</li>
            <li> You will not even find a \\&quot;misting\\&quot; top to the bottle anywhere.</li>
            <li> It is more of a treatment product to apply via a cotton ball after cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best facial toner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My husband has had oily skin issues most of his life.</li>
            <li> Now it is overwhelming with an isopropyl alcohol scent and burns my skin.</li>
            <li> Between these three products, I have have thrown away more than $50.</li>
            <li> I love that the toner cleanses my face without irritation.</li>
            <li> It made my face more oily than before</li>
            <li> It smells like a garden of tomatoes which I really love.  </li>
            <li> and it helps my moisturizer soak in better.  </li>
            <li> If you have super-sensitive skin, this isn&#x27;t the toner for you, but I&#x27;m sure most oily skins can handle this with no problem.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees products are pleasant to use and make my skin feel so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I want a more herb scent.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> But aside from that, I really love this toner...since my store no longer carries it, I have to buy mine online....</li>
            <li> All it does is burn my skin and make it alot more oily</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> Problem: because it comes in a glass container, more and more stores no longer carry it</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this and the way it makes my skin feel -</li>
            <li> and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Today, i tried on my face, and am so pleased.</li>
            <li> It is gentle but very effective; it cleans the filmy residue from soap and the day&#x27;s dirt; also is a great mild way to clean up acne patches.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel very clean</li>
            <li> Good quality&lt;br /&gt;I am Willing to purchase another one.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m now using a whole Burt&#x27;s Bees regimen night &amp; day, and I&#x27;ve loving my skin again!</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time and works great !!</li>
            <li> Love all burt&#x27;s bees products great toner does not leave your skin dry and very refreshing.</li>
            <li> hope you return to the original formulations, and please let me know when you do!</li>
            <li> Nice mild smell (does not smell like tomatoes).</li>
            <li> The best part is that it is pH balanced and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry or feeling \\&quot;tight\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Might take a bit getting used to the smell of the tomato, but it feels very cool after application.</li>
            <li> I prefer alcohol free toners but for an astringent products I am ok with some grain alcohol used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer alcohol free toners but for an astringent products I am ok with some grain alcohol used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t think of a more natural product that I trusted impeccably.</li>
            <li> Just make sure that the shipping costs are cheap (</li>
            <li> Basically, if you have skin easily prone to break-outs?</li>
            <li> And this had a strong fragrant that smells perfume</li>
            <li> The alcohol smell is too strong to use.</li>
            <li> Well ok, so I was also drawn to the cool looking bottle/minimalist packaging</li>
            <li> company sent me a shipping label and said they would send a replacement for the toner, since I was fine with the rosewater toner.</li>
            <li> It smells super fresh, and works really nicely to tone my skin.</li>
            <li> It has a lovely garden smell of herbs, and the bottle is pretty, to boot!</li>
            <li> Although I primarily use the hydrating toners, there are times where I am giving facials to family or friends and doing extractions or doing extractions on myself, where I would cleanse again after</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, and seems to help with my breakouts.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the freshness that this product makes my face feel and</li>
            <li> I miss what this company stood for and the all natural good for me</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Burts is a good line, but if you have sensitive skin, stay away from this stuff and stick to rosewater toner.</li>
            <li> I remember it smelling like the top of a tomato right after pulling it from the vine, and that smell is still there, but it comes with a huge amount of alcohol now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And just for the record it does not smell like a tomato but does have a sort of fresh \\&quot;gardeny\\&quot; aroma that is unique and appealing.</li>
            <li> Very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Natural is best for my sensitive skin.. full of garden veggies.</li>
            <li> So fresh!</li>
            <li> The other nice things about it are:  it takes excess oil off of your face and throat and it never leaves your skin feeling sticky, but just nice and clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s neither too oily, or too dry, so this toner works great for my skin.</li>
            <li> It feels clean after I apply it.</li>
            <li> but didn&#x27;t feel clean or refresh.</li>
            <li> I love this product; when my bottle accidentally broke I really missed it and ordered on on Amazon after my health food store stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> Following it&#x27;s Good reputations&lt;</li>
            <li> Buyers might want to know that this is *much* stronger than the rosewater toner; this is more of an astringent.</li>
            <li> It was cool, slightly tingly, smooth, soft, and best of all, no reaction.</li>
            <li> I have remained loyal and faithful until recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have oily, mild acne, combination skin.</li>
            <li> My T zone will be super shine if I forget to apply this toner or switch to another brand.</li>
            <li> I am allergic and/or highly reactive to most skin and hair care products.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my pores were cleaner, and my face felt cleaner and healthier after I used this the very first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried many brands like Estee Lauder, Shishedo, Neutrogena, Clean and Clear, Ponds, etc</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell amazing, it does the job.</li>
            <li> The scent is very earthy, and my skin feels smooth after using.</li>
            <li> It really keeps my skin fresh and is really good at cleaning out the last traces of dirt and makeup from my face.  </li>
            <li> I finally bought it and this is why I ended loving it and why I would buy it again:&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> Yet is still not overly drying like some and with an 8 ounce bottle it lasts quite a while and is well worth</li>
            <li> It also comes in handy to cleanse and freshen the skin after working outside in the yard or coming in from a humid climate.  </li>
            <li> I am convinced this is the reason my 30 year old skin stays looking 21. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I used a sample someone gave me; I really liked Burt&#x27;s Bees Toner, Garden Tomato, especially the smell.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product I bought while out of town and have not been able to find locally.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so natural and potent</li>
            <li> was nice enough.</li>
            <li> cuz right now it&#x27;s WAY 2</li>
            <li> I even use it when my skin feels dry/tight (right after the shower) and it somehow helps restore some moisture</li>
            <li> and I was right.</li>
            <li> I have used all types of toners in the past and this one by far is the best.</li>
            <li> My face really felt clean after use.</li>
            <li> It helps control my oily skin and really makes it feel clean.</li>
            <li> love how it is able to acomplish it&#x27;s astringent properties but can still be called a toner by the addition of balancing and soothing ingredients like cucumber and green tea.</li>
            <li> My husband has oily skin and mine is very dry, but this toner works nicely for us both.</li>
            <li> Hard to find product, happy to have found it.</li>
            <li> My skin overall has just become more \\&quot;balanced\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The first product I used was the Apricot Baby Oil for my then unborn baby.</li>
            <li> This was the FIRST toner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> one time, the shipping cost me almost as much as the toner!)</li>
            <li> i have oily, combination skin and when i first used the toner the oiliness of my skin lessened.</li>
            <li> and this is great for following up cleansing on days I have exercised or just had a really long day.</li>
            <li> The scent is absolute heaven!</li>
            <li> I applied with cotton balls and did not go over the same area more than twice.</li>
            <li> and i can&#x27;t wait for the hot summer days to bring the feeling of freshness to my face.. .</li>
            <li> when I could no longer afford Clinique Facial toner, I tried several options, the Tomato Toner is hands down the best  leaves me feeling clean  </li>
            <li> /&gt;And just for the record it does not smell like a tomato but does have a sort of fresh \\&quot;gardeny\\&quot; aroma that is unique and appealing.nse and freshen the skin after working outside in the yard or coming in from a humid climate.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling fresh and truly clean, without any left over residue.  </li>
            <li> It was more expensive than other toners i&#x27;ve tried but its the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and</li>
            <li> New users may NOT notice or care, but for we who have used it for years do!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% natural, gentle, doesn&#x27;t sting or burn, and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The glass bottle is just very neat.</li>
            <li> dont really use toner</li>
            <li> The real slap in the face was the Tomato toner which I discovered over 10 years ago...</li>
            <li> It cleans my face really well.</li>
            <li> Since my skin gets really oily in the summer, I need a stronger toner to keep things under control.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Tomato toner works very well without being too drying.</li>
            <li> I really do like Burt&#x27;s Bees tomato toner.</li>
            <li> I can feel a difference and my face is much smoother.</li>
            <li> But smelling like Raid is worth it for the clear skin.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t really noticed any smell from the toner.</li>
            <li> I found it to be very drying for my skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone with problematic skin!</li>
            <li> I really like this product a lot.  </li>
            <li> I do still use my regular Bioré cleanser, but this toner is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> It dries out all the oil and makes your face dry, smooth and super clear.</li>
            <li> So while I do not use it as an everyday toner it has filled a void in my skin care product needs for that specific treatment product as a more astringent toner that is required on occasion.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite toner of all time.</li>
            <li> The new formula may as well be a bottle of isopropyl alcohol!</li>
            <li> but has more alcohol in it than I remember when I used it previously.</li>
            <li> mild enough for my face.</li>
            <li> I understand that popularity dictated larger production scale... but the recent changes seem more profit based rather than customer satisfaction.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is one of the ONLY products that I have used the ENTIRE bottle, and then bought more.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> But after I rubbed a cotton ball over my entire face and neck with this toner, it felt very soft and cool.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this toner.</li>
            <li> I can see why it would be a great product for those with \\&quot;troubled skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It would be suitable for teenagers and twenty-somethings who are dealing with acne, but it&#x27;s not appropriate for a middle-aged person, or for those with</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone with oily or normal skin.</li>
            <li> Only issue is that it DOES dry out my oily skin, which then proceeds to just make more oil.</li>
            <li> My skin alternates between oily and dry depending on the time of year, but this toner completely evens that out and leaves my face feeling very fresh.</li>
            <li> I even bought a variety pack to share with my children, and other than the peppermint, they may as well be cheap smelling fruity concoctions.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is lower than the price at Whole Foods, which seems to be the only retail location still stocking this, so I will absolutely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I have oily but very (VERY) sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After applying it, my skin, especially on my cheeks started to feel hot, like they were on fire.</li>
            <li> It did not make my face dry, and left my skin feeling smooth, soft and tingly.</li>
            <li> I bought an extra one to work, and used it after lunch when my skin gets really oily and so far, it&#x27;s mitigated my development of pimples or enlarged pores.</li>
            <li> Before using this, my face was clear.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I have been washing my face more often lately and it IS winter</li>
            <li> I AM nearly 41...</li>
            <li> So far none of their products have worked for me including their Acne Toner &amp; Citrus Scrub.</li>
            <li> It really takes me back.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that breaks out</li>
            <li> Wow, someone recommended Burt Bee&#x27;s Rosewater Toner, so I tried it.</li>
            <li> I mean) which is a smell I love.</li>
            <li> so my face is pretty dry NOW</li>
            <li> It also smells really fresh, compared to other toners that smell like chemicals.</li>
            <li> toners for oily skin are more often named Astringents, they can be anything from a Which Hazel product to one with more complicated ingredients with a variety of things combined to tighten skin, close pores and break down oil and/or fight bacteria.</li>
            <li> I usually go for the hydrating toners and the refreshing facial mists.</li>
            <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees for nearly 18 years -- back when you could only find the product in very specialized health food stores.</li>
            <li> Burts Bees is my new facial skin care.</li>
            <li> was running low on my Radiance Day Cream, purchased a new jar,</li>
            <li> Since this product is almost all natural, I don&#x27;t have guilt about using it regularly.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this product, I always used a separate toner and zit cream on my early thirties acne prone face.</li>
            <li> I then got some sort of rash near my eye.&lt;br /&gt;The company medical line</li>
            <li> This toner will really pull the hidden dirt out of your pores.  </li>
            <li> But careful how much you use as it can dry your skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive pale skin and it keeps my face clear, non greasy and never dry.</li>
            <li> Good for him but bad for me.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard finding something just right</li>
            <li> My skin normally feels a bit tight after cleansing.</li>
            <li> My skin type is a little sensitive to this product, so I always follow with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It does have some alcohol in it, so might sting a little if you&#x27;re sensitive to that, but I don&#x27;t have any problems with it.</li>
            <li> So I use this every other day so as to not dry out my face</li>
            <li> so it is really hard for me to find things to treat my acne without causing a breakout, I paired it with the sensitive skin face wash and lotion and it has been a lifesaver!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for as long as I can remember and have no interest in using anything else</li>
            <li> My skin is both oily and dry</li>
            <li> dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have literally tried EVERYTHING for my face, i have had moderate to severe acne for 10+ years and this along with other burts bee&#x27;s products has done the trick!!  </li>
            <li> Love it and price isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> and then I would use a quality astringent toner to follow up and close the pores and assist in destroying any final traces of bacteria not vanquished by the cleanser.</li>
            <li> The Acne toner left a thick layer on my face and the scrub made my face itchy and red immediately.</li>
            <li> I have oily/combo skin with moderate acne breakouts, and its hard to find a product that cleans the skin but doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have tried dozens of toners and astringents, and I truly love this one the best!  It&#x27;s my very favorite and I hope Burt&#x27;s Bees never discontinues it because it&#x27;s a great product.  It really keeps my skin fresh and is really good at cleaning out the last traces of dirt and makeup from my face.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product; when my bottle accidentally broke I really missed it and ordered on on Amazon after my health food store stopped carrying it. It is gentle but very effective; it cleans the filmy residue from soap and the day&#x27;s dirt; also is a great mild way to clean up acne patches. It has a lovely garden smell of herbs, and the bottle is pretty, to boot! I won&#x27;t even try other toners because I hate the smell. Since this product is almost all natural, I don&#x27;t have guilt about using it regularly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a toner before because I wasnt sure what it was or that I even needed it. I was buying some of my usual skin products from Burts and Clinique on Amazon and saw this toner come up as a suggestion and decided to try it. My skin normally feels a bit tight after cleansing. But after I rubbed a cotton ball over my entire face and neck with this toner, it felt very soft and cool. It felt like I didn&#x27;t even need a moisturizer, but I apply Dermalogica with spf anyways to protect my skin. I think I have combination skin. It&#x27;s neither too oily, or too dry, so this toner works great for my skin. It looked as if it shrunk my pores as well. And it works great to remove any cleanser reside. My skin overall has just become more \\&quot;balanced\\&quot;. I&#x27;m very happy I decided to add this toner to my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve passed on this toner over and over at the store because I figured it was targeted specifically for oily or acneic skin only. Hence the line about \\&quot;for oily or troubled skin\\&quot; on the bottle. I usually go for the hydrating toners and the refreshing facial mists. NOT what this is. You will not even find a \\&quot;misting\\&quot; top to the bottle anywhere. It is more of a treatment product to apply via a cotton ball after cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SInce I had heard great reviews about it - Well ok, so I was also drawn to the cool looking bottle/minimalist packaging and I always secretly wondered if it actually smelled anything like a \\&quot;Garden Tomato\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I finally bought it and this is why I ended loving it and why I would buy it again:&lt;br /&gt;Most toners for oily skin are more often named Astringents, they can be anything from a Which Hazel product to one with more complicated ingredients with a variety of things combined to tighten skin, close pores and break down oil and/or fight bacteria. Although I primarily use the hydrating toners, there are times where I am giving facials to family or friends and doing extractions or doing extractions on myself, where I would cleanse again after and then I would use a quality astringent toner to follow up and close the pores and assist in destroying any final traces of bacteria not vanquished by the cleanser. This toner is perfect for that! I can see why it would be a great product for those with \\&quot;troubled skin\\&quot;. So while I do not use it as an everyday toner it has filled a void in my skin care product needs for that specific treatment product as a more astringent toner that is required on occasion. Yet is still not overly drying like some and with an 8 ounce bottle it lasts quite a while and is well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how it is able to acomplish it&#x27;s astringent properties but can still be called a toner by the addition of balancing and soothing ingredients like cucumber and green tea. It also comes in handy to cleanse and freshen the skin after working outside in the yard or coming in from a humid climate.  I also appreciate that the alcohol listed on the ingredients of my bottle says it is \\&quot;SD Alcohol (from yellow corn)\\&quot;. I prefer alcohol free toners but for an astringent products I am ok with some grain alcohol used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just for the record it does not smell like a tomato but does have a sort of fresh \\&quot;gardeny\\&quot; aroma that is unique and appealing.nse and freshen the skin after working outside in the yard or coming in from a humid climate.

            <li> Best facial toner I have ever used. Hands down. Smells wonderful. Does not smell like tomato. This has never stung my face before like a few other reviews mentioned. I have been using it for about a year and a half and have gone through one and a half bottles. The glass bottle is just very neat. I cannot say enough good things about this product. It actually makes my skin feel moisturised.</li>
            <li> Following it&#x27;s Good reputations&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Good quality&lt;br /&gt;I am Willing to purchase another one.&lt;br /&gt;Nice product&lt;br /&gt;Smell may not good for some people though</li>
            <li> Natural is best for my sensitive skin.. full of garden veggies. Smells great. Burts Bees is my new facial skin care.</li>
            <li> So fresh! Look forward to using it every day. Smells like a garden!</li>
            <li> My husband has had oily skin issues most of his life. He used this product for a number of years...and has since moved on to other Burt Bees Products. Good for him but bad for me. I want more glass bottles! LOL! byABPryor</li>
            <li> My skin is both oily and dry so it&#x27;s hard finding something just right for my face,&lt;br /&gt;I dont really use toner but since i kind of started getting blemishes on my face lately&lt;br /&gt;I thought I might give it a try...&lt;br /&gt;I have been washing my face more often lately and it IS winter so my face is pretty dry NOW&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to see how this product works fo rme in the summer cuz right now it&#x27;s WAY 2 drying,&lt;br /&gt;It feels like it tightens up my face prety bad &gt;_&amp;lt;</li>
            <li> I have used this toner for nearly 10 years... but recently purchased a new bottle and was shocked!! New users may NOT notice or care, but for we who have used it for years do!! I emailed the company. The new formula may as well be a bottle of isopropyl alcohol! BEWARE!! Your skin will burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi! I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees for nearly 18 years -- back when you could only find the product in very specialized health food stores. The first product I used was the Apricot Baby Oil for my then unborn baby. I was hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used products faithfully since then. I encouraged my mother to carry them in her store in NY. I used include them in packages where I made homemade diapers for friends. I couldn&#x27;t think of a more natural product that I trusted impeccably. I have advocated the products to many people and have made many convert! I have often given my co-workers the lip balm for Christmas, and this year... I couldn&#x27;t believe the variety of balms. I even bought a variety pack to share with my children, and other than the peppermint, they may as well be cheap smelling fruity concoctions. I have remained loyal and faithful until recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was running low on my Radiance Day Cream, purchased a new jar, the scent, texture and product is NOT the same. I purchased the Radience Eye cream... same thing... The real slap in the face was the Tomato toner which I discovered over 10 years ago... mild enough for my face. I swore by it. I switched from Este Lauder to exclusively Burt&#x27;s. Now it is overwhelming with an isopropyl alcohol scent and burns my skin. I can not tolerate it and have started breaking out from the products. I AM nearly 41... I shouldn&#x27;t be breaking out! Between these three products, I have have thrown away more than $50. Not to mention, jars now have plastic tops?? huh??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, to add insult to injury, I learned from a friend that Burt&#x27;s was taken over by Johnson and Johnson. That would explain a lot!! Is Burt&#x27;s Bees nolonger the amazing company that started in Raleigh, NC many years ago? I understand that popularity dictated larger production scale... but the recent changes seem more profit based rather than customer satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE explain the truth to what has happened to my tried and true products?!?! I am currently on the look out for face products that work with my skin as Burt&#x27;s is no longer the answer. Can I mail you back the products for a refund?? I no longer have the receipts... Why would I have kept them anyway? I trusted the product and have NEVER had to return a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you return to the original formulations, and please let me know when you do! I miss what this company stood for and the all natural good for me products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;++++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clorox owns Burt&#x27;s Bees now... :-(</li>
            <li> It cleans my face really well. After showering I would rub my face with this and I swear it look like I&#x27;ve never washed my face or something !</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite toner of all time. Not only does it smell amazing, it does the job. I love that the toner cleanses my face without irritation. It works so well even my boyfriend asked me to buy him a bottle. I bought an extra one to work, and used it after lunch when my skin gets really oily and so far, it&#x27;s mitigated my development of pimples or enlarged pores.</li>
            <li> I really hoped for this product to work considering it&#x27;s for &#x27;oily &amp; troubled skin&#x27;. I have oily, mild acne, combination skin. This broke me out bad. Before using this, my face was clear. It made my face more oily than before and I started getting cystic acne on my face! Gross. This toner leaves a layer on your face and it also burns. I will be returning this product. So far none of their products have worked for me including their Acne Toner &amp; Citrus Scrub. Both products caused bad reactions. The Acne toner left a thick layer on my face and the scrub made my face itchy and red immediately.</li>
            <li> Best toner on the market.</li>
            <li> This is a great toner. The scent is very earthy, and my skin feels smooth after using. My skin type is a little sensitive to this product, so I always follow with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel very clean and I saw a difference in pore size as well. It smells like a garden of tomatoes which I really love.  Love it and price isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I have the same routine. Every night after I wash my face, I tone and then moisturize. I would not switch to another toner. I am convinced this is the reason my 30 year old skin stays looking 21. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I consider myself a product connoisseur.  If a company has made it, I&#x27;ve tried it!  I have oily/combo skin with moderate acne breakouts, and its hard to find a product that cleans the skin but doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  This is one of the ONLY products that I have used the ENTIRE bottle, and then bought more.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that it has done a whole lot for my acne, but it definitely balances the PH of my skin and helps get rid of dead skin cells and redness.  I recommend this product to anyone, whether you have oily skin or not!  I even use it when my skin feels dry/tight (right after the shower) and it somehow helps restore some moisture and it helps my moisturizer soak in better.  LOVE this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It smells like the tomato plant, like being in the midst of someone&#x27;s tomato patch.  It makes me think of summer mornings back home when I would go outside and smell the garden warming up in the morning sun.  It really takes me back.  The other nice things about it are:  it takes excess oil off of your face and throat and it never leaves your skin feeling sticky, but just nice and clean and smooth.  Other toners leave your skin sticky, and I can&#x27;t stand that.</li>
            <li> Since my skin gets really oily in the summer, I need a stronger toner to keep things under control. Burt&#x27;s Bees Tomato toner works very well without being too drying. It smells like tomatoes on the vine (if you&#x27;ve ever grown tomatoes, you know the smell I mean) which is a smell I love. Very clean and fresh. If you have super-sensitive skin, this isn&#x27;t the toner for you, but I&#x27;m sure most oily skins can handle this with no problem. The price on Amazon is lower than the price at Whole Foods, which seems to be the only retail location still stocking this, so I will absolutely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this toner for about 15 years now. It smells super fresh, and works really nicely to tone my skin. It does have some alcohol in it, so might sting a little if you&#x27;re sensitive to that, but I don&#x27;t have any problems with it. I also kind of love the frosted glass bottle that it comes in.</li>
            <li> Love all burt&#x27;s bees products great toner does not leave your skin dry and very refreshing. I have been using this product for as long as I can remember and have no interest in using anything else</li>
            <li> has done wonders with my skin</li>
            <li> This was the FIRST toner I&#x27;ve ever used. As I&#x27;m turning 31 and have been tanning off and on since I was 15. And though my skin still looks pretty darn tootin&#x27; great. I thought it best time to reeeeally start looking into some good, &amp;#34;legit&amp;#34;?skin care products. This is not one of them. 😒 I have oily skin thats prone to semi break-outs. I used this for a week and WOULDN&#x27;T ya guess it...I broke out. Bummerrrr. The smell was SO yummy (like garden tomatos). But, it just was not meant to be. Basically, if you have skin easily prone to break-outs? Don&#x27;t bother. 👎🏻</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE CYSTIC ACNE! DONT DO IT!! IDK HOW IT WORKS FOR SOME OF YOU GUYS BUT IT BROKE ME PUT SO BADLY! I MEAN NODULES ALL OVER OVER FOREHEAD AND JUST UGH! MADE MY AKIN SO NASTY AND OILY ALSO! JUST DONT BUY THIS! I LEARNED THE HARD WAY!</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, and seems to help with my breakouts. Only issue is that it DOES dry out my oily skin, which then proceeds to just make more oil. I moisturize thoroughly after using this, and that seems to help.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter to use with the hydration lotion &amp; cleanser. She loves it! She says that smell is very, very light.</li>
            <li> Buyers might want to know that this is *much* stronger than the rosewater toner; this is more of an astringent. It would be suitable for teenagers and twenty-somethings who are dealing with acne, but it&#x27;s not appropriate for a middle-aged person, or for those with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the scent--despite being tomato-based--has a sort of floral quality. It&#x27;s too &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years, I have not been able to find it in stores and thrilled that amazon has it.</li>
            <li> This toner is great at clearing up your face. It leaves your face hydrated and dewy. You must try this product once.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toner for years and it is amazing! I would never try another toner as this is a 10. I have sensitive pale skin and it keeps my face clear, non greasy and never dry. Honestly, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it...</li>
            <li> This toner is excellent for oily and disturbed skin. It dries out all the oil and makes your face dry, smooth and super clear. Love it!</li>
            <li> Nice mild smell (does not smell like tomatoes). Burt&#x27;s Bees products are pleasant to use and make my skin feel so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Quality not as good as it was years ago. And this had a strong fragrant that smells perfume like. I want a more herb scent.</li>
            <li> Helps get out the dirt that soap doesn&#x27;t. Smoother and clearer skin.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely toner that does not sting and it very refreshing. Also it has a plesant tomato plant like smell.</li>
            <li> I used a sample someone gave me; I really liked Burt&#x27;s Bees Toner, Garden Tomato, especially the smell. I use it at night after washing off makeup and again in the morning before applying makeup...takes off that last layer that washing didn&#x27;t get.  Just make sure that the shipping costs are cheap (one time, the shipping cost me almost as much as the toner!)</li>
            <li> i have literally tried EVERYTHING for my face, i have had moderate to severe acne for 10+ years and this along with other burts bee&#x27;s products has done the trick!!  I have sensitive skin that breaks out so it is really hard for me to find things to treat my acne without causing a breakout, I paired it with the sensitive skin face wash and lotion and it has been a lifesaver!!!</li>
            <li> I really do like Burt&#x27;s Bees tomato toner. It smells delightful &amp; feels really good over my face. Sadly lycopene does nothing for my acne. I had porcelain skin until a couple of years ago and I thought something with tomato derivatives would help. Nope. This tomato toner is not overly drying at all though, and it does the job of cleaning as it should. It&#x27;s not an aid against acne. Neither is their acne line toner, sad to say.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again &amp; again if it weren&#x27;t for the company being owned by Clorox. Any company owned by a poisonous corporation automatically loses my trust, and my purchasing power. Burt&#x27;s Bees doesn&#x27;t test on animals, but Clorox does, and if you fund Burt, well, you get the picture.&lt;br /&gt;And buy on Amazon or ebay or any other site that ISN&#x27;T the Burt&#x27;s Bees shop site. I turned to Amazon because of a TERRIBLE experience with the Burt&#x27;s Bees website in which I had to contact Clorox customer service directly to find out wth happened to my shipment, etc. Buyer beware! choose Amazon! :o)</li>
            <li> Hard to find product, happy to have found it. Great price but has more alcohol in it than I remember when I used it previously. I remember it smelling like the top of a tomato right after pulling it from the vine, and that smell is still there, but it comes with a huge amount of alcohol now.</li>
            <li> This is my first attempt at using a toner, so not sure what to compare this to. So far so good. I can feel a difference and my face is much smoother. I have to shave everyday for my job and my face starting to get raw.  So I use this every other day so as to not dry out my face and it has made a big difference. Might take a bit getting used to the smell of the tomato, but it feels very cool after application.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this product, I always used a separate toner and zit cream on my early thirties acne prone face. However, I found that if I wash my face and then use this toner, it eliminates the need for an additional acne treatment. I would warn though that my boyfriend says that my skin smells like Raid when I use it, so I only use it at night before I go to bed. But smelling like Raid is worth it for the clear skin.</li>
            <li> i have oily, combination skin and when i first used the toner the oiliness of my skin lessened. Unfortunately the toner started make my skin break out a bit on my t zone. This toner has a nice smell but it just doesn&#x27;t work well for my skin.</li>
            <li> This actually works for clearing up acne. My skin has improved in look and feel, I&#x27;m very happy with this toner. It also smells really fresh, compared to other toners that smell like chemicals.</li>
            <li> This product dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> Wow, someone recommended Burt Bee&#x27;s Rosewater Toner, so I tried it. I LOVE it. I never got one zit using it. Currently, I ran out of it, so I&#x27;m using a toner that I&#x27;ve had under my sink...and it doesn&#x27;t even compare to Burt Bee&#x27;s Rosewater Toner! I&#x27;ve gotten pimples using it! The only concern I have is...my health food store no longer carries it, and I asked them why not, and they said it&#x27;s because Chlorox now owns them! So now I have to research this because I&#x27;m into products that don&#x27;t have harmful ingredients (I buy organic when possible)...so I&#x27;m not sure I like the idea of Chlorox owning Burt&#x27;s Bees. But aside from that, I really love this toner...since my store no longer carries it, I have to buy mine online....</li>
            <li> I had used rubbing alcohol or witch hazel for years, and before that I used a number of other brands that would always make my face tingle or burn. After using this, I&#x27;ll not use another brand than Burt&#x27;s Bees again. It&#x27;s 100% natural, gentle, doesn&#x27;t sting or burn, and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t really noticed any smell from the toner. But then again, I didn&#x27;t buy this for the scent. I bought it because my skin tends to be a oily, and I didn&#x27;t want anymore of the drying out of harsh chemicals or alcohol, and the witch hazel wasn&#x27;t working as well as I&#x27;d hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my face, I dab a little on a cotton ball and swirl all over my face and neck. It&#x27;s a very refreshing feeling! I have noticed that my pores were cleaner, and my face felt cleaner and healthier after I used this the very first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now using a whole Burt&#x27;s Bees regimen night &amp; day, and I&#x27;ve loving my skin again!</li>
            <li> I found it to be very drying for my skin. The cap was broken upon arrival. It had a very strong alcohol smell. Discontinued use.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I do still use my regular Bioré cleanser, but this toner is my favorite by far. It does have a slight sting to it if my face has a few breakouts, but it leaves my skin feeling clean afterward.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone having a problem with acne, blackheads, etc.  Takes just a very small amount on a cotton ball so it lasts a long time and works great !!</li>
            <li> This is a great toner which me and my husband both love. I love the smell and it works perfectly. It&#x27;s never been too harsh. My husband has oily skin and mine is very dry, but this toner works nicely for us both.</li>
            <li> All it does is burn my skin and make it alot more oily which is what I do not want.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product I bought while out of town and have not been able to find locally. I have combo/oily skin and this is great for following up cleansing on days I have exercised or just had a really long day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this product for YEARS but it&#x27;s hard to get at the store now.  The scent is absolute heaven!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the freshness that this product makes my face feel and how it cleans my face deeper.</li>
            <li> This is the best toner I have ever used on my oily and acne prone yet sensitive skin.  It leaves my skin feeling fresh and truly clean, without any left over residue.  The best part is that it is pH balanced and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry or feeling \\&quot;tight\\&quot;.  I love this product...to bad it took me 30+ years to find it!</li>
            <li> My favorite toner--gentle and effective</li>
            <li> I have used all types of toners in the past and this one by far is the best. It&#x27;s so natural and potent all at the same time. It cleans off all extra residue left over after washing your face. I highly recommended this toner.</li>
            <li> I had great luck with the rosewater toner and thought I&#x27;d try the tomato line because of my combination/sometimes acne prone skin. The first time I used it I realized I had made a bad choice. I applied with cotton balls and did not go over the same area more than twice. After applying it, my skin, especially on my cheeks started to feel hot, like they were on fire. I then got some sort of rash near my eye.&lt;br /&gt;The company medical line was nice enough. They took notes on it, but told me I should see a doctor. I don&#x27;t have insurance and they said they would not cover a visit. So, instead I got some stuff from the pharmacy that the pharmacist recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company sent me a shipping label and said they would send a replacement for the toner, since I was fine with the rosewater toner. I&#x27;ve been waiting about a month and not holding my breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burts is a good line, but if you have sensitive skin, stay away from this stuff and stick to rosewater toner.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone with problematic skin! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I figure it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try all products needed for the face and I was right. Feels great on the face and i can&#x27;t wait for the hot summer days to bring the feeling of freshness to my face.. .</li>
            <li> when I could no longer afford Clinique Facial toner, I tried several options, the Tomato Toner is hands down the best  leaves me feeling clean  Problem: because it comes in a glass container, more and more stores no longer carry it</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for years and still love it! Great for acne. But careful how much you use as it can dry your skin.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this and the way it makes my skin feel - I use it both in the morning and at bedtime.  The best toner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> This toner will really pull the hidden dirt out of your pores.  Be careful because it can sting on sensitive skin.  I did experience some redness while applying sometimes but it went away immediately.  My face really felt clean after use.</li>
            <li> My skin alternates between oily and dry depending on the time of year, but this toner completely evens that out and leaves my face feeling very fresh. I use this in the morning and the rosewater toner at night.</li>
            <li> This toner is the best I have used and I have used a lot.  It helps control my oily skin and really makes it feel clean.</li>
            <li> The worst toner I have ever bought. The alcohol smell is too strong to use. Never buy it again! It would hurt skin!</li>
            <li> I swear I have never used a brand of face toner a bottle after another. I have used Burts Bee for years and I love the smell. It feels clean after I apply it. I don&#x27;t mind a little bit of alcohol if the product works on my skin. Tried many brands like Estee Lauder, Shishedo, Neutrogena, Clean and Clear, Ponds, etc but didn&#x27;t feel clean or refresh. I have large pores and my T zone is oily. I cannot say Burts Bee Garden Tomato stops the shine but it slows it down. My T zone will be super shine if I forget to apply this toner or switch to another brand.</li>
            <li> I have oily but very (VERY) sensitive skin. I am allergic and/or highly reactive to most skin and hair care products. My skin often turns red and burns. I bought this toner at the store, but was hesitant to try it without research, because of my sensitivities. I was dismayed to see a few terrible reviews recently. However, i decided to try on the back of my hand. This toner felt and smelled amazing! It was cool, slightly tingly, smooth, soft, and best of all, no reaction. Today, i tried on my face, and am so pleased. It did a great job getting oil off my face, making my skin and large pores look smoother. It did not make my face dry, and left my skin feeling smooth, soft and tingly. It was more expensive than other toners i&#x27;ve tried but its the best I&#x27;ve tried. My skin still feel great after four hours, even under make up. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I recently tried the Tomato Toner out.  I really like this product a lot.  I would recommend it to anyone with oily or normal skin.</li>
