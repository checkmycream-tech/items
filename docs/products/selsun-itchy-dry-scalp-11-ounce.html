    <ol>
            <li>These are the best prices.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the results!</li>
            <li>The stuff smells great too, not like the head and shoulders medicated shampoo.</li>
            <li>I worked great for awhile.</li>
            <li>so you know if you are getting a good price or not.  </li>
            <li>I read the good reviews about this product</li>
            <li>This works great make sure you dont use it every day read instruction before using.</li>
            <li>its ok I guesss</li>
            <li>Love the product but the shipper should have taped the lid shut because when I opened the box I found that a lot of the contents had exploded out.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying this anymore for sure.</li>
            <li>Immediately, I realized that it wasn&#x27;t going to work better than Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li>It made my hair more oily and my scalp more itchy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m critter free! </li>
            <li>Does a pretty good job cleansing my scalp.</li>
            <li>It felt like I just used a cheap shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Is there an add that is really true?</li>
            <li>will buy again for the price.. not bad.</li>
            <li>My hair looks fresh and rich.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great in that the smell is much less potent cough drop like than the original, actually almost pleasant, but the shampoo itself also seems less effective in managing a dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>You try it, maybe it&#x27;ll be right for you.</li>
            <li>If you download the amazon app it has a feature in the search section of the app where you can scan the barcode of any item at a store and it will tell you how much it costs on amazon</li>
            <li>The itchiness was so intense, I felt like I had critters living in my scalp.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really help with the dandruff, although it was decent for the flaking.</li>
            <li>At first the clear liquid gives you the feeling that this may&lt;br /&gt;be</li>
            <li>I used this particular version from Selsun once before.</li>
            <li>I had tried many $4 anti dandruff shampoos and they all required daily use, but they never really helped at all with my dandruff problem.</li>
            <li>I worked so hard to get it healthy</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s old ways.</li>
            <li>but the problem is that it had made me LOSE so much hair and not only that</li>
            <li>It may work, just check carefully before you buy if you&#x27;re looking for a particular ingredient!</li>
            <li>Before that shampoo I used Selsun Blue Naturals (clear).</li>
            <li>I also bought a new shampoo and am presently trying it out but still have the Selsun Blue as a back up.</li>
            <li>This is a 21 year old male college student with short wavy hair.</li>

            <li> \\&quot;Real\\&quot; Selsun Blue contains selenium sulfide as the active ingredient.  </li>

            <li> We usually use Selsun medicated with the red label/cap</li>
            <li> With Head and Shoulders I could wash my hair every other day but with this product I had to wash my hair everyday because of the intense itching and crazy amount of flakes.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great-as promised</li>
            <li> At first the clear liquid gives you the feeling that this may&lt;br /&gt;be a product that works. Maybe it does and maybe it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;For me the use of this product produced no positive results and&lt;br /&gt;no negatives either. You try it, maybe it&#x27;ll be right for you. You&lt;br /&gt;never know!</li>
            <li> These are the best prices.  I check walmart, cvs and safeway.  If you download the amazon app it has a feature in the search section of the app where you can scan the barcode of any item at a store and it will tell you how much it costs on amazon so you know if you are getting a good price or not.  I use this on large purchases but also have found that I can save a ton on even these small items.

            <li> Does a pretty good job cleansing my scalp.</li>
            <li> I bleach my hair, so my scalp gets dry and itchy.  This helped provide relief.</li>
            <li> not what I expected  but its ok I guesss</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great in that the smell is much less potent cough drop like than the original, actually almost pleasant, but the shampoo itself also seems less effective in managing a dry scalp.  I&#x27;d rather have the smell and have my shampoo do its job...</li>
            <li> The itch still continues.  I&#x27;m going to have to see a dermatologist. Is there an add that is really true?</li>
            <li> Love the product but the shipper should have taped the lid shut because when I opened the box I found that a lot of the contents had exploded out.</li>
            <li> We usually use Selsun medicated with the red label/cap but I couldn&#x27;t find it this time. This does not compare. It didn&#x27;t really help with the dandruff, although it was decent for the flaking.</li>
            <li> I had tried many $4 anti dandruff shampoos and they all required daily use, but they never really helped at all with my dandruff problem. I decided to try something more expensive. The day after I used this shampoo, it showed instant results. My hair wasn&#x27;t dry like it used to, and if I were to voluntarily scratch my head, no flakes at all fell out. My hair looks fresh and rich. The stuff smells great too, not like the head and shoulders medicated shampoo. This is a 21 year old male college student with short wavy hair. Definitely recommend this for the dry harsh winter time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT/UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;After about 3 months of use, the product did its job. I switched to regular Head and Shoulders now. For the harsh dry winter time, I recommend using the Selsun Blue once a month. It doesnt seem required daily use.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Real\\&quot; Selsun Blue contains selenium sulfide as the active ingredient.  This Selsun Blue product contains pyrithione zinc (typically used in Head and Shoulders).  It may work, just check carefully before you buy if you&#x27;re looking for a particular ingredient!</li>
            <li> I used this particular version from Selsun once before. I worked great for awhile. But you need to rotate your anti-dandruff shampoos to keep ahead of the fungi which adapt and evolve. I&#x27;ll use this bottle and then use anonther type - perhaps the one with selenium sulfide. Then I&#x27;ll come back to this one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo in the hopes that it would help my itchy scalp and dandruff. While it takes care of the itchy scalp, it does nothing for my dandruff. Like another reviewer stated, I lose a lot of hair when using this shampoo. The worst part is, my hair is SO DRY. I worked so hard to get it healthy and it is back to it&#x27;s old ways. I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Got this to bathe my dog with because she has skin issues. I&#x27;m very happy with the results! After just one bath, her large flakes reduced at least 95%.</li>
            <li> It did not help me to get rid of dandruff. On the contrary, it came back as a powder-like flaking. I used the shampoo on the daily basis for two weeks and I had dandruff recurrence 2-3 hours after the shower. it was disappointing experience. Before that shampoo I used Selsun Blue Naturals (clear). It worked. I guess pyrithione zinc does not work for me.</li>
            <li> For the past 3 1/2 years I have been having a problem with itchy scalp on the bottom part of my scalp. I read the good reviews about this product so I bought it and gave it a try. I have noticed that it has reduced my itchiness but the problem is that it had made me LOSE so much hair and not only that, it makes me hair staticky! Everyday when I brush my hair tons and tons fall out. I think the worst part is how frizzy and staticky it has made my hair. I won&#x27;t be buying this anymore for sure.</li>
            <li> I also bought a new shampoo and am presently trying it out but still have the Selsun Blue as a back up.</li>
            <li> This works great make sure you dont use it every day read instruction before using. will buy again for the price.. not bad.</li>
            <li> I did not fell like my hair had any conditioner in it. It felt like I just used a cheap shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The itch did not stop. I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Crap. I&#x27;m So disappointed in this product. Immediately, I realized that it wasn&#x27;t going to work better than Head and Shoulders. I used this for a month and the flakes appeared to grow in size and numbers as the days went on! It made my hair more oily and my scalp more itchy. The itchiness was so intense, I felt like I had critters living in my scalp. With Head and Shoulders I could wash my hair every other day but with this product I had to wash my hair everyday because of the intense itching and crazy amount of flakes. After reading the reviews I ordered two bottles. I chose the auto refill delivery after placing the first order, so now I have 2 more bottles of this crap. Ugh. I&#x27;m such an idiot! Definitely switching back to Head and Shoulders. It&#x27;s cheaper and actually works instead of making your problem worse!  P.s. I had my scalp checked and I&#x27;m critter free! </li>
