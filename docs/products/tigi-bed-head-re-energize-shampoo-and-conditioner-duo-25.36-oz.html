            <li>A great product.</li>

            <li>This shampoo &amp; conditioner is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Smells amazing!  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner, makes the hair feel wonderful.</li>
            <li>and I loved the way it made my hair feel, and kept the fly aways away.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just pleasantly there</li>
            <li>Worth the price!!!!</li>
            <li>The conditioner is absolutely perfect for fine, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo works well, smells good and was a good price.</li>
            <li>Good stuff</li>
            <li>it was as good as all the comments.</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s a good price in consideration to its size.</li>
            <li>That didn&#x27;t do me any good.</li>
            <li>how silky smooth it feels and how wonderful it smells.</li>
            <li>After you use a shampoo/conditioner for a while, it&#x27;s good to mix it up; your hair gets used to the formula.  </li>
            <li>I have relaxed hair and is good for weekly conditioning for women who work out 3 days a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this product 3 times off Amazon now and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>

            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>but it is so much better than that!  </li>
            <li>Very good and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>And it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>The scent of this set is amazing</li>
            <li>, it is handy having the pump to get the shampoo and conditioner out, instead of squeazing bottles.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s has kind of an appley type smell to it</li>
            <li>Nice smell but</li>
            <li>and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>Re-Energize adds shine, and makes my straight hair look healthy and somewhat fuller, so, perfect for my uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all its a good shampoo that smells really good and is worth the deal.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers nicely and leaves hair shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>By far this shampoo and conditioner are the best products I have found for my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and it looks great too!!</li>
            <li>It must be good stuff because they very rarely agree on anything these days.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love it!</li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Very light weight shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner smell great and the large container with the pumps are convenient.  </li>
            <li>It smells okay.</li>
            <li>Level 2 smells better though.</li>
            <li>Love Bed Head products</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>Shampoo is so specific to hair type, but for my hair it&#x27;s perfect, so it&#x27;s a 5 star for the shampoo and conditioner, but a 2 star for the delivery of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need a lot of conditioning, and use conditioner more for shine than for &amp;#34;healthy hair&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>so I have a lot of static issues.</li>
            <li>With this shampoo and conditioner I don&#x27;t have static issues..</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this shampoo a lot, and it stays with you throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Most salon prices are about $25 for both shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>Love the brand!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because I haven&#x27;t had great results with salon products before, but this shampoo and conditioner has knocked all of my preconceptions on the floor.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>love it love all bed head products.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite from this company</li>
            <li>but maybe it will work better for you.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>does all that is says it does and more.</li>
            <li>I love it . .  </li>
            <li>Thanks for another great deal.</li>
            <li>Product came yesterday and the shampoo top is busted.  </li>
            <li>I love the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Just to give you a warning, it&#x27;s a flip top now.</li>
            <li>It works very well and smells great.</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo and conditioner</li>

            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>and I have no split ends.  :-)</li>
            <li>and I think it looks pretty healthy considering :P</li>
            <li>And i have so many brand of shampoo and condition.  </li>
            <li>Love Love Love the product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Since using this conditioner my hair has never been better.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love the smell....</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I will order more.</li>
            <li>I love BEDHEAD</li>
            <li>The scent is not overpowering but has a nice, clean smell.</li>
            <li>This is great for my normal hair.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good.</li>
            <li>great hair product, I have tried all brands and this by far is the best, especially for colored hair</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo smells great and leave my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>Leaves that clean feeling!</li>
            <li>Concentrated shampoo provides lots of foam and a pleasant clean fragrance, conditioner is light and rinses easily, leaves hair soft and manageable, good value</li>
            <li>it leave my hair soft and smell great</li>
            <li>It smells tropical, fruity, and fresh, kind of like coconut and maybe banana?</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, Great price</li>
            <li>Great for my (wavy hispanic) hair texture, not too smelly/perfumed, and the size makes it a great value and keeps me from constantly having to buy new shampoo.</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price around, and it&#x27;s only worth buying if you get it here.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s usually AMAZING the first two washes.</li>
            <li>It arrived less than a week after I ordered it and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Overall pretty happy!</li>
            <li>Found this  product very useful and good product for normal hair.</li>
            <li>It felt soft and clean!!!</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner work well without the huge price tag</li>
            <li>I only wash my hair every 2-3 days and this product smells great and doesn&#x27;t make my hair too oily.  </li>
            <li>but my hair didn&#x27;t feel as smooth or sleek.</li>
            <li>the quality and end results are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Product is great, but the pump on the shampoo took a lot of prying to open</li>
            <li>Fantastic shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and is not too heavy on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, works well, noticed much more volume since using this daily</li>
            <li>It genuinely does make a significant difference in how it dries.</li>
            <li>It really smells great and gives your hair a new life.</li>
            <li>I originally got this shampoo and conditioner from a salon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hair product snob but found this lower-priced shampoo/conditioner originally at Walmart and JCP.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty healthy</li>
            <li>Good shampoo and better then I expected.</li>
            <li>The price for these huge bottles is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>Love this product so much, that I will continue purchasing it.</li>
            <li>The caps on each bottle came broken and most of the product leaked all over inside the package - great product but could have been packed much better.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner so much.</li>
            <li>I was about ready to shave my head when my stylist mentioned that I love my hair after she washes it.</li>
            <li>Love it so much.</li>
            <li>First time I tried this was at Wild Orchids Salon, it smelt so good</li>
            <li>Fresh, clean feeling and scent.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair soft and it really smells good, BUT the conditioner does almost nothing to my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get a ton of tangles, but my hair isn&#x27;t super shiny and brushable out of the shower either.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell, love the way it gives shine to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for a daily shower.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo and conditioner not heavy or sticky feeling after use leaves hair shiny and soft</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s not fancy, but not cheap, this is perfect for those of you with plain ol&#x27; hair that just needs a good washing.</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair look more lively.</li>
            <li>I am also impressed with the size of the bottles - they should last a long time.</li>
            <li>Diffuses easily so you don&#x27;t have to use much product.</li>
            <li>I am left with so many tangles!</li>
            <li>I just used this for the first time and I can&#x27;t wait to use it again and again!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used TIGI products before and have been impressed (espsecially with their Rockaholic dry shampoo), but I think the quality of the Re-energize set hovers somewhere between a generic shampoo (like Garnier or Tresemme) and a nicer, higher-brand one (like Redken).  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is stick straight</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Great for an everyday shampoo</li>
            <li>I can only use this every couple of washes because it it too drying for constant use, but it is great to keep your hair free of product and conditioner buildup.</li>
            <li>This product is great for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>love how soft it makes my hair.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It smells divine and left my hair soft and happy.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, soft and looks healthy.  </li>
            <li>After using this product even one time my hair was incredibly soft and looked healthy again.</li>
            <li>Good stuff... would try other Bed Head varieties.</li>
            <li>Smells good, doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily like other shampoos have.</li>
            <li>Everythin all right.</li>
            <li>Came right on time.</li>
            <li>But this is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>I love having the big dispensers .</li>
            <li>Product is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent of the urban antidotes series.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years (on and off) and I always end up back with it.</li>
            <li>Arrived in the time frame promised and the product was exactly as promised, as well.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much softer and manageable with this stuff!</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>straight to my home!</li>
            <li>The conditioner isn&#x27;t too heavy and it smells good.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this set - it lasts me around 8 months (I have slightly shorter hair) and seems to do a very good job.</li>
            <li>I like tigi bedhead, but  I like the red bottle pomegranate version much better, this just doesn&#x27;t have as appealing of a scent as the other I had purchased before,  </li>
            <li>The conditioner seems to be well absorbed into the ends of my hair and leaves it very soft.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is fine, but the conditioner is just gross.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too much of anything that might need fixing.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re much cheaper online than in the stores.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Thanks 👍😀</li>
            <li>Considering you&#x27;re getting 2 liter bottles of shampoo and conditioner with pumps, you really can&#x27;t complain for the cost.  </li>
            <li>I really like this and have even turned my sister onto it.</li>
            <li>These bottles are too big to use comfortably without the pump.  </li>
            <li>Really gets buildup out of your hair.</li>
            <li>I have very curly, frizzy, and colored hair.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair silky soft and never oily!!!</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair smelling so fresh and easy to style it!&lt;br /&gt;Had a small issue with shipment, but seller took care of the problem right</li>
            <li>I have straight hair that with other shampoos gets greasy at the roots, but this shampoo is awesome and it allows me to only shampoo every other day or so.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s surprising how hard it is to find shampoo and conditioner for normal hair.</li>
            <li>This is hands down, my absolute favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>You will love your soft silky hair ; not greasy or dry .</li>
            <li>The shampoo really dries my hair out, which is fine because it becomes oily easily, but it makes my hair pretty dry and fluffy...</li>
            <li>Always get better pricing on amazon than any other place i&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a great combo set that is high quality at a low price.</li>
            <li>I had some pumps from a previous set that I was able to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still be buying from Tigi again, but I would not recommend this particular product.</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft but doesn&#x27;t have much volume.  </li>
            <li>for the delivery, the shampoo top was not on tight and so some of the shampoo leaked out.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Spendy in a small bottle, so I like the large 64 oz size for a better value.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft and moisturizer really works.</li>
            <li>Most shampoos leave my hair scratchy like straw, and the conditioners make it oily and limp.</li>
            <li>It claims to be for normal hair</li>
            <li>The shampoo cleans very well and the conditioner is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li>I love that I only need less than a dime-size dollop for my whole head!  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo because once you wash and dry your hair, your style stays for the next day.</li>
            <li>I tend to try new hair products often</li>
            <li>Prone to a dry scalp and dandruff, the shampoo is a mild alternative that does not create problems.  </li>
            <li>Shampoo leaves my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>I ordered two pairs, maybe it will be the same after I use the first pair up.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair shine and soft!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The large bottles usually last me just over two months.</li>
            <li>it makes my normally frizzy thick hair very soft and shiny and easy to style.</li>
            <li>This set made my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>I really cant tell a difference between the different shampoos though</li>
            <li>This shampoo definitely gave my thin/flat hair a bit of volume but didn&#x27;t give my hair as much of a shine as I hoped.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and shiny and I always get compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair frequently</li>
            <li>and my hair has been so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It really did as it said and brought my hair back to life!</li>
            <li>The conditioner makes my thick hair, which often tangles, easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>there was a little bit of leakage coming from the pump on top of the container, but I suppose that is expected especially since it traveled far to be with me</li>
            <li>I am sad though that they no longer come with pumps, glad I kept mine!</li>
            <li>No other hair product compares.</li>
            <li>and I noticed it right when I squeezed the shampoo out of the little pouch.</li>
            <li>no where near as much as the previous version I have bought.</li>
            <li>Like I said, normally after the first two, my hair starts to feel a little dry.</li>
            <li>I waited a little bit to post this review since it would be my first time using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have long, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this product many times, I LOVE how it works in my hair, but I am disappointed that they took away the pumps (which is why I knocked it down a star).</li>
            <li>If it isn&#x27;t the real deal\watered down like, do not send it out??</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not especially dry, or oily.</li>
            <li>My hair is thin, fine, and naturally blonde.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I loved the way it made my hair feel, and kept the fly aways away.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just pleasantly there</li>
            <li> Worth the price!!!!</li>
            <li> The conditioner is absolutely perfect for fine, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo works well, smells good and was a good price.</li>
            <li> Good stuff</li>
            <li> it was as good as all the comments.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s a good price in consideration to its size.</li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t do me any good.</li>
            <li> how silky smooth it feels and how wonderful it smells.</li>
            <li> After you use a shampoo/conditioner for a while, it&#x27;s good to mix it up; your hair gets used to the formula.  </li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and is good for weekly conditioning for women who work out 3 days a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product 3 times off Amazon now and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> but it is so much better than that!  </li>
            <li> Very good and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> And it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> The scent of this set is amazing</li>
            <li> , it is handy having the pump to get the shampoo and conditioner out, instead of squeazing bottles.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s has kind of an appley type smell to it</li>
            <li> Nice smell but</li>
            <li> and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Re-Energize adds shine, and makes my straight hair look healthy and somewhat fuller, so, perfect for my uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All in all its a good shampoo that smells really good and is worth the deal.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers nicely and leaves hair shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> By far this shampoo and conditioner are the best products I have found for my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and it looks great too!!</li>
            <li> It must be good stuff because they very rarely agree on anything these days.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love it!</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Very light weight shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner smell great and the large container with the pumps are convenient.  </li>
            <li> It smells okay.</li>
            <li> Level 2 smells better though.</li>
            <li> Love Bed Head products</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is so specific to hair type, but for my hair it&#x27;s perfect, so it&#x27;s a 5 star for the shampoo and conditioner, but a 2 star for the delivery of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need a lot of conditioning, and use conditioner more for shine than for &amp;#34;healthy hair&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> so I have a lot of static issues.</li>
            <li> With this shampoo and conditioner I don&#x27;t have static issues..</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo a lot, and it stays with you throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Most salon prices are about $25 for both shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Love the brand!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because I haven&#x27;t had great results with salon products before, but this shampoo and conditioner has knocked all of my preconceptions on the floor.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> love it love all bed head products.  </li>
            <li> Not my favorite from this company</li>
            <li> but maybe it will work better for you.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> does all that is says it does and more.</li>
            <li> I love it . .  </li>
            <li> Thanks for another great deal.</li>
            <li> Product came yesterday and the shampoo top is busted.  </li>
            <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Just to give you a warning, it&#x27;s a flip top now.</li>

            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I will order more.</li>
            <li> I love BEDHEAD</li>
            <li> The scent is not overpowering but has a nice, clean smell.</li>
            <li> This is great for my normal hair.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good.</li>
            <li> great hair product, I have tried all brands and this by far is the best, especially for colored hair</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo smells great and leave my hair soft.  </li>
            <li> Leaves that clean feeling!</li>
            <li> Concentrated shampoo provides lots of foam and a pleasant clean fragrance, conditioner is light and rinses easily, leaves hair soft and manageable, good value</li>
            <li> it leave my hair soft and smell great</li>
            <li> It smells tropical, fruity, and fresh, kind of like coconut and maybe banana?</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, Great price</li>
            <li> Great for my (wavy hispanic) hair texture, not too smelly/perfumed, and the size makes it a great value and keeps me from constantly having to buy new shampoo.</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price around, and it&#x27;s only worth buying if you get it here.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s usually AMAZING the first two washes.</li>
            <li> It arrived less than a week after I ordered it and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Overall pretty happy!</li>
            <li> Found this  product very useful and good product for normal hair.</li>
            <li> It felt soft and clean!!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner work well without the huge price tag</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair every 2-3 days and this product smells great and doesn&#x27;t make my hair too oily.  </li>
            <li> but my hair didn&#x27;t feel as smooth or sleek.</li>
            <li> the quality and end results are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Product is great, but the pump on the shampoo took a lot of prying to open</li>
            <li> Fantastic shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and is not too heavy on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, works well, noticed much more volume since using this daily</li>
            <li> It genuinely does make a significant difference in how it dries.</li>
            <li> It really smells great and gives your hair a new life.</li>
            <li> I originally got this shampoo and conditioner from a salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hair product snob but found this lower-priced shampoo/conditioner originally at Walmart and JCP.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty healthy</li>
            <li> Good shampoo and better then I expected.</li>
            <li> The price for these huge bottles is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this product so much, that I will continue purchasing it.</li>
            <li> The caps on each bottle came broken and most of the product leaked all over inside the package - great product but could have been packed much better.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner so much.</li>
            <li> I was about ready to shave my head when my stylist mentioned that I love my hair after she washes it.</li>
            <li> Love it so much.</li>
            <li> First time I tried this was at Wild Orchids Salon, it smelt so good</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean feeling and scent.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair soft and it really smells good, BUT the conditioner does almost nothing to my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get a ton of tangles, but my hair isn&#x27;t super shiny and brushable out of the shower either.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell, love the way it gives shine to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for a daily shower.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner not heavy or sticky feeling after use leaves hair shiny and soft</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s not fancy, but not cheap, this is perfect for those of you with plain ol&#x27; hair that just needs a good washing.</li>
            <li> It also makes my hair look more lively.</li>
            <li> I am also impressed with the size of the bottles - they should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Diffuses easily so you don&#x27;t have to use much product.</li>
            <li> I am left with so many tangles!</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time and I can&#x27;t wait to use it again and again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used TIGI products before and have been impressed (espsecially with their Rockaholic dry shampoo), but I think the quality of the Re-energize set hovers somewhere between a generic shampoo (like Garnier or Tresemme) and a nicer, higher-brand one (like Redken).  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is stick straight</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Great for an everyday shampoo</li>
            <li> I can only use this every couple of washes because it it too drying for constant use, but it is great to keep your hair free of product and conditioner buildup.</li>
            <li> This product is great for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> love how soft it makes my hair.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It smells divine and left my hair soft and happy.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, soft and looks healthy.  </li>
            <li> After using this product even one time my hair was incredibly soft and looked healthy again.</li>
            <li> Good stuff... would try other Bed Head varieties.</li>
            <li> Smells good, doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily like other shampoos have.</li>
            <li> Everythin all right.</li>
            <li> Came right on time.</li>
            <li> But this is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> I love having the big dispensers .</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent of the urban antidotes series.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years (on and off) and I always end up back with it.</li>
            <li> Arrived in the time frame promised and the product was exactly as promised, as well.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much softer and manageable with this stuff!</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> straight to my home!</li>
            <li> The conditioner isn&#x27;t too heavy and it smells good.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this set - it lasts me around 8 months (I have slightly shorter hair) and seems to do a very good job.</li>
            <li> I like tigi bedhead, but  I like the red bottle pomegranate version much better, this just doesn&#x27;t have as appealing of a scent as the other I had purchased before,  </li>
            <li> The conditioner seems to be well absorbed into the ends of my hair and leaves it very soft.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is fine, but the conditioner is just gross.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too much of anything that might need fixing.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re much cheaper online than in the stores.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Thanks 👍😀</li>
            <li> Considering you&#x27;re getting 2 liter bottles of shampoo and conditioner with pumps, you really can&#x27;t complain for the cost.  </li>
            <li> I really like this and have even turned my sister onto it.</li>
            <li> These bottles are too big to use comfortably without the pump.  </li>
            <li> Really gets buildup out of your hair.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, frizzy, and colored hair.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair silky soft and never oily!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair smelling so fresh and easy to style it!&lt;br /&gt;Had a small issue with shipment, but seller took care of the problem right</li>
            <li> I have straight hair that with other shampoos gets greasy at the roots, but this shampoo is awesome and it allows me to only shampoo every other day or so.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s surprising how hard it is to find shampoo and conditioner for normal hair.</li>
            <li> This is hands down, my absolute favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> You will love your soft silky hair ; not greasy or dry .</li>
            <li> The shampoo really dries my hair out, which is fine because it becomes oily easily, but it makes my hair pretty dry and fluffy...</li>
            <li> Always get better pricing on amazon than any other place i&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a great combo set that is high quality at a low price.</li>
            <li> I had some pumps from a previous set that I was able to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still be buying from Tigi again, but I would not recommend this particular product.</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft but doesn&#x27;t have much volume.  </li>
            <li> for the delivery, the shampoo top was not on tight and so some of the shampoo leaked out.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Spendy in a small bottle, so I like the large 64 oz size for a better value.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft and moisturizer really works.</li>
            <li> Most shampoos leave my hair scratchy like straw, and the conditioners make it oily and limp.</li>
            <li> It claims to be for normal hair</li>
            <li> The shampoo cleans very well and the conditioner is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> I love that I only need less than a dime-size dollop for my whole head!  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo because once you wash and dry your hair, your style stays for the next day.</li>
            <li> I tend to try new hair products often</li>
            <li> Prone to a dry scalp and dandruff, the shampoo is a mild alternative that does not create problems.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo leaves my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> I ordered two pairs, maybe it will be the same after I use the first pair up.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shine and soft!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The large bottles usually last me just over two months.</li>
            <li> it makes my normally frizzy thick hair very soft and shiny and easy to style.</li>
            <li> This set made my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I really cant tell a difference between the different shampoos though</li>
            <li> This shampoo definitely gave my thin/flat hair a bit of volume but didn&#x27;t give my hair as much of a shine as I hoped.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and shiny and I always get compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair frequently</li>
            <li> and my hair has been so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It really did as it said and brought my hair back to life!</li>
            <li> The conditioner makes my thick hair, which often tangles, easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> there was a little bit of leakage coming from the pump on top of the container, but I suppose that is expected especially since it traveled far to be with me</li>
            <li> I am sad though that they no longer come with pumps, glad I kept mine!</li>
            <li> No other hair product compares.</li>
            <li> and I noticed it right when I squeezed the shampoo out of the little pouch.</li>
            <li> no where near as much as the previous version I have bought.</li>
            <li> Like I said, normally after the first two, my hair starts to feel a little dry.</li>
            <li> I waited a little bit to post this review since it would be my first time using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have long, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product many times, I LOVE how it works in my hair, but I am disappointed that they took away the pumps (which is why I knocked it down a star).</li>
            <li> If it isn&#x27;t the real deal\watered down like, do not send it out??</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not especially dry, or oily.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, fine, and naturally blonde.</li>
            <li> They smell fresh and feminine, but not amazing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a shampoo/conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh fine hair down if it&#x27;s colored; this is it.</li>
            <li> For me, the conditioner gets out my tangles easily as long as I use enough and concentrate it at the ends of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Helped get rid of the greasy look that you get from using the same brand of shampoo/conditioner for too long.</li>
            <li> and this combo give body to my otherwise flat hair.</li>
            <li> It definitely helped out my dry hair!</li>
            <li> and it doesnt leave your hair greasy or heavy, just soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> I have long layered hair almost to my waist.</li>
            <li> And I can&#x27;t believe how different my hair feels compared to when I use other shampoos.</li>
            <li> My hair feels really dry after using it.</li>
            <li> Also, they were not in the packaging as pictured, but loose in a bag.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t enough to send it back, but enough to make a huge mess and be disappointed at the loss.  </li>
            <li> Dries my hair out , but I do like other products they carry.</li>
            <li> Might work well for other people but</li>
            <li> some other salon brands carry.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t fight with any other scents you might want to wear.</li>
            <li> but you only get a small amount of the product.</li>
            <li> I give it a 4 because my other set came with pumps for the spouts, which I prefer.</li>
            <li> I use Aveda for every other hair need but save money by using this product</li>
            <li> I have oily hair that has to be washed everyday, but it gets dry</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the pumps (as shown in the picture) did not come with it.</li>
            <li> My hair comes down to my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I order this set of shampoo and conditioner because my daughter used other bed head product !</li>
            <li> but they did not come with the pumps which makes using such a big bottle  rather difficult.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many hair products in the past and have been disappointed</li>
            <li> I have thick, dry hair and this re-energizes my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I discovered that after you shampoo and condition, rinse out the conditioner (cold water)that instead of using a separate \\&quot;leave in conditioner\\&quot; you can use a tiny bit of the conditioner after you rince, towel dry your hair put a small amount back in your hair</li>
            <li> and I also like the fact that the product has little or no scent, so</li>
            <li> You use so little and</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
            <li> so sometimes I need to go up a level for a few days.</li>
            <li> (Not a strong smell</li>
            <li> I have long, very thick color treated hair</li>
            <li> and I was not particularly pleased with how this cleaned or the level of moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Biolage and Tresemme in the past and it seems like I would always shed tons of hair.</li>
            <li> Hate to order any hair products offline with disappointment and especially bed head beings that&#x27;s all I ever use... what I received is not what I expected, no one wants running like shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> seems to provide fullness to my otherwise thin hair, does not weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> my hair was so hard to comb through afterwards.</li>
            <li> Will not order again, shampoo &amp; conditioner weren&#x27;t as thick as they&#x27;re suppose to be, felt as if they damaged my hair just like Walmart products.</li>
            <li> Gunks up my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> but it is always a little on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> Literally in two washes, this shampoo/conditioner combo has removed all build up from my hair and I&#x27;m hardly shedding!</li>
            <li> Does wonders for my thick hair!</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and lots of it.</li>
            <li> my hair is not one of them, sorry to say</li>
            <li> Not impressed with what it costs.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner I thought was expensive TILL I USED IT.  </li>
            <li> The broken pieces are not in the box which means that someone placed damaged product in a box to mail to me; that makes me really mad.  </li>
            <li> had I not been desperate for some shampoo.</li>
            <li> It smells very stale.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m getting sick of them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked and will be purchasing this again....and again!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Annoying!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I only wash my hair every 2-3 days and this product smells great and doesn&#x27;t make my hair too oily.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product so much, that I will continue purchasing it. Leaves my hair smelling so fresh and easy to style it!&lt;br /&gt;Had a small issue with shipment, but seller took care of the problem right away.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It smells okay. Level 2 smells better though. It works pretty good.</li>
            <li> I understand some hair products are only guaranteed if they are purchased at a salon, I don&#x27;t care for salon prices so I thought I would try online. Much cheaper, but my hair didn&#x27;t feel as smooth or sleek. I ordered two pairs, maybe it will be the same after I use the first pair up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t color my hair. It&#x27;s not especially dry, or oily. It&#x27;s not too much of anything that might need fixing. And it&#x27;s surprising how hard it is to find shampoo and conditioner for normal hair. But this is exactly what I need. And it smells amazing. If you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s not fancy, but not cheap, this is perfect for those of you with plain ol&#x27; hair that just needs a good washing.</li>
            <li> Good stuff... would try other Bed Head varieties.</li>
            <li> I give this brand of shampoo as a birthday gift every year.  The person that receives it loves it. She describes it as one of the best.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints. The shampoo works well, smells good and was a good price. It arrived less than a week after I ordered it and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Love Bed Head products and they&#x27;re much cheaper online than in the stores.  I tend to try new hair products often but I like this one and am still using it.</li>
            <li> This set made my hair so soft. It definitely helped out my dry hair!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo! i love it.</li>
            <li> Bottles were overfilled, and spilled everywhere. Did not include pumps as shown. Not the same as I purchased last time.</li>
            <li> Good stuff but they did not come with the pumps which makes using such a big bottle  rather difficult.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair out , but I do like other products they carry. Might work well for other people but my hair is not one of them, sorry to say</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great.  Great for my (wavy hispanic) hair texture, not too smelly/perfumed, and the size makes it a great value and keeps me from constantly having to buy new shampoo.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is so specific to hair type, but for my hair it&#x27;s perfect, so it&#x27;s a 5 star for the shampoo and conditioner, but a 2 star for the delivery of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need a lot of conditioning, and use conditioner more for shine than for &amp;#34;healthy hair&amp;#34;.  Re-Energize adds shine, and makes my straight hair look healthy and somewhat fuller, so, perfect for my uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the delivery, the shampoo top was not on tight and so some of the shampoo leaked out.  It wasn&#x27;t enough to send it back, but enough to make a huge mess and be disappointed at the loss.  It will make me think twice before I order it online again.  Also, they were not in the packaging as pictured, but loose in a bag.</li>
            <li> This is a really great shampoo and conditioner. My hair is very fine so I have a lot of static issues. With this shampoo and conditioner I don&#x27;t have static issues.. It also makes my hair look more lively.</li>
            <li> there was a little bit of leakage coming from the pump on top of the container, but I suppose that is expected especially since it traveled far to be with me</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, Great price</li>
            <li> Smells good, works well, noticed much more volume since using this daily</li>
            <li> Found this  product very useful and good product for normal hair.</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft and it really smells good, BUT the conditioner does almost nothing to my hair. I am left with so many tangles! AND my hair wasn&#x27;t as silky....frizz doesn&#x27;t go away. Not impressed with what it costs. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dry hair and this re-energizes my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist and have used this shampoo for years on and off. Alot of my clients use this too.  Smells great and it&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner work well without the huge price tag some other salon brands carry. The shampoo lathers nicely and leaves hair shiny and healthy. The conditioner makes my thick hair, which often tangles, easy to comb through. I like the convenient pumps and I also like the fact that the product has little or no scent, so it doesn&#x27;t fight with any other scents you might want to wear.</li>
            <li> best shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Great brand, and great value.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner I thought was expensive TILL I USED IT.  Wow! You use so little and the quality and end results are fantastic.  Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo and you get it at a lower price than at a hair salon.</li>
            <li> Love this duo!  Makes my hair shine and soft! And it&#x27;s very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great. It smells wonderful (although I do wish the smell lasted on my hair longer). I like all Bed Head products. I really cant tell a difference between the different shampoos though (just the smell- and they have all been great!). I will just purchase the set that is the cheapest.</li>
            <li> it was as good as all the comments.</li>
            <li> My hair comes down to my shoulders. I love the smell of this shampoo a lot, and it stays with you throughout the day. (Not a strong smell, it&#x27;s just pleasantly there and you get a whiff of it occasionally)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how soft it makes my hair. It genuinely does make a significant difference in how it dries. For me, the conditioner gets out my tangles easily as long as I use enough and concentrate it at the ends of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large bottles usually last me just over two months. I feel it&#x27;s a good price in consideration to its size. Amazon has the best price around, and it&#x27;s only worth buying if you get it here. Most salon prices are about $25 for both shampoo and conditioner but you only get a small amount of the product.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Great product. Will buy from this seller again. Thanks 👍😀</li>
            <li> Good shampoo and better then I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was a packaged deal with shampoo and conditioner. Received it in the mail with no shampoo. It was 2 conditioners instead. That didn&#x27;t do me any good.</li>
            <li> Love the brand!&lt;br /&gt;I guess its just not the best products for my hair as now they turn faster to be greasy.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this shampoo and conditioner from my hair stylist and I finally used them today. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because I haven&#x27;t had great results with salon products before, but this shampoo and conditioner has knocked all of my preconceptions on the floor. The scent of this set is amazing and I noticed it right when I squeezed the shampoo out of the little pouch. It&#x27;s been a couple of hours since I&#x27;ve washed my hair and I can&#x27;t stop feeling how silky smooth it feels and how wonderful it smells. Try this product out. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!!! I discovered that after you shampoo and condition, rinse out the conditioner (cold water)that instead of using a separate \\&quot;leave in conditioner\\&quot; you can use a tiny bit of the conditioner after you rince, towel dry your hair put a small amount back in your hair and it doesnt leave your hair greasy or heavy, just soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> I wish it would have come with the pumps.</li>
            <li> seems to provide fullness to my otherwise thin hair, does not weigh hair down. Nice quality and the pumps are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Product is great, but the pump on the shampoo took a lot of prying to open-would not just twist up like the conditioner did.</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves my hair feeling good! I just used this for the first time and I can&#x27;t wait to use it again and again! I feel like I could star as the &amp;#34;After&amp;#34; picture in a shampoo commercial! Love, Love, Love it!</li>
            <li> This was a great price online.  The shampoo and conditioner smell great and the large container with the pumps are convenient.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My entire family loves this shampoo &amp; conditioner.  Spendy in a small bottle, so I like the large 64 oz size for a better value.</li>
            <li> This shampoo definitely gave my thin/flat hair a bit of volume but didn&#x27;t give my hair as much of a shine as I hoped.  All in all its a good shampoo that smells really good and is worth the deal.</li>
            <li> Concentrated shampoo provides lots of foam and a pleasant clean fragrance, conditioner is light and rinses easily, leaves hair soft and manageable, good value</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It made my hair feel awesome without drying it out!  It felt soft and clean!!!</li>
            <li> love it love all bed head products.  I love having the big dispensers . they are so convenient.  i will continue using.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!!  Always get better pricing on amazon than any other place i&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> Considering you&#x27;re getting 2 liter bottles of shampoo and conditioner with pumps, you really can&#x27;t complain for the cost.  I&#x27;ve used TIGI products before and have been impressed (espsecially with their Rockaholic dry shampoo), but I think the quality of the Re-energize set hovers somewhere between a generic shampoo (like Garnier or Tresemme) and a nicer, higher-brand one (like Redken).  I don&#x27;t get a ton of tangles, but my hair isn&#x27;t super shiny and brushable out of the shower either.  They smell fresh and feminine, but not amazing.  My hair is very soft but doesn&#x27;t have much volume.  They&#x27;ve lasted me for months but I&#x27;m getting sick of them.  Overall: meh.  After you use a shampoo/conditioner for a while, it&#x27;s good to mix it up; your hair gets used to the formula.  I don&#x27;t regret spending ~$25 on this set, but I won&#x27;t be repurchasing (but I am going to try out their even cheaper Anti-dote version!).</li>
            <li> I like tigi bedhead, but  I like the red bottle pomegranate version much better, this just doesn&#x27;t have as appealing of a scent as the other I had purchased before,  I like the size though, it is handy having the pump to get the shampoo and conditioner out, instead of squeazing bottles.  So I like it, but no where near as much as the previous version I have bought.</li>
            <li> By far this shampoo and conditioner are the best products I have found for my hair. I absolutely highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Helped get rid of the greasy look that you get from using the same brand of shampoo/conditioner for too long.</li>
            <li> Finally found a shampoo that both my wife and teenage daughter agree on and like.  Instead of multiple shampoo and conditioner bottles in the bathroom my wife and teenage daughter both use these products.  It must be good stuff because they very rarely agree on anything these days.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite from this company but maybe it will work better for you. I have long, very thick color treated hair and I was not particularly pleased with how this cleaned or the level of moisture.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what I was looking for. My hair feels great and looks great. And it&#x27;s has kind of an appley type smell to it</li>
            <li> I love this product. Nothing on the market seems to compare.</li>
            <li> Very good and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love the way it gives shine to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for a daily shower. Leaves that clean feeling!</li>
            <li> Smells great, hair feels great!  Love Bead Head Products!</li>
            <li> Prone to a dry scalp and dandruff, the shampoo is a mild alternative that does not create problems.  My daughter and wife like the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Nice smell but my hair was so hard to comb through afterwards.</li>
            <li> this is the 5th set we ordered, my husband loves it, the shampoo cleans the hair quite well, and the shine. the conditioner  is best  we have used, it clears in the rinse, and no problem in detangling hair, will use the vendor/seller again, thank you</li>
            <li> LEFT MY HAIR LIFELESS</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is one of the best hair care product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;It does all that is says it does and more. You will love your soft silky hair ; not greasy or dry . Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I tried some samples of this and am now ordering it! I love it . .  it makes my normally frizzy thick hair very soft and shiny and easy to style. Wonderful product! Smells great too! Worth the price!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone looking for manageability. The smell is a bonus.</li>
            <li> The caps on each bottle came broken and most of the product leaked all over inside the package - great product but could have been packed much better.</li>
            <li> great hair product, I have tried all brands and this by far is the best, especially for colored hair</li>
            <li> I have long, naturally curly hair. I&#x27;ve used Biolage and Tresemme in the past and it seems like I would always shed tons of hair. Literally in two washes, this shampoo/conditioner combo has removed all build up from my hair and I&#x27;m hardly shedding! My hair looks, feels and smells GREAT! The price for these huge bottles is absolutely worth it. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever spend money on another brand again. If you love your hair, do yourself a favor and buy this combo!</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use. Very light weight shampoo and conditioner. This is my favorite scent of the urban antidotes series. It smells tropical, fruity, and fresh, kind of like coconut and maybe banana? I have oily hair that has to be washed everyday, but it gets dry so sometimes I need to go up a level for a few days. The shampoo cleans very well and the conditioner is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. It leaves my hair soft and shiny and I always get compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li> Perfect, just as described. Thanks for another great deal.</li>
            <li> Will not order again, shampoo &amp; conditioner weren&#x27;t as thick as they&#x27;re suppose to be, felt as if they damaged my hair just like Walmart products. Hate to order any hair products offline with disappointment and especially bed head beings that&#x27;s all I ever use... what I received is not what I expected, no one wants running like shampoo &amp; conditioner. If it isn&#x27;t the real deal\watered down like, do not send it out?? Feel ripped off...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like.  Gunks up my thick hair.  Trying to find someone to give these to.</li>
            <li> We have been really happy with this product,. Smells wonderful and has been making my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair feel and look nice.  No complaints from us. Been using about 6 months.</li>
            <li> Product came yesterday and the shampoo top is busted.  The broken pieces are not in the box which means that someone placed damaged product in a box to mail to me; that makes me really mad.  Try the shampoo but get it from someone else.  I love the shampoo and conditioner.  The conditioner is absolutely perfect for fine, color treated hair.  It&#x27;s hard to find a shampoo/conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh fine hair down if it&#x27;s colored; this is it.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, fine, and naturally blonde. I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years (on and off) and I always end up back with it. The conditioner isn&#x27;t too heavy and it smells good. I&#x27;ve bought this product many times, I LOVE how it works in my hair, but I am disappointed that they took away the pumps (which is why I knocked it down a star). I paid for the item pictured and it&#x27;s not what I got. Just to give you a warning, it&#x27;s a flip top now.</li>
            <li> Love this duo! Second time purchasing it. I give it a 4 because my other set came with pumps for the spouts, which I prefer.</li>
            <li> Arrived in the time frame promised and the product was exactly as promised, as well.</li>
            <li> Great for an everyday shampoo and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Bottles do not have pump like depicted here!  Returned!</li>
            <li> I originally got this shampoo and conditioner from a salon. It works very well and smells great. The conditioner seems to be well absorbed into the ends of my hair and leaves it very soft. I really like this and have even turned my sister onto it.</li>
            <li> These arrived without the pump mechanisms.  Annoying!  I had some pumps from a previous set that I was able to use.  These bottles are too big to use comfortably without the pump.  The picture shows a pump for each item.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner but I bought the one with pumps and received ones without</li>
            <li> Shampoo &amp; conditioner set did not arrive with pumps, as advertised.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! My hair is so soft and it looks great too!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo smells great and leave my hair soft.  Totally recommend it to both males and females and get compliments on the smell also</li>
            <li> Fantastic shampoo.  Would recommend.  Works great on color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hair product snob but found this lower-priced shampoo/conditioner originally at Walmart and JCP. But it&#x27;s even cheaper on Amazon. I use it myself and also for my two daughters. Great product! I use Aveda for every other hair need but save money by using this product and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner so much. It smells so delightful. This is hands down, my absolute favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is the same product my hairstylist used on my hair. It smells divine and left my hair soft and happy.</li>
            <li> Does wonders for my thick hair! Best price is on here! Pay double at salons/stores. Very Happy. Big bottles as well.</li>
            <li> It smells great, but use the conditioner with the shampoo. The shampoo really dries my hair out, which is fine because it becomes oily easily, but it makes my hair pretty dry and fluffy... I don&#x27;t know if you guys or gals are going for that or not. Be warned.</li>
            <li> Excellent product....fit every need of mine and came when scheduled.  :)</li>
            <li> The shampoo is fine, but the conditioner is just gross.  I can&#x27;t use it.  It smells very stale.  I would have returned this item had I not been desperate for some shampoo.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go back to regular shampoo! This stuff smells AMAZING! And I can&#x27;t believe how different my hair feels compared to when I use other shampoos. My hair is so much softer and manageable with this stuff! I tried to use similar items, but it just isn&#x27;t the same as this. It&#x27;s like magic!</li>
            <li> I am giving TIGI Bed Head Shampoo &amp; Conditioner a big FIVE STARS for economy and function!  I love that I only need less than a dime-size dollop for my whole head!  These bottles last me about six months, if not longer!  They leave my hair looking healthy, which is saying a lot since I&#x27;ve colored it for YEARS!  I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> this shampoo is the best shampoo that I have ever used.  I highly recommend this product.  My hair shines and looks so healthy.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner, makes the hair feel wonderful. I will order this again.</li>
            <li> A great product. It keeps my hair soft and moisturizer really works. I have relaxed hair and is good for weekly conditioning for women who work out 3 days a week.</li>
            <li> My hair feels really dry after using it. And I don&#x27;t need the conditioner at all but they were sold in a bundle.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, soft and looks healthy.  I haven&#x27;t cut it in over six months and I have no split ends.  :-)</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this set - it lasts me around 8 months (I have slightly shorter hair) and seems to do a very good job. I dye my hair frequently and I think it looks pretty healthy considering :P</li>
            <li> I order this set of shampoo and conditioner because my daughter used other bed head product ! And i have so many brand of shampoo and condition.  it leave my hair soft and smell great</li>
            <li> Love Love Love the product. Only complaint is that the pumps (as shown in the picture) did not come with it.</li>
            <li> Love this brand for my hair! Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I am in love! I waited a little bit to post this review since it would be my first time using this shampoo. And every time another shampoo is introduced to my hair it&#x27;s usually AMAZING the first two washes. I&#x27;ve now gone a week with this and my hair has been so soft and shiny. Like I said, normally after the first two, my hair starts to feel a little dry. Not this one. I&#x27;m shocked and will be purchasing this again....and again!</li>
            <li> This shampoo &amp; conditioner is AMAZING! It really did as it said and brought my hair back to life! After using this product even one time my hair was incredibly soft and looked healthy again. The scent is not overpowering but has a nice, clean smell. I have tried so many hair products in the past and have been disappointed, I will continue to use this product regularly! I am also impressed with the size of the bottles - they should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Really gets buildup out of your hair. When you wash it you can actually hear your hair squeak. I can only use this every couple of washes because it it too drying for constant use, but it is great to keep your hair free of product and conditioner buildup. Awesome smell too!</li>
            <li> Great Product! Great Price! Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo/conditioner combo! My hair is, well, temperamental. Most shampoos leave my hair scratchy like straw, and the conditioners make it oily and limp. I was about ready to shave my head when my stylist mentioned that I love my hair after she washes it. She suggested I use the same stuff they do (this) and sold me set. I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since, but don&#x27;t want to pay the $25 a bottle, so I hit Amazon. Same stuff, WAY lower prices, and straight to my home! Love it. Plus, it smells delish!</li>
            <li> I have always been really impressed with Tigi products, but this set just drys out my hair and seems to add lots of frizz.  I&#x27;ll still be buying from Tigi again, but I would not recommend this particular product.</li>
            <li> Love the pumps!  Shampoo leaves my hair very soft.  Fresh, clean feeling and scent.  Overall pretty happy!</li>
            <li> Aún no llega porque hay qu pagar al instituto de Salud Pública para ingresar al país y es mucha plata y un montón de papeles</li>
            <li> Since using this conditioner my hair has never been better. I have fine hair that is stick straight and this combo give body to my otherwise flat hair. ****Edit.  For the 3rd time I have purchased this combo. I have medium length hair and one set lasts me another 6mo or longer. I am sad though that they no longer come with pumps, glad I kept mine!</li>
            <li> Purchased on recommendation of my stylist.... I LOVE it! Leaves my hair silky soft and never oily!!! I have long layered hair almost to my waist.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo. I have thin hair and lots of it. I love this shampoo because once you wash and dry your hair, your style stays for the next day. I have straight hair that with other shampoos gets greasy at the roots, but this shampoo is awesome and it allows me to only shampoo every other day or so. Love it!</li>
            <li> One of the packs came open and spilled out. It did not come with pump dispensers as shown in the photo.</li>
            <li> Love the smell....the pump system is perfect for my husband and me in our shower!</li>
            <li> Everythin all right. On time perfect conditions.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It claims to be for normal hair but it is so much better than that!  I have very curly, frizzy, and colored hair.  This product works miracles.  My hair is always silky and shiny and the frizz is totally manageable.  No other hair product compares.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and is not too heavy on my hair.  Diffuses easily so you don&#x27;t have to use much product. Works really well for everyday use.</li>
            <li> This product is great for everyday use.  Smells amazing!  Can&#x27;t find it cheaper anywhere else.  Just the shampoo or conditioner by itself at a salon is $30.</li>
            <li> This is great for my normal hair. It really smells great and gives your hair a new life.</li>
            <li> Thank you!!!! Love it so much. Came right on time. I will order more.</li>
            <li> First time I tried this was at Wild Orchids Salon, it smelt so good and I loved the way it made my hair feel, and kept the fly aways away. Been using it ever since. My hair is pretty healthy it just has some whispies sticking out sometimes and this helps it keep in place.</li>
            <li> Smells good, doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily like other shampoos have.</li>
            <li> I love BEDHEAD but it is always a little on the expensive side. When I saw two bottles for this great price, I had to buy it. It smells great and leaves my hair feeling great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product 3 times off Amazon now and have been very pleased.  It&#x27;s hard to find a great combo set that is high quality at a low price.</li>
            <li> Item was great, but during shipping the shampoo lid came off and was all over</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner works exelent and have a great scent. It have work perfectly for my diary hair cleaning.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner not heavy or sticky feeling after use leaves hair shiny and soft</li>
