            <li>whole room was smelling so good!!</li>
            <li>It is  beyond my expectation, it is very well made and very good</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Oils smell so much better when diffused in the air.</li>
            <li>Even my husband has been pleased he breathes easier and</li>
            <li>I love it and use it a lot.</li>
            <li>Love the light settings.</li>
            <li>Loved this diffuser so much I bought two and then recommended it to friends.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work fine for what it is</li>
            <li>so fine it looks like smoke.  </li>
            <li>The mist isn&#x27;t as dense as I originally wanted</li>
            <li>The changing lights are cool but you have to turn it off</li>
            <li>The little diffuser works great.</li>
            <li>I use it in my office, very relaxing and the scents are fabulous.</li>
            <li>Would like a bigger resavore but does a good job and the lid comes on and off easy, so it&#x27;s easy to operate in the dark.</li>
            <li>No issues after 30 days of using it continuously, and my wife is enjoying all of the different fragrances.</li>
            <li>When i first turn it on i have to hit the buttom 2 or 3 times to get it to start working.</li>
            <li>It definitely does make our home smell more like a relaxed atmosphere.</li>
            <li>More than 2 can cause a strong aroma if left on for too long.</li>
            <li>The mist output is very week.</li>
            <li>The water reservoir doesn&#x27;t hold much water at all.  </li>
            <li>But for the purpose of diffusing oil, not so much.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy and will likely choose this model for future purchases.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this diffuser and we bragged on it so much that my sister-in-law wanted one.</li>
            <li>It saves oil by not having to use as much as with heated types.</li>
            <li>My whole house smells like a spa.</li>
            <li>I use this diffuser for my room with essential oils and it always does it&#x27;s job just right.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical because the price is pretty low considering competition, but it has worked out great.</li>
            <li>And barely puts out enough steam to smell any oils unless your standing right next to it.</li>
            <li>I have also not had any trouble keeping it clean, which can be a pain with any machine that uses water.</li>

            <li> Gift to daughter -in-law</li>
            <li> I use it in my office, very relaxing and the scents are fabulous.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser. I use it daily. Love the light settings. The price was great too. I bought a second one.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product, I purchased a cheaper diffuser and it&#x27;s way better. The mist output is very week. It&#x27;s much smaller than I expected.  The changing lights are cool but you have to turn it off it does not turn off by itself</li>
            <li> This was a perfect diffuser while it lasted. We used it about once a day, 5 days a week for 3 months and now it doesn&#x27;t work. :-/ Quite the bummer considering the cost compared to pottery diffusers.</li>
            <li> It is too small to really do anything.  The water reservoir doesn&#x27;t hold much water at all.  Maybe in a teeny tiny bathroom or something.  But for the purpose of diffusing oil, not so much.  It seems to work fine for what it is but I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Best diffuser around for the price.</li>
            <li> No problem with it. Very quiet. Love it.</li>
            <li> Wish I could give this a million stars. OMG best product EVER</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because the price is pretty low considering competition, but it has worked out great. I use this diffuser for my room with essential oils and it always does it&#x27;s job just right. The mist isn&#x27;t as dense as I originally wanted but I would say it has not affected the quality or use of the product. I have also not had any trouble keeping it clean, which can be a pain with any machine that uses water. Overall, I am happy and will likely choose this model for future purchases.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser !!! Want another one !!!</li>
            <li> Love this! It does an awesome job at diffusing and is so pretty!</li>
            <li> This is the best diffuser, I have found. A perfect gift. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Works great! No issues after 30 days of using it continuously, and my wife is enjoying all of the different fragrances.</li>
            <li> I have several of these and for a small unit it really kicks out a lot of vapor.</li>
            <li> The little diffuser works great. The only drawback is its small size, so it runs for only about 3 hours . It would be nice if it were longer.</li>
            <li> Loved this diffuser so much I bought two and then recommended it to friends.  Just started buying oils and bought this one to test it out.  I really like it.  Been using it every night and have had zero issues.  Also, not a problem to mix oils.</li>
            <li> I purchased this diffuser and we bragged on it so much that my sister-in-law wanted one. We later purchased one for each of our children as a Christmas present.  Oils smell so much better when diffused in the air. This nebulizer style diffuser works instantly because it does not heat the oil. Ultrasound creates a mist so fine it looks like smoke.  It only take a couple drops to fill the room with aromatherapy. More than 2 can cause a strong aroma if left on for too long. It saves oil by not having to use as much as with heated types. Also some oils change when heated. Some oils can burn and have an unwanted smell. When used in this nebulizer The aroma is completely different. I looked all over the internet for this model and found that Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li> Covers a 300 sq ft room well when door closed. Lights are nice and it too bright. Puts out a good amount of scent. Auto-shut off seems to turn off before all liquid is used, thus the four stars.</li>
            <li> great customer service. Great product</li>
            <li> Easy to operate and does a great job. Would like a bigger resavore but does a good job and the lid comes on and off easy, so it&#x27;s easy to operate in the dark.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago and I must say I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I can go through two run cycles before needing to fill with water again. This is a plus as I keep it on my headboard and can reach up in the middle of the night and restart. I use my Doterra oils every other filling and what a difference it has made. Even my husband has been pleased he breathes easier and his bloody noses due to our dry climate has decreased dramatically.  I&#x27;ll buy another in the future.</li>
            <li> wonderful product, easy to use, very effective</li>
            <li> Very happy with the diffusers I purchased.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Excellent! I just received my diffuser, and I love it! It is  beyond my expectation, it is very well made and very good looking...&lt;br /&gt;The whole room was smelling so good!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it a 2 star for looks. When i first turn it on i have to hit the buttom 2 or 3 times to get it to start working. It only runs for 3 hours at a time. And barely puts out enough steam to smell any oils unless your standing right next to it.</li>
            <li> Best buy ever. My whole house smells like a spa. Even the dogs do not want to go out in the yard. Awesome for mood lighting  too. Switched from candles to this.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. It definitely does make our home smell more like a relaxed atmosphere. I gave it only 4 stars because it does turn off before the water is completly out of it. I have to restart it and the second time it runs it will run it dry and autmoatically shut off.</li>
            <li> I love it and use it a lot.</li>
    </ol>
