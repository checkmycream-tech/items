    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>provides a wonderful scent not found anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Smells awesome in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is where it gets its excellent lubrication from.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This smells like a wonderful old-school barbershop shave lotion.  </li>
            <li>However, I must say I&#x27;m impressed by the shave it gave me.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I read it was the best and has been around for years.  </li>

            <li>As mentioned, the lubrication is great, the smell is wonderful, lathers well, and lasts.  </li>
            <li>I expect Tabac to smell incredible for its price.  </li>
            <li>It smells good too!  </li>
            <li>It lathers wonderfully, and the scent is a pleasant.  </li>

            <li>Great shave and post shave.  </li>
            <li>about the lather, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>The tub is attractive and refillable.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, and leaves you feeling like a manlier man.</li>
            <li>It lathers great.  </li>
            <li>but Tabac smells just like its name suggests - a great tobacconist shop.  </li>
            <li>the scent is great...  </li>
            <li>Great manly scent.</li>
            <li>But it has a great scent and it provides a great shave.</li>

            <li>This soap is great.</li>
            <li>The reports of its great lathering qualities had me intrigued.  </li>
            <li>but it is very nice.</li>
            <li>This shaving soap is amazing!</li>
            <li>and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an amazing product!</li>
            <li>Lathers great and is good quality.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend this to a friend looking for a good soap in a very nice container.</li>
            <li>It easily the best shaving soap or cream</li>
            <li>I may even exclusively use Tabac--it&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li>And it stays on your face, doing unspeakable things to your aftershave for a good hour before it tires and goes</li>
            <li>Just use a good aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>It does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic lather, awesome packaging.</li>
            <li>A good value imho.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lather is good.</li>
            <li>He was correct, it is a very nice shave soap and produces a nice, creamy, aromatic lather that doesn&#x27;t leave a lingering scent.  </li>
            <li>This soap with a good brush creates a nice lather and a good shave.  </li>
            <li>The great glass bowl is the cherry on top.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with Tabac.  </li>
            <li>Great lather, love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Good price and nice bowl w/ lid.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This product has many detailed reviews so I will just say this shave soap is the best I have come across.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>: Consistently gives the best shaves I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>Yeah this shaving soap is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>albeit after a bit more work than the creams take!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Great lather that is easy to control in terms of thickness.  </li>
            <li>As for the scent, it&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li>It handily outperforms Proraso menthol/eucalyptus (one of my favorites for the smell) and even Truefitt and Hill creams, which is saying something.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get quite a lot of product for the money and it comes in nice glass/ceramic tub that does not look out of place in a bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased to have it in my rotation, but not a soap I would use every day because it is so good.  </li>
            <li>It also lathers up quite nicely...</li>
            <li>The glass jar is nice as well.</li>
            <li>This will be the best soap for everyone that wants to start wetshaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the bowl is quite nice.  </li>
            <li>It lathers nicely ..</li>
            <li>Lathers beautifully and quickly.  </li>
            <li>Tabac Original is a great quality product.  </li>
            <li>Most of the good competitive tallow soaps cost considerably more.  </li>
            <li>Good soap, nice bowl, lid is cheap feeling plastic though.</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to give this a try - and I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m very glad I did.</li>
            <li>Best shaving soap that I have used so far (compared to Edwin Jagger, Dr. Dittmar, van der Hagen, etc.)</li>
            <li>There is also a matching Tabac after shave bottle, that is worth having that makes an attractive combination set.</li>
            <li>With a good quality brush you can make mounds of rich, hydrating lather.  </li>
            <li>May sound a bit off-putting but in fact, it&#x27;s a great, rich, evocative aroma.  </li>
            <li>Tallow soaps, in spite of their generally excellent performance, are generally considered to be lower-cost ingredients compared to vegetable alternatives.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now it just smells like a very lightly scented soap.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it is very smooth.</li>
            <li>It has lubricating properties that aren&#x27;t found in many soaps.  </li>
            <li>Most of those are not tallow based.  </li>
            <li>Probably not a repeat buy since there are better smelling products out there -i.e.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did</li>
            <li>and like it so much, that I&#x27;ll be buying the aftershave too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was great</li>
            <li>my ALL TIME FAVORITE aftershave, which he also wears).  </li>
            <li>I swear the blade cuts better with this than with barbasol goop or TooBS soap.</li>
            <li>So I wouldn&#x27;t let too many comments about the scent steer you away.</li>
            <li>Longer than any cream ever will for sure.  </li>
            <li>Finally, I love the fragrance--it reminds me of an old-time barber shop.  </li>
            <li>How many times have I heard myself say that?</li>
            <li>This is the most sought after shaving soap in the world.</li>
            <li>With Van Der Hagen shave soap it didn&#x27;t do that all too well, now with Tabac shave soap I am able to shave against the grain on my mustache area unlike when I had Van Der Hagen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried so many shave soaps.</li>
            <li>Many from Phoenix artisan, Proraso, cella, Williams mug, van der Hagen.</li>
            <li>Lathers like a dream, even better with distilled water.</li>
            <li>Some soaps were better than others.  </li>
            <li>And, when I have to shave more than once a day</li>
            <li>soap is excellent and sits on the same level as Mitchell&#x27;s wool fat shaving soap.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic.  </li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s more soapy than lotiony (are those even words?</li>
            <li>Scent is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It gives me zero irritation and I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>The scent is prominent without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many shaves</li>
            <li>On this journey I have found my favorite brush and razor etc.</li>
            <li>The longevity of the soap is also outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Overall more impressed with the lather density.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible ..</li>
            <li>Also, the lather is very rich and much more protective than others.  </li>
            <li>max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ability to make the whiskers of the face soft and easy to cut is very good.  </li>
            <li>Smoke the occasional good cigar and this lather reminds me of a wonderful combination of tobacco and single-malt and and leather (the good stuff NOT English Leather!)</li>
            <li>It probably isn&#x27;t ideal for someone that just simply wants the best possible or economical shave.  </li>
            <li>When I do, it&#x27;s warm and even creamier, so it covers your beard quickly, and starts to soften the hair immediately.</li>
            <li>Gives the best and closest shave, but it may make my skin a bit dry.  </li>
            <li>Works well, but I&#x27;ve tried others like &amp;#34;Kiss MY Face&amp;#34; shaving cream which lathers bore easily and has much more lubricity to it to make the razor glide over my skin as if there weren&#x27;t a blade in it.</li>
            <li>Easy to lather.&lt;br /&gt;Unusual scent that people either love or hate.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>This has a strong fragnance that stays on for the rest of the day, love to shave with this every day</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice white glass lidded bowl that looks great all with all your shave gear.  </li>
            <li>Great old school smell - my wife loves it!  </li>
            <li>The product has a great old time soap smell.  </li>
            <li>Tabac lathers good works very well  </li>
            <li>Good shaving soap, but not as much lubricity as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>The Mitchell&#x27;s soap has a very light clean smell that no one can object to.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li>The milk glass bowl is very attractive, and the lather definitely aids in getting a clean, close, and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>wool fat shaving soap&amp;#34; a little better, but this stuff is still excellent.  </li>
            <li>The Tabac lathers very quickly.  </li>
            <li>, it came in very quickly</li>
            <li>how easy it is to lather (with a brush) and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>It lathers very quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry about the strong smell when it is opened - this fades after a day or two.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, very pleased and highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It is one of the best and highest value shaving products on the market (along with proraso and speick) hands down.</li>
            <li>Tabac has that nice fresh and clean scent I like.</li>
            <li>Absolutely as described and more!</li>
            <li>Amazing packaging!&lt;br /&gt;The elegant plastic windowed box, which was also taped, was a nice, heavy ceramic jar with a brown top and a nice big soap, with a good scent.  </li>
            <li>Great shave and no irritation, doesn&#x27;t feel dry afterwards but it feels like it washes very clean.</li>
            <li>Think sex, sweat, grimy rug, cheap perfume, dust, and of course cigarette smoke.  </li>
            <li>I started with an Edwin Jagger DE86 and the Tabac shaving soap and couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth my face was.  </li>
            <li>And the smell of the Tabac is fantastic</li>
            <li>This is one of the nicest shaving soaps available anywhere in the world.</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>Not only does it feel great</li>
            <li>Lathers like a champ, smooth shave every time.</li>
            <li>(my Lady likes my face smooth), I do so without fear of shave burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can now honestly say that I really like Tabac soap</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s an important part of my shave den.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy shaving with this soap.</li>
            <li>Tabac really allows me to make some nice close passes without fear of razor burn.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow this is good stuff.  </li>
            <li>The absolute standard for a perfect lather.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough--my desert island soap for sure!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, live large - it produces a rich and soft lather that sets up your beard for a great shave and the smell lingers - in a good way.</li>
            <li>It quickly forms a rich thick lather and provides excellent lubrication for a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Makes for a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Tabac Original is superior in pretty much every way.</li>
            <li>I tend to load really my brush up for a more luxurious lather, but you can get 3 passes easily with 20-30 seconds of loading</li>
            <li>Tabac Original is made from tallow.  </li>
            <li>It lathers up to a rich creamy lather in the brush.  </li>
            <li>The Tabac Original does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>B000C1VZX8 Tabac Original By Maurer &amp; Wirtz For Men.</li>
            <li>Plus the packaging is pretty elaborate, which also must be factored into the cost.  </li>
            <li>B000GHYXG4 Tabac Original By Maurer &amp; Wirtz For Men.</li>
            <li>IMHO, not as good as a few, but way better than most.  </li>
            <li>The lather in incredibly rich.</li>
            <li>I get excited.</li>
            <li>wanted to get an original product from germany.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a permanent home for an original product.</li>
            <li>And if you still don&#x27;t like it after you&#x27;ve given it a fair shot, there are plenty of wet shavers out there that will be happy to take it of your hands for pretty much what you paid for it.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, good lather, hard soap</li>
            <li>Great scent, doesn&#x27;t linger much, the lather is copious, verrrry slippery and quite hydrating -- drys out slower than, for example, Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood.  </li>
            <li>This soap really rewards a very light touch on that blade.  </li>
            <li>This soap provides the best lather from any hard soap I have yet tried.  </li>
            <li>I experienced my first shave with Tabac using an open comb razor and an ASTRA DE Blade that had already been in service five times.  </li>
            <li>I find that the lather of Tabac is so full that you don&#x27;t need to load up your brush as often as with Mitchell&#x27;s soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s always pharmacy shelves full of Axe body spray for those of you who demand conformity to a manly scent.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely buy it again because of the scent and it does give a good shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in my top 3 for all-around soaps at any price point.</li>
            <li>love shave soaps and even those that are tallow-based, but Tabac isn&#x27;t really for me.  </li>
            <li>Not bad, but</li>
            <li>It certainly has a &amp;#34;nitch&amp;#34;,  and as far as I am aware of,  there are no other soaps with this unique tobacco like scent, and it comes in an attractive shaving bowl--nice to own.  </li>
            <li>and I quickly learned to ignore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the scent as well though this is the most likely reason some people do not like this soap.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Tabac Original: doing it right, doing it well.</li>
            <li>It protects your face incredibly, is slick providing great glide for your razor, and washes off your face, razor and brush easily.  </li>
            <li>Incredible shave soap, you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find a better &#x27;against the grain with a straight razor&#x27; soap, which speaks volumes about its moisture retention and slickness.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely more pricy than the other one, but it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>With a little more work and little more water, Tabac produces some of the best lather out there.  </li>
            <li>The scent is strong at first, but after a few uses it greatly subsides.</li>
            <li>Only, it&#x27;s better!  </li>
            <li>soaps are excellent and they last a very long time before they need to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is great!&lt;br /&gt;The lather is very smooth and the smell reminds me of an old time barber shop.</li>
            <li>And lastly the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>It has an odor resmbling fresh pipe tobacco.  </li>
            <li>Tabac makes a perfect lather -- not too thin and not just a pile of foam</li>
            <li>and you get a lot of it for the price, so it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>This outperforms many much more expensive products and works great for straight or double-edge shaving as well as disposable types.  </li>
            <li>just get it, the scent is that powerful and if it is just wash you face after and it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>It is well worth giving it a try.  </li>
            <li>The most remarkable thing about this soap is how much water you can add while maintaining a slick lather.  </li>
            <li>It is also such a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Give it a shot it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth every dollar....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely worth the price difference</li>
            <li>I suppose it&#x27;d be nice if they had smaller tubs</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a wet shaver for many years and have tried more shaving brush creams and soaps than I can count.</li>
            <li>Lathers quick, moderately slick, great moisturising, and provides acceptable cushion.  </li>
            <li>This soap will lather with just your fingers, but a decent brush will make it easier to get that smooth lather and apply it to your face.</li>
            <li>the shave was very close and clean.</li>
            <li>The white ceramic tub is a very nice touch, and has a clean, modern, almost bauhaus, very German design (while the English soaps come in an Olde World, Distinguished-Gentleman kind of container.)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In spite of my great attempts over the past year or so</li>
            <li>I would describe it as pleasant and relaxing, a little floral note to it.  </li>
            <li>I would also add that a decent brush goes a long way to help produce a good lather.  </li>
            <li>Aftershave 10.1 Oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tabac has a classic, manly smell that&#x27;s quite unique</li>
            <li>Not too strong, not too old man or feminine.</li>
            <li>Because Tabac shaving soap is soooo much more comfortable shave than any other shaving brands.</li>
            <li>There is simply no other soap on the market that can compare to the rich lather that is quickly and effortlessly whipped up by even the cheapest of brushes.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like it but have now begun to to like it.</li>
            <li>After that, I start working up the lather, first on my face, then chin, then neck.  </li>
            <li>Another advantage over the canned goo&#x27;s is this one jar will last literally for a year or more.</li>
            <li>The price is great and the soap will last quite a long time.  </li>
            <li>Quite possibly the most protection of the 50 (or so) soaps/creams I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lather, the scent and the lubrication are all first class.  </li>
            <li>This shave soap is pretty darn</li>
            <li>and now I enjoy the smell but in the beginning I found it to old fashioned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price - this is a more universal arguement.  </li>
            <li>Like this so much, I&#x27;ve purchased the stick version for business trips!</li>
            <li>This would be my first recommendation for a begginer&#x27;s wetshaving kit.&lt;br /&gt;Around 30 dollars for soap seems exorbitant.  </li>
            <li>Well, this product performs exactly as people says it does.  </li>
            <li>If you plan on buying your first Tabac shaving soap, do yourself a favor and buy the bowl with the soap.  </li>
            <li>The Proroso lathered up better for a smaller amount</li>
            <li>First I&#x27;ve ever tried, seems legit</li>
            <li>Granted, at first, it was a bit floral, but I have taken to it and find it to be quite pleasing.  </li>
            <li>I must also point out that my technique has gotten much better than the initial review</li>
            <li>so I thought a much higher priced soap like Tabac will give me a shave that is out of this world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell is enjoyable enough for me.</li>
            <li>Really lathers up quickly, about 30 seconds and its ready to go.  </li>
            <li>I understand that it has a loyal following and is not a poor performer, but it&#x27;s tough to justify it when there are so many better performing and better smelling products out</li>
            <li>has a light, pleasing \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; scent that doesn&#x27;t linger much...</li>
            <li>The Tabac lathers so easily and so nicely I can use it with my straight edge razors, but it is also not too thick a lather to clog the disposables.  </li>
            <li>I have tried and used a few different shaving soaps over the years and by far the Tabac is the most pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li>It is light and barely noticeable while lathering.  </li>
            <li>Has a good smell and a slick lather.</li>
            <li>I am an experienced wet shaver for over fifty years and am used to decent glycerin based soap pucks, whether Col Conk brand or the generic types that are sold for about a dollar each from Atlanta Barber Supply.  </li>
            <li>It stays moist enough t produce a smooth, consistent shave.  </li>
            <li>pure heaven...........</li>
            <li>Tabac certainly did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li>Pairs well with Fine Accouterments American Blend.</li>
            <li>It is not a modern fragrance, but if classic scents like Sandalwood, Old Spice, and the original Clubman scent are in your lineup, believe this will fit right in.</li>
            <li>I have used this with hard and soft waters and had no problem in generating a great lather</li>
            <li>That allows them to be very slippery</li>
            <li>Tabac has a rather strange/funky scent that I really can&#x27;t place or put a name to</li>
            <li>Mitchell&#x27;s not so much without additional work but still not as slick.&lt;br /&gt;6.  </li>
            <li>Like I said this stuff is much cheaper when you buy a refill than the biggest tube of Proraso.</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loves the smell of it, and that&#x27;s what matters.  </li>
            <li>As gross as it may sound, it works.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also really owe it to yourself to try Tabac&#x27;s men&#x27;s aftershave [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I can get a much closer shave with Tabac without razor burn.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a shaving soap!</li>
            <li>I had the hardest time finding a shaving cream/soap that I could use with both a straight edge razor and a run of the mill disposable (Gillete, Schick, etc.).  </li>
            <li>and I really like using it.</li>
            <li>It loads up in no time, and then I stick it in the scuttle until I&#x27;m ready for it.</li>
            <li>The scent compliments the Tabac aftershave very well.</li>
            <li>As scent is subjective won&#x27;t dock it too much there.  </li>
            <li>Most wet shavers agree that this is one of the &#x27;holy grail&#x27; soaps.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Tabac really makes a difference over canned shave cream.</li>
            <li>Too, the shaves are closer, which is something I really like.  </li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lather very well for a premium product;  Very overpriced.</li>
            <li>I purchased Tabac shaving soap from one of my favorite online wet shaving suppliers</li>
            <li>The scent, in my opinion, is very &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The soap takes water well and really softens the beard.</li>
            <li>Woodsy, very spicy scent;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, I expected better for the price.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t let the beard soften (even with substantial amounts of water), nor does it provide much protection against abrasion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, it probably costs about twice what it really should cost.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very pleasing to me.  </li>
            <li>It seems a bit pricey, but the bowl is re-usable and the soap really lasts.  </li>
            <li>None of them offered nearly the protection and smooth shaving action that the Tabac does.</li>
            <li>Soak your brush in warm water for a few minutes then work the soap.</li>
            <li>And it works 10x better than other brands that cost 2 or 3 times as much.  </li>
            <li>(Tabac Original came out in 1959, the same year i was born).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some soaps very bubbly and take more effort, this is just creamy from the first few swirls in the bowl.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You may want to try other soaps and creams for the fun of it, but pick up a jar of Tabac Original for your core shaving kit.  </li>
            <li>If you use an old-fashioned straight edge or double-edged safety razor this is about as high quality a shave soap as you can find.</li>
            <li>Smells old-school of warm florals, baby power, and soapiness, very little citrus in spite of what the description implies.  </li>
            <li>The smell was initially a bit off-putting, but as others have stated, you do get used to it after a couple shaves and it&#x27;s not bad at all (IMHO).</li>
            <li>I placed the open containers in warm water while I get other things really to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even without any cologne or scented aftershave the scent of the soap alone is masculine and pleasant and subtle.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like it</li>
            <li>Maybe I bought an older product, but the scent lasted about 10 minutes and faded away.</li>
            <li>Lubrication is really good, but when it gets thin it doesn&#x27;t really lubricate.  </li>
            <li>Some people who shave several times a week (3 or more) say they have gotten 6-8months MINIMUM from this soap; put it in a rotation and it will last for years.  </li>
            <li>The lather is more easily controlled than other shaving soaps (Castle Forbes was a bit more difficult to get a decent lather).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still fairly new to traditional wet shaving but have already spend a small fortune finding the best brush/razor/soap/blades for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get out of this 4.4 oz puck, but thus far, the puck is very resilient, unlike Cella and Proraso which are softer and therefore get used up</li>
            <li>I have tried Proraso Green and Red soaps, both are solid soaps at a great price.</li>
            <li>The soap puck seems like it will last for a year or so, so it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>My dislike mostly comes from the scent, it is copious and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>only gripe is that Tabac seems to take a bit more effort to rinse the residue off when done shaving, but this is quite minor and the soap otherwise  seems to have moisturizing effect.  </li>
            <li>Nice thick lather that doesn&#x27;t fade away as you shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several brushes, but my Semogue 830 boar seems just right to load the soap and get it on my face.</li>
            <li>I continue to try new products, techniques and pass along this knowledge to newcomers.  </li>
            <li>If you are new to face lathering, try this soap...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to shaving with a DE razor after about 30 years of using cheap double blade disposables.  </li>
            <li>fragrance is not bad, but I find that it just lingers for far too long after shaving.  </li>
            <li>After running out of my first puck, even though I have several other options that I enjoy, I missed the Tabac.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more time spent, but the results are well worth it.</li>
            <li>It definitely exceeds most other soaps I&#x27;ve used in this department.</li>
            <li>Each of those products has had a learning curve where I would have to determine the right amount of water to have in the brush, the right pressure to use, and perhaps a few other variables to getting a good lather- not true when I&#x27;ve traveled and shaved in soft water conditions.  </li>
            <li>The lather keep hydrated and does not dry out quickly, and the level of cushion (the elusive aspect of razor protection that wetshavers harp on) is simply unbeatable.  </li>
            <li>Lathers quite easily and very little is needed to get a decent shave.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my hubby; it creates a smooth, creamy lather and smells slightly of Tabac (</li>
            <li>It reminds me of a sumptuous mahogany library filled with leather bound books, with a slightly woody aroma.</li>
            <li>This soap will last a lifetime, I have had this one for several months and the container is still 80% full.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but thought I&#x27;d give Tabac a try, since many people seem to like it so much.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a strong smelling musky soap, but honestly did not find it bad at all.</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding option for those of you with hard water, as I have.  </li>
            <li>The smell of the soap is mild yet masculine, and does not conflict with any other fragrances.  </li>
            <li>Minimal effort needed to whip up good lather even with hard water.</li>
            <li>provided you put a little water on the puck first to hydrate and break down the top layer.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately I cannot come to terms with the scent, which is exactly the smell you get when you first walk into a cheap motel room.  </li>
            <li>-- that old barbershop smell that</li>
            <li>Proraso (all kinds), D.R.Harris, Old Williams etc</li>
            <li>4 pass shave with no irritation at all (first in a long time).  </li>
            <li>It has prolonged my blade life far beyond what I used to get when using a canned goo and Tabac</li>
            <li>Old Man\\&quot; feel about it.</li>
            <li>It lathers up far easier and faster than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I bring the loaded brush up to my skin and lather on the face directly.</li>
            <li>They were classy people</li>
            <li>It fits in the hand well and looks classy in the shave</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really hang on or interfere with subsequent aftershave or colognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kinda does smell like an old man barber shop ..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too loud tho</li>
            <li>your into wet shaving, give it a try, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>However, for this price, I can purchase Arko, and coconut oil (plus some essential oils) to provide the missing moisturising, and be just as satisfied with the shave, without the lingering scent.</li>
            <li>Makes a thick, creamy, phenomenal lather.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scent - Probably the most subjective factor regarding this soap which is very polarizing; either you love it or hate it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a cool old-world smoky scent and one of these tubs will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I could feel my face getting dry after the first cheek.</li>
            <li>Tabac original by Maurer &amp; Wirtz is an essential part of any man&#x27;s wet shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is also a pretty big chunk of soap that is going to last you</li>
            <li>The puck is quite a bit larger than most shave soaps I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>The scent is certainly polarizing, but if you keep the lid off for long stretches, it does modify somewhat.</li>
            <li>Works really well, lathers creamy and the lather lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m exactly one year into wet shaving with a DE safety razor, and this is.</li>
            <li>Smells like a European airline toilet when you first start using it.</li>
            <li>However, this will last me at least 18 months, or more.  </li>
            <li>the economical go-to soaps for wet shavers (Such as Proraso, Arko, and others).  </li>
            <li>Tabacs lather is very full and very slick.  </li>
            <li>This will definitely be a major part of my rotation.  </li>
            <li>It lathers like no other soap I have tried to date</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products, including Proraso and The Real Shaving Company creams, and Colonel Conk and Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood soaps.  </li>
            <li>Trumpers cream, another good soap and Truefitt and Hill which is the worst soap short of a very cheap one I used to use.</li>
            <li>According to my local municipality, we average about 130 mg/L total hardness over the course of the year, and one of my biggest challenges to shaving has been learning to get a good lather with hard water.  </li>
            <li>The blade does not drag over the skin</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t dry the face out, even after a particularly painstaking shave session...</li>
            <li>Definitely needed to be aired out.</li>
            <li>The lather is creamier than anything I&#x27;ve tried thus far in my (as yet short) wet-shaving history.</li>
            <li>From my experience so far, about two weeks of use, the jar will last about a year.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and neck whiskers that grow in different directions on both sides.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very subtle and I tend to have to swirl it more than I&#x27;d like to get the lather (I do not typically shave everything,</li>
            <li>Lathers quickly and keeps the face hydrated and slick during the shave.</li>
            <li>The soap created a super slick cushion on my face.</li>
            <li>It lathers reasonably, but does not lather as well as other tallow-based soaps.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Tabac shaving soap has a rich thick lather but almost no slickness.</li>
            <li>With daily use one puck will last nearly a year.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing that leaving my brush a little more wet than usual is what really brought out the quality of the shave</li>
            <li>Lathers up to a rich, thick foam that doesn&#x27;t deteriorate after a few minutes... lubes the skin to protect the skin from the razor very well...</li>
            <li>It produces a smooth, slick lather, with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li>For those of you new to wet shaving, a proper lather is absolutely critical to getting a quality shave.  </li>
            <li>shave soap is really good even a little expensive though I do not care of price but quality like this shave soap.</li>

            <li> This product has many detailed reviews so I will just say this shave soap is the best I have come across.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> : Consistently gives the best shaves I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> Yeah this shaving soap is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> albeit after a bit more work than the creams take!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great lather that is easy to control in terms of thickness.  </li>
            <li> As for the scent, it&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li> It handily outperforms Proraso menthol/eucalyptus (one of my favorites for the smell) and even Truefitt and Hill creams, which is saying something.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get quite a lot of product for the money and it comes in nice glass/ceramic tub that does not look out of place in a bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased to have it in my rotation, but not a soap I would use every day because it is so good.  </li>
            <li> It also lathers up quite nicely...</li>
            <li> The glass jar is nice as well.</li>
            <li> This will be the best soap for everyone that wants to start wetshaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the bowl is quite nice.  </li>
            <li> It lathers nicely ..</li>
            <li> Lathers beautifully and quickly.  </li>
            <li> Tabac Original is a great quality product.  </li>
            <li> Most of the good competitive tallow soaps cost considerably more.  </li>
            <li> Good soap, nice bowl, lid is cheap feeling plastic though.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to give this a try - and I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m very glad I did.</li>
            <li> Best shaving soap that I have used so far (compared to Edwin Jagger, Dr. Dittmar, van der Hagen, etc.)</li>
            <li> There is also a matching Tabac after shave bottle, that is worth having that makes an attractive combination set.</li>
            <li> With a good quality brush you can make mounds of rich, hydrating lather.  </li>
            <li> May sound a bit off-putting but in fact, it&#x27;s a great, rich, evocative aroma.  </li>
            <li> Tallow soaps, in spite of their generally excellent performance, are generally considered to be lower-cost ingredients compared to vegetable alternatives.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now it just smells like a very lightly scented soap.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it is very smooth.</li>
            <li> It has lubricating properties that aren&#x27;t found in many soaps.  </li>
            <li> Most of those are not tallow based.  </li>
            <li> Probably not a repeat buy since there are better smelling products out there -i.e.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad you did</li>
            <li> and like it so much, that I&#x27;ll be buying the aftershave too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was great</li>
            <li> my ALL TIME FAVORITE aftershave, which he also wears).  </li>
            <li> I swear the blade cuts better with this than with barbasol goop or TooBS soap.</li>
            <li> So I wouldn&#x27;t let too many comments about the scent steer you away.</li>
            <li> Longer than any cream ever will for sure.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I love the fragrance--it reminds me of an old-time barber shop.  </li>
            <li> How many times have I heard myself say that?</li>
            <li> This is the most sought after shaving soap in the world.</li>
            <li> With Van Der Hagen shave soap it didn&#x27;t do that all too well, now with Tabac shave soap I am able to shave against the grain on my mustache area unlike when I had Van Der Hagen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried so many shave soaps.</li>
            <li> Many from Phoenix artisan, Proraso, cella, Williams mug, van der Hagen.</li>
            <li> Lathers like a dream, even better with distilled water.</li>
            <li> Some soaps were better than others.  </li>
            <li> And, when I have to shave more than once a day</li>
            <li> soap is excellent and sits on the same level as Mitchell&#x27;s wool fat shaving soap.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic.  </li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s more soapy than lotiony (are those even words?</li>
            <li> Scent is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It gives me zero irritation and I love the scent.  </li>
            <li> The scent is prominent without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many shaves</li>
            <li> On this journey I have found my favorite brush and razor etc.</li>
            <li> The longevity of the soap is also outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Overall more impressed with the lather density.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible ..</li>
            <li> Also, the lather is very rich and much more protective than others.  </li>
            <li> max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ability to make the whiskers of the face soft and easy to cut is very good.  </li>
            <li> Smoke the occasional good cigar and this lather reminds me of a wonderful combination of tobacco and single-malt and and leather (the good stuff NOT English Leather!)</li>
            <li> It probably isn&#x27;t ideal for someone that just simply wants the best possible or economical shave.  </li>
            <li> When I do, it&#x27;s warm and even creamier, so it covers your beard quickly, and starts to soften the hair immediately.</li>
            <li> Gives the best and closest shave, but it may make my skin a bit dry.  </li>
            <li> Works well, but I&#x27;ve tried others like &amp;#34;Kiss MY Face&amp;#34; shaving cream which lathers bore easily and has much more lubricity to it to make the razor glide over my skin as if there weren&#x27;t a blade in it.</li>
            <li> Easy to lather.&lt;br /&gt;Unusual scent that people either love or hate.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> This has a strong fragnance that stays on for the rest of the day, love to shave with this every day</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice white glass lidded bowl that looks great all with all your shave gear.  </li>
            <li> Great old school smell - my wife loves it!  </li>
            <li> The product has a great old time soap smell.  </li>
            <li> Tabac lathers good works very well  </li>
            <li> Good shaving soap, but not as much lubricity as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> The Mitchell&#x27;s soap has a very light clean smell that no one can object to.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> The milk glass bowl is very attractive, and the lather definitely aids in getting a clean, close, and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> wool fat shaving soap&amp;#34; a little better, but this stuff is still excellent.  </li>
            <li> The Tabac lathers very quickly.  </li>
            <li> , it came in very quickly</li>
            <li> how easy it is to lather (with a brush) and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> It lathers very quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry about the strong smell when it is opened - this fades after a day or two.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, very pleased and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It is one of the best and highest value shaving products on the market (along with proraso and speick) hands down.</li>
            <li> Tabac has that nice fresh and clean scent I like.</li>
            <li> Absolutely as described and more!</li>
            <li> Amazing packaging!&lt;br /&gt;The elegant plastic windowed box, which was also taped, was a nice, heavy ceramic jar with a brown top and a nice big soap, with a good scent.  </li>
            <li> Great shave and no irritation, doesn&#x27;t feel dry afterwards but it feels like it washes very clean.</li>
            <li> Think sex, sweat, grimy rug, cheap perfume, dust, and of course cigarette smoke.  </li>
            <li> I started with an Edwin Jagger DE86 and the Tabac shaving soap and couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth my face was.  </li>
            <li> And the smell of the Tabac is fantastic</li>
            <li> This is one of the nicest shaving soaps available anywhere in the world.</li>
            <li> Overall great product.</li>
            <li> Not only does it feel great</li>
            <li> Lathers like a champ, smooth shave every time.</li>
            <li> (my Lady likes my face smooth), I do so without fear of shave burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can now honestly say that I really like Tabac soap</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s an important part of my shave den.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy shaving with this soap.</li>
            <li> Tabac really allows me to make some nice close passes without fear of razor burn.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow this is good stuff.  </li>
            <li> The absolute standard for a perfect lather.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough--my desert island soap for sure!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, live large - it produces a rich and soft lather that sets up your beard for a great shave and the smell lingers - in a good way.</li>
            <li> It quickly forms a rich thick lather and provides excellent lubrication for a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Makes for a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Tabac Original is superior in pretty much every way.</li>
            <li> I tend to load really my brush up for a more luxurious lather, but you can get 3 passes easily with 20-30 seconds of loading</li>
            <li> Tabac Original is made from tallow.  </li>
            <li> It lathers up to a rich creamy lather in the brush.  </li>
            <li> The Tabac Original does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> B000C1VZX8 Tabac Original By Maurer &amp; Wirtz For Men.</li>
            <li> Plus the packaging is pretty elaborate, which also must be factored into the cost.  </li>
            <li> B000GHYXG4 Tabac Original By Maurer &amp; Wirtz For Men.</li>
            <li> IMHO, not as good as a few, but way better than most.  </li>
            <li> The lather in incredibly rich.</li>
            <li> I get excited.</li>
            <li> wanted to get an original product from germany.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a permanent home for an original product.</li>
            <li> And if you still don&#x27;t like it after you&#x27;ve given it a fair shot, there are plenty of wet shavers out there that will be happy to take it of your hands for pretty much what you paid for it.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, good lather, hard soap</li>
            <li> Great scent, doesn&#x27;t linger much, the lather is copious, verrrry slippery and quite hydrating -- drys out slower than, for example, Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood.  </li>
            <li> This soap really rewards a very light touch on that blade.  </li>
            <li> This soap provides the best lather from any hard soap I have yet tried.  </li>
            <li> I experienced my first shave with Tabac using an open comb razor and an ASTRA DE Blade that had already been in service five times.  </li>
            <li> I find that the lather of Tabac is so full that you don&#x27;t need to load up your brush as often as with Mitchell&#x27;s soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s always pharmacy shelves full of Axe body spray for those of you who demand conformity to a manly scent.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely buy it again because of the scent and it does give a good shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in my top 3 for all-around soaps at any price point.</li>
            <li> love shave soaps and even those that are tallow-based, but Tabac isn&#x27;t really for me.  </li>
            <li> Not bad, but</li>
            <li> It certainly has a &amp;#34;nitch&amp;#34;,  and as far as I am aware of,  there are no other soaps with this unique tobacco like scent, and it comes in an attractive shaving bowl--nice to own.  </li>
            <li> and I quickly learned to ignore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the scent as well though this is the most likely reason some people do not like this soap.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Tabac Original: doing it right, doing it well.</li>
            <li> It protects your face incredibly, is slick providing great glide for your razor, and washes off your face, razor and brush easily.  </li>
            <li> Incredible shave soap, you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find a better &#x27;against the grain with a straight razor&#x27; soap, which speaks volumes about its moisture retention and slickness.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely more pricy than the other one, but it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> With a little more work and little more water, Tabac produces some of the best lather out there.  </li>
            <li> The scent is strong at first, but after a few uses it greatly subsides.</li>
            <li> Only, it&#x27;s better!  </li>
            <li> soaps are excellent and they last a very long time before they need to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!&lt;br /&gt;The lather is very smooth and the smell reminds me of an old time barber shop.</li>
            <li> And lastly the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> It has an odor resmbling fresh pipe tobacco.  </li>
            <li> Tabac makes a perfect lather -- not too thin and not just a pile of foam</li>
            <li> and you get a lot of it for the price, so it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li> This outperforms many much more expensive products and works great for straight or double-edge shaving as well as disposable types.  </li>
            <li> just get it, the scent is that powerful and if it is just wash you face after and it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> It is well worth giving it a try.  </li>
            <li> The most remarkable thing about this soap is how much water you can add while maintaining a slick lather.  </li>
            <li> It is also such a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Give it a shot it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth every dollar....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely worth the price difference</li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;d be nice if they had smaller tubs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a wet shaver for many years and have tried more shaving brush creams and soaps than I can count.</li>
            <li> Lathers quick, moderately slick, great moisturising, and provides acceptable cushion.  </li>
            <li> This soap will lather with just your fingers, but a decent brush will make it easier to get that smooth lather and apply it to your face.</li>
            <li> the shave was very close and clean.</li>
            <li> The white ceramic tub is a very nice touch, and has a clean, modern, almost bauhaus, very German design (while the English soaps come in an Olde World, Distinguished-Gentleman kind of container.)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In spite of my great attempts over the past year or so</li>
            <li> I would describe it as pleasant and relaxing, a little floral note to it.  </li>
            <li> I would also add that a decent brush goes a long way to help produce a good lather.  </li>
            <li> Aftershave 10.1 Oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tabac has a classic, manly smell that&#x27;s quite unique</li>
            <li> Not too strong, not too old man or feminine.</li>
            <li> Because Tabac shaving soap is soooo much more comfortable shave than any other shaving brands.</li>
            <li> There is simply no other soap on the market that can compare to the rich lather that is quickly and effortlessly whipped up by even the cheapest of brushes.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like it but have now begun to to like it.</li>
            <li> After that, I start working up the lather, first on my face, then chin, then neck.  </li>
            <li> Another advantage over the canned goo&#x27;s is this one jar will last literally for a year or more.</li>
            <li> The price is great and the soap will last quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> Quite possibly the most protection of the 50 (or so) soaps/creams I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lather, the scent and the lubrication are all first class.  </li>
            <li> This shave soap is pretty darn</li>
            <li> and now I enjoy the smell but in the beginning I found it to old fashioned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price - this is a more universal arguement.  </li>
            <li> Like this so much, I&#x27;ve purchased the stick version for business trips!</li>
            <li> This would be my first recommendation for a begginer&#x27;s wetshaving kit.&lt;br /&gt;Around 30 dollars for soap seems exorbitant.  </li>
            <li> Well, this product performs exactly as people says it does.  </li>
            <li> If you plan on buying your first Tabac shaving soap, do yourself a favor and buy the bowl with the soap.  </li>
            <li> The Proroso lathered up better for a smaller amount</li>
            <li> First I&#x27;ve ever tried, seems legit</li>
            <li> Granted, at first, it was a bit floral, but I have taken to it and find it to be quite pleasing.  </li>
            <li> I must also point out that my technique has gotten much better than the initial review</li>
            <li> so I thought a much higher priced soap like Tabac will give me a shave that is out of this world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smell is enjoyable enough for me.</li>
            <li> Really lathers up quickly, about 30 seconds and its ready to go.  </li>
            <li> I understand that it has a loyal following and is not a poor performer, but it&#x27;s tough to justify it when there are so many better performing and better smelling products out</li>
            <li> has a light, pleasing \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; scent that doesn&#x27;t linger much...</li>
            <li> The Tabac lathers so easily and so nicely I can use it with my straight edge razors, but it is also not too thick a lather to clog the disposables.  </li>
            <li> I have tried and used a few different shaving soaps over the years and by far the Tabac is the most pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li> It is light and barely noticeable while lathering.  </li>
            <li> Has a good smell and a slick lather.</li>
            <li> I am an experienced wet shaver for over fifty years and am used to decent glycerin based soap pucks, whether Col Conk brand or the generic types that are sold for about a dollar each from Atlanta Barber Supply.  </li>
            <li> It stays moist enough t produce a smooth, consistent shave.  </li>
            <li> pure heaven...........</li>
            <li> Tabac certainly did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li> Pairs well with Fine Accouterments American Blend.</li>
            <li> It is not a modern fragrance, but if classic scents like Sandalwood, Old Spice, and the original Clubman scent are in your lineup, believe this will fit right in.</li>
            <li> I have used this with hard and soft waters and had no problem in generating a great lather</li>
            <li> That allows them to be very slippery</li>
            <li> Tabac has a rather strange/funky scent that I really can&#x27;t place or put a name to</li>
            <li> Mitchell&#x27;s not so much without additional work but still not as slick.&lt;br /&gt;6.  </li>
            <li> Like I said this stuff is much cheaper when you buy a refill than the biggest tube of Proraso.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves the smell of it, and that&#x27;s what matters.  </li>
            <li> As gross as it may sound, it works.  </li>
            <li> I really like the smell.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also really owe it to yourself to try Tabac&#x27;s men&#x27;s aftershave [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I can get a much closer shave with Tabac without razor burn.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a shaving soap!</li>
            <li> I had the hardest time finding a shaving cream/soap that I could use with both a straight edge razor and a run of the mill disposable (Gillete, Schick, etc.).  </li>
            <li> and I really like using it.</li>
            <li> It loads up in no time, and then I stick it in the scuttle until I&#x27;m ready for it.</li>
            <li> The scent compliments the Tabac aftershave very well.</li>
            <li> As scent is subjective won&#x27;t dock it too much there.  </li>
            <li> Most wet shavers agree that this is one of the &#x27;holy grail&#x27; soaps.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Tabac really makes a difference over canned shave cream.</li>
            <li> Too, the shaves are closer, which is something I really like.  </li>
            <li> haha)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather very well for a premium product;  Very overpriced.</li>
            <li> I purchased Tabac shaving soap from one of my favorite online wet shaving suppliers</li>
            <li> The scent, in my opinion, is very &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The soap takes water well and really softens the beard.</li>
            <li> Woodsy, very spicy scent;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, I expected better for the price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t let the beard soften (even with substantial amounts of water), nor does it provide much protection against abrasion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, it probably costs about twice what it really should cost.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very pleasing to me.  </li>
            <li> It seems a bit pricey, but the bowl is re-usable and the soap really lasts.  </li>
            <li> None of them offered nearly the protection and smooth shaving action that the Tabac does.</li>
            <li> Soak your brush in warm water for a few minutes then work the soap.</li>
            <li> And it works 10x better than other brands that cost 2 or 3 times as much.  </li>
            <li> (Tabac Original came out in 1959, the same year i was born).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some soaps very bubbly and take more effort, this is just creamy from the first few swirls in the bowl.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You may want to try other soaps and creams for the fun of it, but pick up a jar of Tabac Original for your core shaving kit.  </li>
            <li> If you use an old-fashioned straight edge or double-edged safety razor this is about as high quality a shave soap as you can find.</li>
            <li> Smells old-school of warm florals, baby power, and soapiness, very little citrus in spite of what the description implies.  </li>
            <li> The smell was initially a bit off-putting, but as others have stated, you do get used to it after a couple shaves and it&#x27;s not bad at all (IMHO).</li>
            <li> I placed the open containers in warm water while I get other things really to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even without any cologne or scented aftershave the scent of the soap alone is masculine and pleasant and subtle.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like it</li>
            <li> Maybe I bought an older product, but the scent lasted about 10 minutes and faded away.</li>
            <li> Lubrication is really good, but when it gets thin it doesn&#x27;t really lubricate.  </li>
            <li> Some people who shave several times a week (3 or more) say they have gotten 6-8months MINIMUM from this soap; put it in a rotation and it will last for years.  </li>
            <li> The lather is more easily controlled than other shaving soaps (Castle Forbes was a bit more difficult to get a decent lather).  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still fairly new to traditional wet shaving but have already spend a small fortune finding the best brush/razor/soap/blades for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get out of this 4.4 oz puck, but thus far, the puck is very resilient, unlike Cella and Proraso which are softer and therefore get used up</li>
            <li> I have tried Proraso Green and Red soaps, both are solid soaps at a great price.</li>
            <li> The soap puck seems like it will last for a year or so, so it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> My dislike mostly comes from the scent, it is copious and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> only gripe is that Tabac seems to take a bit more effort to rinse the residue off when done shaving, but this is quite minor and the soap otherwise  seems to have moisturizing effect.  </li>
            <li> Nice thick lather that doesn&#x27;t fade away as you shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several brushes, but my Semogue 830 boar seems just right to load the soap and get it on my face.</li>
            <li> I continue to try new products, techniques and pass along this knowledge to newcomers.  </li>
            <li> If you are new to face lathering, try this soap...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to shaving with a DE razor after about 30 years of using cheap double blade disposables.  </li>
            <li> fragrance is not bad, but I find that it just lingers for far too long after shaving.  </li>
            <li> After running out of my first puck, even though I have several other options that I enjoy, I missed the Tabac.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more time spent, but the results are well worth it.</li>
            <li> It definitely exceeds most other soaps I&#x27;ve used in this department.</li>
            <li> Each of those products has had a learning curve where I would have to determine the right amount of water to have in the brush, the right pressure to use, and perhaps a few other variables to getting a good lather- not true when I&#x27;ve traveled and shaved in soft water conditions.  </li>
            <li> The lather keep hydrated and does not dry out quickly, and the level of cushion (the elusive aspect of razor protection that wetshavers harp on) is simply unbeatable.  </li>
            <li> Lathers quite easily and very little is needed to get a decent shave.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hubby; it creates a smooth, creamy lather and smells slightly of Tabac (</li>
            <li> It reminds me of a sumptuous mahogany library filled with leather bound books, with a slightly woody aroma.</li>
            <li> This soap will last a lifetime, I have had this one for several months and the container is still 80% full.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but thought I&#x27;d give Tabac a try, since many people seem to like it so much.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a strong smelling musky soap, but honestly did not find it bad at all.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding option for those of you with hard water, as I have.  </li>
            <li> The smell of the soap is mild yet masculine, and does not conflict with any other fragrances.  </li>
            <li> Minimal effort needed to whip up good lather even with hard water.</li>
            <li> provided you put a little water on the puck first to hydrate and break down the top layer.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I cannot come to terms with the scent, which is exactly the smell you get when you first walk into a cheap motel room.  </li>
            <li> -- that old barbershop smell that</li>
            <li> Proraso (all kinds), D.R.Harris, Old Williams etc</li>
            <li> 4 pass shave with no irritation at all (first in a long time).  </li>
            <li> It has prolonged my blade life far beyond what I used to get when using a canned goo and Tabac</li>
            <li> Old Man\\&quot; feel about it.</li>
            <li> It lathers up far easier and faster than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I bring the loaded brush up to my skin and lather on the face directly.</li>
            <li> They were classy people</li>
            <li> It fits in the hand well and looks classy in the shave</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really hang on or interfere with subsequent aftershave or colognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Kinda does smell like an old man barber shop ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too loud tho</li>
            <li> your into wet shaving, give it a try, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> However, for this price, I can purchase Arko, and coconut oil (plus some essential oils) to provide the missing moisturising, and be just as satisfied with the shave, without the lingering scent.</li>
            <li> Makes a thick, creamy, phenomenal lather.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scent - Probably the most subjective factor regarding this soap which is very polarizing; either you love it or hate it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a cool old-world smoky scent and one of these tubs will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I could feel my face getting dry after the first cheek.</li>
            <li> Tabac original by Maurer &amp; Wirtz is an essential part of any man&#x27;s wet shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is also a pretty big chunk of soap that is going to last you</li>
            <li> The puck is quite a bit larger than most shave soaps I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> The scent is certainly polarizing, but if you keep the lid off for long stretches, it does modify somewhat.</li>
            <li> Works really well, lathers creamy and the lather lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m exactly one year into wet shaving with a DE safety razor, and this is.</li>
            <li> Smells like a European airline toilet when you first start using it.</li>
            <li> However, this will last me at least 18 months, or more.  </li>
            <li> the economical go-to soaps for wet shavers (Such as Proraso, Arko, and others).  </li>
            <li> Tabacs lather is very full and very slick.  </li>
            <li> This will definitely be a major part of my rotation.  </li>
            <li> It lathers like no other soap I have tried to date</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products, including Proraso and The Real Shaving Company creams, and Colonel Conk and Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood soaps.  </li>
            <li> Trumpers cream, another good soap and Truefitt and Hill which is the worst soap short of a very cheap one I used to use.</li>
            <li> According to my local municipality, we average about 130 mg/L total hardness over the course of the year, and one of my biggest challenges to shaving has been learning to get a good lather with hard water.  </li>
            <li> The blade does not drag over the skin</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry the face out, even after a particularly painstaking shave session...</li>
            <li> Definitely needed to be aired out.</li>
            <li> The lather is creamier than anything I&#x27;ve tried thus far in my (as yet short) wet-shaving history.</li>
            <li> From my experience so far, about two weeks of use, the jar will last about a year.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and neck whiskers that grow in different directions on both sides.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very subtle and I tend to have to swirl it more than I&#x27;d like to get the lather (I do not typically shave everything,</li>
            <li> Lathers quickly and keeps the face hydrated and slick during the shave.</li>
            <li> The soap created a super slick cushion on my face.</li>
            <li> It lathers reasonably, but does not lather as well as other tallow-based soaps.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Tabac shaving soap has a rich thick lather but almost no slickness.</li>
            <li> With daily use one puck will last nearly a year.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that leaving my brush a little more wet than usual is what really brought out the quality of the shave</li>
            <li> Lathers up to a rich, thick foam that doesn&#x27;t deteriorate after a few minutes... lubes the skin to protect the skin from the razor very well...</li>
            <li> It produces a smooth, slick lather, with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> For those of you new to wet shaving, a proper lather is absolutely critical to getting a quality shave.  </li>
            <li> shave soap is really good even a little expensive though I do not care of price but quality like this shave soap.</li>
            <li> Tabac is a little steep compared to other soaps like Cella and Proraso, but in the end it is easily worth it.  </li>
            <li> The bowl is both solid and unobtrusive, taking up far less room than would a generic bowl, and if you are someone with multiple soaps in rotation it helps to have specific bowls for each one.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really whips up into a thick and slick lather that the razor glides right through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The funky smell eventually diminishes after several uses and it does last a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m bumping up my rating from 3 to about 4.25 but leaving as 4 stars overall because it is quite expensive...still I&#x27;ve been using in on and off for like 3 months and it hasn&#x27;t shrunk much so it is long lasting.</li>
            <li> but I started getting much better shaves with Tabac now and the lather is now thick and also slick.</li>
            <li> A product every shaver should try at least once, as it is definitely different in a positive way.</li>
            <li> I usually use my straight edge on the weekends with the disposables during the week.  </li>
            <li> so it takes a while to lather but will last a long time.</li>
            <li> A shave burns\\&quot; is normal for me, each and everyday.</li>
            <li> In addition, I&#x27;ve found whipping up a lather in my Georgetown Pottery G5 Shaving Scuttle is easier than almost all other soaps I&#x27;ve tried, the lather does not dry out, and will easily last for three or four passes.</li>
            <li> One puck of this soap will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I dry my brush on a rack in the bathroom, and the entire bathroom has the scent of this soap when you walk in.</li>
            <li> about 5 to 6 turns on the disk and the lather that occurred was enormous, thick and slick, with a light scent, not too much.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> With the thick, protective, slick lather that Tabac provided, the used Astra blade felt like it had just been unwrapped new for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about Tabac for a long time</li>
            <li> Between this and my tub of Proraso, I am set for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> a long time- consider this when you see the price.  </li>
            <li> After reading about the scent in numerous online forums, it wasn&#x27;t quite what I had expected.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to place the smell for a long time.</li>
            <li> Depending on how much you decide to load the brush every time you shave, it can be expected that this soap will last at the very least half a year, but likely far longer.  </li>
            <li> Since Tabacs lather is very slick, the blade slides much easiler over the skin.  </li>
            <li> And admitting that it&#x27;s been around as long as Ii have doesn&#x27;t help!</li>
            <li> Very slick lather that makes the shave much easier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a hip, new fragrance, and a lot of newbies to the game of wet shaving seem to overlook the fact that this fragrance is over 50+ years old.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out or burn.</li>
            <li> If you are one of them, leave it open for a few days and the scent will fade a little without disappearing completely.  </li>
            <li> I mean, the Taylor tub cream didn&#x27;t even come with a snazzy ceramic bowl to refill and become an heirloom along with my Merkur Classic.</li>
            <li> You could probably get a similar shave from an average bar of tallow soap.</li>
            <li> It does not irritate the skin like some soaps can (especially genorously scented ones), and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I am sure that anyone who knows how to work up a proper lather will not be disappointed in this Quality Shave Soap.</li>
            <li> But my skin was very dry even after my aftershave balm.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work, and almost made a big mess.</li>
            <li> The soap is long-lasting and looks like it will last for at least a year of daily shaving use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a big advantage in those trouble spots.</li>
            <li> I wet my Omega synthetic and gave it about 20 swirls on the soap.</li>
            <li> Parker badger brush slightly wet got</li>
            <li> The puck is also hard so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a hard soap and the puck is 4.4oz should last a long time.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long this stuff will last as a little bit of Proraso</li>
            <li> I use it in a rotation with other shaving creams and soaps.  </li>
            <li> like I had seen suggested for other soaps...</li>
            <li> burn\\&quot; when I shave too close with other soaps.  </li>
            <li> Works extremely well with a EJ DE razor.</li>
            <li> From other reviews you can tell that the purchase of this soap is a no brainer.</li>
            <li> and I prefer the small and tingly feeling, but this Tabac is still a solid choice.</li>
            <li> Well I kept on using Tabac soap and tried some other stuff as well</li>
            <li> Worst case scenario, if the scent bothers that much just wash your face with ivory or dove soap when you&#x27;re done shaving; 90% of it will be gone and you&#x27;ll have a clean palate for your scent of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the product, but I also like other products, some are half the price.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is fantastic never get a bad shave again.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the Taylor of Old Bond St. tub creams, aerosol creams of all colors and flavors, and the Shave Secret shave oil,</li>
            <li> I appear to be down to just liking this soap, DR Harris Arlington, and Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat of the ~10 I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This soap makes me feel like I could chop down a tree with an axe, dig a ditch with a pickaxe, and kill a bear with a hunting knife.</li>
            <li> or if they can pull down the price.</li>
            <li> It produces a very rich, creamy base that protects your skin each and every shave.  </li>
            <li> so that isn&#x27;t a bad thing, at least to me :)</li>
            <li> I can shave with less fear of getting nicked when I use it.  </li>
            <li> and so you get less nicks</li>
            <li> /&gt;Taking previous reviewers advice, I did spend a minute or two longer working the soap up into a lather.</li>
            <li> I only use a few swirls and the lather is thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve noticed less irritation on my neck and haven&#x27;t had razor burn.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all the time to make a lather and have it to the point of cream like consistency with the building lather on the face way is less than 45 seconds at</li>
            <li> Then my face started to feel like it was slightly burning, something that has never happened to me before.</li>
            <li> The name, and way some have described the scent online seemed odd.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a good option for traveling as this is a big honking glass jar of soap, so I might have to pick up the stick version of this and give it a try.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not good enough to re order either.</li>
            <li> Slight citrus, but also a little tobacco.</li>
            <li> Soak the brush, put a few sprinkles of water on the soap while you shower, then shake the brush out, load it for about 15 seconds (upside down), and face lather.  </li>
            <li> the box was a pouch bubble wrapped and taped tightly.  </li>
            <li> But just a little ehhhh</li>
            <li> was a little pricy</li>
            <li> It was subtle enough not to be offensive, and truthfully not offensive at all.</li>
            <li> A few swirls with the brush and its lather galore.</li>
            <li> Mitchell&#x27;s takes a few moments to lather up once it is in the shaving bowl.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not cheap at about 28$ - the refills can be had for about</li>
            <li> I was using Proroso for almost a year and bought this one on a whim since I was almost out of the green tube.</li>
            <li> There are a few that come close to this one</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a complex enough nose to pick out all the subtle notes that others claim; I just smell soap.  </li>
            <li> Blade glides across your face and will tame the toughest beard.</li>
            <li> First the bad: the smell leaves a bit to be desired.  </li>
            <li> Within a few seconds of loading, you start to see a gloriously slick lather bloom.  </li>
            <li> Under that was another layer of tightly taped bubble wrap, all wrapped in thick brown paper.</li>
            <li> I tend to prefer creams ordinarily but this soap ACTS like a cream and lathers like one too.  </li>
            <li> Sorry British...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Describing shave soap usually gets a \\&quot;ymmv\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> but I like to keep a small stache and goatee).</li>
            <li> Cushioning and slick.</li>
            <li> I load either of my badger brushes for about 15-20 seconds and start a small mix in a separate cup and face lather.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure what happened</li>
            <li> I add a little water at a time as it goes on thick, ( read yogurt, not 2 inches thick), and then it smoothes out with some water.</li>
            <li> It lathers with no problems, whatever type brush you use (boar or badger) and the lather is thick, slick and cushiony.  </li>
            <li> When I try a soap, I&#x27;m looking for a thick, but slick lather that is yogurt-like in viscosity and lubricates the blade as it cuts.  </li>
            <li> Hard to tell with the weather.</li>
            <li> I prefer hard soaps</li>
            <li> ceramic jar with hard plastic lid.&lt;br</li>
            <li> think of any negative points, and therefore I heartily recommend this product and give it five stars.</li>
            <li> This is the secret sauce missing from 99% of shaving creams / soaps.  </li>
            <li> There are YouTube videos on how to make a thick, creamy lather in just a matter or a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> it was unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Provides a very slick surface for the razor to glide over while helping to provide a close shave.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and has grown on me since I started with it.</li>
            <li> The scent lingers but is subtle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve bought this again, and the scent was stronger and unappealing.</li>
            <li> Also... if your skin is already damaged by a bad shave, this stuff irritates that skin a little.</li>
            <li> Once you get your recipe down you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say anything bad about it.</li>
            <li> Give it a try, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> The unfortunate thing is, the price does too.</li>
            <li> Difficult to describe</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with Tabac shaving soap.......</li>
            <li> Is it expensive?  </li>
            <li> I had a failed experiment with Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat, so I was wary of another hyped up soap.  </li>

            <li> but I don&#x27;d hate it either.  </li>
            <li> If you hate smoking or smokers or tobacco, it&#x27;s probably not for you.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t terrible to me but it is evoking memories of my youth that I can&#x27;t quite place</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Tabac simply can&#x27;t be beat! It&#x27;s a great smelling soap with a great lather, in every water, every time. The great glass bowl is the cherry on top.</li>
            <li> After running out of my first puck, even though I have several other options that I enjoy, I missed the Tabac.  So I ordered another.  This time with the dish.  If you have never used Tabac you need to treat yourself!  Lathers beautifully and quickly.  Great shave and post shave.  Even without any cologne or scented aftershave the scent of the soap alone is masculine and pleasant and subtle.  Pairs well with Fine Accouterments American Blend.</li>
            <li> Tabac Original is made from tallow.  It has lubricating properties that aren&#x27;t found in many soaps.  It lathers up to a rich creamy lather in the brush.  I can shave with less fear of getting nicked when I use it.  And then there is the scent.  It has an odor resmbling fresh pipe tobacco.  I don&#x27;t particularly like it but I don&#x27;d hate it either.  I use it in a rotation with other shaving creams and soaps.  Most of those are not tallow based.  That allows them to be very slippery but they are not as protective as Tabac.  Most of the good competitive tallow soaps cost considerably more.  I would reccomend this to a friend looking for a good soap in a very nice container.</li>
            <li> I agree with an earlier reveiwer who commented on the soap smell. At first I didn&#x27;t like it but have now begun to to like it. A few swirls with the brush and its lather galore. It easily the best shaving soap or cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Shaving Soap for over a year and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.  I&#x27;ve heard about Tabac for a long time and I just thought I would give it a try and compare the two soaps.  These are my observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Both soaps are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The Mitchell&#x27;s soap has a very light clean smell that no one can object to.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Tabac has a rather strange/funky scent that I really can&#x27;t place or put a name to but it is not over powering and I quickly learned to ignore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the same brush, razor, and blades I placed the open containers in warm water while I get other things really to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  The Tabac lathers very quickly.  Mitchell&#x27;s takes a few moments to lather up once it is in the shaving bowl.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Tabacs lather is very full and very slick.  Mitchell&#x27;s not so much without additional work but still not as slick.&lt;br /&gt;6.  Since Tabacs lather is very slick, the blade slides much easiler over the skin.  This is a big advantage in those trouble spots. The blade does not drag over the skin and so you get less nicks while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;7.  I find that the lather of Tabac is so full that you don&#x27;t need to load up your brush as often as with Mitchell&#x27;s soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both soaps are excellent and they last a very long time before they need to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me I would give the final nod to Tabac overall.</li>
            <li> Smells like a European airline toilet when you first start using it. The funky smell eventually diminishes after several uses and it does last a long time. Probably not a repeat buy since there are better smelling products out there -i.e. Taylor of OldBondStreet</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but thought I&#x27;d give Tabac a try, since many people seem to like it so much.  Wow this is good stuff.  Lather explodes on your face like crazy.  I&#x27;ve also heard others complain about the scent.  I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about.  It has a very pleasant smell.  And it works 10x better than other brands that cost 2 or 3 times as much.  This will definitely be a major part of my rotation.  I may even exclusively use Tabac--it&#x27;s that good.  If you&#x27;re on the fence, get a badger brush and give this one a try.</li>
            <li> This soap provides the best lather from any hard soap I have yet tried.  Unfortunately I cannot come to terms with the scent, which is exactly the smell you get when you first walk into a cheap motel room.  Think sex, sweat, grimy rug, cheap perfume, dust, and of course cigarette smoke.  Not the smoke itself mind you, I would actually prefer that.  This is the acrid scent of old, stale smoke that has coated every surface of our room in the Tabac Motel (hourly rates available) for the decade since it was last remodeled.  And it stays on your face, doing unspeakable things to your aftershave for a good hour before it tires and goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I still give it four stars because of the lather, the size, and the price.</li>
            <li> Lathers up to a rich, thick foam that doesn&#x27;t deteriorate after a few minutes... lubes the skin to protect the skin from the razor very well... doesn&#x27;t dry the face out, even after a particularly painstaking shave session... has a light, pleasing \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; scent that doesn&#x27;t linger much... What&#x27;s not to like?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the Taylor of Old Bond St. tub creams, aerosol creams of all colors and flavors, and the Shave Secret shave oil, Tabac Original is superior in pretty much every way. None of them offered nearly the protection and smooth shaving action that the Tabac does. I mean, the Taylor tub cream didn&#x27;t even come with a snazzy ceramic bowl to refill and become an heirloom along with my Merkur Classic. The Tabac Original does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking previous reviewers advice, I did spend a minute or two longer working the soap up into a lather. It&#x27;s a little more time spent, but the results are well worth it. I also tried melting the soap into the bowl like I had seen suggested for other soaps... didn&#x27;t work, and almost made a big mess. Also... if your skin is already damaged by a bad shave, this stuff irritates that skin a little. Just use a good aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tabac Original: doing it right, doing it well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to shaving with a DE razor after about 30 years of using cheap double blade disposables.  I started with an Edwin Jagger DE86 and the Tabac shaving soap and couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth my face was.  And the smell of the Tabac is fantastic -- that old barbershop smell that I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get the soap on my damp brush, then on to one side of my fact.  Then I do the same thing or the left side of my face.  Then my chin and neck.  After that, I start working up the lather, first on my face, then chin, then neck.  Tabac makes a perfect lather -- not too thin and not just a pile of foam so you can&#x27;t even see your face.  It&#x27;s just awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may want to try other soaps and creams for the fun of it, but pick up a jar of Tabac Original for your core shaving kit.  You&#x27;ll be glad you did</li>
            <li> Like I said this stuff is much cheaper when you buy a refill than the biggest tube of Proraso. Beyond that it is a toss up as to what you prefer. I&#x27;m not sure how long this stuff will last as a little bit of Proraso lets me shave 2 passes on my head and face.</li>
            <li> I have been buying up lots of different soaps and creams.  Proraso (all kinds), D.R.Harris, Old Williams etc but this blows them away.  4 pass shave with no irritation at all (first in a long time).  When I used an alum stick on my face and felt no burn it was unbelievable!</li>
            <li> This is one of the nicest shaving soaps available anywhere in the world. It quickly forms a rich thick lather and provides excellent lubrication for a very smooth shave. It has prolonged my blade life far beyond what I used to get when using a canned goo and Tabac provides a wonderful scent not found anywhere else. Another advantage over the canned goo&#x27;s is this one jar will last literally for a year or more. Between this and my tub of Proraso, I am set for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with Tabac.  This is an outstanding option for those of you with hard water, as I have.  According to my local municipality, we average about 130 mg/L total hardness over the course of the year, and one of my biggest challenges to shaving has been learning to get a good lather with hard water.  For those of you new to wet shaving, a proper lather is absolutely critical to getting a quality shave.  I&#x27;ve tried other products, including Proraso and The Real Shaving Company creams, and Colonel Conk and Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood soaps.  Each of those products has had a learning curve where I would have to determine the right amount of water to have in the brush, the right pressure to use, and perhaps a few other variables to getting a good lather- not true when I&#x27;ve traveled and shaved in soft water conditions.  At my house, Tabac is a no fuss product.  Soak the brush, put a few sprinkles of water on the soap while you shower, then shake the brush out, load it for about 15 seconds (upside down), and face lather.  This stuff really whips up into a thick and slick lather that the razor glides right through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also a pretty big chunk of soap that is going to last you a long time- consider this when you see the price.  As for the scent, it&#x27;s nice.  I would describe it as pleasant and relaxing, a little floral note to it.  My wife absolutely loves the smell of it, and that&#x27;s what matters.  There&#x27;s always pharmacy shelves full of Axe body spray for those of you who demand conformity to a manly scent.  I dry my brush on a rack in the bathroom, and the entire bathroom has the scent of this soap when you walk in. Smells awesome in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a good option for traveling as this is a big honking glass jar of soap, so I might have to pick up the stick version of this and give it a try.  Otherwise, very pleased and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Best shaving soap that I have used so far (compared to Edwin Jagger, Dr. Dittmar, van der Hagen, etc.) Lathers quickly and keeps the face hydrated and slick during the shave. Tabac also keeps your face from drying out in the winter. The soap puck seems like it will last for a year or so, so it is worth the price. Don&#x27;t worry about the strong smell when it is opened - this fades after a day or two.</li>
            <li> Not cheap at about 28$ - the refills can be had for about 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This contains tallow - rendered animal fat.  This is the secret sauce missing from 99% of shaving creams / soaps.  This is where it gets its excellent lubrication from.  As gross as it may sound, it works.  Not like it smells like a can of beef.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smells like a wonderful old-school barbershop shave lotion.  I really like the smell.  As mentioned, the lubrication is great, the smell is wonderful, lathers well, and lasts.  One can of this stuff should last you probably close to a year.  So, the economics of it aren&#x27;t really so bad.  You could buy the cheaper stuff, but you&#x27;d have to buy a lot of it, so I feel like the cost is probably about break-even when compared with others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve come to find out that I like &amp;#34;mitchell&#x27;s wool fat shaving soap&amp;#34; a little better, but this stuff is still excellent.  Give it a try, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like Bay Rum without the \\&quot;Boozy Old Man\\&quot; feel about it. It lathers like no other soap I have tried to date and like it so much, that I&#x27;ll be buying the aftershave too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was great, it came in very quickly and you get a lot of it for the price, so it&#x27;s well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your into wet shaving, give it a try, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This soap with a good brush creates a nice lather and a good shave.  It smells good too!  It isn&#x27;t as creamy as some of the shaving creams I have tried but it is very nice.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hubby; it creates a smooth, creamy lather and smells slightly of Tabac (my ALL TIME FAVORITE aftershave, which he also wears).  The soap is long-lasting and looks like it will last for at least a year of daily shaving use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also really owe it to yourself to try Tabac&#x27;s men&#x27;s aftershave [[ASIN:B000C1VZX8 Tabac Original By Maurer &amp; Wirtz For Men. Aftershave 10.1 Oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tabac has a classic, manly smell that&#x27;s quite unique and, what can I say, very German.  It reminds me of a sumptuous mahogany library filled with leather bound books, with a slightly woody aroma. Love it!</li>
            <li> Tabac is my daily shave soap. It lathers up far easier and faster than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  Also, the lather is very rich and much more protective than others.  I can sometimes get \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; when I shave too close with other soaps.  I can get a much closer shave with Tabac without razor burn. One puck of this soap will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product two years ago and I&#x27;m only about 1/2 way through the container.  Has a good smell and a slick lather.</li>
            <li> Pleasure to shave with this soap. The scent is subtle and has grown on me since I started with it. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> First the bad: the smell leaves a bit to be desired.  It basically smells like baby powder.  Not bad, but nothing remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: Consistently gives the best shaves I have ever had.  It handily outperforms Proraso menthol/eucalyptus (one of my favorites for the smell) and even Truefitt and Hill creams, which is saying something.</li>
            <li> Great scent, doesn&#x27;t linger much, the lather is copious, verrrry slippery and quite hydrating -- drys out slower than, for example, Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood.  The white ceramic tub is a very nice touch, and has a clean, modern, almost bauhaus, very German design (while the English soaps come in an Olde World, Distinguished-Gentleman kind of container.)  This soap really rewards a very light touch on that blade.  I swear the blade cuts better with this than with barbasol goop or TooBS soap.</li>
            <li> Lathers great and is good quality. The price is unbeatable. I love the smell and it is very smooth. The scent lingers but is subtle.  Overall great product.</li>
            <li> This shaving soap is amazing! I heard numerous people online talk about this soap and how easy it is to lather (with a brush) and decided to give it a try.  It seems like it will last forever and it smells amazing! I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a shaving soap!</li>
            <li> Yeah this shaving soap is pretty awesome. Soak your brush in warm water for a few minutes then work the soap. Watch it explode. I bring the loaded brush up to my skin and lather on the face directly. Makes a thick, creamy, phenomenal lather. The scent is strong at first, but after a few uses it greatly subsides. Now it just smells like a very lightly scented soap. So I wouldn&#x27;t let too many comments about the scent steer you away. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I&#x27;d ever shave with.  I tend to prefer creams ordinarily but this soap ACTS like a cream and lathers like one too.  It&#x27;s got a cool old-world smoky scent and one of these tubs will last a very long time.  Longer than any cream ever will for sure.  This outperforms many much more expensive products and works great for straight or double-edge shaving as well as disposable types.  It is one of the best and highest value shaving products on the market (along with proraso and speick) hands down.</li>
            <li> I have tried and used a few different shaving soaps over the years and by far the Tabac is the most pleasant to use.  I had the hardest time finding a shaving cream/soap that I could use with both a straight edge razor and a run of the mill disposable (Gillete, Schick, etc.).  I usually use my straight edge on the weekends with the disposables during the week.  Until I tried out the Tabac I had 3 or 4 different shaving creams/soaps at hand depending on the razor.  The Tabac lathers so easily and so nicely I can use it with my straight edge razors, but it is also not too thick a lather to clog the disposables.  The lather is more easily controlled than other shaving soaps (Castle Forbes was a bit more difficult to get a decent lather).  The price is great and the soap will last quite a long time.  I would recommend this over any shaving gel/cream and over the soaps I have tried (Castle Forbes, Art of Shaving and Rivivage).  I would also add that a decent brush goes a long way to help produce a good lather.  This soap will lather with just your fingers, but a decent brush will make it easier to get that smooth lather and apply it to your face.</li>
            <li> just get it, the scent is that powerful and if it is just wash you face after and it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> I just received this soap, and knew going in that the smell might be off putting. I was expecting a strong smelling musky soap, but honestly did not find it bad at all. Maybe I bought an older product, but the scent lasted about 10 minutes and faded away. There was only a hint of the &amp;#34;funk&amp;#34; others have mentioned. It was subtle enough not to be offensive, and truthfully not offensive at all. With that said however, the scent is not one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the lather, it&#x27;s great. I wet my Omega synthetic and gave it about 20 swirls on the soap. Then built a face lather in just over a minute. The soap created a super slick cushion on my face. It definitely exceeds most other soaps I&#x27;ve used in this department. The unfortunate thing is, the price does too. However, I must say I&#x27;m impressed by the shave it gave me. Quite possibly the most protection of the 50 (or so) soaps/creams I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve bought this again, and the scent was stronger and unappealing. Definitely needed to be aired out.</li>
            <li> This product is my gold standard for shaving soaps and I recommend it to everyone who asks for a soap.  It lathers with no problems, whatever type brush you use (boar or badger) and the lather is thick, slick and cushiony.  I love the scent as well though this is the most likely reason some people do not like this soap.  If you are one of them, leave it open for a few days and the scent will fade a little without disappearing completely.  I have used this with hard and soft waters and had no problem in generating a great lather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get quite a lot of product for the money and it comes in nice glass/ceramic tub that does not look out of place in a bathroom.  Suggest that you get the After Shave (Lotion or Balm) to go with this soap!!!</li>
            <li> I will be brief.  This product has many detailed reviews so I will just say this shave soap is the best I have come across.  The lather, the scent and the lubrication are all first class.  This will definitely be a repeat purchase for me.  Try it and you will see.</li>
            <li> It does a good job.  Cost versus performance and shaving satisfaction it definitely deserves a four star rating.  I am pleased to have it in my rotation, but not a soap I would use every day because it is so good.  The scent is different, a  tobacco like scent.  It is well worth giving it a try.  I like the product, but I also like other products, some are half the price.  I would definitely buy it again because of the scent and it does give a good shave.  A product every shaver should try at least once, as it is definitely different in a positive way. It certainly has a &amp;#34;nitch&amp;#34;,  and as far as I am aware of,  there are no other soaps with this unique tobacco like scent, and it comes in an attractive shaving bowl--nice to own.  There is also a matching Tabac after shave bottle, that is worth having that makes an attractive combination set.</li>
            <li> Tabac lathers good works very well  and I really like using it. however its pricey for soap so thats why the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This is the finest shaving soap I&#x27;ve used, period.  With a good quality brush you can make mounds of rich, hydrating lather.  I&#x27;ve used it to shave with DE&#x27;s and cartridge razors, and it has helped reduce irritation.  The most remarkable thing about this soap is how much water you can add while maintaining a slick lather.  A little goes a long way.  With daily use one puck will last nearly a year.  The tub is attractive and refillable.  Finally, I love the fragrance--it reminds me of an old-time barber shop.  I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough--my desert island soap for sure!</li>
            <li> Absolutely as described and more! Everyone who&#x27;s on the fence try this now! You will not be disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> How many times have I heard myself say that? And admitting that it&#x27;s been around as long as Ii have doesn&#x27;t help! (Tabac Original came out in 1959, the same year i was born).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing product! The lather is creamier than anything I&#x27;ve tried thus far in my (as yet short) wet-shaving history. It loads up in no time, and then I stick it in the scuttle until I&#x27;m ready for it. When I do, it&#x27;s warm and even creamier, so it covers your beard quickly, and starts to soften the hair immediately. By the time I put the razor to my face, it glides along my face like a downhill skier!</li>
            <li> Great lather, love the fragrance. Not too strong, not too old man or feminine. Seems like it will last forever. I only use a few swirls and the lather is thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> I seem to prefer creams and am picky about my soaps. I appear to be down to just liking this soap, DR Harris Arlington, and Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat of the ~10 I&#x27;ve tried. Tabac has that nice fresh and clean scent I like. It also lathers up quite nicely... albeit after a bit more work than the creams take!</li>
            <li> This soap makes me feel like I could chop down a tree with an axe, dig a ditch with a pickaxe, and kill a bear with a hunting knife. Not only does it feel great when it is applied, it gets every whisker to stand at attention and die like a hero. Since I started using this over a run of the mill shave gel, I&#x27;ve noticed less irritation on my neck and haven&#x27;t had razor burn. Smells great, and leaves you feeling like a manlier man.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I read it was the best and has been around for years.  The product has a great old time soap smell.  It lathers great.  I don&#x27;t see any difference in the quality of the shave from glycerin soaps from others.</li>
            <li> Fantastic lather, awesome packaging. The scent compliments the Tabac aftershave very well. The puck is quite a bit larger than most shave soaps I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Gives the best and closest shave, but it may make my skin a bit dry.  Hard to tell with the weather.</li>
            <li> This is the most sought after shaving soap in the world. Lathers like a champ, smooth shave every time. I will always have TABAC in my shave den.</li>
            <li> This shave soap is pretty darn good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all the time to make a lather and have it to the point of cream like consistency with the building lather on the face way is less than 45 seconds at max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ability to make the whiskers of the face soft and easy to cut is very good.  With Van Der Hagen shave soap it didn&#x27;t do that all too well, now with Tabac shave soap I am able to shave against the grain on my mustache area unlike when I had Van Der Hagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lubrication is really good, but when it gets thin it doesn&#x27;t really lubricate.  Though I think that all lather does that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shave soap is really good even a little expensive though I do not care of price but quality like this shave soap.</li>
            <li> This soap will last a lifetime, I have had this one for several months and the container is still 80% full. Works really well, lathers creamy and the lather lasts for a long time. The smell is not for everyone, I got used to it and now I enjoy the smell but in the beginning I found it to old fashioned. The smell is too floral, not enough tobacco as I would expect from a product called Tabac.</li>
            <li> Lathers quick, moderately slick, great moisturising, and provides acceptable cushion.  My dislike mostly comes from the scent, it is copious and long lasting.  As scent is subjective won&#x27;t dock it too much there.  However, for this price, I can purchase Arko, and coconut oil (plus some essential oils) to provide the missing moisturising, and be just as satisfied with the shave, without the lingering scent.</li>
            <li> Difficult to describe but Tabac smells just like its name suggests - a great tobacconist shop.  May sound a bit off-putting but in fact, it&#x27;s a great, rich, evocative aroma.  Smoke the occasional good cigar and this lather reminds me of a wonderful combination of tobacco and single-malt and and leather (the good stuff NOT English Leather!) - a men&#x27;s club.  If you hate smoking or smokers or tobacco, it&#x27;s probably not for you.  Otherwise, live large - it produces a rich and soft lather that sets up your beard for a great shave and the smell lingers - in a good way.</li>
            <li> Good shaving soap, but not as much lubricity as I had hoped. Works well, but I&#x27;ve tried others like &amp;#34;Kiss MY Face&amp;#34; shaving cream which lathers bore easily and has much more lubricity to it to make the razor glide over my skin as if there weren&#x27;t a blade in it.</li>
            <li> ...pure heaven........... you can&#x27;t go wrong with Tabac shaving soap....... the scent is great...  the aftershave is very good too.</li>
            <li> Most wet shavers agree that this is one of the &#x27;holy grail&#x27; soaps.  I did a lot of research before I pulled the trigger and bought a jar.  There are two things that are potentially off-putting and I will address them as objectively as I can before I levy my final verdict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent - Probably the most subjective factor regarding this soap which is very polarizing; either you love it or hate it.  It&#x27;s not a hip, new fragrance, and a lot of newbies to the game of wet shaving seem to overlook the fact that this fragrance is over 50+ years old.  That being said, I don&#x27;t mind it because I like old school fragrances and it compliments a wide range of colognes that are currently on the market.  Worst case scenario, if the scent bothers that much just wash your face with ivory or dove soap when you&#x27;re done shaving; 90% of it will be gone and you&#x27;ll have a clean palate for your scent of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price - this is a more universal arguement.  Is it expensive?  Relatively speaking, yes.  But again, it has been around FOREVER.  Which to me says something about the efficacy of the product.  Plus the packaging is pretty elaborate, which also must be factored into the cost.  This to me, however, reflects the what&#x27;s in the jar - quality, both in and out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the review:  the richness of the lather is second to none.  There are YouTube videos on how to make a thick, creamy lather in just a matter or a couple minutes. It protects your face incredibly, is slick providing great glide for your razor, and washes off your face, razor and brush easily.  It does not irritate the skin like some soaps can (especially genorously scented ones), and a little goes a long way.  I tend to load really my brush up for a more luxurious lather, but you can get 3 passes easily with 20-30 seconds of loading provided you put a little water on the puck first to hydrate and break down the top layer.  Some people who shave several times a week (3 or more) say they have gotten 6-8months MINIMUM from this soap; put it in a rotation and it will last for years.  So, you still think $25 is exorbitant?  I myself think it&#x27;s a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion, if you&#x27;re on the fence about Tabac trust me and take the plunge.  And if you still don&#x27;t like it after you&#x27;ve given it a fair shot, there are plenty of wet shavers out there that will be happy to take it of your hands for pretty much what you paid for it.  That&#x27;s as close to a money back guarantee as you can get.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to give this a try - and I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m very glad I did. This is likely to become my go-to shaving soap. Works extremely well with a EJ DE razor. Provides a very slick surface for the razor to glide over while helping to provide a close shave. The smell was initially a bit off-putting, but as others have stated, you do get used to it after a couple shaves and it&#x27;s not bad at all (IMHO). In addition, I&#x27;ve found whipping up a lather in my Georgetown Pottery G5 Shaving Scuttle is easier than almost all other soaps I&#x27;ve tried, the lather does not dry out, and will easily last for three or four passes. Like this so much, I&#x27;ve purchased the stick version for business trips! Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> If you use an old-fashioned straight edge or double-edged safety razor this is about as high quality a shave soap as you can find.</li>
            <li> Smells good, good lather, hard soap so it takes a while to lather but will last a long time. The glass jar is nice as well.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat Tabac! Because Tabac shaving soap is soooo much more comfortable shave than any other shaving brands. No question, period!!!  Sorry British...</li>
            <li> Tabac Original is a great quality product.  It produces a very rich, creamy base that protects your skin each and every shave.  Once you get your recipe down you will not be disappointed.  Several reviewers have commented on the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;.  To me it simply smells like &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; but I admit I don&#x27;t have the keenest nose.</li>
            <li> Great old school smell - my wife loves it!  I have to cologne too.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many shave soaps. Many from Phoenix artisan, Proraso, cella, Williams mug, van der Hagen. None of them perform as well as tabac. It is also such a nice scent. It is a powdery scent that is timeless. The puck is also hard so it will last a long time. I also have the tabac aftershave. I will use these for the rest of my life if I can. Give it a shot it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have gotten my best shaves with this Soap and Speick cream. Lathers like a dream, even better with distilled water. The scent isn&#x27;t terrible to me but it is evoking memories of my youth that I can&#x27;t quite place but I think my grandparents bathroom smelled like this. They were classy people so that isn&#x27;t a bad thing, at least to me :)</li>
            <li> Tabac really makes a difference over canned shave cream. Great manly scent. Blade glides across your face and will tame the toughest beard. Good price and nice bowl w/ lid.[[ASIN:B000GHYXG4 Tabac Original By Maurer &amp; Wirtz For Men. Shaving Soap Bowl 4.4 Ounces]]</li>
            <li> From other reviews you can tell that the purchase of this soap is a no brainer. The aroma and physical qualities are well tended to. I am an experienced wet shaver for over fifty years and am used to decent glycerin based soap pucks, whether Col Conk brand or the generic types that are sold for about a dollar each from Atlanta Barber Supply.  I experienced my first shave with Tabac using an open comb razor and an ASTRA DE Blade that had already been in service five times.  With the thick, protective, slick lather that Tabac provided, the used Astra blade felt like it had just been unwrapped new for the first time.  I am sure that anyone who knows how to work up a proper lather will not be disappointed in this Quality Shave Soap. Worth every dollar....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m exactly one year into wet shaving with a DE safety razor, and this is. A Hannukah gift to myself.  I&#x27;ve used about 10 different shave soaps and creams, and my current soaps are proraso, bigelow, Tobs, AOS, VDH, Speick and Kiehls.&lt;br /&gt;Inside the box was a pouch bubble wrapped and taped tightly.  Under that was another layer of tightly taped bubble wrap, all wrapped in thick brown paper. Amazing packaging!&lt;br /&gt;The elegant plastic windowed box, which was also taped, was a nice, heavy ceramic jar with a brown top and a nice big soap, with a good scent.  My wife LOVES the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I knew this was coming and had not shaved in about 4 or 5 days.  I actually contemplated waiting another week, but couldn&#x27;t wait, so prep began.&lt;br /&gt;My Parker badger brush slightly wet got about 5 to 6 turns on the disk and the lather that occurred was enormous, thick and slick, with a light scent, not too much.&lt;br /&gt;This is the slipperiest, slickest, thickest, and richest lather possible. The absolute standard for a perfect lather. Perfect for folks that need to work on their technique achieving a good lather, which should never be overlooked during prep.&lt;br /&gt;As I continue to try new products, techniques and pass along this knowledge to newcomers.  This would be my first recommendation for a begginer&#x27;s wetshaving kit.&lt;br /&gt;Around 30 dollars for soap seems exorbitant.  However, this will last me at least 18 months, or more.  A good value imho.&lt;br /&gt;Describing shave soap usually gets a \\&quot;ymmv\\&quot;. However, that is NOT the case here. This will be the best soap for everyone that wants to start wetshaving.&lt;br /&gt;Every aspect makes a difference in the result. Don&#x27;t pass on Tabac.</li>
            <li> After reading about the scent in numerous online forums, it wasn&#x27;t quite what I had expected. But it has a great scent and it provides a great shave. Nice thick lather that doesn&#x27;t fade away as you shave. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of reviews out there regarding this product.  I know, I read them all and BEFORE I purchased this product.  What sold me on trying it, was a picture review of the product being used.  Well, this product performs exactly as people says it does.  Only, it&#x27;s better!  Yeah, that&#x27;s the \\&quot;gotcha\\&quot; part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why: I have a beard that is horrible.  A shave burns\\&quot; is normal for me, each and everyday. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of shaving soaps from different manufacturers, including some homemade ones to try and beat the shave burn.  Some soaps were better than others.  Some stank...literally.  But, when I combined this soap with my Silver-tipped Badger from Merkur, I witnessed a wedding between the 2 German products.  The result was that my beard and my face were the ones to be blessed by their union.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaves now are always \\&quot;burn-free\\&quot;.  The Merkur Trac 3 glides, just like it should, across my face.  Too, the shaves are closer, which is something I really like.  And, when I have to shave more than once a day (my Lady likes my face smooth), I do so without fear of shave burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some advice:  Quit reading all the reviews and buy the product.</li>
            <li> If you plan on buying your first Tabac shaving soap, do yourself a favor and buy the bowl with the soap.  It&#x27;s completely worth the price difference and you&#x27;ll keep using it once you buy your second puck of Tabac.  My wife loves the smell of this soap and it performs well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is excellent and sits on the same level as Mitchell&#x27;s wool fat shaving soap.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic.  It lathers wonderfully, and the scent is a pleasant.  It seems to last forever too.</li>
            <li> I was using Proroso for almost a year and bought this one on a whim since I was almost out of the green tube. It is definitely more pricy than the other one, but it&#x27;s nice. The smell is very subtle and I tend to have to swirl it more than I&#x27;d like to get the lather (I do not typically shave everything, but I like to keep a small stache and goatee). The Proroso lathered up better for a smaller amount and I prefer the small and tingly feeling, but this Tabac is still a solid choice. Even though it&#x27;s more soapy than lotiony (are those even words? haha) it is still very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Great lather. IMHO, not as good as a few, but way better than most.  Scent is not my favorite.  Slight citrus, but also a little tobacco.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather very well for a premium product;  Very overpriced.</li>
            <li> Good soap, nice bowl, lid is cheap feeling plastic though.</li>
            <li> Incredible shave soap, you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find a better &#x27;against the grain with a straight razor&#x27; soap, which speaks volumes about its moisture retention and slickness.  The scent is certainly polarizing, but if you keep the lid off for long stretches, it does modify somewhat.</li>
            <li> Lathers quite easily and very little is needed to get a decent shave. It&#x27;s hard to say anything bad about it. I suppose it&#x27;d be nice if they had smaller tubs or if they can pull down the price.</li>
            <li> First I&#x27;ve ever tried, seems legit</li>
            <li> this stuff is fantastic never get a bad shave again.</li>
            <li> I purchased Tabac shaving soap from one of my favorite online wet shaving suppliers and I think this product is great.  It produces a smooth, slick lather, with minimal effort.  The scent, in my opinion, is very &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t have a complex enough nose to pick out all the subtle notes that others claim; I just smell soap.  The milk glass bowl is very attractive, and the lather definitely aids in getting a clean, close, and comfortable shave.  I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I recently tried Tabac after hearing its rave reviews on forums.  I had a failed experiment with Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat, so I was wary of another hyped up soap.  Tabac certainly did not disappoint.  When I try a soap, I&#x27;m looking for a thick, but slick lather that is yogurt-like in viscosity and lubricates the blade as it cuts.  Tabac fits the bill in spades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros: This is some of the easiest soap to lather.  Within a few seconds of loading, you start to see a gloriously slick lather bloom.  With a little more work and little more water, Tabac produces some of the best lather out there.  It gives me zero irritation and I love the scent.  Granted, at first, it was a bit floral, but I have taken to it and find it to be quite pleasing.  The scent is prominent without being overpowering.  Also, the bowl is quite nice.  It fits in the hand well and looks classy in the shave den.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons: The only con I could come up with is the price.  Tabac is a little steep compared to other soaps like Cella and Proraso, but in the end it is easily worth it.  I don&#x27;t know how many shaves I&#x27;ll get out of this 4.4 oz puck, but thus far, the puck is very resilient, unlike Cella and Proraso which are softer and therefore get used up faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, Tabac has a permanent home in my shave den.  I&#x27;ll never be without a puck.  It&#x27;s in my top 3 for all-around soaps at any price point.</li>
            <li> It has a lather second to none. Cushioning and slick. It doesn&#x27;t dry out or burn. I have been trying to place the smell for a long time. I arrived at that smell when your kid pees in the bed.</li>
            <li> If you are new to face lathering, try this soap...it&#x27;s effortless. The soap takes water well and really softens the beard. Very slick lather that makes the shave much easier. Woodsy, very spicy scent; almost incense-lke. A great soap.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used. It lathers very quickly and easily. The lather in incredibly rich. And lastly the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> This soap is great. I load either of my badger brushes for about 15-20 seconds and start a small mix in a separate cup and face lather. Wonderful. I add a little water at a time as it goes on thick, ( read yogurt, not 2 inches thick), and then it smoothes out with some water. Great shave and no irritation, doesn&#x27;t feel dry afterwards but it feels like it washes very clean. Everything I wanted. I have tried Proraso Green and Red soaps, both are solid soaps at a great price. Trumpers cream, another good soap and Truefitt and Hill which is the worst soap short of a very cheap one I used to use.</li>
            <li> Well I kept on using Tabac soap and tried some other stuff as well and I&#x27;m not sure what happened but I started getting much better shaves with Tabac now and the lather is now thick and also slick. I&#x27;m guessing that leaving my brush a little more wet than usual is what really brought out the quality of the shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m bumping up my rating from 3 to about 4.25 but leaving as 4 stars overall because it is quite expensive...still I&#x27;ve been using in on and off for like 3 months and it hasn&#x27;t shrunk much so it is long lasting. I can now honestly say that I really like Tabac soap and it&#x27;s an important part of my shave den. I must also point out that my technique has gotten much better than the initial review and I have switched blades(polsilver)...maybe these changes were a factor as well. Tabac has made a fan out of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still fairly new to traditional wet shaving but have already spend a small fortune finding the best brush/razor/soap/blades for me. On this journey I have found my favorite brush and razor etc. but was still looking for the best shave prep for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried proraso,van der hagen,col conk,cella and body shop maca root. All budget priced and worked well enough with col conk soap being my go to soap. I prefer hard soaps so I thought a much higher priced soap like Tabac will give me a shave that is out of this world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order the soap. It arrives. I get excited. Same brush I always use(silvertip). Same razor I prefer mostly(futur). Same blades I use always(merkur). Lather up. Lather is good. Smell is enjoyable enough for me. I begin shaving and that&#x27;s where my excitement ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tabac shaving soap has a rich thick lather but almost no slickness. I could feel my face getting dry after the first cheek. Then my face started to feel like it was slightly burning, something that has never happened to me before. Anyway I finish off my shave and no doubt the shave was very close and clean. But my skin was very dry even after my aftershave balm. Maybe tallow soaps don&#x27;t agree me? I don&#x27;t know, I expected better for the price. The smell is not good enough to re order either. I&#x27;ll stick to col conk I guess or try TOBS or Trufitt &amp; Hill next.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a wet shaver for many years and have tried more shaving brush creams and soaps than I can count. There are a few that come close to this one but none surpass it in quality of lather or shaving results.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful soap.  Great lather that is easy to control in terms of thickness.  Makes for a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I  bought Tabac on the recommendation of a friend.  He was correct, it is a very nice shave soap and produces a nice, creamy, aromatic lather that doesn&#x27;t leave a lingering scent.  It stays moist enough t produce a smooth, consistent shave.  From my experience so far, about two weeks of use, the jar will last about a year.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!&lt;br /&gt;The lather is very smooth and the smell reminds me of an old time barber shop. I really enjoy shaving with this soap.</li>
            <li> My review is quite contradictory to all off the rave reviews on Amazon.  It isn&#x27;t that I don&#x27;t respect the opinions of the majority here, but I just wanted to share my personal experiences with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love shave soaps and even those that are tallow-based, but Tabac isn&#x27;t really for me.  I understand that it has a loyal following and is not a poor performer, but it&#x27;s tough to justify it when there are so many better performing and better smelling products out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In spite of my great attempts over the past year or so, I&#x27;ve never received a shave from this product that could match even the economical go-to soaps for wet shavers (Such as Proraso, Arko, and others).  It doesn&#x27;t let the beard soften (even with substantial amounts of water), nor does it provide much protection against abrasion.  It lathers reasonably, but does not lather as well as other tallow-based soaps.  Tallow soaps, in spite of their generally excellent performance, are generally considered to be lower-cost ingredients compared to vegetable alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is not bad, but I find that it just lingers for far too long after shaving.  It will hang on your face all day.  Some may find it a bit off-putting, and actually gives me headaches by noon.  Smells old-school of warm florals, baby power, and soapiness, very little citrus in spite of what the description implies.  I expect Arko to smell like bargain soap.  I expect Tabac to smell incredible for its price.  I don&#x27;t feel that this smells up to par.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it probably costs about twice what it really should cost.  This product seems to be geared for fans of the entire Tabac line.  It probably isn&#x27;t ideal for someone that just simply wants the best possible or economical shave.  You could probably get a similar shave from an average bar of tallow soap.</li>
            <li> Really lathers up quickly, about 30 seconds and its ready to go.  Moistens up your beard and keeps it that way for the entire shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to lather.&lt;br /&gt;Unusual scent that people either love or hate.&lt;br /&gt;Nice ceramic jar with hard plastic lid.&lt;br /&gt;This is a hard soap and the puck is 4.4oz should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Tabac original by Maurer &amp; Wirtz is an essential part of any man&#x27;s wet shaving experience.  There is simply no other soap on the market that can compare to the rich lather that is quickly and effortlessly whipped up by even the cheapest of brushes.  The smell of the soap is mild yet masculine, and does not conflict with any other fragrances.  The lather keep hydrated and does not dry out quickly, and the level of cushion (the elusive aspect of razor protection that wetshavers harp on) is simply unbeatable.  The longevity of the soap is also outstanding.  Depending on how much you decide to load the brush every time you shave, it can be expected that this soap will last at the very least half a year, but likely far longer.  The bowl is both solid and unobtrusive, taking up far less room than would a generic bowl, and if you are someone with multiple soaps in rotation it helps to have specific bowls for each one.  I cannot for the life of me think of any negative points, and therefore I heartily recommend this product and give it five stars.</li>
            <li> I held off trying Tabac. The name, and way some have described the scent online seemed odd. The reports of its great lathering qualities had me intrigued.  It comes in a nice white glass lidded bowl that looks great all with all your shave gear.  The scent is very pleasing to me.  It is not a modern fragrance, but if classic scents like Sandalwood, Old Spice, and the original Clubman scent are in your lineup, believe this will fit right in. For a person that likes lighter Citrus notes, maybe not.  I would encourage anyone to try. It is light and barely noticeable while lathering.  Doesn&#x27;t really hang on or interfere with subsequent aftershave or colognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several brushes, but my Semogue 830 boar seems just right to load the soap and get it on my face. Minimal effort needed to whip up good lather even with hard water. Yes, almost explosive.  Overall more impressed with the lather density. Some soaps very bubbly and take more effort, this is just creamy from the first few swirls in the bowl.  It rivals creams for ease of use.  Slickness  and blade cushioning is about the best. I have sensitive skin and neck whiskers that grow in different directions on both sides.  Tabac really allows me to make some nice close passes without fear of razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only gripe is that Tabac seems to take a bit more effort to rinse the residue off when done shaving, but this is quite minor and the soap otherwise  seems to have moisturizing effect.  It seems a bit pricey, but the bowl is re-usable and the soap really lasts.  Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> This has a strong fragnance that stays on for the rest of the day, love to shave with this every day</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely .. Will last forever and a day .. It just the smell .. It&#x27;s not terrible .. But just a little ehhhh .. Kinda does smell like an old man barber shop .. It&#x27;s not too loud tho</li>
            <li> wanted to get an original product from germany. was a little pricy but it&#x27;s a permanent home for an original product. now I can just buy the soap for the dish. great!</li>
