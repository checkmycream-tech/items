            <li>SUPPER EXCITED!!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it works very good.</li>
            <li>Very good I  recomed  </li>
            <li>I used it before my tattoo (loss count on what number this was) am working on my sleeve and for a good two hours i couldn&#x27;t feel anything!</li>
            <li>Great time saver.</li>
            <li>and if I&#x27;m not quite happy with the results, I reapply and put the saran</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>It worked great for the outline work.</li>
            <li>works great for tattooing</li>
            <li>I went in with GREAT CONFIDENCE that I wouldn&#x27;t feel a thing.</li>
            <li>Works great and penetrates skin as advertised.</li>
            <li>You do have to wait the 15 minutes, however the results are great.  </li>
            <li>Worked AMAZING for me!</li>
            <li>This is okay, not the best in the world.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so furious about the product because the reviews were almost all impeccable</li>
            <li>The anesthetic lasts a good while too, so you don&#x27;t have to re-apply often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>Using for dermatology and works good</li>
            <li>fantastic, excellent product.</li>
            <li>This cream is really effective a fantastic cream!!!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>This is The Most Amazing STUFF I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Made the brazilian wax much more tolerable...cannot wax again without it!</li>
            <li>Makes getting peels much more pleasant of an experience.</li>
            <li>Amazing I&#x27;m getting tattoed as I type</li>
            <li>Most of us probably recognize 20% more of any good thing as a good thing itself</li>
            <li>I mainly use it for lancing cysts and this numbs the skin perfectly for it.</li>
            <li>But the numbness goes away so quickly that I could tell during the wax that it had already worn off a great deal.</li>
            <li>The product is packaged very cheaply and when I took the tube of cream out of the box, there was already a puncture hole in it.</li>
            <li>I am able to wax myself using Numbfast.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered it 3 times and I love it.</li>
            <li>I gave Greencaine 5 stars too, but NUMBFAST is much more affordable.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m really glad i tried this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it work well for piercings or tattoos as well.</li>
            <li>I did check with my artist before using and he was ok with giving it a chance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Now I will have to spend more for something that works.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waist your time get the better quality stuff and pay the money or you will pay way more like me.</li>
            <li>I love this product....</li>
            <li>Will order again for more work...</li>
            <li>I also tried No Scream Cream for waxing, and this product is far superior!  </li>
            <li>Leave it on a lttle longer than recommended because it does wear off very quick.</li>
            <li>Came with instructions and was easy to apply.</li>
            <li>They are comforted and move pass the moment and onto playing much more quickly.</li>
            <li>The reason I decided to try this was because I was getting a huge coverup tattoo.</li>
            <li>Only lasts 45 minutes or so, which isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>to use Speednumb, but I think this may be more economical.</li>
            <li>I could not believe that I was not feeling any pain at all and whole procedure went so well!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually put a review, but I need to since this product was incredible on numbing!</li>
            <li>Edited to add: if you use this for waxing, make sure the wax does not get too hot.  </li>
            <li>I got more for the coloring and shading and used it exactly the way I used it for the line work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably go to the 5% first because most of us want to maximize when it comes to pain relief.</li>
            <li>Large areas may require 4 tubes to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li>I was able to sit thru all my line work mostly pain free 6 total hours.</li>
            <li>and I still took the chance on getting this product because I really wanted to believe it could work and at this price I wanted it even more to be a dream come true.</li>
            <li>(Hey, go easy on me, it was my first time!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used as recommended and the half hour was great.</li>
            <li>Just apply wrap it up wait and wipe off with dry towel and your good to go .</li>
            <li>so I was able to sit still for a good 2 hour long session going over some sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>Because it did NOT numb the area in ANYWAY.</li>
            <li>so the question gets to be which is economical for you?</li>
            <li>I have to self inject using a relatively large needle, the numbing is significant, if cream is used under a bandage about a hour before</li>
            <li>Works great for the first half hour</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found Lidocaine handy when either of the grandkids gets a finger shut in a door, or a minor abrasion (not wounds), or hitting the finger hammering one of those Home Depot kids projects;</li>
            <li>Worked quickly and stayed a reasonable time.</li>
            <li>Used this for a tattoo, worked great, skin was numb for about 2 1/2 hours made the experience very easy to deal with after it wore off still seemed to minimize the pain a bit.</li>
            <li>this was my first time using this product.</li>
            <li>Numbs skin very well!</li>
            <li>work very well!</li>
            <li>It really works, but it does not totally numb the area.</li>
            <li>It really numbs!</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing a different numbing cream that is a much better quality than this one.  </li>
            <li>On my first session of bikini Elos laser hair removal I was jumping from pain and could not endure the torture.</li>
            <li>This product definitely made my waxing more tolerable.</li>
            <li>I used it exactly as the instructions said to use it.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly how they were listed and it still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I Put on the skin about 1 hour and 40 min before getting the tattoo think it would have worked even better if i left in on for a lease 2 hours like the directions said but didn&#x27;t have time.  </li>
            <li>The higher viscosity in this product will help you use it</li>
            <li>then you&#x27;re more likely to need a 4 oz tube for that size of job.</li>
            <li>I then made sure to wrap the area in plastic wrap (held in place by medical tape) and when I was ready to wax, removed plastic wrap and  wiped off the remaining cream and got to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I came across NUMBFAST and purchased a tube due to the many positive reviews AND the $19.99 price tag!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to pick this up because the price is pretty high for what you get</li>
            <li>This numb Fast cream works great!</li>
            <li>#34;clean up&amp;#34; of strays, so I didn&#x27;t really need the numbing then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not 100% pain free, I say about 75% especially in the thicker hair follicles.  </li>
            <li>The cream absorbed completely into my skin.</li>
            <li>The area covered didn&#x27;t hurt at all but as soon as he hit the one I forgot to put cream on, I was in so much pain</li>
            <li>and then your ready to go.</li>
            <li>For me it did not take all of the pain away, but it really took the edge off.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>After about 10 minutes, my skin began to burn so intensely that I had to wash all of the cream off.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>helps so much.</li>
            <li>this stuff will really work.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pay so much for it to not work.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It numbs the skin very well.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who wants to buy something of quality ...................</li>
            <li>Both presently offer free shipping.</li>
            <li>Tattoo Artist must work fast once area is exposed</li>
            <li>Really helps with laser hair removal.</li>
            <li>This does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Works better than other brands that are lodicaine 5%.</li>
            <li>I usually purchase Greencaine numbing gel because it&#x27;s extremely effective when I use my Tria laser on my legs AND for my Brazilian wax.</li>
            <li>getting a tattoo removed and the pain is honestly excruciating - but this makes an UNBELIEVABLE difference.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>And as I said, even though they were done on different days in the exact same spot - the second one hurt more.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it added anything at all but the morning I used it, I scrubbed the area very well with a lufa and a sugar scrub being sure to get rid of all the dead skin - thinking maybe that would help penetrate better.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time, is not so strong how expected, is rather soft</li>
            <li>this session, I had the tulips, white daisies on the right and the hummingbird done.</li>
            <li>The cream in the 4% product in my opinion has less viscosity and that makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use plastic wrap and give yourself at least an hour to really kick in.</li>
            <li>Let me help: If you live near where you can get a sunburn</li>
            <li>Be sure to use small amounts with these kids and apply the cream to where it disappears in the skin; you don&#x27;t want a child getting Lidocaine in or near the eyes, and of course like all medicines it should be kept away from the reach of children.r near the eyes, and of course like all medicines it should be kept away from the reach of children.</li>
            <li>its better than waiting an extra half hour in her office to be numbed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li>last time I forgot to cover the whole area.</li>
            <li>Used 2 tubes whole back piece.</li>
            <li>Did not work very well overall.</li>
            <li>Absolutely a must cream for deep bikini laser hair removal procedure!!!</li>
            <li>Did not completely numb, but definitely took the edge off enough to where I would never wax again without it.</li>
            <li>I sure as heck hope it&#x27;s not too late to get my money back.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t do without numbing cream for laser and waxing, so price is definitely a major factor when considering which product to purchase.</li>
            <li>Definitely helps on the sensitive areas when getting tattoos</li>
            <li>I really thought this appointment would be great since my other 4 were painful.</li>
            <li>Tried to use it for a half sleeve tattoo, no change in pain (not my first tattoo).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve probably ordered it a total of 15-20 times I refuse to do a tattoo on myself without it because i literally can barely feel a thing....</li>
            <li>It numbed a little bit, but not too much.</li>

            <li> Made the brazilian wax much more tolerable...cannot wax again without it!</li>
            <li> Makes getting peels much more pleasant of an experience.</li>
            <li> Amazing I&#x27;m getting tattoed as I type</li>
            <li> Most of us probably recognize 20% more of any good thing as a good thing itself</li>

            <li> I love this product....</li>
            <li> Will order again for more work...</li>
            <li> I also tried No Scream Cream for waxing, and this product is far superior!  </li>
            <li> Leave it on a lttle longer than recommended because it does wear off very quick.</li>

            <li> Only lasts 45 minutes or so, which isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> to use Speednumb, but I think this may be more economical.</li>
            <li> I could not believe that I was not feeling any pain at all and whole procedure went so well!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually put a review, but I need to since this product was incredible on numbing!</li>
            <li> Edited to add: if you use this for waxing, make sure the wax does not get too hot.  </li>
            <li> I got more for the coloring and shading and used it exactly the way I used it for the line work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably go to the 5% first because most of us want to maximize when it comes to pain relief.</li>
            <li> Large areas may require 4 tubes to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> I was able to sit thru all my line work mostly pain free 6 total hours.</li>
            <li> and I still took the chance on getting this product because I really wanted to believe it could work and at this price I wanted it even more to be a dream come true.</li>
            <li> (Hey, go easy on me, it was my first time!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used as recommended and the half hour was great.</li>
            <li> Just apply wrap it up wait and wipe off with dry towel and your good to go .</li>
            <li> so I was able to sit still for a good 2 hour long session going over some sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Because it did NOT numb the area in ANYWAY.</li>
            <li> so the question gets to be which is economical for you?</li>
            <li> I have to self inject using a relatively large needle, the numbing is significant, if cream is used under a bandage about a hour before</li>
            <li> Works great for the first half hour</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found Lidocaine handy when either of the grandkids gets a finger shut in a door, or a minor abrasion (not wounds), or hitting the finger hammering one of those Home Depot kids projects;</li>
            <li> Worked quickly and stayed a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> Used this for a tattoo, worked great, skin was numb for about 2 1/2 hours made the experience very easy to deal with after it wore off still seemed to minimize the pain a bit.</li>
            <li> this was my first time using this product.</li>
            <li> Numbs skin very well!</li>
            <li> work very well!</li>
            <li> It really works, but it does not totally numb the area.</li>
            <li> It really numbs!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing a different numbing cream that is a much better quality than this one.  </li>
            <li> On my first session of bikini Elos laser hair removal I was jumping from pain and could not endure the torture.</li>

            <li> I Put on the skin about 1 hour and 40 min before getting the tattoo think it would have worked even better if i left in on for a lease 2 hours like the directions said but didn&#x27;t have time.  </li>
            <li> The higher viscosity in this product will help you use it</li>
            <li> then you&#x27;re more likely to need a 4 oz tube for that size of job.</li>
            <li> I then made sure to wrap the area in plastic wrap (held in place by medical tape) and when I was ready to wax, removed plastic wrap and  wiped off the remaining cream and got to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I came across NUMBFAST and purchased a tube due to the many positive reviews AND the $19.99 price tag!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to pick this up because the price is pretty high for what you get</li>
            <li> This numb Fast cream works great!</li>
            <li> #34;clean up&amp;#34; of strays, so I didn&#x27;t really need the numbing then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not 100% pain free, I say about 75% especially in the thicker hair follicles.  </li>
            <li> The cream absorbed completely into my skin.</li>
            <li> The area covered didn&#x27;t hurt at all but as soon as he hit the one I forgot to put cream on, I was in so much pain</li>
            <li> and then your ready to go.</li>
            <li> For me it did not take all of the pain away, but it really took the edge off.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> After about 10 minutes, my skin began to burn so intensely that I had to wash all of the cream off.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> helps so much.</li>
            <li> this stuff will really work.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay so much for it to not work.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It numbs the skin very well.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who wants to buy something of quality ...................</li>
            <li> Both presently offer free shipping.</li>
            <li> Tattoo Artist must work fast once area is exposed</li>
            <li> Really helps with laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> This does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Works better than other brands that are lodicaine 5%.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase Greencaine numbing gel because it&#x27;s extremely effective when I use my Tria laser on my legs AND for my Brazilian wax.</li>
            <li> getting a tattoo removed and the pain is honestly excruciating - but this makes an UNBELIEVABLE difference.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> And as I said, even though they were done on different days in the exact same spot - the second one hurt more.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it added anything at all but the morning I used it, I scrubbed the area very well with a lufa and a sugar scrub being sure to get rid of all the dead skin - thinking maybe that would help penetrate better.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, is not so strong how expected, is rather soft</li>
            <li> this session, I had the tulips, white daisies on the right and the hummingbird done.</li>
            <li> The cream in the 4% product in my opinion has less viscosity and that makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use plastic wrap and give yourself at least an hour to really kick in.</li>
            <li> Let me help: If you live near where you can get a sunburn</li>
            <li> Be sure to use small amounts with these kids and apply the cream to where it disappears in the skin; you don&#x27;t want a child getting Lidocaine in or near the eyes, and of course like all medicines it should be kept away from the reach of children.r near the eyes, and of course like all medicines it should be kept away from the reach of children.</li>
            <li> its better than waiting an extra half hour in her office to be numbed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> last time I forgot to cover the whole area.</li>
            <li> Used 2 tubes whole back piece.</li>
            <li> Did not work very well overall.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a must cream for deep bikini laser hair removal procedure!!!</li>
            <li> Did not completely numb, but definitely took the edge off enough to where I would never wax again without it.</li>
            <li> I sure as heck hope it&#x27;s not too late to get my money back.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t do without numbing cream for laser and waxing, so price is definitely a major factor when considering which product to purchase.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps on the sensitive areas when getting tattoos</li>
            <li> I really thought this appointment would be great since my other 4 were painful.</li>
            <li> Tried to use it for a half sleeve tattoo, no change in pain (not my first tattoo).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably ordered it a total of 15-20 times I refuse to do a tattoo on myself without it because i literally can barely feel a thing....</li>
            <li> It numbed a little bit, but not too much.</li>
            <li> You may not be able to feel that the wax is too hot and you will end up with some very angry skin!</li>
            <li> As described, it doesn&#x27;t last a long time.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, if you&#x27;re not a sunbather and want something for the occasional household kitchen burn then maybe the smaller tube is the choice if cost is not a object.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying this for as long as I have to wax.</li>
            <li> Takes a minute to work but when it does be careful if ur using it to tattoo especially because u will go deeper then</li>
            <li> and the difference is that this has 5% Lidocaine and the other has only 4% Lidocaine.</li>
            <li> it definitely let me down.</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as expected.</li>
            <li> I use a cotton cosmetic pad that I wet and wring out to spread it evenly over the skin.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely no numbing...</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, it did not numb my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I like that it has no real odor to it.</li>
            <li> followed the directions by applying a thick layer and rubbing it in completely into the skin, and then followed up with another layer that I did not run in fully (per the directions).</li>
            <li> It is expensive for such a small tube but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Barely worked for me, very hit or miss, one piece of skin wouldn&#x27;t even numb when generously applied, the other accidentally touched lost sensation for hours...</li>
            <li> I used it before my Brazilian wax and felt very little pain, similar to Greencaine.</li>
            <li> It worked as well as expected!</li>
            <li> I was able to get through about 1 1/2 hours of tattooing completely numb!</li>
            <li> and my beautician saw the difference in my reaction and asked me what the cream was called so she can recommend it to her other clients.</li>
            <li> Wish I used this before on my other tattoos</li>
            <li> The other is $3.63 an ounce and this is $19.50 an ounce [30 grams].</li>
            <li> This does numb fast, but the numbing effect seems to fade quicker than a traditional numbing creme.  </li>
            <li> I just got tattooed behind the knee (known for being a very painful spot), both legs, and this stuff did wonders and I have several tattoos done without it, so I feel I can gauge fairly well.</li>
            <li> Just note that you may have to re-apply a few times due to it wearing off.  </li>
            <li> I think the trick is to only rub a small amount actually into the skin then coat the skin with a very thick layer and wrap it up tight.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t numb me completely, but it definitely took the edge off</li>
            <li> pain means no flinching and less damage at injection site.</li>
            <li> Maybe an hour &amp; a half to two hours for me.</li>
            <li> I wiped it off about 10 minutes before the wax and it felt pretty numb.</li>
            <li> First it takes a lot of the product to numb an area.</li>
            <li> I felt every little bit.</li>
            <li> Third you only get about 15 minutes of numb time before it wears off.</li>
            <li> Yes after a few hours you can feel it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so upset that I wasted my money on it, and</li>
            <li> You just put it on and rub it in and after a few minutes, you&#x27;re all set.</li>
            <li> What a waste</li>
            <li> I use this for skin needling, which can be very irritating if you already have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Second it takes a long time for the area to become numb.</li>
            <li> but I am a baby when it comes to tattooing myself, I am never able to finish it  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately the effects do not last past that.</li>
            <li> It did help eventually and there wasn&#x27;t any damage, but not a grand achievement.</li>
            <li> There were a decent amount of bad</li>
            <li> Waxing el natural is really painful, kudos to those who can.  </li>
            <li> I was numb for a solid 2 hrs after.</li>
            <li> I do neither of these things - I find I&#x27;m fully numb in an hour without the cover, but that may be because I do skin needling regularly, so</li>
            <li> at least until you get used to how the products behave and gauge your pain threshold.</li>
            <li> Only seems to numb the eye area.</li>
            <li> It did not ruin my tattoo in the least, I did not notice any problems with healing</li>
            <li> I read EVERY review on here when I am purchasing an item or at least try to.</li>
            <li> My directions said keep on at least 2 hours.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Very small tube for the price.</li>
            <li> Overall, this was a very disappointing experience.</li>
            <li> Once the skin is broken it does not do its job at all.</li>
            <li> behind...)</li>
            <li> Much less painful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of comparing the two for pain relief I am unable to discern a difference, but I know while using the less expensive product the skin on the hand applying became numb and that speaks to adequacy on some level.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was there for a five hour sitting, but I took it like a champ &amp; didn&#x27;t wuss out when the pain started hitting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was completely numb for the majority of the hour session.</li>
            <li> I use this numb cream when I get alser hair remover.  </li>
            <li> There is not a child proof cap on this product and Lidocaine is quite a dangerous substance for children to have the chance to get into.  </li>
            <li> completely numb.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t numb at all.</li>
            <li> Hurt like crazy.  </li>
            <li> it did numb my skin</li>
            <li> I had a 3 hour session and it lasted about 2 hours so not too bad.</li>
            <li> I have grandchildren and bad splinters come with the territory of children.</li>
            <li> I know everyone reads the reviews thinking that may have been a bad batch that wont happen to me.</li>
            <li> This procedure is quite painful and numbfest makes it bearable.</li>
            <li> hate that you have to put a wrap over it once applied to the skin for it to take affect.</li>
            <li> Waxing still isn&#x27;t painless, but it takes away the worst of it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product! I have bought several tubes, it personally lasts for me 1-2 hours, I feel no pain only vibrations from the tattoo gun. But by that time, the artist is almost done with the session.</li>
            <li> This numb Fast cream works great! I put it on for an hour &amp; wrapped plastic wrap over it. I used it on my tummy prior to derma rolling, I used a 2.0 mm. I didn&#x27;t feel any pain &amp; this was my first time using this product. I would recommend this product! I don&#x27;t usually put a review, but I need to since this product was incredible on numbing!</li>
            <li> Used this before a self, at-home Brazilian wax session and it worked wonderfully. I was totally expecting it not to work based on the reviews here but for me, it did its job and then some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions by applying a thick layer and rubbing it in completely into the skin, and then followed up with another layer that I did not run in fully (per the directions). I then made sure to wrap the area in plastic wrap (held in place by medical tape) and when I was ready to wax, removed plastic wrap and  wiped off the remaining cream and got to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was completely numb for the majority of the hour session. It was the last 10 minutes or so that I could tell it had started to fade off but by that time, I was only doing &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34; of strays, so I didn&#x27;t really need the numbing then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is going to be a staple for me! Definitely recommend for those who wax at home. Be sure to use plastic wrap and give yourself at least an hour to really kick in.</li>
            <li> This does numb fast, but the numbing effect seems to fade quicker than a traditional numbing creme.  I&#x27;d buy it again though.  Just note that you may have to re-apply a few times due to it wearing off.  I use it when I visit my aesthetician, its better than waiting an extra half hour in her office to be numbed.  Great time saver.</li>
            <li> Used it for a tattoo I&#x27;m getting on my leg. I had a 3 hour session and it lasted about 2 hours so not too bad.</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as expected. Very small tube for the price. I had a laser procedure done &amp; I left some areas untreated &amp; the pain level was the same on the treated area &amp; the untreated area.</li>
            <li> I use this for bikini/brazilian waxing and it works great!  I am able to wax myself using Numbfast.  I also tried No Scream Cream for waxing, and this product is far superior!  PS. I apply and cover with saran wrap and wait about 45-60 minutes while my wax heats.  Then I do a tester strip and if I&#x27;m not quite happy with the results, I reapply and put the saran wrap back on and wait another 30 minutes.  Then I wax.  It is not 100% pain free, I say about 75% especially in the thicker hair follicles.  Waxing el natural is really painful, kudos to those who can.  Not me.  :)  Edited to add: if you use this for waxing, make sure the wax does not get too hot.  Test it on your arm if you have too.  You may not be able to feel that the wax is too hot and you will end up with some very angry skin!</li>
            <li> It worked as well as expected! It didn&#x27;t numb me completely, but it definitely took the edge off so I was able to sit still for a good 2 hour long session going over some sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like anestesia</li>
            <li> I use this numb cream when I get alser hair remover.  I&#x27;ve ordered it 3 times and I love it.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase Greencaine numbing gel because it&#x27;s extremely effective when I use my Tria laser on my legs AND for my Brazilian wax. However, the price is $55 for 4 Oz tube...ouch! I came across NUMBFAST and purchased a tube due to the many positive reviews AND the $19.99 price tag! I used it before my Brazilian wax and felt very little pain, similar to Greencaine. Prior to my appointment,  I rubbed the cream into my skin, put saran wrap securely on the area, and waited for approximately 1 hr. The cream absorbed completely into my skin. I was numb for a solid 2 hrs after. Both creams are excellent, quality products. I gave Greencaine 5 stars too, but NUMBFAST is much more affordable. I can&#x27;t do without numbing cream for laser and waxing, so price is definitely a major factor when considering which product to purchase.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all</li>
            <li> Very effective, I recommend !!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a numbing cream before till I tried this.  The reason I decided to try this was because I was getting a huge coverup tattoo. I put on the cream generously and left a layer on , then wrapped it for three hours before my tattoo .&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you this is a life saver. Yes after a few hours you can feel it but it isn&#x27;t anything compared to the actual pain.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this 4 times already .&lt;br /&gt;This last time I forgot to cover the whole area. The area covered didn&#x27;t hurt at all but as soon as he hit the one I forgot to put cream on, I was in so much pain</li>
            <li> Numbs skin very well!</li>
            <li> I use this numblng cream for my facial laser removal treatments and it helps a lot. This procedure is quite painful and numbfest makes it bearable.</li>
            <li> Worked quickly and stayed a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> Tried to use it for a half sleeve tattoo, no change in pain (not my first tattoo). I used as directed.</li>
            <li> This is okay, not the best in the world. Only lasts 45 minutes or so, which isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and works perfectly!!</li>
            <li> This product is great. I use this cream before my laser hair removal treatments. All you need to do is rub this cream into the skin then place a layer over the area and cover with saran wrap for an hour and then your ready to go. For me it did not take all of the pain away, but it really took the edge off.</li>
            <li> I use this before I get my Skin Pen on my face!  work very well!</li>
            <li> I got this for my Brazilian waxes. It really works, but it does not totally numb the area. It does give a bit of relief which is all I wanted to make it bearable. I put it on the area, and put plastic wrap over it. It was on my for an hour. I wiped it off about 10 minutes before the wax and it felt pretty numb. But the numbness goes away so quickly that I could tell during the wax that it had already worn off a great deal. All in all I will use again.</li>
            <li> Did not last but for maybe 30 minutes of tattoo time. Used 2 tubes whole back piece. Used as recommended and the half hour was great. But it fell way short of two hours.</li>
            <li> I use this for skin needling, which can be very irritating if you already have sensitive skin. Works like a charm. I use a cotton cosmetic pad that I wet and wring out to spread it evenly over the skin. It says to cover it with plastic and wait 2 hours before your procedure. I do neither of these things - I find I&#x27;m fully numb in an hour without the cover, but that may be because I do skin needling regularly, so I suggest you follow the directions at least until you get used to how the products behave and gauge your pain threshold. The anesthetic lasts a good while too, so you don&#x27;t have to re-apply often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used to use Speednumb, but I think this may be more economical.</li>
            <li> I have grandchildren and bad splinters come with the territory of children. This product helps with screaming fits of pain. It helps the proses of fixing boo boo&#x27;s faster.</li>
            <li> I purchased the numbing cream to use prior to my derma-rolling. Apply, wait 25 minutes, then derma-roll! Much less painful.</li>
            <li> It worked well. You just have to apply the cream about an hour or so before you go get your tattoo.</li>
            <li> It really numbs! Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Great for laser hair removal!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says. I was able to get through about 1 1/2 hours of tattooing completely numb!</li>
            <li> Makes getting peels much more pleasant of an experience. I love it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for Nape tattoo. Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely no numbing...</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help with the sensitivity while using my tria. Sorry to say, it did not numb my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but it works ok. First it takes a lot of the product to numb an area. Second it takes a long time for the area to become numb. Third you only get about 15 minutes of numb time before it wears off.</li>
            <li> Did not work very well overall. I used it for laser hair removal and will not be using it again.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT IS NOT MADE IN THE USA. Not very happy with this purchase. The product is packaged very cheaply and when I took the tube of cream out of the box, there was already a puncture hole in it. Because of this, numbing cream was all over the box. Despite this fact though, I decided to test the numbing ability of this cream to see if I should re-purchase it. After about 10 minutes, my skin began to burn so intensely that I had to wash all of the cream off. I will be purchasing a different numbing cream that is a much better quality than this one.  P.S. There is not a child proof cap on this product and Lidocaine is quite a dangerous substance for children to have the chance to get into.  Overall, this was a very disappointing experience.</li>
            <li> Yep, you put it on your arm, and your arm will disappear.</li>
            <li> Amazing I&#x27;m getting tattoed as I type this didn&#x27;t feel any of the outline. I did also purchase vasoacaine which is used when the skin is open.. Best tattoo every no pain</li>
            <li> A lot of reviews bashing this product, but everyone reacts different to pain, esp tattoos. Even the same person on a different day will respond differently. I just got tattooed behind the knee (known for being a very painful spot), both legs, and this stuff did wonders and I have several tattoos done without it, so I feel I can gauge fairly well. And as I said, even though they were done on different days in the exact same spot - the second one hurt more. You cannot expect to feel 0 pain using this product, but it does help. Not sure if it added anything at all but the morning I used it, I scrubbed the area very well with a lufa and a sugar scrub being sure to get rid of all the dead skin - thinking maybe that would help penetrate better.</li>
            <li> IT WORKED .... TATTOO DID NOT HURT AT ALL !!</li>
            <li> this absolutely works, I&#x27;ve used on clients for more painful places they get tattooed and also I&#x27;ve used this on myself a number of times.  I am a tattoo artist but I am a baby when it comes to tattooing myself, I am never able to finish it  but ever since I have seen this I&#x27;ve probably ordered it a total of 15-20 times I refuse to do a tattoo on myself without it because i literally can barely feel a thing....feeling does start coming back in about an hour though.  I apply a generous amount to the area and wrap plastic wrap around it and let it sit for about an hour then take it off and wipe it off and start the tattoo...its amazing!!</li>
            <li> Works very well. Waxing still isn&#x27;t painless, but it takes away the worst of it!</li>
            <li> People are saying its not working. I don&#x27;t think it works very good.</li>
            <li> Very good I  recomed  it I am using it for my hair removal treatment.&lt;br /&gt;And  the pain is less&lt;br /&gt;I can see the diff with it and with out it&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again</li>
            <li> If you use it. Leave it on a lttle longer than recommended because it does wear off very quick.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a must cream for deep bikini laser hair removal procedure!!! I give this product a 5 star!!! This cream is really effective a fantastic cream!!! On my first session of bikini Elos laser hair removal I was jumping from pain and could not endure the torture. Then I started to search online numbing creams and decided to try this NUMBFAST and I am so happy! I could not believe that I was not feeling any pain at all and whole procedure went so well!!! I applied the cream 1 hour before the procedure as it was written and it worked!!! Thanks amazon!!!</li>
            <li> This product definitely made my waxing more tolerable. Did not completely numb, but definitely took the edge off enough to where I would never wax again without it.</li>
            <li> I have to self inject using a relatively large needle, the numbing is significant, if cream is used under a bandage about a hour before injection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No pain means no flinching and less damage at injection site.</li>
            <li> Using for dermatology and works good</li>
            <li> I used this product for a sleeve. I used it exactly as the instructions said to use it. It worked great for the outline work. I was able to sit thru all my line work mostly pain free 6 total hours. I got more for the coloring and shading and used it exactly the way I used it for the line work and it did not work at all. So I would recommend this product for line work but nothing else. Once the skin is broken it does not do its job at all. Look for the blue bottle of spray stuff its called vicocane (I think is how you spell it) for shading and color..</li>
            <li> Came with instructions and was easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This is the bomb for laser hair removal.  Just need to leave it on for about an hour before your treatment.</li>
            <li> helps so much. getting a tattoo removed and the pain is honestly excruciating - but this makes an UNBELIEVABLE difference.</li>
            <li> If you read the directions this come with and follow them this stuff will really work. I used it before my tattoo (loss count on what number this was) am working on my sleeve and for a good two hours i couldn&#x27;t feel anything! completely numb. as it started to wear off it still help to ease the intensity of the pain.</li>
            <li> works great for tattooing</li>
            <li> This product did not work at ALL. I&#x27;m so upset that I wasted my money on it, and I sure as heck hope it&#x27;s not too late to get my money back. I essentially paid twenty something dollars for lotion. Because it did NOT numb the area in ANYWAY. I followed the directions exactly how they were listed and it still didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m so furious about the product because the reviews were almost all impeccable and I thought I would give this a chance...it definitely let me down. If you listen to ANY of these reviews, please let it be mine. Don&#x27;t pay so much for it to not work. It&#x27;s a huge WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps on the sensitive areas when getting tattoos</li>
            <li> I used for laser hair removal. I put it on an hour before my appt and it worked about 50% of the time. I would definitely try it.</li>
            <li> Works!! I used it when I was doing laser.</li>
            <li> It was a wonderful product</li>
            <li> Works better than other brands that are lodicaine 5%. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Does work, I used it for when I have a wax appointment and my beautician saw the difference in my reaction and asked me what the cream was called so she can recommend it to her other clients. I&#x27;m buying this for as long as I have to wax. It is expensive for such a small tube but totally worth it. Don&#x27;t try to use a regular bag instead of saran wrap, it doesn&#x27;t work with a regular bag.</li>
            <li> Only seems to numb the eye area.</li>
            <li> Works great for the first half hour but unfortunately the effects do not last past that.</li>
            <li> Worked AMAZING for me! Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> hate that you have to put a wrap over it once applied to the skin for it to take affect. for over 2 hours to wait for this work and do it job, should take no longer than 20-30 mintues for item to work</li>
            <li> Takes a minute to work but when it does be careful if ur using it to tattoo especially because u will go deeper then u want and not notice and feel it for real later!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to pick this up because the price is pretty high for what you get but i&#x27;m really glad i tried this. It numbs the skin very well. You just put it on and rub it in and after a few minutes, you&#x27;re all set. I mainly use it for lancing cysts and this numbs the skin perfectly for it. I&#x27;m sure it work well for piercings or tattoos as well.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, is not so strong how expected, is rather soft</li>
            <li> Used this for a tattoo, worked great, skin was numb for about 2 1/2 hours made the experience very easy to deal with after it wore off still seemed to minimize the pain a bit. I think the trick is to only rub a small amount actually into the skin then coat the skin with a very thick layer and wrap it up tight. I Put on the skin about 1 hour and 40 min before getting the tattoo think it would have worked even better if i left in on for a lease 2 hours like the directions said but didn&#x27;t have time.  Wish I used this before on my other tattoos would have helped alot. I like that it has no real odor to it. Just apply wrap it up wait and wipe off with dry towel and your good to go . I see no reason to get anymore tattoos without using this.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions!! I got this for a lengthy tattoo session. It says to use it two hours before and to wrap with saran wrap, I did just that and it worked. I did not even feel the man tattooing for about 3 hours (but he was also running 45 min. behind...). I did check with my artist before using and he was ok with giving it a chance. It did not ruin my tattoo in the least, I did not notice any problems with healing and I&#x27;m on here to buy another tube for my next session. Hope this helps anyone trying to decide whether or not to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this session, I had the tulips, white daisies on the right and the hummingbird done.</li>
            <li> fantastic, excellent product. I recommend it to anyone who wants to buy something of quality ...................</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the product. I also use another Amazon offered product &amp;#34;Lidocaine Plus (Lidocaine 4%) Cream ~ oz&amp;#34; and the difference is that this has 5% Lidocaine and the other has only 4% Lidocaine. The other is $3.63 an ounce and this is $19.50 an ounce [30 grams]. Both presently offer free shipping. I don&#x27;t find any fault in either product.  This product has an extra 20% of the key ingredient but is five times more expensive. The cream in the 4% product in my opinion has less viscosity and that makes it easy to apply. The higher viscosity in this product will help you use it sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of comparing the two for pain relief I am unable to discern a difference, but I know while using the less expensive product the skin on the hand applying became numb and that speaks to adequacy on some level. I wanted to find out if there was a difference with the extra percent and I didn&#x27;t find out, so I will probably stay with the 4% cream on reorders. However, the next time I have a burn I&#x27;ll probably go to the 5% first because most of us want to maximize when it comes to pain relief. Most of us probably recognize 20% more of any good thing as a good thing itself so the question gets to be which is economical for you? Let me help: If you live near where you can get a sunburn then you&#x27;re more likely to need a 4 oz tube for that size of job. On the other hand, if you&#x27;re not a sunbather and want something for the occasional household kitchen burn then maybe the smaller tube is the choice if cost is not a object. I&#x27;ve also found Lidocaine handy when either of the grandkids gets a finger shut in a door, or a minor abrasion (not wounds), or hitting the finger hammering one of those Home Depot kids projects; things of that sort. They are comforted and move pass the moment and onto playing much more quickly. NOTE: Be sure to use small amounts with these kids and apply the cream to where it disappears in the skin; you don&#x27;t want a child getting Lidocaine in or near the eyes, and of course like all medicines it should be kept away from the reach of children.r near the eyes, and of course like all medicines it should be kept away from the reach of children.</li>
            <li> Why would anyone get a tattoo without this! It worked excellent.</li>
            <li> Very nice! works well</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t numb at all. Could totally feel tattoo needle. Hurt like crazy.  Didn&#x27;t work for me. Returned it....</li>
            <li> This is The Most Amazing STUFF I have ever used! I&#x27;m a HUGEE baby when it comes to needles! And have gone though the pain of getting a tattoo with out this stuff. Finished my tattoo to day! And used this stuff. DIDN&#x27;T FEEL A PAIN!</li>
            <li> Does have numbing effect. Tattoo Artist must work fast once area is exposed I began feeling pain within 15 minutes. Large areas may require 4 tubes to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> I read EVERY review on here when I am purchasing an item or at least try to. There were a decent amount of bad and I still took the chance on getting this product because I really wanted to believe it could work and at this price I wanted it even more to be a dream come true. I applied the cream generously over my area to be treated. I then used saran wrap as directed. I did not remove the wrap until I got to my laser hair removal office. Total of 2 hr and 15 mins. My directions said keep on at least 2 hours. I went in with GREAT CONFIDENCE that I wouldn&#x27;t feel a thing. Then the laser started and holy hell I felt every little bit. I really thought this appointment would be great since my other 4 were painful. While going through treatment I cursed this stuff numerous times in my head. What a waste and I cannot return it and I am out the money. Now I will have to spend more for something that works. Don&#x27;t waist your time get the better quality stuff and pay the money or you will pay way more like me. I know everyone reads the reviews thinking that may have been a bad batch that wont happen to me. Trust me it will. It did nothing for me. Take my advice! Oh it wasn&#x27;t expired like some people had an issue with. Mine says Jan 2017. Don&#x27;t do it!</li>
            <li> Made the brazilian wax much more tolerable...cannot wax again without it!</li>
            <li> Really helps with laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> Purchased for tattoo removal on my index finger. Followed proper application instructions. Didn&#x27;t work. Dermatologist had to stop, apply the cream they had there and then proceed after 3 mins.</li>
            <li> Works great and penetrates skin as advertised.</li>
            <li> I had to leave it on for two hours. It numbed a little bit, but not too much.</li>
            <li> Barely worked for me, very hit or miss, one piece of skin wouldn&#x27;t even numb when generously applied, the other accidentally touched lost sensation for hours...It did help eventually and there wasn&#x27;t any damage, but not a grand achievement.</li>
            <li> You do have to wait the 15 minutes, however the results are great.  NO PAIN.</li>
            <li> As described, it doesn&#x27;t last a long time. Maybe an hour &amp; a half to two hours for me. Unfortunately I was there for a five hour sitting, but I took it like a champ &amp; didn&#x27;t wuss out when the pain started hitting. (Hey, go easy on me, it was my first time!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;definitely reccommend for shorter sittings / smaller tattoos. If I get another (any size) I will still use it.</li>
            <li> I love this product....I got a tattoo on my upper inner arm AND DIDN&#x27;T FEEL ANYTHING.....Will order again for more work... SUPPER EXCITED!!!! I follow the directions to the T!!!!</li>
            <li> it did numb my skin but i had to apply it twice.</li>
            <li> This does absolutely nothing.</li>
