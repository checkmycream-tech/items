            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>It is amazing!</li>
            <li>They give you excellent tips and show you how to use and love each of their products.</li>
            <li>just be sure to dab instead of schmear it on, and your face will look flawless!</li>
            <li>makes my skin more smoothy and flawless with foundation</li>
            <li>It fills in all your pores and fine lines and allows your foundation/concealer to blend in perfectly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had good skin.</li>
            <li>I loved the product when I bought it at Sephora.</li>
            <li>I guess this would be a good purchase if you had neither of these stores in your area.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s good compared to some of the things that you can put on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product works good for temporary pore reduction.</li>
            <li>and she knows good beauty products.</li>
            <li>They are really good at posting them.  </li>
            <li>But I guess you get what you paid for, and while I thought I was getting was a good deal</li>
            <li>Lorac is a superior product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome and makes my face look totally smooth.  </li>
            <li>This creamy velvety smooth formula is perfect for my dry/oily combo skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth and flawless and my makeup lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>It feels good when you put it on, but</li>
            <li>If your skin is in good shape, you can wear it alone too.</li>
            <li>I put it on and loved the way it felt.  </li>
            <li>I have good skin</li>
            <li>and I loved it a lot ..</li>
            <li>It has a great, smooth, non-oily texture giving my skin a matte finish, filling in the pores and giving my skin a great youthful, creamy finish.  </li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love benefit porefessional!!!</li>
            <li>With the Lorac primer, my makeup looks flawless and stays fresh until I take it off.  </li>
            <li>And somehow it is tinted just right to blend perfectly</li>
            <li>works at first, works great!</li>
            <li>Love the way this product goes on under makeup and gives my skin a nice silky feeling without being greasy/oily!</li>
            <li>this product from Benefit looks and feels like on my skin - I love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Makes my makeup look so much better!</li>
            <li>Never have I received more compliments!</li>
            <li>This product does everything it says and much more!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>The best for people that has large pores... use it and you will see the difference</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Woooooooooow this product is so so amazing</li>
            <li>AMAZING</li>
            <li>Did my makeup and my skin looked amazing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, because it does an amazing job.  </li>
            <li>It feels like silk when you put it on your skin and keeps the skin feeling nice</li>
            <li>I will never spend my own money on this, so</li>
            <li>I gave my friend a sample of mine and she liked it as well</li>
            <li>So I use POREfessional over the top and it gives me a flawless, matte look that is fresh and not cakey.  </li>
            <li>This product&#x27;s formula and ingredients could allegedly be hazardous, I have also come to find out.  </li>
            <li>I used this product hoping that each time I would see some kind of difference.</li>
            <li>Really helps for a flawless looking skin.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with this product at all.  </li>
            <li>Very soft/smooth and perfect for anytime/</li>
            <li>any kind makeup.</li>
            <li>It feels clean on my skin...not greasy and looks great.  </li>
            <li>I figured it was too good to be true!</li>
            <li>(This is basically spackle for your pores---but looks awesome and has caused me no skin reaction, even though my skin is very sensitive.)</li>
            <li>Puerto Rican and have naturally oily skin and enlarged pores, I&#x27;m still amazed to this day at how wonderfully this product assists with BOTH of those issues.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of blackheads in my nose/cheek/chin area and this product smooths out those pores nicely, since blackheads are more just pores and not inflammation.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised and simultaneously horrified, given all the excellent reviews of this product on Amazon and YouTube.  </li>
            <li>I like how much sort makes your skin feel and makes it easy to blend makeup but not that impressed</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS STUFF!  </li>
            <li>I use this more and more, and it&#x27;s becoming my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; product for making my skin look good.  </li>
            <li>Nonetheless, it also has a very strong fragrance, which I found overwhelming.</li>
            <li>okay but not as good as the true stuff</li>
            <li>My favorite makeup primer, never go a day without it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me tell you: this product is a magic potion, it made my pores literrally disappear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so in love with my skin now.</li>
            <li>I love the porefessional.</li>
            <li>I have actually quit wearing any foundation since I bought this, it&#x27;s AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li>I want to love this, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this product after reading many favorable reviews, but it was no use for me.</li>
            <li>I purchased it at Sephora and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>They put something else in the POREfessional bottle that is thicker, darker in hue, and feels more like an expired foundation on the skin.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>It can be used under or on top of makeup.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you pat your face, not rub.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought POREprofessional because I read so many glowing reviews.</li>
            <li>It works on the pores on my chin but not on the top and sides of my nose.</li>
            <li>so I could buy it more often</li>
            <li>I am going to purchase more...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to just spend the money and go buy it from Benefit or a cosmetics store</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll stick with clarins for better result but they are pricey though</li>
            <li>The Lorac mattifying primer works way better than this.  </li>
            <li>This just teaches me the lesson of being satisfied with what I have.  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this.</li>
            <li>Have used for a year and love alone or under foundation.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend purchasing anyting like this from seller or anyone else online except a reputable makeup company.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>i really love it</li>
            <li>This product has helped me look and feel better.  </li>
            <li>I lOve Benefit&#x27;s POREfessional primer for my forehead,nose and cheeks which do have some pores,more noticeable on forehead.  </li>
            <li>and I love it for covering the pores on my nose.</li>
            <li>Why would you pay MORE for a product than Benefit themselves and their authorized sellers charges?</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li>I love the texture -</li>
            <li>I try to re-apply over the top of my make up which is a BB cream and tht</li>
            <li>The consistency is nice and it goes on really smoothly.</li>
            <li>It mostly leaves my nose flake-y when I put it on.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this from Sephora after hearing such awesome things.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and it does an okay job.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the packaging and arrival timing.</li>
            <li>Its not awful,</li>
            <li>finish much better.</li>
            <li>On days that I don&#x27;t use the smashbox product, I use aveeno tinted moisturizer and that works better than this product as well.</li>
            <li>it goes on nicely, does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do, and makes my makeup go on so much smoother than most!</li>
            <li>I think this is easily the most overrated product of the year.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and makes me feel more confident about my imperfections.</li>
            <li>If the product you receive is anything short of light, silky and wonderful - you probably received a knock off.</li>
            <li>If you want something light, non pigmented, and that works MUCH better stick with Clinique&#x27;s Oil Control Hydrator.</li>
            <li>I also love that I can buy it on Amazon w/ FREE shipping.</li>
            <li>I love this product, how every ontop of some of my mosturizier it tends to clump up, and also does not keep me af matte as I was hoping, but I like to use this with my nars oil free primer</li>
            <li>I purchased this primer from Ulta but loved it so much I wanted to write a review.  </li>
            <li>I dabbed a little more on - blended in perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I have bought Benefit products for years, I do not believe this is a true product!</li>
            <li>Tried other products but this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really easy to spread out and blend in.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for making my skin look soft and smooth -</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really easy to apply foundation over it.</li>
            <li>I love Benefit Cosmetics mainly because they deliver a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>:) I explained to her that Mommy just wasn&#x27;t one of those lucky people like her whose pores weren&#x27;t visible..</li>
            <li>Nothing huge, just like what you&#x27;d see from an errant speck of mascara or something.  </li>
            <li>I have huge sized pores on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>being that I have huge pores.</li>
            <li>I have huge pores.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product and I will say that it is Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light beige.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will be buying this product anymore do to the changes made by the company unless it was turnes silky smooth again....</li>
            <li>It makes my t-zone smooth</li>
            <li>I have also used this alone as a sheer foundation and it works great.  </li>
            <li>This primer wears perfect under any makeup, you don&#x27;t have to use benefits&#x27; foundation, an aspect I love about the entire product line (so far).  </li>
            <li>I really liked it so much.</li>
            <li>It helped me keeping the foundation smooth and poreless</li>
            <li>However, as a facial primer, I thought this product was great.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and found the POREfessional to go on light and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous Benefit product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s about it though as far as the good things go.</li>
            <li>This product really works, I bought 2!!!</li>
            <li>This was not the real thing!!!</li>
            <li>I am new to foundation primers and am glad I found this one so soon in my search!  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing it smells good and makes my pores look less visible and works as a primer.  </li>
            <li>First I want to say that I love this product.</li>
            <li>Hey there,&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>The duration of the product is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>This is original product</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m so excited I get to have a makeup face that will stay on this summer, and not melt away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it on clean skin before applying mascara.</li>
            <li>actually* make your face look flawless with it being applied by a professional?    </li>
            <li>Clearly this REALLY clogged my pores and my skin wasn&#x27;t happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if your pores are HUGE, this product would be worth it.</li>
            <li>However, you can purchase it on Ebay for $18 (including shipping) for a full sized bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really soft on your skin, so it feels nice and almost powdery.</li>
            <li>This product was number one in my book now the formulation has been changed and not for the better being how much we pay for it.</li>
            <li>I used it daily and loved the smell and</li>
            <li>Seller offered a full refund, however, I did not want seller to resell this to some unsuspecting person.  </li>
            <li>it was not the true product.  </li>
            <li>this is not the true product</li>
            <li>Maybe you&#x27;d get a good review if it was actually the product.</li>
            <li>It actually did a good job camouflaging my pores and extending the wear of my makeup.</li>
            <li>and she looks at me and says, \\&quot;Mama, what are all those holes on your nose?\\&quot; (Kids, aren&#x27;t they just so sweet?)</li>
            <li>Plus, there is no bad, or chemical, smell</li>
            <li>There just wasn&#x27;t anything super special about it.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but it runs out super fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am a benefit LOVER so while this product is not for my skin, I am so happy with the company and other products.</li>
            <li>I will do some more research to find a better product- one that would be 4 stars or above.</li>
            <li>Really does smooth pores and make skin feel and look smooth.</li>
            <li>stuff works great, by the way, but only if you get the real deal.</li>
            <li>it helps tremendously with pore coverage.</li>
            <li>I have never seen pimples pop up so quickly with anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>But luckily, it works well for me and has become my new favorite Benefit product.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and easy to apply and feels comfortable, a little like a very fine powder.</li>
            <li>THIS IS NOT THE REAL THING!!  </li>
            <li>After the first use it became watery!</li>
            <li>The actual product purchased at Sephora &#x3D; 5 stars for sure!</li>
            <li>I should have read all the reviews first!</li>
            <li>Your skin feels so smooth and really reduce the pore.</li>
            <li>it is silky, velvety smooth and goes on to make your skin look very &amp;#34;blurred&amp;#34; and even.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s important to say, because had I spent my own money on it</li>
            <li>I later ask her how she liked the product</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth every dollar, and throw anything else you have away!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Smashbox is far better</li>
            <li>I was thinking I was going to put it on laugh and walk away.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it a family member thought I was pregnant because of the glow my skin had to it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really fair skinned, and I can&#x27;t see it on my face like some of the other reviews</li>
            <li>I think it makes the powder I wear look a little better, and more polished.</li>
            <li>went in search of pore eraser, or whatever it would be that I could use to help this huge issue that took me almost 40 years to even know I had developed!</li>
            <li>It really helps diminish pores and it has a nice scent not overwhelming or potent.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>Even with the tint it has, it didn&#x27;t help my skin very much.</li>
            <li>and although I probably had to use a little more of this than most people, it really does work.</li>
            <li>Additionally, even though I did not think there was a major change in the look of my skin, many, many people commented on how my skin looked so healthy lately.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit concerned the first time I used the product, as it does have a tint to it</li>
            <li>Where to start: first is the color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s water based, and actually does fill better without the hastles.</li>
            <li>I bought this Product again, 2 tubes for myself and my Mother again, and she used it and the first thing She noticed was</li>
            <li>Save yourself the time and money buy from sephora or other reputable places!</li>
            <li>since this is the first pore product I&#x27;ve bought, I didn&#x27;t have anything to compare it with.</li>
            <li>I love the the intricacy of its ingredients that complement the ultimate quality when I used it.</li>
            <li>Absorb into pores immediately then make the pores more obvious.</li>
            <li>In fact, my makeup looked exactly as it does when I don&#x27;t use a primer.  </li>
            <li>Not my first time trying it.</li>
            <li>He loves the way it works, and I love how it also makes me look 5 years younger just from reducing (not really reducing but somehow amazingly hiding them)</li>
            <li>I thought it was worth the money; however, when I tried the product, it is very short-lasting.  </li>
            <li>And at first I did.</li>
            <li>My face feels do soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>;-) I started at the drugstores and bought one pore minimizer after another, but to no avail..&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was already a fan of \\&quot;Benefit They&#x27;Re Real!</li>
            <li>When I put this product on, at first I thought it was a miracle.</li>
            <li>Its not the real thing!</li>
            <li>Porefessional is a great product as a spot corrector, primer, or mixed with a little foundation, all you need for full cover-up.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s some other kind of makeup in a porefessional box</li>
            <li>Needless to say,I was happy because I got a free tube of porefessional.</li>
            <li>and you can dab it on top of your foundation later on in the day if you have really oily skin.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t glide on very well and the overall finish was just okay.</li>
            <li>This is the first pore-minimizer I&#x27;ve ever used so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.  </li>
            <li>However, this product works exactly as described and I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it works well for people who are not sensitive to it.</li>
            <li>It DOES have a cool texture and feels soft and creamy on my face, but wasn&#x27;t the product I was looking for at all.  </li>
            <li>First of all, the tube arrived unsealed and appeared as though it was just filled with regular foundation.</li>
            <li>I purchased mine at Sephora and my recommendation to anyone who has a large area they are trying to correct is to use this product under your make up.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I don&#x27;t have a problem with large pores, so</li>
            <li>I have mefium to large size pores and it fills them all in.  </li>
            <li>this a positive review my wife has cancer&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Guilt trip much?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally not one to buy make up that costs more than $10</li>
            <li>I have had the &#x27;issue&#x27; of being the not-so-proud owner of large pores my whole life.</li>
            <li>I use a tinted moisturizer with SPF instead of foundation and although it gives my skin a nice, even look, it does leave it looking a little greasy.  </li>
            <li>it even covered up some of my trouble spots (amazing).  </li>
            <li>I will go back to buying from Sephora which sells the totally fantastic REAL product.  </li>
            <li>Doesnt last all day, but this product really helps my skin look so smooth.</li>
            <li>&quot; Obviously, I shouldn&#x27;t have been taken in by the cheap pricing.</li>
            <li>Well I tried it, and REALLY didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to dab it, powder myself again - really</li>
            <li>, just re-do my whole</li>
            <li>so I can absolutely tell the difference.</li>
            <li>Order the real thing from a reliable source.</li>
            <li>Why do some of these companies put so much perfume in their product?  </li>
            <li>I tried everything, but this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>It really does help reduce pore size.</li>
            <li>This product really reduces my pores - and it also keeps my oily face matte so much longer than just a moisturiser or a primer.</li>
            <li>I got this along with the powder foundation from benefit, I never knew my pores really were an issue</li>
            <li>It seems a bit pricey, but you really don&#x27;t need a whole lot to get the job done.</li>
            <li>It seems like a moisturizer with lots of talc and it dries fast.</li>
            <li>Now that is high quality makeup!  </li>
            <li>My foundation was very streaked.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy from here, this isn&#x27;t the real Benefit Porefessional product by Benefit Cosmetics.</li>
            <li>so you know you&#x27;re getting the real thing.</li>
            <li>For me, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in the size of my pores after using it.</li>
            <li>no pores were visible on my face at all and as an added benefit, it also controls oil in my T zone really well.  </li>
            <li>This product was a lot cheaper from this vendor, but it is NOT the real thing..</li>
            <li>I bought it from the bitch box shop because I didn&#x27;t get a sample and really wanted to try it,</li>
            <li>It makes your sling feel like velvet and it really does minimize the appearance of pores.</li>
            <li>Like any supplier selling knock-offs, the packaging looks identical to the real stuff.</li>
            <li>They confirmed that it had not and what I received was likely a counterfeit product.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Porefessional, the real stuff, cost $30.</li>
            <li>As a primer, it worked very well</li>
            <li>I really tried to like this product.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this primer...</li>
            <li>have benefited from it so much</li>
            <li>What I received was a knock-off of the real Benefit Porefessional product.</li>
            <li>my mac studio fix foundation stays on much longer.</li>
            <li>I applied foundation over it, my usual brand, and at first everything looked really nice.  </li>
            <li>Also - though I hardly ever wear powder or foundation - I did put some mineral powder on after, was still awesome - and half way through another hot day</li>
            <li>But it truly is amazing, definitely going to be a part of my getting ready routine for a very long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to my tried and true Lorac primer.  </li>
            <li>Even though it won&#x27;t completely hide all my pores, it minimizes my pores really well!</li>
            <li>me, it&#x27;s worth the price too, especially when you find yourself wasting money on other products that claim to do the same before you finally wise up and buy \\&quot;Benefit Cosmetics</li>
            <li>A little darker than expected but still great.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smoother and makes the pores less noticeable and allows my makeup to apply better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the shine, but it does seem to take less of this... Still love it, but wondering if they changed the product.</li>
            <li>their main flaw was that they&#x27;d sink into my pores and clog them or give my skin an oily appearance.  </li>
            <li>I compared this w/ my older tube &amp; this product</li>
            <li>Later I had friends comment on how clear and smooth my skin is.  </li>
            <li>Great coverage with such a small amount!</li>
            <li>I highly suggest if they send you a sample or you try something</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone who cares about his or her skin.</li>
            <li>I did not have high hopes for this product</li>
            <li>I would highly recommed it to anyone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, to say the least.</li>
            <li>It really does minimize your pores and gives a soft silky feeling to your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different products and spent so much money on cleansers, ointments you name it</li>
            <li>OZ and $31 for normal size 0.75 U.S. FL OZ</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Porefessional for a few weeks now and love it for the 1st couple of hours.</li>
            <li>Brand new in box unopened or tampered with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used quite a few foundation primers but this one is by far the most versatile.  </li>
            <li>THE BOTTLE WAS OPEN AND THE PRODUCT WAS NOT THE SAME AS THE REAL ONE, SUPER GREASY AND STICKY.</li>
            <li>I will most likely buy this product again and maybe try some of Benefit&#x27;s other cosmetics.</li>
            <li>My pores kept exactly the same.</li>
            <li>My pores are normally pretty visible even from about ten feet away</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>So, people with sensitive skin or prone to breakouts beware!</li>
            <li>It is greasy and pink in color unlike the true Porefection from Benefit cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Finally, the stuff was greasy to the point that I had to use Dawn dishwashing soap to remove it from my hands (the same stuff they used to clean up wildlife at the site of the oil spill).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty expensive splurge to be honest.</li>
            <li>I tried mine also to see if it was just her tube using the older and the new on each side of the face and felt A total difference and was highly dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I have really large pores, especially on my left cheek.  </li>
            <li>the sheer silkyness of the Product is now gone and rough rather than silky baby smooth to put onto the skin.</li>
            <li>My pores are visible when I look close up in the mirror, but this doesn&#x27;t make them completely invisible.</li>
            <li>Again, the only reason I gave it three stars is because I didn&#x27;t really pay for it, so I&#x27;m not that upset about</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this item directly from Benefit Cosmetics before</li>
            <li>Appears well when on but not for the perfume sensitive as myself.  </li>
            <li>I recently went on a hiking trip and really put it to the test..</li>
            <li>Guess I will spend the $ next time for the real thing.</li>
            <li>I received this product, the tube was completely busted opened.</li>
            <li>And WOW does it work--</li>
            <li>One tip: invest in a gentle scrub cleanser and toner for a once a week deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>I like to save up buck as much as the next gal, but......  </li>
            <li>Girlfriend loves this stuff leaves her skin feeling soft and does reduce the appearance of her pores.</li>
            <li>I have since returned it and returned to my local Sephora to buy the REAL</li>
            <li>I have bought this product directly from the store</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy it directly from ULTA or Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>About a year or so ago, 11 year old daughter and I were cuddled up on the couch</li>
            <li>This product is so good, i was a bit nervous since its so expensive but it works girls..</li>
            <li>I have fair skin, and it looked like a fake tan on me.</li>
            <li>I have a very, very oily t-zone but have some dry patches from overuse of spot treatments.</li>
            <li>But for a lovely illusion, a little of this cream goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>BUT like an hour later - I am super shiny and my pores are back to regular.</li>
            <li>I wish it provided more long lasting matte effect because large pores usually come from acne which comes from oily skin</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;After he innocent little comment, I started obsessing about the size of my pores, and swore every time I looked in the mirror, the pores seemed not only to multiply but to grow larger!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m disappointed that Amazon (my favorite company in the world) doesn&#x27;t vet its sellers better especially after so many negative reviews.</li>
            <li>It was, as most other products promising the same benefits, a waste of money.</li>
            <li>So Porefessional is going back to Ulta where I&#x27;ll exchange it for a new tube of Lorac.  </li>
            <li>My red nose with huge pores turns my skin color too, within a few seconds.</li>
            <li>It created a nice smooth base for applying my mineral foundation and when using it my foundation stayed in tact longer.</li>
            <li>I wear it with no other makeup.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on this when a little foundation could do a much better job at filling/covering pores and for the same amount of time prettty much.</li>
            <li>My fine line and dark circles literally disappear!!!</li>
            <li>Beyond a shadow of a doubt, double checked with manufacture of authentic brand, this turned out to be a FAKE, CHEAP, IMITATION.  </li>
            <li>I have bought several Benefit POREfessional tubes directly from Benefit Cosmetics.</li>
            <li>you can see how your pores disappear instantly and your skin feels soft all day...</li>
            <li>Another reason I am in love with this product is: if you have a blemish (especially on the forehead and cheeks) you can dab extra primer on that area, delicately cover with concealer using a concealer brush, and finish using your powder foundation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m acne-prone and obviously I was sensitive to one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>and when I finally got it, I didn&#x27;t get nearly the results I wanted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my daughter&#x27;s favorite primer, so much so that she had a small one that she cut the bottom off of to get &amp;#34;all&amp;#34; of the product out of, so this year she got a small one and this one.</li>
            <li>I have no idea how this became so popular or so EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li>So, I was kind of skeptical of this product when I bought it because hey, what product can *</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as if someone filled the bottle with a thick and pasty foundation.</li>
            <li>Like a lot of other reviewers, I got a knock-off that was nothing like the REAL Benefit product and had to be thrown out.  </li>
            <li>I have other skin issues that I really need my makeup to address and pore</li>
            <li>Secondly, it&#x27;s about as viscous as any ointment, so the pigment doesn&#x27;t really blend or dissipate therefore, not really translucent as claimed.  </li>
            <li>I have used Clinique in the past with less satisfying results.</li>
            <li>Sort of the shade of old lady correction stockings thus, not a &#x27;natural&#x27; color.</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical, but the reveiws were too good, so</li>
            <li>Less is more with this product, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>(half of it was climbing up the mountain) in 93 degree weather-a real butt burner, came back took a nap,</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve never had good skin.</li>
            <li> I loved the product when I bought it at Sephora.</li>
            <li> I guess this would be a good purchase if you had neither of these stores in your area.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s good compared to some of the things that you can put on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product works good for temporary pore reduction.</li>
            <li> and she knows good beauty products.</li>
            <li> They are really good at posting them.  </li>
            <li> But I guess you get what you paid for, and while I thought I was getting was a good deal</li>
            <li> Lorac is a superior product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome and makes my face look totally smooth.  </li>
            <li> This creamy velvety smooth formula is perfect for my dry/oily combo skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smooth and flawless and my makeup lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> It feels good when you put it on, but</li>
            <li> If your skin is in good shape, you can wear it alone too.</li>
            <li> I put it on and loved the way it felt.  </li>
            <li> I have good skin</li>
            <li> and I loved it a lot ..</li>
            <li> It has a great, smooth, non-oily texture giving my skin a matte finish, filling in the pores and giving my skin a great youthful, creamy finish.  </li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love benefit porefessional!!!</li>
            <li> With the Lorac primer, my makeup looks flawless and stays fresh until I take it off.  </li>

            <li> works at first, works great!</li>

            <li> Makes my makeup look so much better!</li>
            <li> Never have I received more compliments!</li>
            <li> This product does everything it says and much more!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> The best for people that has large pores... use it and you will see the difference</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Woooooooooow this product is so so amazing</li>
            <li> AMAZING</li>
            <li> Did my makeup and my skin looked amazing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame, because it does an amazing job.  </li>
            <li> It feels like silk when you put it on your skin and keeps the skin feeling nice</li>
            <li> I will never spend my own money on this, so</li>
            <li> I gave my friend a sample of mine and she liked it as well</li>
            <li> So I use POREfessional over the top and it gives me a flawless, matte look that is fresh and not cakey.  </li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s formula and ingredients could allegedly be hazardous, I have also come to find out.  </li>
            <li> I used this product hoping that each time I would see some kind of difference.</li>
            <li> Really helps for a flawless looking skin.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with this product at all.  </li>
            <li> Very soft/smooth and perfect for anytime/</li>
            <li> any kind makeup.</li>
            <li> It feels clean on my skin...not greasy and looks great.  </li>
            <li> I figured it was too good to be true!</li>
            <li> (This is basically spackle for your pores---but looks awesome and has caused me no skin reaction, even though my skin is very sensitive.)</li>
            <li> Puerto Rican and have naturally oily skin and enlarged pores, I&#x27;m still amazed to this day at how wonderfully this product assists with BOTH of those issues.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of blackheads in my nose/cheek/chin area and this product smooths out those pores nicely, since blackheads are more just pores and not inflammation.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised and simultaneously horrified, given all the excellent reviews of this product on Amazon and YouTube.  </li>
            <li> I like how much sort makes your skin feel and makes it easy to blend makeup but not that impressed</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS STUFF!  </li>
            <li> I use this more and more, and it&#x27;s becoming my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; product for making my skin look good.  </li>
            <li> Nonetheless, it also has a very strong fragrance, which I found overwhelming.</li>
            <li> okay but not as good as the true stuff</li>
            <li> My favorite makeup primer, never go a day without it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me tell you: this product is a magic potion, it made my pores literrally disappear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with my skin now.</li>
            <li> I love the porefessional.</li>
            <li> I have actually quit wearing any foundation since I bought this, it&#x27;s AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> I want to love this, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product after reading many favorable reviews, but it was no use for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased it at Sephora and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> They put something else in the POREfessional bottle that is thicker, darker in hue, and feels more like an expired foundation on the skin.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> It can be used under or on top of makeup.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you pat your face, not rub.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought POREprofessional because I read so many glowing reviews.</li>
            <li> It works on the pores on my chin but not on the top and sides of my nose.</li>
            <li> so I could buy it more often</li>
            <li> I am going to purchase more...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to just spend the money and go buy it from Benefit or a cosmetics store</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll stick with clarins for better result but they are pricey though</li>
            <li> The Lorac mattifying primer works way better than this.  </li>
            <li> This just teaches me the lesson of being satisfied with what I have.  </li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this.</li>
            <li> Have used for a year and love alone or under foundation.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend purchasing anyting like this from seller or anyone else online except a reputable makeup company.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> i really love it</li>
            <li> This product has helped me look and feel better.  </li>
            <li> I lOve Benefit&#x27;s POREfessional primer for my forehead,nose and cheeks which do have some pores,more noticeable on forehead.  </li>
            <li> and I love it for covering the pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> Why would you pay MORE for a product than Benefit themselves and their authorized sellers charges?</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> I love the texture -</li>
            <li> I try to re-apply over the top of my make up which is a BB cream and tht</li>
            <li> The consistency is nice and it goes on really smoothly.</li>
            <li> It mostly leaves my nose flake-y when I put it on.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this from Sephora after hearing such awesome things.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and it does an okay job.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the packaging and arrival timing.</li>
            <li> Its not awful,</li>
            <li> finish much better.</li>
            <li> On days that I don&#x27;t use the smashbox product, I use aveeno tinted moisturizer and that works better than this product as well.</li>
            <li> it goes on nicely, does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do, and makes my makeup go on so much smoother than most!</li>
            <li> I think this is easily the most overrated product of the year.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and makes me feel more confident about my imperfections.</li>
            <li> If the product you receive is anything short of light, silky and wonderful - you probably received a knock off.</li>
            <li> If you want something light, non pigmented, and that works MUCH better stick with Clinique&#x27;s Oil Control Hydrator.</li>
            <li> I also love that I can buy it on Amazon w/ FREE shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this product, how every ontop of some of my mosturizier it tends to clump up, and also does not keep me af matte as I was hoping, but I like to use this with my nars oil free primer</li>
            <li> I purchased this primer from Ulta but loved it so much I wanted to write a review.  </li>
            <li> I dabbed a little more on - blended in perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I have bought Benefit products for years, I do not believe this is a true product!</li>
            <li> Tried other products but this one is the best.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really easy to spread out and blend in.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for making my skin look soft and smooth -</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really easy to apply foundation over it.</li>
            <li> I love Benefit Cosmetics mainly because they deliver a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> :) I explained to her that Mommy just wasn&#x27;t one of those lucky people like her whose pores weren&#x27;t visible..</li>
            <li> Nothing huge, just like what you&#x27;d see from an errant speck of mascara or something.  </li>
            <li> I have huge sized pores on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> being that I have huge pores.</li>
            <li> I have huge pores.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product and I will say that it is Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light beige.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will be buying this product anymore do to the changes made by the company unless it was turnes silky smooth again....</li>
            <li> It makes my t-zone smooth</li>
            <li> I have also used this alone as a sheer foundation and it works great.  </li>
            <li> This primer wears perfect under any makeup, you don&#x27;t have to use benefits&#x27; foundation, an aspect I love about the entire product line (so far).  </li>
            <li> I really liked it so much.</li>
            <li> It helped me keeping the foundation smooth and poreless</li>
            <li> However, as a facial primer, I thought this product was great.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and found the POREfessional to go on light and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous Benefit product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s about it though as far as the good things go.</li>
            <li> This product really works, I bought 2!!!</li>
            <li> This was not the real thing!!!</li>
            <li> I am new to foundation primers and am glad I found this one so soon in my search!  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing it smells good and makes my pores look less visible and works as a primer.  </li>
            <li> First I want to say that I love this product.</li>
            <li> Hey there,&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> The duration of the product is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is original product</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m so excited I get to have a makeup face that will stay on this summer, and not melt away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it on clean skin before applying mascara.</li>
            <li> actually* make your face look flawless with it being applied by a professional?    </li>
            <li> Clearly this REALLY clogged my pores and my skin wasn&#x27;t happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if your pores are HUGE, this product would be worth it.</li>
            <li> However, you can purchase it on Ebay for $18 (including shipping) for a full sized bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really soft on your skin, so it feels nice and almost powdery.</li>
            <li> This product was number one in my book now the formulation has been changed and not for the better being how much we pay for it.</li>
            <li> I used it daily and loved the smell and</li>
            <li> Seller offered a full refund, however, I did not want seller to resell this to some unsuspecting person.  </li>
            <li> it was not the true product.  </li>
            <li> this is not the true product</li>
            <li> Maybe you&#x27;d get a good review if it was actually the product.</li>
            <li> It actually did a good job camouflaging my pores and extending the wear of my makeup.</li>
            <li> and she looks at me and says, \\&quot;Mama, what are all those holes on your nose?\\&quot; (Kids, aren&#x27;t they just so sweet?)</li>
            <li> Plus, there is no bad, or chemical, smell</li>
            <li> There just wasn&#x27;t anything super special about it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but it runs out super fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a benefit LOVER so while this product is not for my skin, I am so happy with the company and other products.</li>
            <li> I will do some more research to find a better product- one that would be 4 stars or above.</li>
            <li> Really does smooth pores and make skin feel and look smooth.</li>
            <li> stuff works great, by the way, but only if you get the real deal.</li>
            <li> it helps tremendously with pore coverage.</li>
            <li> I have never seen pimples pop up so quickly with anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> But luckily, it works well for me and has become my new favorite Benefit product.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and easy to apply and feels comfortable, a little like a very fine powder.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT THE REAL THING!!  </li>
            <li> After the first use it became watery!</li>
            <li> The actual product purchased at Sephora &#x3D; 5 stars for sure!</li>
            <li> I should have read all the reviews first!</li>
            <li> Your skin feels so smooth and really reduce the pore.</li>
            <li> it is silky, velvety smooth and goes on to make your skin look very &amp;#34;blurred&amp;#34; and even.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s important to say, because had I spent my own money on it</li>
            <li> I later ask her how she liked the product</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth every dollar, and throw anything else you have away!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Smashbox is far better</li>
            <li> I was thinking I was going to put it on laugh and walk away.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it a family member thought I was pregnant because of the glow my skin had to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really fair skinned, and I can&#x27;t see it on my face like some of the other reviews</li>
            <li> I think it makes the powder I wear look a little better, and more polished.</li>
            <li> went in search of pore eraser, or whatever it would be that I could use to help this huge issue that took me almost 40 years to even know I had developed!</li>
            <li> It really helps diminish pores and it has a nice scent not overwhelming or potent.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much</li>
            <li> Even with the tint it has, it didn&#x27;t help my skin very much.</li>
            <li> and although I probably had to use a little more of this than most people, it really does work.</li>
            <li> Additionally, even though I did not think there was a major change in the look of my skin, many, many people commented on how my skin looked so healthy lately.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned the first time I used the product, as it does have a tint to it</li>
            <li> Where to start: first is the color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s water based, and actually does fill better without the hastles.</li>
            <li> I bought this Product again, 2 tubes for myself and my Mother again, and she used it and the first thing She noticed was</li>
            <li> Save yourself the time and money buy from sephora or other reputable places!</li>
            <li> since this is the first pore product I&#x27;ve bought, I didn&#x27;t have anything to compare it with.</li>
            <li> I love the the intricacy of its ingredients that complement the ultimate quality when I used it.</li>
            <li> Absorb into pores immediately then make the pores more obvious.</li>
            <li> In fact, my makeup looked exactly as it does when I don&#x27;t use a primer.  </li>
            <li> Not my first time trying it.</li>
            <li> He loves the way it works, and I love how it also makes me look 5 years younger just from reducing (not really reducing but somehow amazingly hiding them)</li>
            <li> I thought it was worth the money; however, when I tried the product, it is very short-lasting.  </li>
            <li> And at first I did.</li>
            <li> My face feels do soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> ;-) I started at the drugstores and bought one pore minimizer after another, but to no avail..&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was already a fan of \\&quot;Benefit They&#x27;Re Real!</li>
            <li> When I put this product on, at first I thought it was a miracle.</li>
            <li> Its not the real thing!</li>
            <li> Porefessional is a great product as a spot corrector, primer, or mixed with a little foundation, all you need for full cover-up.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s some other kind of makeup in a porefessional box</li>
            <li> Needless to say,I was happy because I got a free tube of porefessional.</li>
            <li> and you can dab it on top of your foundation later on in the day if you have really oily skin.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t glide on very well and the overall finish was just okay.</li>
            <li> This is the first pore-minimizer I&#x27;ve ever used so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.  </li>
            <li> However, this product works exactly as described and I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it works well for people who are not sensitive to it.</li>
            <li> It DOES have a cool texture and feels soft and creamy on my face, but wasn&#x27;t the product I was looking for at all.  </li>
            <li> First of all, the tube arrived unsealed and appeared as though it was just filled with regular foundation.</li>
            <li> I purchased mine at Sephora and my recommendation to anyone who has a large area they are trying to correct is to use this product under your make up.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I don&#x27;t have a problem with large pores, so</li>
            <li> I have mefium to large size pores and it fills them all in.  </li>
            <li> this a positive review my wife has cancer&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Guilt trip much?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally not one to buy make up that costs more than $10</li>
            <li> I have had the &#x27;issue&#x27; of being the not-so-proud owner of large pores my whole life.</li>
            <li> I use a tinted moisturizer with SPF instead of foundation and although it gives my skin a nice, even look, it does leave it looking a little greasy.  </li>
            <li> it even covered up some of my trouble spots (amazing).  </li>
            <li> I will go back to buying from Sephora which sells the totally fantastic REAL product.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt last all day, but this product really helps my skin look so smooth.</li>
            <li> &quot; Obviously, I shouldn&#x27;t have been taken in by the cheap pricing.</li>
            <li> Well I tried it, and REALLY didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to dab it, powder myself again - really</li>
            <li> , just re-do my whole</li>
            <li> so I can absolutely tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Order the real thing from a reliable source.</li>
            <li> Why do some of these companies put so much perfume in their product?  </li>
            <li> I tried everything, but this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> It really does help reduce pore size.</li>
            <li> This product really reduces my pores - and it also keeps my oily face matte so much longer than just a moisturiser or a primer.</li>
            <li> I got this along with the powder foundation from benefit, I never knew my pores really were an issue</li>
            <li> It seems a bit pricey, but you really don&#x27;t need a whole lot to get the job done.</li>
            <li> It seems like a moisturizer with lots of talc and it dries fast.</li>
            <li> Now that is high quality makeup!  </li>
            <li> My foundation was very streaked.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy from here, this isn&#x27;t the real Benefit Porefessional product by Benefit Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> so you know you&#x27;re getting the real thing.</li>
            <li> For me, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in the size of my pores after using it.</li>
            <li> no pores were visible on my face at all and as an added benefit, it also controls oil in my T zone really well.  </li>
            <li> This product was a lot cheaper from this vendor, but it is NOT the real thing..</li>
            <li> I bought it from the bitch box shop because I didn&#x27;t get a sample and really wanted to try it,</li>
            <li> It makes your sling feel like velvet and it really does minimize the appearance of pores.</li>
            <li> Like any supplier selling knock-offs, the packaging looks identical to the real stuff.</li>
            <li> They confirmed that it had not and what I received was likely a counterfeit product.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> Porefessional, the real stuff, cost $30.</li>
            <li> As a primer, it worked very well</li>
            <li> I really tried to like this product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this primer...</li>
            <li> have benefited from it so much</li>
            <li> What I received was a knock-off of the real Benefit Porefessional product.</li>
            <li> my mac studio fix foundation stays on much longer.</li>
            <li> I applied foundation over it, my usual brand, and at first everything looked really nice.  </li>
            <li> Also - though I hardly ever wear powder or foundation - I did put some mineral powder on after, was still awesome - and half way through another hot day</li>
            <li> But it truly is amazing, definitely going to be a part of my getting ready routine for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to my tried and true Lorac primer.  </li>
            <li> Even though it won&#x27;t completely hide all my pores, it minimizes my pores really well!</li>
            <li> me, it&#x27;s worth the price too, especially when you find yourself wasting money on other products that claim to do the same before you finally wise up and buy \\&quot;Benefit Cosmetics</li>
            <li> A little darker than expected but still great.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smoother and makes the pores less noticeable and allows my makeup to apply better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the shine, but it does seem to take less of this... Still love it, but wondering if they changed the product.</li>
            <li> their main flaw was that they&#x27;d sink into my pores and clog them or give my skin an oily appearance.  </li>
            <li> I compared this w/ my older tube &amp; this product</li>
            <li> Later I had friends comment on how clear and smooth my skin is.  </li>
            <li> Great coverage with such a small amount!</li>
            <li> I highly suggest if they send you a sample or you try something</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to anyone who cares about his or her skin.</li>
            <li> I did not have high hopes for this product</li>
            <li> I would highly recommed it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, to say the least.</li>
            <li> It really does minimize your pores and gives a soft silky feeling to your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different products and spent so much money on cleansers, ointments you name it</li>
            <li> OZ and $31 for normal size 0.75 U.S. FL OZ</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Porefessional for a few weeks now and love it for the 1st couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Brand new in box unopened or tampered with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few foundation primers but this one is by far the most versatile.  </li>
            <li> THE BOTTLE WAS OPEN AND THE PRODUCT WAS NOT THE SAME AS THE REAL ONE, SUPER GREASY AND STICKY.</li>
            <li> I will most likely buy this product again and maybe try some of Benefit&#x27;s other cosmetics.</li>
            <li> My pores kept exactly the same.</li>
            <li> My pores are normally pretty visible even from about ten feet away</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> So, people with sensitive skin or prone to breakouts beware!</li>
            <li> It is greasy and pink in color unlike the true Porefection from Benefit cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Finally, the stuff was greasy to the point that I had to use Dawn dishwashing soap to remove it from my hands (the same stuff they used to clean up wildlife at the site of the oil spill).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty expensive splurge to be honest.</li>
            <li> I tried mine also to see if it was just her tube using the older and the new on each side of the face and felt A total difference and was highly dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I have really large pores, especially on my left cheek.  </li>
            <li> the sheer silkyness of the Product is now gone and rough rather than silky baby smooth to put onto the skin.</li>
            <li> My pores are visible when I look close up in the mirror, but this doesn&#x27;t make them completely invisible.</li>
            <li> Again, the only reason I gave it three stars is because I didn&#x27;t really pay for it, so I&#x27;m not that upset about</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this item directly from Benefit Cosmetics before</li>
            <li> Appears well when on but not for the perfume sensitive as myself.  </li>
            <li> I recently went on a hiking trip and really put it to the test..</li>
            <li> Guess I will spend the $ next time for the real thing.</li>
            <li> I received this product, the tube was completely busted opened.</li>
            <li> And WOW does it work--</li>
            <li> One tip: invest in a gentle scrub cleanser and toner for a once a week deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> I like to save up buck as much as the next gal, but......  </li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves this stuff leaves her skin feeling soft and does reduce the appearance of her pores.</li>
            <li> I have since returned it and returned to my local Sephora to buy the REAL</li>
            <li> I have bought this product directly from the store</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy it directly from ULTA or Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> About a year or so ago, 11 year old daughter and I were cuddled up on the couch</li>
            <li> This product is so good, i was a bit nervous since its so expensive but it works girls..</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, and it looked like a fake tan on me.</li>
            <li> I have a very, very oily t-zone but have some dry patches from overuse of spot treatments.</li>
            <li> But for a lovely illusion, a little of this cream goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> BUT like an hour later - I am super shiny and my pores are back to regular.</li>
            <li> I wish it provided more long lasting matte effect because large pores usually come from acne which comes from oily skin</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;After he innocent little comment, I started obsessing about the size of my pores, and swore every time I looked in the mirror, the pores seemed not only to multiply but to grow larger!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that Amazon (my favorite company in the world) doesn&#x27;t vet its sellers better especially after so many negative reviews.</li>
            <li> It was, as most other products promising the same benefits, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> So Porefessional is going back to Ulta where I&#x27;ll exchange it for a new tube of Lorac.  </li>
            <li> My red nose with huge pores turns my skin color too, within a few seconds.</li>
            <li> It created a nice smooth base for applying my mineral foundation and when using it my foundation stayed in tact longer.</li>
            <li> I wear it with no other makeup.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this when a little foundation could do a much better job at filling/covering pores and for the same amount of time prettty much.</li>
            <li> My fine line and dark circles literally disappear!!!</li>
            <li> Beyond a shadow of a doubt, double checked with manufacture of authentic brand, this turned out to be a FAKE, CHEAP, IMITATION.  </li>
            <li> I have bought several Benefit POREfessional tubes directly from Benefit Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> you can see how your pores disappear instantly and your skin feels soft all day...</li>
            <li> Another reason I am in love with this product is: if you have a blemish (especially on the forehead and cheeks) you can dab extra primer on that area, delicately cover with concealer using a concealer brush, and finish using your powder foundation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m acne-prone and obviously I was sensitive to one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> and when I finally got it, I didn&#x27;t get nearly the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my daughter&#x27;s favorite primer, so much so that she had a small one that she cut the bottom off of to get &amp;#34;all&amp;#34; of the product out of, so this year she got a small one and this one.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this became so popular or so EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> So, I was kind of skeptical of this product when I bought it because hey, what product can *</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if someone filled the bottle with a thick and pasty foundation.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of other reviewers, I got a knock-off that was nothing like the REAL Benefit product and had to be thrown out.  </li>
            <li> I have other skin issues that I really need my makeup to address and pore</li>
            <li> Secondly, it&#x27;s about as viscous as any ointment, so the pigment doesn&#x27;t really blend or dissipate therefore, not really translucent as claimed.  </li>
            <li> I have used Clinique in the past with less satisfying results.</li>
            <li> Sort of the shade of old lady correction stockings thus, not a &#x27;natural&#x27; color.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but the reveiws were too good, so</li>
            <li> Less is more with this product, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> (half of it was climbing up the mountain) in 93 degree weather-a real butt burner, came back took a nap,</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t 100% fill in my pores, but it definitely makes them a little less noticeable in a very natural looking way, which is what I like so much about this product.</li>
            <li> Very thin and definitely work like magic</li>
            <li> Its nice but so expensive!</li>
            <li> But the tube is exactly the same, word for word, and this product seems to be lighter in color, thinner and leaves a shine rather than being dull and blending.</li>
            <li> The texture as you spread it on your face is light and almost powder like and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily and all you need is a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I am an older lady and have trouble with pores.  </li>
            <li> Thick, goopy, stinky product that was no where near the product I had been using!!!!</li>
            <li> No more dabbing concealer on a breakout and still having to settle for \\&quot;it&#x27;s still shows in the light, but at least it&#x27;s not red anymore\\&quot; Not to mention it lasts ALL DAY.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive given the size of the full sized tube being as small as it is.</li>
            <li> However, by the end of the night (5 hours later) I had a whitehead on my cheek and another volcanic zit starting to pop up on my other cheek.  </li>
            <li> It looked like a extra teeny needle deposited beige makeup in every single pore on my face!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that this stuff really does help with that at least.  </li>
            <li> At least temporarily, which I really appreciate.</li>
            <li> Fake product, they took the packaging and filled it with something else</li>
            <li> I tried to save some money by buying my porrfessional for a long time.  </li>
            <li> and I would know I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x60;ve use Porefessional for a long time.  </li>
            <li> In short, no thanks, and cannot recommend.</li>
            <li> Read previous reviews of same product, different sellers.</li>
            <li> I love it, definitely powerless!</li>
            <li> It feels the same as the other ones I used before.</li>
            <li> the whitehead was gone and the other was starting to diminish.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 2 stars because seller gave a prompt &amp; full refund (incl shipping) after I complained the product was not authentic Porefessional by Benefit.</li>
            <li> The black is not visible in the cream itself, only as you&#x27;re rubbing it on.  </li>
            <li> did not close my pores, was really dark in colour &amp; dried before completely applied.  </li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS SUPER FAKE.</li>
            <li> once I use this up, which will probably take a long time considering that fact that a little goes a long way, I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> It withstood heavy sweating, high heat, harsh dusty winds, rub-off proof from napping, and high humidity from the shower</li>
            <li> On top of the bad rating I am submitting, I also received a coupon for (If you like this product I will send you a 100$ gift certificate)</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a Christmas gift and was a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> It &amp;#34;fills in&amp;#34; my pores as well as could be expected, I guess.  </li>
            <li> Worse, Outlet de Beaute has had several complaints about this from different people regarding different Benefit products and they&#x27;re still selling the stuff.</li>
            <li> Poorly packed, got almost the items leaking and couple with the top broken, seems like they just threw my stuff in the box without any protections.</li>
            <li> The real POREfessional is a tan color, the stuff I received was pink, shiny, thin, and smelled perfumey.</li>
            <li> The product is tinted but only very slightly and does not cover my skin issues.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried primers and a couple of other creams which claim to minimize the look of pores...</li>
            <li> This worries me about ordering other things</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m not sure that it makes SUCH a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I guess the grass is always greener on the other side.  </li>
            <li> My pores have been absolutely GIANT on the inner parts of my cheeks, the base of my forehead and on my entire nose ever since junior high, so when I heard about The POREfessional balm I just had to try it out.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch, but I was not at all interested in exploring its use further.  </li>
            <li> Definitely NOT worth the $36 I paid for it.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t reduce oil.</li>
            <li> The previous tube I purchased was at least 2 to 3 times larger...</li>
            <li> Then after a few minutes (before I put any other makeup on), it separated on my skin and sat in oily dots.  </li>
            <li> One odd thing, though.  </li>
            <li> Every now and then as I&#x27;m smoothing the cream across my skin, there will be a black streak in it.  </li>
            <li> The price here was much less than sephora, so I gave it a go.</li>
            <li> This is not real as I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve read in the comments.</li>
            <li> just makes a mess.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve got full-on foundation on, but I get a little boost of coverage/even tone.  </li>
            <li> Just a little dab on my (yes, I will admit it)</li>
            <li> If I put too little then you can&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> It needs to be a little less pricey!</li>
            <li> I have tried foundations with heavy coverage and it seemed as if my pores were just getting magnified.</li>
            <li> Do not order from this seller just to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> I must have gotten a few...</li>
            <li> In the trash - what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Does what is says (fills pores) but far too expensive.</li>
            <li> (Well, if she had a few wrinkles</li>
            <li> I have oily, uneven skin, and this works wonders...</li>
            <li> But a little bit small for the price...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dark and thick and feels like im smoothering leather on my face.</li>
            <li> The only thing that&#x27;s a little unfortunate is the price.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!  </li>
            <li> It acts like a primer but would be too expensive to use it as such.</li>
            <li> The day after I had the disaster with Porefessional, I used the Lorac primer and my usual foundation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous primers both expensive and from a drugstore.  </li>
            <li> Sorry for such just an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; rating.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a few months and never makes me break out!</li>
            <li> using it as a base/primer is a bit hard now because it doesn&#x27;t glide onto the skin like before.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase mine from Amazon, as I read the negative reviews about the sellers counterfeiting the product and selling it as the Benefit product.  </li>
            <li> but honestly, I am not looking for a product I have to reapply during the day.</li>
            <li> At least then I could choose the color of this paint instead of the pastey pastel brown colour it leaves my face.</li>
            <li> and I was REALLY skeptical about the size of the tube; with other products which claim to minimize the look of pores I have to use a lot of the product to see any effect.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it also clogged my pores and broke me out pretty badly each time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing thing is that you have to use a very small amount, so the tube lasts forever.</li>
            <li> After applying a very small amount to start I then applied my foundation.</li>
            <li> Absolutely ridiculous that Amazon would allow this to happen...</li>
            <li> However, the very next morning, my skin broke out relatively badly and I feel it was probably from this product.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad, just different.</li>
            <li> , I would probably be a little unhappy with what I got.</li>
            <li> I have a rather rosy complexion with some broken capillaries as well.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the product because of the negative review.</li>
            <li> It looked splotchy, which is worse than enlarged pores.</li>
            <li> bought two pieces of, is all false</li>
            <li> (I have really bad dark circles-hence the oodles of concealer)</li>
            <li> The tube wasn&#x27;t even sealed which lead me to believe it was tampered with and refilled with this fake pink crap.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review of them stating that I knew the product was fake, and,</li>
            <li> I am so sad . . .</li>
            <li> Product was fake.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this stuff was going to do what it claimed it could do, since I (thought)</li>
            <li> This product is way too expensive.   </li>
            <li> Not only did it not do its pore minimizing namesake, it looked awful.  </li>
            <li> I think I was just misguided by someone desperate to sell me a product.  </li>
            <li> Very sad...</li>
            <li> It doesnt fill the poors and I HATE the fact that its a weird orangey color.</li>
            <li> Too bad I fell for the reduced price on Amazon and took a chance.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I will tell you that my sister tried it too and it gave her a boil on her nose  :(  </li>
            <li> You can see them and its really annoying.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worst of all it didn&#x27;t reduce the appearance of my pores.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had good skin. My pores have been absolutely GIANT on the inner parts of my cheeks, the base of my forehead and on my entire nose ever since junior high, so when I heard about The POREfessional balm I just had to try it out. It applies on my face so silky and it&#x27;s really easy to spread out and blend in. It doesn&#x27;t 100% fill in my pores, but it definitely makes them a little less noticeable in a very natural looking way, which is what I like so much about this product. It doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m caking on liquid foundation or something. I will definitely be keeping this on stock at all times in the future.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for making my skin look soft and smooth - but if I put in on the morning, I need to reapply in the afternoon. Its nice but so expensive!</li>
            <li> I have really large pores, especially on my left cheek.  I&#x27;ve tried primers and a couple of other creams which claim to minimize the look of pores...their main flaw was that they&#x27;d sink into my pores and clog them or give my skin an oily appearance.  I&#x27;m normally not one to buy make up that costs more than $10 and I&#x27;m always skeptical when I see so many rave reviews for a product.  I was a bit concerned the first time I used the product, as it does have a tint to it and I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t match my skin tone and I was REALLY skeptical about the size of the tube; with other products which claim to minimize the look of pores I have to use a lot of the product to see any effect.  But this product actually dose work!  The texture as you spread it on your face is light and almost powder like and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily and all you need is a small amount.  I did not purchase mine from Amazon, as I read the negative reviews about the sellers counterfeiting the product and selling it as the Benefit product.  I purchased mine at Sephora and my recommendation to anyone who has a large area they are trying to correct is to use this product under your make up.  I will most likely buy this product again and maybe try some of Benefit&#x27;s other cosmetics.</li>
            <li> This is the first pore-minimizer I&#x27;ve ever used so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.  It &amp;#34;fills in&amp;#34; my pores as well as could be expected, I guess.  One odd thing, though.  Every now and then as I&#x27;m smoothing the cream across my skin, there will be a black streak in it.  Nothing huge, just like what you&#x27;d see from an errant speck of mascara or something.  The black is not visible in the cream itself, only as you&#x27;re rubbing it on.  It&#x27;s happened frequently enough that I know it&#x27;s coming from this product and nothing else.  I&#x27;m using it on clean skin before applying mascara.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product , works perfect</li>
            <li> My favorite makeup primer, never go a day without it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Puerto Rican and have naturally oily skin and enlarged pores, I&#x27;m still amazed to this day at how wonderfully this product assists with BOTH of those issues. Customer for life.</li>
            <li> I have huge sized pores on my cheeks. No matter what I use they are just very obvious. I have tried foundations with heavy coverage and it seemed as if my pores were just getting magnified. So I gave up on the idea of wearing make up.    Until I read a review about Porefessional. I was very skeptical, but the reveiws were too good, so what the heck, I went on to try it.    Let me tell you: this product is a magic potion, it made my pores literrally disappear. I dap it on after my mosturizer and once again after my Maybelline Minerals Powder Foundation, and you can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;m wearing makeup.    I want to say though, that a couple of daps just doesn&#x27;t do it for me, I might have to apply 3 layers or something on those oily days to get the baby skin result.     I&#x27;m so in love with my skin now.</li>
            <li> I loved the product when I bought it at Sephora. It feels like silk when you put it on your skin and keeps the skin feeling nice all day- even though I have oily skin.  When I received this product from Ion Diet, it did not seem to be the same product. It went on feeling somewhat greasy. I went back to Sephora to see if what they sell felt the same as I had remembered it and it does. This makes me believe that the seller did not ship me the same thing as what is in the store.  This worries me about ordering other things online- even though they have the same name as what is in stores.  I gave 5 stars for the product that is sold in a store- not for what I received.</li>
            <li> I have bought several Benefit POREfessional tubes directly from Benefit Cosmetics. That stuff is awesome, not tinted, not greasy, not at all like the stuff that Outlet de Beaute is selling. Worse, Outlet de Beaute has had several complaints about this from different people regarding different Benefit products and they&#x27;re still selling the stuff. I wrote a review of them stating that I knew the product was fake, and, instead of owning that fact, they just said that the packaging was different because it was from \\&quot;Europe or Asia.\\&quot; Obviously, I shouldn&#x27;t have been taken in by the cheap pricing.</li>
            <li> I have oily/combination skin, and this product makes my skin so greasy. It works about 10 minutes then starts to crease.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my daughter&#x27;s favorite primer, so much so that she had a small one that she cut the bottom off of to get &amp;#34;all&amp;#34; of the product out of, so this year she got a small one and this one.</li>
            <li> I love the porefessional. But you can get it for $30 at any Ulta or Sephora. I guess this would be a good purchase if you had neither of these stores in your area. But that aside, porefessional is the best! It smooths out every imperfection on your face and is specifically awesome for oily skin,OHMYGOSH!!</li>
            <li> I purchased a sample of this after reading some of the reviews on Sephora.com, and OH MY GOD! I have had the &#x27;issue&#x27; of being the not-so-proud owner of large pores my whole life. lol.. And I&#x27;ve tried just about everything --BUT-- I put this on my face after cleaning and it just melts into your skin, that&#x27;s the only way I can describe what happens. In your hands, it feels like a balm. Once it touches your skin, it disappears and you walk away looking like you have a poreless face! I am in love with this product and I will say that it is Definitely worth the money. However, you can purchase it on Ebay for $18 (including shipping) for a full sized bottle. I have actually quit wearing any foundation since I bought this, it&#x27;s AWESOME!!! But DON&#x27;T buy any! Because I don&#x27;t know what the heck I&#x27;ll do if Benefit ever runs out of this!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to cover pores as well as some superficial acne scars. Well I tried it, and REALLY didn&#x27;t like it at all. Where to start: first is the color. It&#x27;s a light beige. Sort of the shade of old lady correction stockings thus, not a &#x27;natural&#x27; color. Secondly, it&#x27;s about as viscous as any ointment, so the pigment doesn&#x27;t really blend or dissipate therefore, not really translucent as claimed.  Finally, the stuff was greasy to the point that I had to use Dawn dishwashing soap to remove it from my hands (the same stuff they used to clean up wildlife at the site of the oil spill).  If you want something light, non pigmented, and that works MUCH better stick with Clinique&#x27;s Oil Control Hydrator. It&#x27;s water based, and actually does fill better without the hastles.</li>
            <li> I am so sad . . . I want to love this, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works at first, works great! BUT like an hour later - I am super shiny and my pores are back to regular. It says to take it w/ you . . . but honestly, I am not looking for a product I have to reapply during the day. I&#x27;d have to dab it, powder myself again - really, just re-do my whole face!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a benefit LOVER so while this product is not for my skin, I am so happy with the company and other products. I also love that I can buy it on Amazon w/ FREE shipping.</li>
            <li> I got this product with a gift card. That&#x27;s important to say, because had I spent my own money on it, I would probably be a little unhappy with what I got. So this review may be a bit bias based on the fact that, to me, this product was basically free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the product is smaller than what I was expecting for the amount of money it costs. It&#x27;s a pretty expensive splurge to be honest. Also, I&#x27;m not sure that it makes SUCH a noticeable difference. My pores are visible when I look close up in the mirror, but this doesn&#x27;t make them completely invisible. Maybe if your pores are HUGE, this product would be worth it. I was looking for something that would make them vanish for a while, and this doesn&#x27;t do it. It&#x27;s definitely not a miracle product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, that being said, it has a color to it, but nothing that you can see once you apply the creme. I&#x27;m really fair skinned, and I can&#x27;t see it on my face like some of the other reviews said. It&#x27;s also really soft on your skin, so it feels nice and almost powdery. I think of it as a makeup primer. I think it makes the powder I wear look a little better, and more polished. Plus, there is no bad, or chemical, smell so that&#x27;s good compared to some of the things that you can put on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s about it though as far as the good things go. I will never spend my own money on this, so once I use this up, which will probably take a long time considering that fact that a little goes a long way, I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again. If you&#x27;re looking for a miracle, this isn&#x27;t it. If you&#x27;re looking for something that is going to make a noticeable or drastic difference, this isn&#x27;t it. If I were you, I would save my money and get something else. Again, the only reason I gave it three stars is because I didn&#x27;t really pay for it, so I&#x27;m not that upset about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product after reading many favorable reviews, but it was no use for me. My pores kept exactly the same. It was, as most other products promising the same benefits, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this Product again, 2 tubes for myself and my Mother again, and she used it and the first thing She noticed was the sheer silkyness of the Product is now gone and rough rather than silky baby smooth to put onto the skin. it&#x27;s darker in colour and it does give coverage but using it as a base/primer is a bit hard now because it doesn&#x27;t glide onto the skin like before. I tried mine also to see if it was just her tube using the older and the new on each side of the face and felt A total difference and was highly dissapointed. This product was number one in my book now the formulation has been changed and not for the better being how much we pay for it. I don&#x27;t think I will be buying this product anymore do to the changes made by the company unless it was turnes silky smooth again....</li>
            <li> First I want to say that I love this product. I purchased it at Sephora and fell in love with it. I used it daily and loved the smell and how great it made my makeup look. I gave my friend a sample of mine and she liked it as well so she decided to order it. I later ask her how she liked the product and she said it made her greasy so she stopped using it. When my tube ran out she offered up hers. Needless to say,I was happy because I got a free tube of porefessional. When I went to apply the product she bought on here it was a disaster!!!!! Thick, goopy, stinky product that was no where near the product I had been using!!!! This product is amazing if its not a rip off imposter that is sold here!!! ...no wonder she gave it to me!!!!  Save yourself the time and money buy from sephora or other reputable places!</li>
            <li> I am new to foundation primers and am glad I found this one so soon in my search!  Love the way this product goes on under makeup and gives my skin a nice silky feeling without being greasy/oily!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from the seller, Beauty Brands 4 U. WARNING- THIS IS NOT THE REAL THING!!  I&#x27;ve purchased this item directly from Benefit Cosmetics before so I can absolutely tell the difference. First of all, the tube arrived unsealed and appeared as though it was just filled with regular foundation. The color and texture is completely different from the actual Benefit product. Very disappointed. Do not order from this seller just to save a few bucks. Order the real thing from a reliable source.</li>
            <li> This product works good for temporary pore reduction. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought POREfessional at a Benefit counter after a saleswoman promised me it would reduce redness and even out my complexion.  What a waste of money!  It did neither of those things.  It DOES have a cool texture and feels soft and creamy on my face, but wasn&#x27;t the product I was looking for at all.  That being said, I don&#x27;t have a problem with large pores, so I&#x27;m hoping that this stuff really does help with that at least.  I think I was just misguided by someone desperate to sell me a product.  If you&#x27;re looking for a product to even out your skin tone or reduce redness, this won&#x27;t help you.</li>
            <li> Product was fake. Just so everyone knows Benefit does not sell there products thru amazon so anything that&#x27;s not from Benefit themselves will be COUNTERFEIT.</li>
            <li> Hey there,&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to try this product. I ordered like HEAPS of them cos&#x27; I&#x27;d heard people RAVE about it.&lt;br /&gt;I got it and it&#x27;s dark and thick and feels like im smoothering leather on my face. I&#x27;d RATHER use paint. At least then I could choose the color of this paint instead of the pastey pastel brown colour it leaves my face. I must have gotten a few... Gosh I hope you check out your trader before you make the bid. My one must be the \\&quot;fake\\&quot; one I&#x27;ve been hearing about. Utterly dissappointing.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0034ZQDKO The Porefessional Pro Balm to Minimize the Appearance of Pores - 22ml/0.75oz]]</li>
            <li> This product really works, I bought 2!!! and I am so happy with my product. Your skin feels so smooth and really reduce the pore.</li>
            <li> I have been using POREfessional for about a year now, and I know what this product from Benefit looks and feels like on my skin - I love it! I thought it&#x27;d be cheaper to get it from Amazon BUT this product that I have been sold IS NOT POREfessional in any means. They put something else in the POREfessional bottle that is thicker, darker in hue, and feels more like an expired foundation on the skin. I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was on my sister&#x27;s wish list and she knows good beauty products. I am thinking about getting a tube for myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the Southwest now - the lack of humidity makes my skin feel like it&#x27;s cracking and the heat makes my pores scream open.  A horrid combination if you&#x27;re trying not to accelerate aging and don&#x27;t like having 80 grit sandpaper skin.  I impulse bought this, and as soon as I got into my car I started dabbing this on my chin, cheeks and forehead.  It has a great, smooth, non-oily texture giving my skin a matte finish, filling in the pores and giving my skin a great youthful, creamy finish.  I LOVE IT!  And it&#x27;s a nude-ish tinted cream, so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve got full-on foundation on, but I get a little boost of coverage/even tone.  So you know - this pore reduction is NOT permanent.  Wash your face and get your pores back.  But for a lovely illusion, a little of this cream goes a long way.  Also - though I hardly ever wear powder or foundation - I did put some mineral powder on after, was still awesome - and half way through another hot day I dabbed a little more on - blended in perfectly.  And finally - I can be prone to breakouts and this hasn&#x27;t caused a breakout or any itchy sensation.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Appears well when on but not for the perfume sensitive as myself.  Why do some of these companies put so much perfume in their product?  In the trash - what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this stuff was going to do what it claimed it could do, since I (thought) I tried everything, but this stuff really works. My pores disappeared and it was sooo lightweight. It can be used under or on top of makeup. Just make sure you pat your face, not rub.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing thing is that you have to use a very small amount, so the tube lasts forever. This stuff is worth every dollar, and throw anything else you have away!&lt;br /&gt;Love the stuff, and I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I tried this on a whim while on a Sephora run. It&#x27;s amazing! It really does minimize your pores and gives a soft silky feeling to your skin. It reminds me a lot of Philosophy&#x27;s The Present but I suppose the smell of The Present may turn people off.</li>
            <li> This product is so good, i was a bit nervous since its so expensive but it works girls.. (or boys) you can see how your pores disappear instantly and your skin feels soft all day... great purchase</li>
            <li> A make- up guru on YouTube mentioned this product and I was impressed. It really does help reduce pore size. I use it every day, with or without make-up</li>
            <li> This product really reduces my pores - and it also keeps my oily face matte so much longer than just a moisturiser or a primer. It makes my t-zone smooth so it&#x27;s really easy to apply foundation over it.</li>
            <li> Package size is very much smaller than it appears. Definitely NOT worth the $36 I paid for it. The previous tube I purchased was at least 2 to 3 times larger...I thought I was purchasing the same size.</li>
            <li> I got this along with the powder foundation from benefit, I never knew my pores really were an issue but then I tried this product and it REALLY smoothed things over and gave a nice base for the powder. I get a lot of blackheads in my nose/cheek/chin area and this product smooths out those pores nicely, since blackheads are more just pores and not inflammation. I wish it provided more long lasting matte effect because large pores usually come from acne which comes from oily skin but overall I like it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I bought POREprofessional because I read so many glowing reviews. It acts like a primer but would be too expensive to use it as such.It works on the pores on my chin but not on the top and sides of my nose. I&#x27;ve tried using 2 coats but it doesn&#x27;t make any difference. since this is the first pore product I&#x27;ve bought, I didn&#x27;t have anything to compare it with. I will do some more research to find a better product- one that would be 4 stars or above. I probably would not recommend POREfessional Translucent.</li>
            <li> I love it, definitely powerless!</li>
            <li> I wish it was cheaper so I could buy it more often</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Just a little dab on my (yes, I will admit it) GIANT pores and they are history - visually anyway. They are still there, this product does not help to reduce the size or anything, but only I know it. It seems a bit pricey, but you really don&#x27;t need a whole lot to get the job done. And somehow it is tinted just right to blend perfectly, it doesn&#x27;t stick out like a mismatched foundation or anything. So you can skip the foundation if you want and just powder up or go without anything. Great, great stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this! I tried it above my lips where tiny wrinkles are starting and they disappeared from view! It actually fills the wrinkles! My red nose with huge pores turns my skin color too, within a few seconds. I don&#x27;t put my foundation over it since it&#x27;s not needed. It seems like a moisturizer with lots of talc and it dries fast. You pat it on instead of rubbing it in. It&#x27;s expensive but I&#x27;ll continue buying more before it&#x27;s gone because I never want to be without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few foundation primers but this one is by far the most versatile.  I use a tinted moisturizer with SPF instead of foundation and although it gives my skin a nice, even look, it does leave it looking a little greasy.  So I use POREfessional over the top and it gives me a flawless, matte look that is fresh and not cakey.  I have also used this alone as a sheer foundation and it works great.  I use this more and more, and it&#x27;s becoming my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; product for making my skin look good.  I will tell you that my sister tried it too and it gave her a boil on her nose  :(  So it isn&#x27;t for everyone.  But luckily, it works well for me and has become my new favorite Benefit product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Love it!</li>
            <li> There just wasn&#x27;t anything super special about it. I like how much sort makes your skin feel and makes it easy to blend makeup but not that impressed</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS SUPER FAKE. THE BOTTLE WAS OPEN AND THE PRODUCT WAS NOT THE SAME AS THE REAL ONE, SUPER GREASY AND STICKY. I JUST WANT TO RETURN IT AND GET MY MONEY BACK!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  Like all of benefits&#x27; products, as soon as they send you a sample you are hooked for life.  This primer wears perfect under any makeup, you don&#x27;t have to use benefits&#x27; foundation, an aspect I love about the entire product line (so far).  It fills in all your pores and fine lines and allows your foundation/concealer to blend in perfectly! Not only does it make your pores appear smaller but it smooths away shine and you can dab it on top of your foundation later on in the day if you have really oily skin. Another reason I am in love with this product is: if you have a blemish (especially on the forehead and cheeks) you can dab extra primer on that area, delicately cover with concealer using a concealer brush, and finish using your powder foundation.  Your blemish literally disappears! No more dabbing concealer on a breakout and still having to settle for \\&quot;it&#x27;s still shows in the light, but at least it&#x27;s not red anymore\\&quot; Not to mention it lasts ALL DAY.  I recently went on a hiking trip and really put it to the test..I wore porefessional, erase paste, stay don&#x27;t stray, and powder foundation (I have really bad dark circles-hence the oodles of concealer) I went to breakfast, hiked and eight mile hike (half of it was climbing up the mountain) in 93 degree weather-a real butt burner, came back took a nap, jumped in the shower with no time to redo my makeup before dinner so I didn&#x27;t wash my face while I was showering and my makeup still looked flawless!  Now that is high quality makeup!  It withstood heavy sweating, high heat, harsh dusty winds, rub-off proof from napping, and high humidity from the shower (side note-I have dehydrated skin with occasional oily T-zone).  Benefit Cosmetics knows what they are doing when it comes to makeup. I highly suggest if they send you a sample or you try something and you don&#x27;t like it, go to their website and watch a \\&quot;how-to\\&quot; video.  They are really good at posting them.  They give you excellent tips and show you how to use and love each of their products.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing it smells good and makes my pores look less visible and works as a primer.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product for years and I don&#x27;t know what I would do without.  My fine line and dark circles literally disappear!!! Love, Love, Love benefit porefessional!!!</li>
            <li> After the first use it became watery!</li>
            <li> The BEST primer ever! Very thin and definitely work like magic...I LOVE IT! I am going to purchase more...Worth the price</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! Great coverage with such a small amount! The duration of the product is definitely worth the money! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Smooths my face, smooths out small wrinkles, many times that&#x27;s all I need no more foundations</li>
            <li> Purchased this item because I had a tube that I picked up at the mall, and assumed it would be the same product.  But I guess you get what you paid for, and while I thought I was getting was a good deal (of course I purchased 2 of them), i end up with something that has either been refilled with some sort of non skin tone colored goop which spreads like candle wax or honey on a greesy face (Lol).  Unless you have skin the color of one of those Barbie dolls, you may as well use this stuff for Halloween.</li>
            <li> Woooooooooow this product is so so amazing I really liked it so much. It helped me keeping the foundation smooth and poreless</li>
            <li> I have a rather rosy complexion with some broken capillaries as well. I need to wear a foundation. This product does not work with foundation. After applying a very small amount to start I then applied my foundation. My foundation was very streaked. The product is tinted but only very slightly and does not cover my skin issues. Worst of all it didn&#x27;t reduce the appearance of my pores. I definitely won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I use this primer daily under my makeup. It makes my skin smoother and makes the pores less noticeable and allows my makeup to apply better. The only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t reduce oil. I did a side by side comparison here: [...]</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. It makes my pores go in hiding! It does not make me break out and it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy from here, this isn&#x27;t the real Benefit Porefessional product by Benefit Cosmetics. It has the same packaging, but is tampered with, the tube wasn&#x27;t even sealed and it definitely does not look like the Porefessional by Benefit I have been using. Absolutely ridiculous that Amazon would allow this to happen...I am returning it. It&#x27;s better to just spend the money and go buy it from Benefit or a cosmetics store so you know you&#x27;re getting the real thing. What a scam.</li>
            <li> The lotion is arguably some of the best I&#x27;ve used. I love the the intricacy of its ingredients that complement the ultimate quality when I used it. Would highly recommend to anyone who cares about his or her skin. In addition, the perfect size adds to a good traveling accessory</li>
            <li> The POREfessional is supposed to create an illusion of smaller pores by filling them in. Does it succeed in doing this? Perhaps for some. For me, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in the size of my pores after using it. However, as a facial primer, I thought this product was great. I have combination skin and found the POREfessional to go on light and non-greasy. It created a nice smooth base for applying my mineral foundation and when using it my foundation stayed in tact longer.</li>
            <li> A little darker than expected but still great.</li>
            <li> Absorb into pores immediately then make the pores more obvious. i&#x27;ll stick with clarins for better result but they are pricey though</li>
            <li> Poorly packed, got almost the items leaking and couple with the top broken, seems like they just threw my stuff in the box without any protections. Very sad...</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t fill or minimize my pores at all.  I applied foundation over it, my usual brand, and at first everything looked really nice.  Then several hours later I looked in the bathroom mirror (not even a magnifying mirror mind you) and every pore around my nose had a deposit of foundation in it.  It looked like a extra teeny needle deposited beige makeup in every single pore on my face!  I was so surprised and simultaneously horrified, given all the excellent reviews of this product on Amazon and YouTube.  After several hours, it was as if I had not applied any primer at all to my face.  In fact, my makeup looked exactly as it does when I don&#x27;t use a primer.  So what gives?  I&#x27;m going back to my tried and true Lorac primer.  In fact, I don&#x27;t know why I even bought this stuff.  I guess the grass is always greener on the other side.  The Lorac mattifying primer works way better than this.  The day after I had the disaster with Porefessional, I used the Lorac primer and my usual foundation.  Ten hours later (looking in the same mirror) no pores were visible on my face at all and as an added benefit, it also controls oil in my T zone really well.  So Porefessional is going back to Ulta where I&#x27;ll exchange it for a new tube of Lorac.  This just teaches me the lesson of being satisfied with what I have.  With the Lorac primer, my makeup looks flawless and stays fresh until I take it off.  What more can you ask for?  Lorac is a superior product.  I don&#x27;t recommend Porefessional at all.</li>
            <li> This product was a lot cheaper from this vendor, but it is NOT the real thing..I compared this w/ my older tube &amp; this product did not close my pores, was really dark in colour &amp; dried before completely applied.  Guess I will spend the $ next time for the real thing.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to be either a counterfeit or it was expired. It was not at all the texture that Benefit Porefessional is supposed to be. I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this. I bought it from the bitch box shop because I didn&#x27;t get a sample and really wanted to try it, being that I have huge pores. It&#x27;s amazing, to say the least. It makes your sling feel like velvet and it really does minimize the appearance of pores. My pores are normally pretty visible even from about ten feet away and although I probably had to use a little more of this than most people, it really does work. The only thing that&#x27;s a little unfortunate is the price. It&#x27;s pretty expensive given the size of the full sized tube being as small as it is. But it truly is amazing, definitely going to be a part of my getting ready routine for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I received this product, the tube was completely busted opened. I have bought Benefit products for years, I do not believe this is a true product! It is greasy and pink in color unlike the true Porefection from Benefit cosmetics. On top of the bad rating I am submitting, I also received a coupon for (If you like this product I will send you a 100$ gift certificate) TOTALL GIMMICK.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous Benefit product. Really does smooth pores and make skin feel and look smooth. Have used for a year and love alone or under foundation.</li>
            <li> I think this is easily the most overrated product of the year. I bought it because I asked the girl in Sephora for a pore filler, and she insisted on this one. It just doesnt seem to do ANYTHING at all.  I know I apply it correctly but just patting it in instead of swearing it everywhere and it still just doesnt improve the look of my skin. It doesnt fill the poors and I HATE the fact that its a weird orangey color. I have no idea how this became so popular or so EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> I did not have high hopes for this product but it actually works.  The trick is only to use it on the portion of your face with the largest pores.  For me, that&#x27;s my nose.  If you use it everywhere it will flake.  I apply it, let it set, and then put my tinted sunscreen over.  If I sweat a lot, it starts to diminish but you can re-apply.  I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Beyond a shadow of a doubt, double checked with manufacture of authentic brand, this turned out to be a FAKE, CHEAP, IMITATION.  This was purchased as a Christmas gift and was a huge disappointment.  This product&#x27;s formula and ingredients could allegedly be hazardous, I have also come to find out.  Seller offered a full refund, however, I did not want seller to resell this to some unsuspecting person.  I also do not feel that I should have to take MY time to package item and take to the post office.  I would not recommend purchasing anyting like this from seller or anyone else online except a reputable makeup company.</li>
            <li> So, I was kind of skeptical of this product when I bought it because hey, what product can *actually* make your face look flawless with it being applied by a professional?    And then, I tried this. And WOW does it work--just be sure to dab instead of schmear it on, and your face will look flawless! it even covered up some of my trouble spots (amazing).  It almost made my face look airbrushed! wow!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. Would never be without it. Makes my makeup look so much better!</li>
            <li> Makes skin look flawless. Can&#x27;t recommend BENEFIT products enough, especially this one! Quality, quality, quality. One tip: invest in a gentle scrub cleanser and toner for a once a week deep cleaning. (This is basically spackle for your pores---but looks awesome and has caused me no skin reaction, even though my skin is very sensitive.) A bit pricey, but well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I see no difference with this product in the size of my pores or their visibility.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of other reviewers, I got a knock-off that was nothing like the REAL Benefit product and had to be thrown out.  I got mine from Bmore Cosmetics so definitely stay away from them.  I will go back to buying from Sephora which sells the totally fantastic REAL product.  I&#x27;m disappointed that Amazon (my favorite company in the world) doesn&#x27;t vet its sellers better especially after so many negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I use this product all of the time.  I am an older lady and have trouble with pores.  However, this product works exactly as described and I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Does what is says (fills pores) but far too expensive. Does not keep oil at bay.</li>
            <li> This is original product</li>
            <li> Greasy... Don&#x27;t understand the fuss. Not my first time trying it. Smashbox is far better</li>
            <li> Excellent communication i really love it</li>
            <li> I like this product. It goes on smooth and makes me feel more confident about my imperfections. The only drawback is I think it truly does make you get sweatier if you&#x27;re prone to that. So test it out first because that&#x27;s not necessarily sexy.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS STUFF!  It&#x27;s awesome and makes my face look totally smooth.  (I look like a giant crater without makeup)  It totally works and I recommend to all my friends!</li>
            <li> I was walking around in the mall and saw a tester for this, I thought what the hay why not see if it even works. I was thinking I was going to put it on laugh and walk away. That is not what happened. I showed my friends husband who also tried it and we both ended up buying one before we left. He loves the way it works, and I love how it also makes me look 5 years younger just from reducing (not really reducing but somehow amazingly hiding them) the size of my pores. AMAZING I TELL YA!</li>
            <li> The POREfessional is wonderful... it goes on nicely, does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do, and makes my makeup go on so much smoother than most!</li>
            <li> This product is way too expensive.   I thought it was worth the money; however, when I tried the product, it is very short-lasting.  I think it lasts for only about an hour when I have tried on for couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Beware of Knock-off&#x27;s being sold online. If the product you receive is anything short of light, silky and wonderful - you probably received a knock off. Like any supplier selling knock-offs, the packaging looks identical to the real stuff. Go to a store like Ulta and try out their tester. If it&#x27;s not like what you received - let Amazon know and get a refund! I like to save up buck as much as the next gal, but......  I no longer buy any cosmetics online.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works great, by the way, but only if you get the real deal.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but it runs out super fast.</li>
            <li> This product goes on like silk.  I&#x27;ve stopped using a foundation and use this with powder and blush only. This product has helped me look and feel better.  Never have I received more compliments!</li>
            <li> This product does everything it says and much more! Love it! I will definitely buy again! It needs to be a little less pricey!</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves this stuff leaves her skin feeling soft and does reduce the appearance of her pores.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the product because of the negative review. So I contact the seller before I purchase the seller promised to refund if anything. I&#x27;ve been using this product for some times. It feels the same as the other ones I used before. Thank you , I will purchase from this seller again !</li>
            <li> I lOve Benefit&#x27;s POREfessional primer for my forehead,nose and cheeks which do have some pores,more noticeable on forehead.  I bought mine cheaper at Macy&#x27;s $10. for travel size 0.25 U.S. FL. OZ and $31 for normal size 0.75 U.S. FL OZ and they have a third size 1.5 U.S.FL OZ for $42.00  It really helps diminish pores and it has a nice scent not overwhelming or potent. This creamy velvety smooth formula is perfect for my dry/oily combo skin.</li>
            <li> I received my purchase in the correct packaging, but the contents were NOT Benefit Cosmetics POREfessional. The tube wasn&#x27;t even sealed which lead me to believe it was tampered with and refilled with this fake pink crap. The real POREfessional is a tan color, the stuff I received was pink, shiny, thin, and smelled perfumey. I brought it in to my local Sephora to see if the product had changed since my last purchase. They confirmed that it had not and what I received was likely a counterfeit product. I have since returned it and returned to my local Sephora to buy the REAL product.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SELLER ON AMAZON!!!</li>
            <li> it was not the true product.  I tried to save some money by buying my porrfessional for a long time.  this is not the true product and I would know I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time.  it works okay but not as good as the true stuff it&#x27;s some other kind of makeup in a porefessional box</li>
            <li> Even though it won&#x27;t completely hide all my pores, it minimizes my pores really well! I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> Have used this product before and I love it for covering the pores on my nose. The price here was much less than sephora, so I gave it a go. Brand new in box unopened or tampered with. Will order again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this primer from Ulta but loved it so much I wanted to write a review.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous primers both expensive and from a drugstore.  None have worked as well as this.  It makes my skin smooth and flawless and my makeup lasts all day.  I have very oily skin and my makeup tends to \\&quot;melt\\&quot; off of my face.  It stays on throughout the day with this primer.  It also makes my skin \\&quot;glow\\&quot;.  The first time I used it a family member thought I was pregnant because of the glow my skin had to it.  Later I had friends comment on how clear and smooth my skin is.  t isn&#x27;t that way without this primer.  I don&#x27;t intend to use anything else again!</li>
            <li> Estava muito curiosa sobre este produto usado por maquiadores e a sensação da Benefit. Estou muito satisfeita com a compra!</li>
            <li> Porefessional is a great product as a spot corrector, primer, or mixed with a little foundation, all you need for full cover-up. That said buyer beware. Why would you pay MORE for a product than Benefit themselves and their authorized sellers charges? Porefessional, the real stuff, cost $30.</li>
            <li> I am not a makeup wearer aside from mascara.  Though I know I should wear cover-up on sun-spotted areas, everything felt so heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of the POREfessional and tried it - OMG!  It&#x27;s light.  It&#x27;s smooth.  And it does not suffocate my skin in any way.  Additionally, even though I did not think there was a major change in the look of my skin, many, many people commented on how my skin looked so healthy lately.  It also prevents shine without any drying.  This stuff does it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am forever grateful and a believer in this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been looking forward to this product&lt;br /&gt;but，this product is not ture&lt;br /&gt;it‘s Too disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;I bought two pieces of, is all false</li>
            <li> Doesnt last all day, but this product really helps my skin look so smooth. At least temporarily, which I really appreciate. Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x60;ve use Porefessional for a long time.  Tried other products but this one is the best.  I would highly recommed it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased the sample size of this primer at Sephora. I love the texture - it is silky, velvety smooth and goes on to make your skin look very &amp;#34;blurred&amp;#34; and even. However, the very next morning, my skin broke out relatively badly and I feel it was probably from this product. As a primer, it worked very well and I&#x27;m sure it works well for people who are not sensitive to it. If you have acne-prone skin, err on the side of caution with this primer.</li>
            <li> it helps tremendously with pore coverage. I have tried just about everything &amp; this is the best. I wear it with no other makeup.</li>
            <li> Warning to all who wish to purchase a cheaper product, this is NOT the same product as from Benefit Cosmetics. It&#x27;s as if someone filled the bottle with a thick and pasty foundation. Do NOT purchase this if you wish to just save some money. I figured it was too good to be true!</li>
            <li> Como não achei opção de contato com o vendedor resolvi falar por aqui pra ver se me respondem. Comprei esse e outros produtos e pedi para entregarem na casa da minha tia, que mora nos USA, pois como ia visitá-la pegaria com ela. Assim tudo que chegou ela guardou, porém como não pude ir na casa dela ela me enviou para o Brasil e, demorou muito a chegar, quando abi a caixa esse item não veio...todos os outros que comprei vieram menos ele. apesar de constar como entregue, este produto NÃO foi entregue. Gostaria de solicitar que o enviem efetivamente para o endereço indicado na nota, pois já foi pago há meses. Aguardo retorno.</li>
            <li> As a primer, just the best on the market!  A little goes a long way.  A bit pricy but it will last.</li>
            <li> I used this product hoping that each time I would see some kind of difference. However, after 10 applications...nothing. It feels good when you put it on, but...nothing. Sorry for such just an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; rating.</li>
            <li> This is not real as I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve read in the comments. FYI I received a note saying &amp;#34;give this a positive review my wife has cancer&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Guilt trip much? Maybe you&#x27;d get a good review if it was actually the product.</li>
            <li> This is the best pore cover I have ever tried.  It feels clean on my skin...not greasy and looks great.  I have used Clinique in the past with less satisfying results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 2 stars because seller gave a prompt &amp; full refund (incl shipping) after I complained the product was not authentic Porefessional by Benefit. What I received wasn&#x27;t sealed, like the tube is when purchased at Sephora, and while it is a close dupe, the product sent does NOT look or behave like Porefessional on my skin. I have fair skin, and it looked like a fake tan on me. I would guess the tube was refilled it was some sort of semi-sheer mattifying foundation insted of Porefessional. Read previous reviews of same product, different sellers. It&#x27;s a scam. My seller was BECCA ROAD.  The actual product purchased at Sephora &#x3D; 5 stars for sure! Too bad I fell for the reduced price on Amazon and took a chance. I should have read all the reviews first!</li>
            <li> I have bought this product directly from the store so I know what it should feel like. This was not the real thing!!! Beware if buying from this site. Save your money and buy it directly from ULTA or Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love Benefit Cosmetics mainly because they deliver a great product at a reasonable price. I docked one star because this is way too pricey for what you get, IMO.  It&#x27;s a good pore minimizer that leaves your skin a perfect canvas for foundation. If your skin is in good shape, you can wear it alone too. I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon, also locally from Ulta, and a department store Kiosk. It&#x27;s the same product. Less is more with this product, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I really tried to like this product. I&#x27;ve been using Porefessional for a few weeks now and love it for the 1st couple of hours. By hour 3 my pores look bigger than when I stared in the AM. (Whts tht about?) I try to re-apply over the top of my make up which is a BB cream and tht just makes a mess.</li>
            <li> Maybe they have made some changes to the product. But the tube is exactly the same, word for word, and this product seems to be lighter in color, thinner and leaves a shine rather than being dull and blending. It isn&#x27;t bad, just different. I don&#x27;t like the shine, but it does seem to take less of this... Still love it, but wondering if they changed the product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for smoothing the look of pores. It is smooth and easy to apply and feels comfortable, a little like a very fine powder.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this primer... And at first I did. The consistency is nice and it goes on really smoothly. It actually did a good job camouflaging my pores and extending the wear of my makeup. Unfortunately, it also clogged my pores and broke me out pretty badly each time I tried to use it. I&#x27;m acne-prone and obviously I was sensitive to one of the ingredients. If you have acne, see if you can try it out at a make-up store before you buy it.</li>
            <li> I have really open pores on my nose.. I&#x27;ve tried so many different products and spent so much money on cleansers, ointments you name it I tried it! This stuff I&#x27;d buy by the cases if I could! Amazing my nose looks like I&#x27;m a kid again!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!!!  My face feels do soft and smooth.  I have mefium to large size pores and it fills them all in.  It is amazing!</li>
            <li> About a year or so ago, 11 year old daughter and I were cuddled up on the couch and she looks at me and says, \\&quot;Mama, what are all those holes on your nose?\\&quot; (Kids, aren&#x27;t they just so sweet?) :) I explained to her that Mommy just wasn&#x27;t one of those lucky people like her whose pores weren&#x27;t visible..&lt;br /&gt;After he innocent little comment, I started obsessing about the size of my pores, and swore every time I looked in the mirror, the pores seemed not only to multiply but to grow larger!!&lt;br /&gt;I went in search of pore eraser, or whatever it would be that I could use to help this huge issue that took me almost 40 years to even know I had developed! ;-) I started at the drugstores and bought one pore minimizer after another, but to no avail..&lt;br /&gt;I was at the mall with my girls and we went into \\&quot;Sephora\\&quot; and I saw \\&quot;Benefit The POREfessional\\&quot;. I was already a fan of \\&quot;Benefit They&#x27;Re Real! Mascara\\&quot; so I decided to give yet another pore minimizer a try and bought the \\&quot;POREfessionals\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Well let me tell you, I&#x27;m not looking for a pore minimizer anymore, my \\&quot;holes on my nose\\&quot; were suddenly GONE! My prayers had been answered! All it takes is one application of \\&quot;POREfessionals\\&quot; each day with my regular foundation and my skin looks as good as my daughters! (Well, if she had a few wrinkles it would!)&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, it&#x27;s worth the price too, especially when you find yourself wasting money on other products that claim to do the same before you finally wise up and buy \\&quot;Benefit Cosmetics POREfessionals!!\\&quot; I know I think so!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m just not using this correctly? because all the hype about it confuses me alot. I was eager to try this out and when I finally got it, I didn&#x27;t get nearly the results I wanted. It mostly leaves my nose flake-y when I put it on. If I put too little then you can&#x27;t see a difference. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this when a little foundation could do a much better job at filling/covering pores and for the same amount of time prettty much.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this from Sephora after hearing such awesome things.  I put it on and loved the way it felt.  Did my makeup and my skin looked amazing.  I was instantly sold and planned to go out the next day to buy a tube.  However, by the end of the night (5 hours later) I had a whitehead on my cheek and another volcanic zit starting to pop up on my other cheek.  I washed my face when I got home and by the morning the whitehead was gone and the other was starting to diminish.  I have never seen pimples pop up so quickly with anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.  Clearly this REALLY clogged my pores and my skin wasn&#x27;t happy with it.  It&#x27;s a shame, because it does an amazing job.  So, people with sensitive skin or prone to breakouts beware!</li>
            <li> Fake product, they took the packaging and filled it with something else</li>
            <li> Love this product. Been using for years and does not disappoint! I put it on after moisturizing before makeup. Really helps for a flawless looking skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this and didn&#x27;t realize it was a primer. I have good skin so I gave it away as a gift.</li>
            <li> This cream is working properly, you used to occasions,&lt;br /&gt;Reduces the appearance of pores&lt;br /&gt;I have benefited from it so much and I loved it a lot .. Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with this product at all.  I only have enlarged pores around my nose, so I&#x27;m not dealing with a big area or in need of a lot of coverage.  When I put this product on, at first I thought it was a miracle. The color match was perfect. It felt like a silky lotion. It seemed to totally camouflage my pores. Then after a few minutes (before I put any other makeup on), it separated on my skin and sat in oily dots.  Not only did it not do its pore minimizing namesake, it looked awful.  It looked splotchy, which is worse than enlarged pores. I attempted to use it on two occasions before giving up.  Maybe I got a bad batch, but I was not at all interested in exploring its use further.  I have other skin issues that I really need my makeup to address and pore minimization isn&#x27;t a priority.  For that reason, I didn&#x27;t try again with a replacement of this product. I see that some people rave about it, so perhaps my experience was a fluke. Nonetheless, it also has a very strong fragrance, which I found overwhelming. In short, no thanks, and cannot recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;m in love! An it came on time and no damaged what so ever.</li>
            <li> The best primer to minimize pores! Very soft/smooth and perfect for anytime/any kind makeup. But a little bit small for the price...</li>
            <li> makes my skin more smoothy and flawless with foundation&lt;br /&gt;and actually my skin pore disappear&lt;br /&gt;i used it only before foundations&lt;br /&gt;so i like it</li>
            <li> I love this product, how every ontop of some of my mosturizier it tends to clump up, and also does not keep me af matte as I was hoping, but I like to use this with my nars oil free primer and it does an okay job. I have a very, very oily t-zone but have some dry patches from overuse of spot treatments.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the same stuff that I have gotten at Ulta before.  It&#x27;s a different smell and consistency.</li>
            <li> this stuff is the best stuff i&#x27;ve found for reducing the appearance of pores.</li>
            <li> I have huge pores. You can see them and its really annoying. This primer works great to minimize them. I tap it on my nose, cheeks and forehead. Then I use my foundation and then tap a second layer of POREfessional on. It&#x27;s like spackle for the face!!!</li>
            <li> Its not the real thing! Dont buy it.</li>
            <li> This is great product, I have purchased it a couple of times. I was pleased with the packaging and arrival timing.</li>
            <li> Its not awful, but I like smashbox photo finish much better. This product didn&#x27;t glide on very well and the overall finish was just okay. Even with the tint it has, it didn&#x27;t help my skin very much. On days that I don&#x27;t use the smashbox product, I use aveeno tinted moisturizer and that works better than this product as well.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It lasts for a few months and never makes me break out!</li>
            <li> What I received was a knock-off of the real Benefit Porefessional product.</li>
            <li> the best thing to ever happen to my face. period. I have oily, uneven skin, and this works wonders...my mac studio fix foundation stays on much longer. i&#x27;m so excited I get to have a makeup face that will stay on this summer, and not melt away. Oily women, we have finally won!</li>
            <li> The best for people that has large pores... use it and you will see the difference</li>
    </ol>
