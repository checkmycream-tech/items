            <li>Nice daytime look.  </li>
            <li>They are more like real eyelashes in length and thinness which is perfect for work.</li>
            <li>The band is flimsy compared to the ones I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to but these do great once I get the shape just right.</li>
            <li>I love how the eyelashes look</li>
            <li>My favorite lashes bc</li>
            <li>Red cherry lashes are wonderful.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how much I love them.</li>
            <li>The band is almost invisible, which makes it look like the lashes are individually rooted and helps them blend perfectly.</li>
            <li>Very good quality, so you can reuse each pair multiple times.</li>
            <li>I received my eyelashes very quickly.</li>
            <li>With these lashes and mine I have full lovely luscious seductive lashes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>

            <li>The order came in right on time for my photoshoot:)</li>
            <li>The lashes are very flexible and very easy to trim the band length, which makes them a breeze to wear.</li>
            <li>I bought these eyelashes and they arrived extremely quick and are amazing and very high quality.</li>
            <li>I am a happy customer, Thanks Mixed Roots:)</li>
            <li>Long, but great.</li>
            <li>I wanted something with a more natural look just to enhance the thickness of my own lashes a little and these did the job great.</li>
            <li>Nice, they look natural</li>
            <li>They are very natural and it shipped really quickly, if I could give more stars I would put all the way.</li>
            <li>They are quite long, so they would be better in a more formal occasion.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Those lashes are very comfortable and they look natural.</li>
            <li>Very light weight and natural looking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased high end and can definitely say that these are really good quality</li>
            <li>The small are more for weddings and special occasions where the xs are perfect for an everyday put together look.</li>
            <li>I love my Red Cherry eyelashes!!!!</li>
            <li>Natural looking and cheap</li>
            <li>Really good for an everyday look.</li>
            <li>so natural looking and with proper care can reuse it many times!</li>
            <li>love these  very  natural looking  not real long like a lot of brands.</li>
            <li>I only give it a four star because I&#x27;m used to the stiffer band for added stability from velour lashes yet those are for the more glamorous evening wear where these red cherry&#x27;s are great for everyday day wear!</li>
            <li>A little risk can dig you up a nice find.</li>
            <li>Also, the price really can&#x27;t be beat, and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>I would definitly recommend them to anyone that wants a realistic look.</li>
            <li>The lashes are beautiful and look really expensive.</li>
            <li>they are natural looking and really make my almond-shaped eyes pop!</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase because of the realistic look they give my eyes even when I am not wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>I really like that these lashes aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;IN YOUR FACE&amp;#34; and look very natural.  </li>
            <li>Very natural looking but still fluttery when curled!</li>
            <li>I love these lashes for everyday usage, for school and work.</li>
            <li>I also love how you get 3 sets of lashes for so little money!</li>
            <li>They are very natural looking, yet add a lot of drama.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking.,,,,,,</li>
            <li>they are natural but can be used for any event or occasion.</li>
            <li>They look so natural that no-one knows I&#x27;m wearing them.</li>
            <li>These are Red Cherry lashes and they&#x27;re cheaper than buying straight from the brand.</li>
            <li>I can wear this to work without being conscious of them.</li>
            <li>The lashes give a nice full look without being overly long and exaggerated.  </li>
            <li>I love these lashes because they are very small and natural looking.</li>
            <li>They add just a tiny bit of length and a good amount of thickness they are not in anyway to dramatic.</li>
            <li>I like this, because you can go more natural and opt out of that heavy top eyeliner, unlike what you have to do on lashes that have that thick, black band.</li>
            <li>The lashes are smaller and realistic and they actually look like my lashes.</li>
            <li>For my next ones I will go up to 747S instead of xs however just because these are basically the length of my natural lashes.</li>

            <li> I received my eyelashes very quickly. They were well packaged and in great condition when I got them. I cant find these eyelashes anywhere so I was very pleased that I received them as soon as I did. Mixed Roots is a company I recommend to buy products from.</li>
            <li> Those lashes are very comfortable and they look natural. They are advertised as real human, but I&#x27;m not sure which part if human hair can be this course... But they serve the purpose.</li>
            <li> The lashes are smaller and realistic and they actually look like my lashes. With these lashes and mine I have full lovely luscious seductive lashes. I will continue to purchase because of the realistic look they give my eyes even when I am not wearing makeup.</li>

            <li> Worked perfectly for my business woman on-the-go makeup looks. I love these lashes for everyday usage, for school and work.</li>
            <li> I have worn these to work. They are more like real eyelashes in length and thinness which is perfect for work. They look so natural that no-one knows I&#x27;m wearing them.</li>

            <li> I only give it a four star because I&#x27;m used to the stiffer band for added stability from velour lashes yet those are for the more glamorous evening wear where these red cherry&#x27;s are great for everyday day wear! The band is flimsy compared to the ones I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to but these do great once I get the shape just right. The best way to do that is wait after the glue gets tacky before doing the bendy shape. Hope this helps! Enjoy</li>
            <li> I love my Red Cherry eyelashes!!!! The order came in right on time for my photoshoot:) My headshots look amazing thanks to my 747xs lashes.   I am a happy customer, Thanks Mixed Roots:)</li>
            <li> Natural looking and cheap</li>
            <li> They do not last/hold up as well as the Cherishlook brand which supposed to be the same manufacture.</li>
            <li> so natural looking and with proper care can reuse it many times! I always have trouble finding eyelashes for my eyes but this is freakishly awesome! very happy with this product</li>
            <li> love these  very  natural looking  not real long like a lot of brands.</li>
            <li> I really like that these lashes aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;IN YOUR FACE&amp;#34; and look very natural.  Also, the price really can&#x27;t be beat, and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> Really nice falsies! They look extremely natural on girls with naturally short lashes like myself—it adds just a tiny bit of subtle volume. Very good quality, so you can reuse each pair multiple times. For my next ones I will go up to 747S instead of xs however just because these are basically the length of my natural lashes. I prefer natural-looking, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind if they were just a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I had bought Red Cherry lashes before and they were WAY to long and just horribly fake. I wanted something with a more natural look just to enhance the thickness of my own lashes a little and these did the job great. They add just a tiny bit of length and a good amount of thickness they are not in anyway to dramatic. Really good for an everyday look.</li>
            <li> Red cherry lashes are wonderful. Buying them in a bundle saves a ton of money. If you like this style, it&#x27;s a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I just received my lashes and they are perfect. Very light weight and natural looking. These are not for those who are looking for dramactic look. I can wear this to work without being conscious of them. I personally didn&#x27;t buy them on Amazon,  got mine from Ebay but I wanted to do a review on these. That&#x27;s how much I love them.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even feel them. I have the 747s too. The small are more for weddings and special occasions where the xs are perfect for an everyday put together look. I wear lashes because sometimes mascara can irritate my eyes and these lashes meet my needs. I&#x27;ve purchased high end and can definitely say that these are really good quality</li>
            <li> These are the best.....can&#x27;t beat the prices!  Very natural looking.,,,,,,</li>
            <li> Nice, they look natural</li>
            <li> REVIEW FOR 747S: Well, I ordered the 747xs, but I was sent the 747s, which basically means that these are a tiny bit longer than the ones I wanted. The thing is, these lashes are great. Long, but great. I couldn&#x27;t even complain that the length was wrong. They are very nice. The band is almost invisible, which makes it look like the lashes are individually rooted and helps them blend perfectly. I like this, because you can go more natural and opt out of that heavy top eyeliner, unlike what you have to do on lashes that have that thick, black band. I wore light beige/nude eyeshadow and just a thin line of liquid eyeliner at the lashline. The lashes are very flexible and very easy to trim the band length, which makes them a breeze to wear. I wore them all night (with DUO eyelash bond) through some humid weather, and they didn&#x27;t come off. They are quite long, so they would be better in a more formal occasion.</li>
