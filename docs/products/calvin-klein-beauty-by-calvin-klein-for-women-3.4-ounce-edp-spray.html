            <li>She liked it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching all over for this scent and was thrilled to find it.</li>
            <li>and I really liked the fragrance was told I could get at Boston Store and come to find out it has been discontinued by them.</li>
            <li>Tested fragrances in department stores to decide what I liked before purchacing online.</li>
            <li>bt so nice..light nice smell,</li>

            <li>and i just could not ask for more.</li>
            <li>And it has turned into my # 1 favorite...</li>
            <li>The amazon price was better then the outlet price.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t effect everyone like this, but check it out.</li>
            <li>Eternity doesn&#x27;t have this effect at all and smells even better.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.  </li>
            <li>I find I have to use more of a volume than I do for most perfumes.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>It smells elegant and it reminds me of J&#x27;adore by Dior.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent.</li>
            <li>wondering if the EDT spray would have better staying power....</li>
            <li>and I get many compliments when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>My favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>My favorite besides Chanel Chance.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I bought Calvin Klein Beauty, which is wonderful!!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get this product out there for a better price.</li>
            <li>I was able to get them here and save money.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know what else to say :)</li>
            <li>she is glad to see it.</li>
            <li>Both my wife and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>and I just love the scent, it has a citrus undertone.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>she love it</li>
            <li>I love this perfume</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be doing it again for sure.</li>
            <li>I love it and</li>
            <li>Mostly use Musk Oils.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>So glad if pundit here.</li>
            <li>Great clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells  very rich.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, its high quality perfume i love it</li>
            <li>I have loved CK Beauty since my first sniff....</li>
            <li>scent makes a statement but it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>its nt so strong..</li>
            <li>My wife loves it, I love it and the price is right!</li>
            <li>When I tried the fragrance in the store, it smelled pretty amazing ...</li>
            <li>Bold, but still refreshing.  </li>
            <li>but I think that&#x27;s fine since the smell and everything else seems to be genuine.</li>
            <li>Liked it, brought it home for girlfriend&#x27;s approval before buying a large bottle.</li>
            <li>it was love at first smell, so I ordered it asap!</li>
            <li>Huge bottle for the price I was paying for a 1 oz in Kohl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>, what cheap perfume smell was that?&amp;#34; when someone walks by wearing this.</li>
            <li>I tested this in a department store and found it to be light and airy</li>
            <li>This is a great smell that stays in my clothing several times after being washed.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>totally worth my money..:)</li>
            <li>Although a little strong at first, it wears into perfect and light scent.</li>
            <li>My wife loves all the CK scents, so when I originally took a chance on this one, it was a pretty safe bet.  </li>
            <li>It was brand new and in a nice package.</li>
            <li>This is always a special gift from my husband.</li>
            <li>Opened it up right away, smells just like it should!</li>
            <li>Not overly sweet.</li>
            <li>I love this scent, very light and will last all day.</li>
            <li>and I feel that it would be better for someone a bit older.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for everyday wear or special occasions.</li>
            <li>The product was excellent as expected and the shipping arrived as estimated (but on the very last day).</li>
            <li>CK perfumes are pricey but worth it if you, like me, want a fragrance to make a statement and</li>
            <li>Just not crazy about it.</li>
            <li>it is soft yet fresh and have received many compliments.</li>
            <li>CK usually is a good decision, gave her Euphoria for the last two Christmases because she really likes it, this one seems to meet her preference as well.</li>
            <li>I have trouble liking CK fragrances, but this is the best Calvin Klein fragrance by far.</li>
            <li>worth the money for all the compliments that I receive.</li>
            <li>Another one I did order from Calvin Klein directly was the same - great smell.</li>
            <li>One I bought in Duty Free and liked so much the fresh smell, stay long-</li>
            <li>Calvin Klein Beauty arrived very fast from the seller.</li>
            <li>Beauty and Euphoria are the only two fragrances I own that I know will have a lasting, strong formula.</li>
            <li>Quick shipped and same as in store but way more reasonable.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted and been looking for awhile.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I had ever noticed this issue.</li>
            <li>Just be aware.</li>
            <li>My husband first bought this perfume for me a couple of years ago.  </li>
            <li>Calvin Klein never fails in the fragrance department.  </li>
            <li>Not the first time I&#x27;ve purchased Beauty, but the first time I purchased online.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with the sample fragrance in a local store and its staying power.</li>
            <li>I have had several compliments on this perfume, it is my favorite.</li>
            <li>This Beauty is OK, but it just doesn&#x27;t smell the same as in the stores.</li>
            <li>First time I tried Calvin Klein.  </li>
            <li>stay for long time..:)</li>
            <li>Ordered a large bottle and gave it to her for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I received a sample and then ordered the large Eu De Parfume -</li>
            <li>you want a long lasting, woody perfume with a touch of clean floral, this is for you. :-)</li>
            <li>Very classy women&#x27;s fragrance!!</li>
            <li>This one is the real Calvin Klein Beauty.</li>
            <li>Very versatile for day or night.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and yet seems to last the day.</li>
            <li>whole day, all my friends were asking what is the perfume.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty sensitive to scents so rarely do I pick a new one.</li>
            <li>Calvin Klein has other better fragrances ...</li>
            <li>I received more compliments on this than any other.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t stock up yet, I still need to buy a few more first...</li>
            <li>It is very strong smell, I am not sure I will order some perfumes online.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have that heavy and harsh scent that many famous scents have.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this perfume in any department store around where I live.</li>
            <li>When a new one comes out I always purchase it.</li>
            <li>Price was fab and shipped brand new, unopened in psckage.</li>
            <li>I usually like CK colognes and I like this okay, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to purchase this fragrance, as it is very difficult to find in the stores.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t received any compliments so far ...</li>
            <li>Surprised me</li>
            <li>I love the subtle smell.</li>
            <li>The main accord of the perfume is jasmine (white floral).</li>
            <li>Boy did I ever score some major brownie points on this purchase.</li>
            <li>really like the smell; but wife says it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the tester she tried at the Calvin Klein store  --</li>
            <li>It is far cheaper here than a department store, and as Beauty has gone out of production, this is practically the only way to buy it anymore.  </li>
            <li>The silage is moderate to heavy, is strong enough for people to notice the scent but is not too heavy to annoy others.</li>
            <li>Alway hear so much about Calvin Klein and was a little bit dissappointed.  </li>

            <li> I love this scent.  </li>
            <li> I find I have to use more of a volume than I do for most perfumes.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> It smells elegant and it reminds me of J&#x27;adore by Dior.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent.</li>
            <li> wondering if the EDT spray would have better staying power....</li>
            <li> and I get many compliments when I wear it.  </li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li> My favorite besides Chanel Chance.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I bought Calvin Klein Beauty, which is wonderful!!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get this product out there for a better price.</li>
            <li> I was able to get them here and save money.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what else to say :)</li>
            <li> she is glad to see it.</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> and I just love the scent, it has a citrus undertone.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> she love it</li>
            <li> I love this perfume</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be doing it again for sure.</li>
            <li> I love it and</li>
            <li> Mostly use Musk Oils.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> So glad if pundit here.</li>
            <li> Great clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells  very rich.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, its high quality perfume i love it</li>
            <li> I have loved CK Beauty since my first sniff....</li>
            <li> scent makes a statement but it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> its nt so strong..</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, I love it and the price is right!</li>
            <li> When I tried the fragrance in the store, it smelled pretty amazing ...</li>
            <li> Bold, but still refreshing.  </li>
            <li> but I think that&#x27;s fine since the smell and everything else seems to be genuine.</li>
            <li> Liked it, brought it home for girlfriend&#x27;s approval before buying a large bottle.</li>
            <li> it was love at first smell, so I ordered it asap!</li>
            <li> Huge bottle for the price I was paying for a 1 oz in Kohl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> , what cheap perfume smell was that?&amp;#34; when someone walks by wearing this.</li>
            <li> I tested this in a department store and found it to be light and airy</li>
            <li> This is a great smell that stays in my clothing several times after being washed.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> totally worth my money..:)</li>
            <li> Although a little strong at first, it wears into perfect and light scent.</li>
            <li> My wife loves all the CK scents, so when I originally took a chance on this one, it was a pretty safe bet.  </li>
            <li> It was brand new and in a nice package.</li>
            <li> This is always a special gift from my husband.</li>
            <li> Opened it up right away, smells just like it should!</li>
            <li> Not overly sweet.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, very light and will last all day.</li>
            <li> and I feel that it would be better for someone a bit older.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for everyday wear or special occasions.</li>
            <li> The product was excellent as expected and the shipping arrived as estimated (but on the very last day).</li>
            <li> CK perfumes are pricey but worth it if you, like me, want a fragrance to make a statement and</li>
            <li> Just not crazy about it.</li>
            <li> it is soft yet fresh and have received many compliments.</li>
            <li> CK usually is a good decision, gave her Euphoria for the last two Christmases because she really likes it, this one seems to meet her preference as well.</li>
            <li> I have trouble liking CK fragrances, but this is the best Calvin Klein fragrance by far.</li>
            <li> worth the money for all the compliments that I receive.</li>
            <li> Another one I did order from Calvin Klein directly was the same - great smell.</li>
            <li> One I bought in Duty Free and liked so much the fresh smell, stay long-</li>
            <li> Calvin Klein Beauty arrived very fast from the seller.</li>
            <li> Beauty and Euphoria are the only two fragrances I own that I know will have a lasting, strong formula.</li>
            <li> Quick shipped and same as in store but way more reasonable.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted and been looking for awhile.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I had ever noticed this issue.</li>
            <li> Just be aware.</li>
            <li> My husband first bought this perfume for me a couple of years ago.  </li>
            <li> Calvin Klein never fails in the fragrance department.  </li>
            <li> Not the first time I&#x27;ve purchased Beauty, but the first time I purchased online.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love with the sample fragrance in a local store and its staying power.</li>
            <li> I have had several compliments on this perfume, it is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This Beauty is OK, but it just doesn&#x27;t smell the same as in the stores.</li>
            <li> First time I tried Calvin Klein.  </li>
            <li> stay for long time..:)</li>
            <li> Ordered a large bottle and gave it to her for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I received a sample and then ordered the large Eu De Parfume -</li>
            <li> you want a long lasting, woody perfume with a touch of clean floral, this is for you. :-)</li>
            <li> Very classy women&#x27;s fragrance!!</li>
            <li> This one is the real Calvin Klein Beauty.</li>
            <li> Very versatile for day or night.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and yet seems to last the day.</li>
            <li> whole day, all my friends were asking what is the perfume.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty sensitive to scents so rarely do I pick a new one.</li>
            <li> Calvin Klein has other better fragrances ...</li>
            <li> I received more compliments on this than any other.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t stock up yet, I still need to buy a few more first...</li>
            <li> It is very strong smell, I am not sure I will order some perfumes online.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have that heavy and harsh scent that many famous scents have.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this perfume in any department store around where I live.</li>
            <li> When a new one comes out I always purchase it.</li>
            <li> Price was fab and shipped brand new, unopened in psckage.</li>
            <li> I usually like CK colognes and I like this okay, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Glad I was able to purchase this fragrance, as it is very difficult to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t received any compliments so far ...</li>
            <li> Surprised me</li>
            <li> I love the subtle smell.</li>
            <li> The main accord of the perfume is jasmine (white floral).</li>
            <li> Boy did I ever score some major brownie points on this purchase.</li>
            <li> really like the smell; but wife says it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the tester she tried at the Calvin Klein store  --</li>
            <li> It is far cheaper here than a department store, and as Beauty has gone out of production, this is practically the only way to buy it anymore.  </li>
            <li> The silage is moderate to heavy, is strong enough for people to notice the scent but is not too heavy to annoy others.</li>
            <li> Alway hear so much about Calvin Klein and was a little bit dissappointed.  </li>
            <li> This smells the same, but does not last as long...</li>
            <li> last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a softer scent but didn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li> But again it was not harsh or too heavy a scent.  </li>
            <li> Was skeptical ordering this online since in the past i&#x27;ve received products that were fake, but this is the real deal and im glad i took a change.  </li>
            <li> I cannot wear any other Calvin Klein scents - they are either too floral, too musky, too .....</li>
            <li> I will pass it down to a Granddaughter who is 22.  </li>
            <li> After smoking a cigarrete at a friends house, I decided to ask her if she could give me a little bit of whatever fragrance she had</li>
            <li> The color of the bottle was a little bit darker than the picture</li>
            <li> It felt like little pin pricks inside my nose when I got a whiff of this scent.</li>
            <li> But gave myself a little gift.  </li>
            <li> I dislike heavy scents but Beauty wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> which i m using everyday.</li>
            <li> I am using this perfume a few years.</li>
            <li> Not a strong fragrance</li>
            <li> It has been my signature scent for the past three years.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This is hard to find- Macy&#x27;s no longer sells.</li>
            <li> and when I spray on the perfume ..I can hardly get a whiff of it.</li>
            <li> However, after going through half a bottle ..I hate to say this</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong either as a gift or for yourself.</li>
            <li> sadly CK Beauty doesn&#x27;t quite cut the mark.</li>
            <li> It is sad they discontinued this but thank to amazon</li>
            <li> You can go wrong with this perfume.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Beauty!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The woody base is a bit stronger than I would like - specifically, the cedar makes this perfume quite androgynous as I believe it could pass for a cologne as well.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Cheaper than department store. Bought it as a gift and she likes it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, very light and will last all day. I always get compliments when I wear it. Beautiful scent!</li>
            <li> Literally my problem is that your scent morphs beautifully but has no longevity.&lt;br /&gt;I love it to the nines, if it weren&#x27;t for its ephemeral spray.</li>
            <li> Oxygene by Lanvin was currently my #1 favorite... After smoking a cigarrete at a friends house, I decided to ask her if she could give me a little bit of whatever fragrance she had and she pulled out this BEAUTY.... it was love at first smell, so I ordered it asap! It came well packaged, on time and i just could not ask for more. I adore it!! And it has turned into my # 1 favorite... sorry Lanvin! Lol!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you amazon!! Love ittttt!</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect gift and lives up to ratings &amp; reviews. Smells wonderful, crisp &amp; light. No &amp;#34;ugh, what cheap perfume smell was that?&amp;#34; when someone walks by wearing this.</li>
            <li> I love this scent!  Perfect!  Great size!</li>
            <li> This is the nicest scent I have ever found.   I tested this in a department store and found it to be light and airy and it does not over power you.     The amazon price was better then the outlet price.    Comes in a very nice decorative bottle.   Cant go wrong either as a gift or for yourself.</li>
            <li> This fragrance has a perfect husky, rich smell to it that still feels feminine and grown up. I get compliments every time I wear it!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted and been looking for awhile.  I couldn&#x27;t find this perfume in any department store around where I live. And the price was a bargain!</li>
            <li> The product was excellent as expected and the shipping arrived as estimated (but on the very last day). The color of the bottle was a little bit darker than the picture but I think that&#x27;s fine since the smell and everything else seems to be genuine.</li>
            <li> Glad I was able to purchase this fragrance, as it is very difficult to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> I was worried it would be a knock off, or broken...was perfect and arrived quickly and well packed! Opened it up right away, smells just like it should! This is hard to find- Macy&#x27;s no longer sells. Boo.</li>
            <li> Packaged beautiful arrived on time and always smells beautiful on my woman,</li>
            <li> Got a sample strip of this scent in a local store. Liked it, brought it home for girlfriend&#x27;s approval before buying a large bottle. She liked it also. Noticed we started having symptoms of nasal stuffiness and sneezing, assumed it was not related to the scent. Ordered a large bottle and gave it to her for Christmas. She put some on. She got stuffed up and I started sneezing. It felt like little pin pricks inside my nose when I got a whiff of this scent. Really!&lt;br /&gt;I have heard about some people being allergic to perfume. This is the first time I had ever noticed this issue. It affected us both to the point she could not use it at all. Just be aware. I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t effect everyone like this, but check it out. Eternity doesn&#x27;t have this effect at all and smells even better.</li>
            <li> I have loved CK Beauty since my first sniff.... its perfect for any occassion... Everytime I wear it my coworkers ask me &amp;#34;What im wearing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My husband first bought this perfume for me a couple of years ago.  I had never heard of it&lt;br /&gt;before. I receive a lot of complimemts on this scent.  It is one of my favorites. My best friend now wears it as well.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best smelling perfumes that linger and it came to me on time!</li>
            <li> Never had to rate perfume, but I will do so.  Calvin Klein never fails in the fragrance department.  Although a little strong at first, it wears into perfect and light scent.</li>
            <li> I bought CK Beauty from Perfumania after comparing the prices with Amazon. When I tried the fragrance in the store, it smelled pretty amazing ...I was taken ! I dislike heavy scents but Beauty wasn&#x27;t. However, after going through half a bottle ..I hate to say this but it&#x27;s not that great. I haven&#x27;t received any compliments so far ...and when I spray on the perfume ..I can hardly get a whiff of it. Calvin Klein has other better fragrances ...the tried and tested Euphoria and Eternity ....sadly CK Beauty doesn&#x27;t quite cut the mark.</li>
            <li> I lovee this. It smells good its just amazing. It is sad they discontinued this but thank to amazon i found it ^_^ .. I got 2 of these ... xo - would recommend</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  The only problem is that the scent does not last all day.  I find I have to use more of a volume than I do for most perfumes.  Scent is great though.</li>
            <li> MY DAUGHTER IS HOOKED ON THIS I THINK THIS IS HER 4TH BOTTLE SO THIS ONE IS FOR CHRISTMAS A GREAT SCENT</li>
            <li> Love the scent. I chose to give it to my mom as a mother&#x27;s day gift. She loves it. I will definitely buy one for me later.</li>
            <li> A very Good deal. Best price I have found so far and I absolutely love this fragrance. One of my favs!</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast and the packaging was perfect. I bought this for my sister and she loved it. The main accord of the perfume is jasmine (white floral). It has great longevity (you can smell the perfume even after you&#x27;ve washed your cloth). The silage is moderate to heavy, is strong enough for people to notice the scent but is not too heavy to annoy others. It smells elegant and it reminds me of J&#x27;adore by Dior.</li>
            <li> so, I recommend to all who like it. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, its high quality perfume i love it</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift and it was quite well received.  Not the first time I&#x27;ve purchased Beauty, but the first time I purchased online.  It is far cheaper here than a department store, and as Beauty has gone out of production, this is practically the only way to buy it anymore.  Stock up while you can...wait, don&#x27;t stock up yet, I still need to buy a few more first...</li>
            <li> Beauty and Euphoria are the only two fragrances I own that I know will have a lasting, strong formula. CK perfumes are pricey but worth it if you, like me, want a fragrance to make a statement and last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woody base is a bit stronger than I would like - specifically, the cedar makes this perfume quite androgynous as I believe it could pass for a cologne as well. I would have liked stronger floral notes. This isn&#x27;t an every day kind of fragrance for me, since I&#x27;m 24 and I feel that it would be better for someone a bit older. But, I am yet to find a \\&quot;younger\\&quot; fragrance that has a CK quality formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a long lasting, woody perfume with a touch of clean floral, this is for you. :-)</li>
            <li> My favorite scent. Long&lt;br /&gt;Lasting  I have walked thru a store and have&lt;br /&gt;Had ppl ask me what perfume was I wearing.  Surprised me I couldn&#x27;t smell it</li>
            <li> Smells sooo good really pleased with Beauty. Have to say all of Calvin&#x27;s Perfumes smell great. When a new one comes out I always purchase it.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the sample fragrance in a local store and its staying power. This smells the same, but does not last as long... wondering if the EDT spray would have better staying power....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great scent for warmer weather.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance.  Have gotten lots of complements.  Not a strong fragrance so you might think you can&#x27;t smell it anymore, but others can.</li>
            <li> I love the subtle smell. Lasts all day but will not overwhelm others</li>
            <li> I smelled this perfume in a magazine and had to get some.  It is a softer scent and I get many compliments when I wear it.  Love it!</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.  I used to buy it at the duty-free store between the US and Canada but they no longer have it! Awesome product</li>
            <li> Wife thinks it is different than the store bought product.</li>
            <li> You can go wrong with this perfume.</li>
            <li> I usually like CK colognes and I like this okay, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again. It doesn&#x27;t seem to last well. Just not crazy about it.</li>
            <li> I received a sample and then ordered the large Eu De Parfume - it is soft yet fresh and have received many compliments.</li>
            <li> Very classy women&#x27;s fragrance!! CK usually is a good decision, gave her Euphoria for the last two Christmases because she really likes it, this one seems to meet her preference as well.</li>
            <li> My partner loves this perfume, and i was glad to snag some since it has been DISCONTINUED by Calvin Klein!</li>
            <li> This one is the real Calvin Klein Beauty.</li>
            <li> Gents, if your lady smells like this and you lose sight of her, another man may pick her up without prior knowledge. Therefore, if your lady wears this perfume in public, keep a watchful eye. That is all.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, feminine scent that lasts through the day.  Very versatile for day or night.  My favorite besides Chanel Chance.</li>
            <li> Very good price for one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells  very rich.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical ordering this online since in the past i&#x27;ve received products that were fake, but this is the real deal and im glad i took a change.  Huge bottle for the price I was paying for a 1 oz in Kohl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I bought Calvin Klein Beauty, which is wonderful!! This is my favorite Calvin Klein fragrance!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get this product out there for a better price. I am so pleased to have fount this deal!</li>
            <li> Must have!  The scent is heavenly.  I get stopped about how yummy I smell!</li>
            <li> I have trouble liking CK fragrances, but this is the best Calvin Klein fragrance by far. It is warm and floral, yet I could not associate my personality with it so I gave it to my mom. She liked it.</li>
            <li> I love it, thank you!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Gave as gift to someone else</li>
            <li> love this smells great.</li>
            <li> This is a great smell that stays in my clothing several times after being washed.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money for all the compliments that I receive.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Very lasting fragrance. Works wonderful with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted this from the local store.  I was able to get them here and save money.  My wife already likes this perfume, so saving money was a bonus.</li>
            <li> I have had several compliments on this perfume, it is my favorite. This is always a special gift from my husband.</li>
            <li> Wife liked it so I am happy. Packing was good. Bottle looks good ... don&#x27;t know what else to say :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching all over for this scent and was thrilled to find it. Price was fab and shipped brand new, unopened in psckage.</li>
            <li> I love love love this perfume! It has been my signature scent for the past three years.&lt;br /&gt;This scent makes a statement but it&#x27;s not too strong. It&#x27;s great for everyday wear or special occasions. I truly recommend it.</li>
            <li> this is a gift for my mom. she is glad to see it. she like the smell and i like the price. LOL</li>
            <li> I had purchased Beauty before, so this was a repeat purchase.  My wife loves all the CK scents, so when I originally took a chance on this one, it was a pretty safe bet.  She loves it...so, I love it!!</li>
            <li> Someone at work had this on and I really liked the fragrance was told I could get at Boston Store and come to find out it has been discontinued by them.</li>
            <li> Great perfume.  Both my wife and I love the smell.  Bold, but still refreshing.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with Beauty!</li>
            <li> I received more compliments on this than any other. I need another bottle!</li>
            <li> Calvin Klein Beauty arrived very fast from the seller. It was brand new and in a nice package. No problems with communication and I just love the scent, it has a citrus undertone. All in all, great product!</li>
            <li> Good fragrance, good smell, I recommend it, you will feel fresh, and receives compliments are good, comes in good condition, well packaged. Thank You. I would buy again</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this and was thrilled at the price for under $40.00. Wonderful scent and design. So happy to own</li>
            <li> Boy did I ever score some major brownie points on this purchase. My wife loves it, I love it and the price is right!</li>
            <li> An amazing flowery scent!</li>
            <li> I am pretty sensitive to scents so rarely do I pick a new one. I cannot wear any other Calvin Klein scents - they are either too floral, too musky, too .....smelly. This one though is just wonderful. That perfect balance between spicy and feminine.</li>
            <li> I got it for her ...she love it</li>
            <li> Calvin Klein Beauty 3.4 ounce spray is a great fragrance. It&#x27;s light and yet seems to last the day. Not overly sweet.</li>
            <li> Tested fragrances in department stores to decide what I liked before purchacing online. This Beauty is OK, but it just doesn&#x27;t smell the same as in the stores. Oh well</li>
            <li> Great clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find this! They no longer are selling it in stores. It is one of my favorites!!!</li>
            <li> This was a great price for this size bottle. I love this perfume and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT! Quick shipped and same as in store but way more reasonable. I&#x27;ll be doing it again for sure. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I love it and people I don&#x27;t know come up to me to tell me that I smell good, or nice, or exquisite.</li>
            <li> The same product in Marshalls and TJ Maxx was 25% more expensive. I got a good bargain with this perfume.</li>
            <li> really like the smell; but wife says it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the tester she tried at the Calvin Klein store  -- she even asked me if i got her a knockoff! I assured her it wasn&#x27;t (oh, please, Amazon, let it be so!!!)</li>
            <li> Just loved it..smell so nice..its nt so strong..bt so nice..light nice smell,which i m using everyday. stay for long time..:) totally worth my money..:)</li>
            <li> First time I tried Calvin Klein.  Didn&#x27;t have that heavy and harsh scent that many famous scents have.  Mostly use Musk Oils.  But gave myself a little gift.  It was a softer scent but didn&#x27;t last long at all.  I will pass it down to a Granddaughter who is 22.  Alway hear so much about Calvin Klein and was a little bit dissappointed.  But again it was not harsh or too heavy a scent.  Will give it away.</li>
            <li> I am using this perfume a few years. One I bought in Duty Free and liked so much the fresh smell, stay long- whole day, all my friends were asking what is the perfume.  Another one I did order from Calvin Klein directly was the same - great smell. This one which I ordered does not seams to be the same??? It is very strong smell, I am not sure I will order some perfumes online.</li>
            <li> Love it.  So glad if pundit here.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, not too overwhelming, and quite pleasant.  Generously-sized bottle, too!</li>
            <li> Smells AWESOME! My wife LOVES IT!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the smell!! &amp;#60;3</li>
