            <li>Very pretty!</li>
            <li>i love this in the winter after a hot shower!</li>
            <li>Its hard to find products that work great, &amp; smell good...</li>
            <li>Product was sealed and fresh :)</li>
            <li>Sometimes I blend it with a light body lotion</li>
            <li>It has given my skin a much needed boost and makes my skin look amazing.</li>
            <li>the scent is divine, and may enjoy using it knowing i&#x27;m nourishing my skin and not slathering toxins on it and into my body...</li>
            <li>I have asthma, which is often triggered by perfumey smells, so this is perfect and light and fruity, making it one of the few scents I can tolerate.</li>
            <li>Very nice scent and stays on a long time.  </li>
            <li>No joke, this smells delicious but you will not only attract fellow friends to sniff your lovely glossy arms, but also every single insect within sniffing distance.</li>
            <li>Smells fabulous,not too sweet.</li>
            <li>I loved the scent and was pleasantly surprised that this oil actually felt thicker than most oils I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The initial smell is a bit strong, but the oil is great for message, and leaves a pleasant smell behind.</li>
            <li>Luscious apricot fragrance that makes skin so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>My skin was soft for 2 days after my massage, and the smell was really refreshing and yummy.</li>
            <li>I first purchased after having this massaged on hands and arms during a spa treatment and then quickly found it here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff, very subtle apricot fragrance, safe to use all over your body.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use after my showers, as it really makes my skin feel soft, and I love the apricot oil along with the fact that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li>really like the scent and dries quickly</li>
            <li>Plus I really love the pleasing light apricot scent, unlike Palmers and other body oils.</li>
            <li>Best oil I have ever used, keeps the skin moisturized until the next day, smells amazing, absorbs SO AMAZING almost completely within 5 minutes, truly remarkable product, my only qualm is that the cap opens to easy because only within a week of purchasing the ENTIRE content of the oil spilled out into my bad...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time buying a &#x27;body&#x27; product by Eminence</li>
            <li>(I use MANY facial products) and I really like it!</li>
            <li>I use it when I am staying home for the day and it keeps my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I mostly use this as a anti-aging product (although I&#x27;m only 24 &amp; dnt</li>
            <li>I love the way it sinks into my skin so quickly.</li>
            <li>I use this body oil in the winter when my skin is more dry .</li>
            <li>Expensive for what you get, however this is a nice light oil that absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I put it on my body after I lightly towel dry after my shower.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This has come in handy with other apricot scented bath products that do not have enough fragrance.  </li>
            <li>- its got other natural healing and moisturizing ingredients that make my skin feel silky smooth and look positively glowing.  </li>
            <li>Really does leave skin soft.</li>
            <li>and this really makes my skin fragrant and feel supple and natural.</li>
            <li>My wife uses this every morning and it helps to keep her skin very very soft.</li>
            <li>Since I have dry skin, I&#x27;ve tried absolutely everything (mineral oil, flaxseed, sesame, rapeseed, etc.)</li>
            <li>Worked on smoothning on the the first day not the marks but few weeks on and off</li>
            <li>It smells divine (doesn&#x27;t last too long though) and keeps my skin moisturized and soft.</li>

            <li> Although I did get sick of the scent pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It seems to dry out my skin after awhile.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dry skin</li>
            <li> it has worked on my dry arms where even prescription products didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> This helps with my dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it for my dry skin all over,right after the shower</li>
            <li> but usually I apply directly.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not strong -- it is barely there.  </li>
            <li> and I just can&#x27;t afford to purchase again, so be careful when transporting it.</li>
            <li> I rub it over wet skin in the shower to seal in moisture.  </li>
            <li> Only wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but it&#x27;s such a treat.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but smells diving  </li>
            <li> I almost started crying it was so upsetting</li>
            <li> I use this as an everyday moisturizer in place of lotion.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t been doing it everyday but works try it</li>
            <li> I use it every few days, and find that the softness lasts throughout the day, as does the scent.</li>
            <li> I live in northern New England where the winters are brutal.  </li>
            <li> Does not leave an oil slick on my skin at all.</li>
            <li> + the oil is every expensive</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t linger or anything I just got bored of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted!!</li>

            <li> My favorite body oil!</li>
            <li> Perfect! Product was sealed and fresh :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time buying a &#x27;body&#x27; product by Eminence (I use MANY facial products) and I really like it! I use it on my legs instead of lotion...and it STAYS longer, makes my legs look nice! I&#x27;ll be buying again for sure!</li>
            <li> Really does leave skin soft. I can&#x27;t smell the scent everyone raved about, could be my nose though! I love the way it sinks into my skin so quickly. Does not leave an oil slick on my skin at all. I put it on my body after I lightly towel dry after my shower. I use all the Eminence body products. The Monoi night treatment for body smells divine and works great!</li>
            <li> Best oil I have ever used, keeps the skin moisturized until the next day, smells amazing, absorbs SO AMAZING almost completely within 5 minutes, truly remarkable product, my only qualm is that the cap opens to easy because only within a week of purchasing the ENTIRE content of the oil spilled out into my bad... I almost started crying it was so upsetting + the oil is every expensive and I just can&#x27;t afford to purchase again, so be careful when transporting it.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but smells diving  Good for a couple&#x27;s night in for massages!</li>
            <li> Since I have dry skin, I&#x27;ve tried absolutely everything (mineral oil, flaxseed, sesame, rapeseed, etc.) but for me this apricot body oil is the best.  I first purchased after having this massaged on hands and arms during a spa treatment and then quickly found it here at Amazon. And it&#x27;s not just apricot oil - its got other natural healing and moisturizing ingredients that make my skin feel silky smooth and look positively glowing.  Sometimes I blend it with a light body lotion but usually I apply directly.  It has given my skin a much needed boost and makes my skin look amazing. Plus I really love the pleasing light apricot scent, unlike Palmers and other body oils. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing.  It&#x27;s a very lightly scented oil that I use just before stepping out of the shower.  The scent stays with me for most of the day.  Keeps my skin moisturized for 24 hours.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I rub it over wet skin in the shower to seal in moisture.  I live in northern New England where the winters are brutal.  This oil treatment means I do not have to apply lotion.  The scent is not strong -- it is barely there.  It will not clash with fragrances.</li>
            <li> The apricot scent is very nice, but I do not think it keeps the moisture in very well. It seems to dry out my skin after awhile.</li>
            <li> Luscious apricot fragrance that makes skin so soft and smooth! I use it under my moisturizer as well and love it.</li>
            <li> The initial smell is a bit strong, but the oil is great for message, and leaves a pleasant smell behind.</li>
            <li> Whoa!  Smells nice!  This has come in handy with other apricot scented bath products that do not have enough fragrance.  Add this to it and it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;heavenly.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, very subtle apricot fragrance, safe to use all over your body. I have naturally dry skin and this really makes my skin fragrant and feel supple and natural. No weird chemicals to irritate your skin, particularly delicate areas. Like manna from Heaven except only for your skin.</li>
            <li> Great product and super fast shipping.  My wife uses this every morning and it helps to keep her skin very very soft.</li>
            <li> Best oil ! Was using Burt&#x27;s bees apricot oil this is much better, smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use after my showers, as it really makes my skin feel soft, and I love the apricot oil along with the fact that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li> Love this! Smells great, like it much better than the sesame oil I use to use. I will order again.</li>

            <li> I love the Apricot body oil.  It has a delightful lingering light fragrance that is just lovely.  It is more expensive that what I like to pay though.  Don&#x27;t buy the champagne body oil.  It doesn&#x27;t smell very good.</li>
            <li> This helps with my dry itchy skin.  It absorbs well and has a pleasant light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Smells amazing!!</li>
            <li> This is is very nice and light.  It is not oily like some body oils.  It has a nice light fragrance and it makes the skin very good especially when using it in teh shower.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of a body oil. Smooth, moisturized, beautiful skin with a hint of fragrance. That is not how I would describe this body oils results. It does have a nice fragrance but it does not give me the moisture that I need. I need to alternate between this product and a cream to have enough moisture (and it&#x27;s not even winter yet).</li>
            <li> just got it,don&#x27;t  know yet how it is working</li>
            <li> I use this body oil in the winter when my skin is more dry . I like the smell and feel of it.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find products that work great, &amp; smell good... this one nailed em both! I mostly use this as a anti-aging product (although I&#x27;m only 24 &amp; dnt have a lot of wrinkles yet lol), I have reasons to believe this stuff is the fountain of youth in a bottle!! :D</li>
            <li> Love it ! Smells great and is amazing on my skin that is very dry. It&#x27;s the only body oil that I use.</li>
            <li> This product was used on me during a massage and it felt so good I had to get some for myself.  The scent is perfect.  It is not too strong but is very pleasant smelling.  I love how the lotion warms just by rubbing your hands together. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> No joke, this smells delicious but you will not only attract fellow friends to sniff your lovely glossy arms, but also every single insect within sniffing distance. You have been warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its moisturizing, smells nice, mix with water to get more for your money, no skin irritations for me.</li>
            <li> Great product! Love the smell! Love how it feels on my skin. However, it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after an amazing massage while on vacation. My skin was soft for 2 days after my massage, and the smell was really refreshing and yummy. I bought it through Amazon as soon as I got back, and prefer it to lotion. I use it every few days, and find that the softness lasts throughout the day, as does the scent. I have asthma, which is often triggered by perfumey smells, so this is perfect and light and fruity, making it one of the few scents I can tolerate. I&#x27;m addicted!!</li>
            <li> Expensive for what you get, however this is a nice light oil that absorbs quickly. It leaves your skin looking dewy.</li>
            <li> It has the most incredible fragrance!!!</li>
            <li> Silky body oil that&#x27;s not doesn&#x27;t leave over powering scent. Absorbs nicely,without a greasy feel. Smells fabulous,not too sweet. I use it for my dry skin all over,right after the shower</li>
            <li> the scent is divine, and may enjoy using it knowing i&#x27;m nourishing my skin and not slathering toxins on it and into my body...i love this in the winter after a hot shower!</li>
            <li> A good product, but probably will not reorder.  I like the fragrance, but prefer a lotion rather than the oil.</li>
