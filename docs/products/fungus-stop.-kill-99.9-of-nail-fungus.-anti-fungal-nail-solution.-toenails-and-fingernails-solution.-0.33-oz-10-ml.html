            <li>Effective.</li>
            <li>Having said that, when it runs out I will buy more, this will also be good for maintenance.</li>
            <li>Tastes wonderful on real pizza!&lt;br /&gt;:)toes, but to all my toes.</li>
            <li>Tastes wonderful on real pizza!&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li>Nothing was effective.</li>
            <li>you letter and a present - a good size bag of wonderful oregano spice.</li>
            <li>Also smelled very strong of oregano.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, just paint it on once a day</li>
            <li>Did not work for me, has very strong herbs smell that is overpowering.</li>
            <li>Best advice, stop it early!</li>
            <li>Very good product, responsible seller, they even put a gift in the package.</li>
            <li>Excellent product so far.</li>
            <li>This product proved to be an inexpensive, completely safe, and effective way to remove toe nail fungus from three nails</li>
            <li>This is the best anti-fungus that I have used so far.</li>
            <li>They are not yet cured but it is the best treatment I have used so far</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is all natural ingredients and again, that burn is the most wonderful kind of burn.  </li>
            <li>so far this is the best.</li>
            <li>I MISS having my feet looking pretty with nailpolish, and I don&#x27;t enjoy walking around in flip flops without perfectly pedicured feet.</li>
            <li>I MISS having my feet looking pretty with nailpolish, and I don&#x27;t enjoy walking around in flip flops without perfectly pedicured feet.</li>
            <li>, just smells like strong oregano to me!</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love!</li>
            <li>Smells great and feels like its working on the first try.</li>
            <li>Arrived well packaged, with good info and gift, and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, I received a bag of oily (in a really great way) oregano for cooking.</li>
            <li>It did come with a free bag of oregano which I love !</li>
            <li>I have been battling toe nail fungus for many years now</li>
            <li>so you feel safe using it</li>
            <li>And nails look better.</li>
            <li>My toe nails are looking healthy.</li>
            <li>Im glad I did-</li>
            <li>The seller is also amazing, I received a free organic oregano sample from Greece.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased and will order another bottle to keep on hand.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have tried many many things and nothing</li>
            <li>but I think the soaking is doing more to fight it than this.  </li>
            <li>But, I figured I had tried so many things and nothing worked why not try this stuff.</li>
            <li>It feels nice and smooth applying it.</li>
            <li>Apply this product after the bath while the skin/nail is softened so it absorbs the treatment better.</li>
            <li>You should be on your way to healthy nails in no time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am SO GLAD I did.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I can deal with it given the outstanding results.</li>
            <li>I am really glad I found this product</li>
            <li>A phenomenal product.</li>
            <li>but i think its getting better</li>
            <li>Will not know for sure until the nail grows out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is my favorite product.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products with prescriptions and so many over the counter</li>
            <li>and I know you will love it too.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>so it was able to be cut with nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>I am of course satisfied with on going results...</li>
            <li>I hope that in a couple of months I have better news.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using it once a day just to be sure.</li>
            <li>Now my nails are growing much better.</li>
            <li>I continue to use the product until my nail are healthy again</li>
            <li>product was impressive on my initial use.</li>
            <li>It has been about 3 weeks and his toes look better than they have in years.</li>
            <li>He is really pleased.</li>
            <li>Customer service was 5 stars for sure......  </li>
            <li>I am glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy in years.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be working better than so called anti fungus medicine .</li>
            <li>This is one of many that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a sure fire solution for that</li>
            <li>HAVE TRIED MANY OVER THE COUNTER LIQUIDS AND NONE OF THEM WORK.</li>
            <li>I also started doing it after I got out of the shower, because I read somewhere that having your nail be softer (after showering or swimming) allows it to absorb better.</li>
            <li>A truly outstanding product.</li>
            <li>The oil moisturizes the nail giving them a healthy appearance</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s clearly better than when I started.  </li>
            <li>Would probably work better...</li>
            <li>Product works wonders and I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better to cure my toenail fungus.</li>
            <li>Love it love</li>
            <li>it love it. :)</li>
            <li>I got a real good pedicurist and had with her toghether a fight against fungal infestation about the last 5 years.....</li>
            <li>Will reorder for sure if this problem ever happens again.  </li>
            <li>have battled  toe nail fungus for most of my life, and I will be keeping a bottle of this product on hand at all times from now on.  </li>
            <li>more than expect,amazing.satisfy</li>
            <li>Kerasal works MUCH better, I threw this away.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to thank him, for having such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Well, after 3 months of dedicated use, I am pleased to report that this stuff works.  </li>
            <li>Application twice a day is better than just once.  </li>
            <li>and that the smell was overwhelming.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, the question of whether or not wearing nailpolish is okay or not while using this???</li>
            <li>All Zane Hellas products are of the highest quality and highest effectiveness - most probably in the world.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I purchase this product for the reviews that it received, hoping that I would be another satisfied customer</li>
            <li>I have been through more anti fungal remedies/medicines than I can count.  </li>
            <li>Nothing seemed to change the appearance or fix the problem, so I decided to order this product, solely based on it being the top rated solution on amazon.</li>
            <li>After using this for 4 weeks now, I can better describe its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>The combination seems to work better than either one alone.   </li>
            <li>I will keep you posted for more results</li>
            <li>and soon I will be able to wear sandles without hiding&lt;br</li>
            <li>My nails look and feel much better.</li>
            <li>but it just made my nails LOOK better.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel ok.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of Oregano as well as most herbs and spices.</li>
            <li>My toe nails look better.</li>
            <li>Ok</li>
            <li>here&#x27;s my verdict after 1 month of use: IT&#x27;S OKAY.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easier and more convenient to use.</li>
            <li>This does even more for the toenail fungus that you get under the nail.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the burn that says relief in so many ways.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and will be ordering again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The strong is also very very strong...</li>
            <li>My order got here with pretty good timing.</li>
            <li>Product shipped quickly and was nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>Still, mild discoloration remains that should have grown out at this stage, if this product was that effective.</li>
            <li>Excellent product; however, the two bottles that were shipped within a single bubble-wrap envelope had leaked during shipment from its origin in Greece.  </li>
            <li>I think it is still to early to say it is a perfect medication for the problem, but, I am willing to buy another bottle to keep this working.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>My nails have grown out, and really look  good.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much I&#x27;ll be ready for the summer!!! :)</li>
            <li>Positive vibes!!!</li>
            <li>This product comes from Greece and it arrived very quickly - just 10 days after I ordered it.</li>
            <li>The product came very quickly.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s so happy and relieved, as he&#x27;s tried so many different medicines and nothing has worked...until now!</li>
            <li>Arrived fast, smells nice and came with a free gift!</li>
            <li>This stuff is STRONG.</li>
            <li>The product itself is STRONG.</li>
            <li>The smell was way to strong.  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t like its smell which is a bit strong.</li>
            <li>It is strong also because all the death nail fall off within days of using the oil.</li>
            <li>smells too strong oregano.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t get over how strongly it smells of oregano...</li>
            <li>The smell of this stuff is really strong of Oregano.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recall if I put my sneakers on if the smell is still that strong</li>
            <li>within 5-6 days I started noticing the nail becoming clear; it has been 2 weeks since I started using it and the nail is about 70% normal, incredible!!!</li>
            <li>it &#x27;worked fine&#x27;.....</li>
            <li>I have an extremely mild case of toenail fungus, it worsened!</li>
            <li>My toenail fungus (I know...not the most pleasant topic, but we&#x27;re all in the same boat here)</li>
            <li>At this point I am giving the product a 4star review but most certainly see a huge improvement!</li>
            <li>Thorough instructions, easy to apply, and smells like fresh herbs!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nearly everything and this works best and is by far the easiest to use.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It came with a free gift.</li>
            <li>So this didn&#x27;t work for me, but I would still recommend trying it based on the success that many people seem to have had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it on a few of my toenails and the results are just as impressive.</li>
            <li>Also came with a free sample of oregano to put on my food  </li>
            <li>must admit that, I might be having advanced toe fungus.</li>
            <li>When my item was delivered I also got a free gift of oregano.</li>
            <li>This product seemed to fit the bill</li>
            <li>I would expect that a 30 day treatment will make both of my toes looking fantastic.  </li>
            <li>So I tried this stuff because it was cheap in spite of the fact that I have never believed in</li>
            <li>It does work, and it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, I have ordered a second bottle to share with family.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would say this is definitely worth giving a shot (much better and safer than going to the podiatrist and getting a pill that can screw up your liver.)</li>
            <li>When it did arrive there was a free sample of oregano (which has nothing to do with the product</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Would work the best by removing as much of the fungus infected nail as possible before using this product.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So, far it&#x27;s working good.</li>
            <li>You made my life a whole lot more enjoyable again with this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural, so I feel good about using it.</li>
            <li>Zane Hellas sent a free gift in my package of dried Oregano which is delicious!  </li>
            <li>It really works!!!  </li>
            <li>This really works!!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sorry folks, I&#x27;ve got no other good advice rather than visiting a doc to get oral medication or a compounded liquid prescription, if you want something</li>
            <li>I am already seeing significant improvement.</li>
            <li>But so worth the wait!</li>
            <li>This company is by far the most professional I have experienced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m two weeks in  and already see a difference,  I&#x27;m so excited.</li>
            <li>And the small gift was wonderful as well!</li>
            <li>-- it now  takes a close look to see the difference between the originally infected and uninfected nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Original review</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to go ahead and order my 2nd bottle now :o)</li>
            <li>Will purchase more in the future for sure!</li>
            <li>Once I start seeing a significant difference I will update my review.</li>
            <li>cause I got too excited.</li>
            <li>Excess fungal infected nail was filed off, and then scrubbed clean with a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>so glad and appreciative that today&#x27;s medicine technology are so advancing, I can treat my fungal nail in such an efficient way.</li>
            <li>I was able to effectively record nail growth as I had a pin dot mark (some form of fungus, I assume) halfway up my big toe.</li>
            <li>I used this nightly before bed, and after 3-4 months my nail is growing out cleanly.  </li>
            <li>would recommend the product to somebody with a mild toe fungus problem, but not for curing advanced toe fungus.</li>
            <li>you clean underneath your nailbeds  thoroughly each time you shower.  </li>
            <li>Before applying Fungus Stop, in case your toenail has already separated from the nail bed, clean under the nail, and remove the excess keratin that has built up.</li>
            <li>and/or clean under the toenail without washing your hands immediately afterwards with soap an water.</li>
            <li>So far I have not seen results, maybe required of more treatment time, I need more information</li>
            <li>It also works great on dry scaly skin on the bottom of my feet.</li>
            <li>Will give 5 stars if it works, overall I am happy right now.</li>
            <li>AND MY NAILS HAVE GROWN IN GREAT AND UNAFFECTED!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my large toe have toe nail fungus for most of my life, so when I tried&lt;</li>
            <li>Well packaged with a thank you letter, clear instructions and a nice sized sample of their oregano.</li>
            <li>It shipped way faster than it said it was so that was cool.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the free gift of oregano!</li>
            <li>Really seems to be working after more than a month.  </li>
            <li>Thanks fungus stop :)</li>
            <li>After 4 weeks the bottle is still 2/3 full, so no need to buy another.  </li>
            <li>It takes 12 mos for toe nails to grow in full so....</li>
            <li>Right after the first use I checked, I knew my condition wasn&#x27;t better</li>
            <li>The brush that comes with it makes application nice with no mess.</li>
            <li>is pretty strong, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li>At first, I was just putting it on the two toe nails in question, but now I&#x27;m using it on the others as well since fungus can spread easily.</li>
            <li>I have been very neglectful in using this &amp;#34;Fungus Stop&amp;#34; and much to my delight and surprise my toenails are much better!  </li>
            <li>Love it and so far it seems to be working just fine</li>
            <li>The other one is clearing up to the point that I am happy to go barefoot now.  </li>
            <li>so i dont have a mild case.</li>
            <li>So happy to finally find something that works and works fast.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and</li>
            <li>Started working quite quickly.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very happy with the product, just can&#x27;t give it a 5 because it has yet to totally resolve the problem.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect a quick result.  </li>
            <li>and how do you get it to adequately absorb in and</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how quickly it arrived, even faster than some USA shipping I have had, and after two weeks of use I can say, without a doubt, it is working.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I guess this will work if you&#x27;re super patient....</li>
            <li>too much of them causes my Athlete&#x27;s Foot to happily come back.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the packet of dried Oregano - it&#x27;s wonderfully tasty!</li>
            <li>I switched to this product because it was all natural,  very strong and moisturizes while killing all the bacteria and fungus.</li>
            <li>: Love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and  seems effective, also enjoyed the free sample of dried  oregano that was inhcluded</li>
            <li>The scent is strong- pure oregano</li>
            <li>Wow, it does have a strong odor, but I thought, heck, I need something strong to kick this fungus&#x27; tail.  </li>
            <li>Ok so after 3 mos, the 2 toe nails on my left were looking better, but not the 5 ones on the right.</li>
            <li>Great product - I have used oregano oil in the past so was not disappointed, arrived quickly and quickly cleared up the issue</li>
            <li>Not to mention they sent me a small gift of extremely potent and delicious Greek Oregano.</li>
            <li>YOu have to be consistent with this!</li>
            <li>My toe nails are definitely looking better and it is so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Yes, your feet smell like oregano, but I just put it on at night and a quick morning shower washes it right off.</li>
            <li>I been using this product for more than 4 weeks, I was really exited and positive about it.</li>
            <li>I do have to complement the seller on their fast shipping and free oregano, ergo the two stars.</li>
            <li>Honest and goes the extra mile.</li>
            <li>From there, I was able to clear away the debris from under the nail.  </li>
            <li>all whit the healthy looks and natural color like the rest of my nails.</li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t use it in your bedroom unless you want to give your room a powerful, lingering stuffy pizza smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural ingredients make it safe.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a product worth trying.  </li>
            <li>I think it is useful.</li>
            <li>Just one application a day and wait 5-7 minutes for it to soak in vs. ReNew which requires twice a day application using fresh band-aids for each application, keeping the band-aids on all night and all day.  </li>
            <li>WORTH</li>
            <li>It made my big toenail look discolored and didn&#x27;t seem effective.  </li>
            <li>But it is worth it to suffer and fix the problem than to hide</li>
            <li>But it is worth it to suffer and fix the problem than to hide</li>
            <li>and I am seeing fresh nail growing out with NO traces to fungus.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit strong as far as the odor is concerned, but it worked quickly.  </li>
            <li>, I would say it&#x27;s very well worth the buy!</li>
            <li>My hope is, that my other problem nails will also look this good in time.</li>
            <li>The top of my nail is still discolored, but the lower half is completely clear and healthy looking, and as my nail continues to grow, all of the discoloration rises to the top where I can clip off the nail.</li>
            <li>and well i cant see nothing right now</li>
            <li>and I started using it right away after it arrived from Greece.  </li>
            <li>I am using it right now,don</li>
            <li>When I read that it kills 99.9% nail fungus, Lysol came to my mind right away.</li>
            <li>started using it right away</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this stuff at all, has a very strong smell like you have a greek salad on your toes.  </li>
            <li>Remember that fungus likes a moist, warm, dim place to live and thrive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After this regimen I was already starting to see results, but the Fungus Stop got things cleared up more quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been two weeks and the new growth of my nail is coming in fine.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed is how powerful the smell is.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend as I believe this is so far better than any chemical concoction 😎</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on week 3 and can already see new, fresh and clean nail growth from the nail bed.</li>
            <li>Its the best product out here to safely get rid of fungus or bad infections.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying to cure fungus on one of my big toes for the last 5 years, I saw this product on Amazon with great views and decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really find the answer, and in my opinion, if you have that layer of nailpolish on your nails then how is the application supposed to adequately absorb into the nail?</li>
            <li>This product is very useful, it helps kill fungus, you have just a little on your nails or toenails, this should help clear it up, make sure you clip your nail down till all the infected part is gone, then apply this to the affected area and let it soak in, if you use it consistently, you should start seeing progress within 3 weeks, make sure to repeat the steps above for best results.</li>
            <li>I have found that it is so much more effective if I remove as much of the effective nail as possible, as opposed to just filing it, which can be tricky, but given the nature of the loose nail, it wasn&#x27;t so much an issue to get most of it cut down.</li>
            <li>It has gone from super yellow (a la corn on the cob) to more of a pastel yellow (like a super light colored Easter egg).</li>
            <li>It works very fast.  </li>
            <li>Did exactly nothing to solve problem</li>
            <li>This stuff really works with fungus of the nails!  </li>
            <li>And I was consistent too.</li>
            <li>Started seeing results within the first week.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I see a difference in my toenail.  </li>
            <li>I CAN SEE IT WORKING, and I see a better nail future in my life.</li>
            <li>The prescription did not work for me I first bought from office.</li>
            <li>and I used this product a month ago for the first time.</li>
            <li>My left toe will take a while longer as it was covered more.</li>
            <li>For those discouraged by lack of results, it is my understanding the fungus must grow out first.</li>
            <li>After using consistently, I still don&#x27;t see results.</li>
            <li>You can really tell the difference between their oregano and ours (US)!</li>
            <li>initially got the fungus on my toe last year after my best friend stepped on my toe with her giant combat boots.</li>
            <li>This is the third week, I have 3 more before I can comment</li>
            <li>but this is my first experience with nail fungus...</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think it was doing anything</li>
            <li>My only advice is to make sure  </li>
            <li>This is the best deal for the price, too as I have only used a small portion of the bottle.</li>
            <li>and at first, they wanted to remove the toenail.  </li>
            <li>I first received and opened the package I noted the product is made in Greece and thought, oops - that probably is not&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can really see a difference!</li>
            <li>Since the product is an oil, obviously you will see a color change  immediately - into a more transparent-healthy looking toenail.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the reasonable price.    </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>First off, let me tell what I&#x27;ve done to my toenail fungus over the yrs.</li>
            <li>first month that I applied it, I did see a difference.</li>
            <li>They are starting to look healthy again.</li>
            <li>and I am happy to report he has no more whatever it was In his toenail!</li>
            <li>If you want a fine and natural toe and nail fungus product that is pure  </li>
            <li>This was really going to be my last try before I went to the podiatrist (which I am sure</li>
            <li>I kept going because what I did notice was while my nail looked much the same, I could tell the fungus was not replicating any more; something changed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a little over a month now, and I&#x27;m very, very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using 2x every day for over a month, and while I am making progress and my nails look much better, it does take a long time.</li>
            <li>I purchased this based on other reviews, and  So far so good..</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s some kind of spot where I got some days before a down falling tile on.</li>
            <li>After examining a number of options (including the new prescription medication that costs HUNDREDS of dollars) and reading the reviews here, I decided this was worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>The results are very decent.</li>
            <li>Less effective than tea tree oil for my nail fungus.</li>
            <li>it worked for me and its easy to use, shipping was going to take from 6 to 8 weeks but on my case it only took two weeks.</li>
            <li>It actually worked very quickly for me.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using oil of oregano on his toes but it must have not been strong enough.  </li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell of Oregano, which I don&#x27;t mind - it makes me hungry for pizza actually.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be certain it isn&#x27;t helping but the soaking made a rapid improvement.</li>
            <li>While it did take a while to come in, and has certainly taken a while to work (through no fault of</li>
            <li>All new nail growth is smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>Lots of positive reviews and recommendations on German AMAZON but that oil isn&#x27;t available at the moment.....  </li>
            <li>Great product my husband had one toenail that started looking a little yellow</li>
            <li>but im very optimistic of the results.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>They are the real deal.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for your service</li>
            <li>This item arrived much faster than the 3 week quote.</li>
            <li>be patient,it really does work.</li>
            <li>This is really working on my toenail fungus.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>This thing really works.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>I can not say this will work completely but worth a try.</li>
            <li>and I hope one day I can give my thanks to you in person when I travel to Greece.</li>
            <li>really works.</li>
            <li>Fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>Havent noticed a real change</li>
            <li>Well, it really works.</li>
            <li>As you can see really fast shipping.</li>
            <li>THANKS, ZANE HELLAS</li>
            <li>Despite continual use of this product, much of the fungus has returned.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really hoping it works.</li>
            <li>This stuff has really made a difference</li>
            <li>Nails didn&#x27;t get worse and it smells great,</li>
            <li>Works fast.</li>
            <li>Priced reasonably and their service is good.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>It has not worworked as fast as I thought it would...</li>
            <li>This really does work.</li>
            <li>THANKS ZANE HELLAS</li>
            <li>Seeing fast results, I have been using for two weeks on a toenail.</li>
            <li>Before I used Vicks vapor rub and covered with a bandaid for 2 months without much change.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The product has an unusual pungent odor that dissipates within 25 to 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that it seems to really work.  </li>
            <li>I was about ready to try taking the anti-fungal pills until my dermatologist said they would not work for toenails.  </li>
            <li>I think this really works.</li>
            <li>stuff and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it, the whole nail was coming off.  </li>
            <li>I really hope it works.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Packaged well and fairly fast shipping, but it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I feel that I caught it fast, and the people who say that they can&#x27;t rid their fungus</li>
            <li>The smell is a gentle oregano scent that does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work and had hi hopes after reading all these reviews however I have seen no improvement</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li>This is really work</li>
            <li>I was using Tea Tree Oil straight before.</li>
            <li>Ok....so I&#x27;ve waited a whole month of use of this before I decided to write this review.  </li>
            <li>I wish this product was available in a bigger bottle with a roll-on applicator for doing the bottom of your feet.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work and works very well.  </li>
            <li>really works.</li>
            <li>this works fast too.</li>
            <li>- the toenail has grown out significantly and it is apparent that the new growth is fungus-free!</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised at how quickly my nail infection was cured, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I do strongly suggest though to file your nail before using this, even lightly if there&#x27;s no more thickness to be filed.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t clear up right away; I think the product needs time and nightly applications to get to the root of the problem.</li>
            <li>So, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll buy this item again, but I am so pleased, that I am going to look into other products they carry.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product daily for 3 weeks and do see a significant difference on my fingernail.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m at now, letting the normal nail grow out!  </li>
            <li>Other foot lotion and moisturizer with peppermint are ok but</li>
            <li>Now I tried that oil and have seen even right behind the first days that there has been some kind of &#x27;brightness&#x27; that I even thought it might be helpful.</li>
            <li>Be patient apply daily to clean filed nails.</li>
            <li>Also clean your bathroom floors and shower regularly.  </li>
            <li>my left big toe, the discoloration has pretty much disappeared and the toe looks healthy and is growing normally.</li>
            <li>my left big toe, the discoloration has pretty much disappeared and the toe looks healthy and is growing normally.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU FOR BELIEVE AGAIN IN THE TRULY GOOD PRODUCTS THAT ONLY COMES FROM MOTHER EARTH and the techniques developed only so far in Europe.</li>
            <li>Way better than the other high priced products.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think you should give it a try, because it&#x27;s free of hormones and works better than other natural costly remedies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been applying this to both toes daily for about 2 months now and slowly but surely, the fungus toenail is growing out and the healthy toenail is growing in.</li>
            <li>The left corner of mytoenail is starting to grow promising, healthy.</li>
            <li>So far, does the job really well!</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad at all, it smells as if I am cooking an Italian dinner, but not for my toe.</li>
            <li>Brittle, dry, jagged nails are now smooth and healthier looking and feeling.</li>
            <li>Two weeks with this and healthy toenail has grown out half way.</li>
            <li>and I only have a mild case of nail fungus.</li>
            <li>I didnt expect such quick results</li>
            <li>After only four (4) applications, I have seen a tremendous mark of improvement.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the main reason I gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I read tons of reviews and the main things that stuck out were people complaining that they had &amp;#34;feetza&amp;#34; (feet that smelled like pizza)</li>
            <li>When I noticed a yellow and disfigured lump on my toenail, I suspected the fungus, but wasn&#x27;t sure because it didn&#x27;t cover the entire nail, like I&#x27;ve seen on others.</li>
            <li>or I may see if I can cut this stuff with another Essential Oil with the same properties and a better smell.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>This is the only one that has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I used ALL of mine in high hopes that just maybe...just maybe it would take it all to get rid of the fungus..</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the medicine and this seller.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for nail fungus.</li>
            <li>Currently, the next time I clip my toenails, my right toe will be completely fungus free.</li>
            <li>I give it a little more time to kick in before I could say if it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li>Just because you still see discoloration on your nail after 4 weeks does NOT mean the product isn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li>Achieved better results from OTC products sold by large and small retailers.</li>
            <li>So far it has done absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>fast service from Greece seems to work early days</li>
            <li>The shipment too longer than expected, so they decided not to charge me for the product, but in addition, they sent  me additional quantity again free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As few drugs are able to penetrate the nail.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure after a few weeks the discoloration will be gone.  </li>
            <li>Obviously, people have had success but not me.</li>
            <li>I honestly think it has helped with the smaller toe nails but the big toe nail is still yellow but seems to be getting clearer</li>
            <li>We have used this for 2 months now, and she says it is allowing her toenail t recover and look normal, I agree.</li>
            <li>It took a few months of  every day use, but this product, unlike so many others that I have tried, got the job done.  </li>
            <li>If you have ever dealt with that burning itch that comes with cracked toes, from althetes foot, that no matter how hard you scratch or twist, it still drives you mad with the itching, I put this stuff on and got that burn, they mentioned, and it was the most wonderful burn</li>
            <li>That alone made me feel ok about my purchase because it made me less conscious.</li>
            <li>WOW, I hadn&#x27;t seen a normal nail on that toe in 2 years!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it was fungus until recently, despite having issues with my toes right after the pedicure.</li>
            <li>Two toenails on my left foot, and all 5 toenails on the right.</li>
            <li>I gotta try especially after reading all these positive reviews!</li>
            <li>and I can see my new nail growing out</li>
            <li>My husband HATES the smell, but he will live..</li>
            <li>The directions say to use every day for a month, however being a new mother of two babies there were days I forgot to do it.  </li>
            <li>I thought a new nail would be growing underneath</li>
            <li>/&gt;this, within a couple of days, I could already see it regrowing a new toe</li>
            <li>I suck at getting into new habits</li>
            <li>We have a new term in our house.</li>
            <li>It was only after using that product for a few days, that I read the micro-print label under a magnifying glass and discovered that it was \\&quot;...not effective for scalp or nails.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Again, I am very sensitive to smell so it may not bother others.</li>
            <li>and it looks like in two weeks I will be clear of this fungus!</li>
            <li>My nails are clear and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li>To answer a question by another potential customer:  You can use Fungus stop over your pretty pedicure.  </li>
            <li>Like it so far, but have not completed it yet!</li>
            <li>I have used many fungus killer in the past</li>
            <li>The other is making significant progress.</li>
            <li>I am currently on my third week of using this product and it appears to be in the first stage of working.  </li>
            <li>Still to early to tell!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 33 years old and my toenails almost look 22 again!  </li>
            <li>First time I used my toe got sore and turned red.  </li>
            <li>Like the first, the affected part of the second nail is growing out and gradually getting trimmed off.</li>
            <li>It has the exact same effect of Oreganol Oil.</li>
            <li>If the nail is clear with new growth below the discolored area, then be patient and keep applying the product.</li>
            <li>I have been doing so for about a month now, the first infection is entirely clear and the second infection is not spreading.</li>
            <li>First off wanted to say that shipping was much faster than expected.</li>
            <li>so I can not really sasay how quickly it should have worked...</li>
            <li>In just a few months, this inexpensive and easy to apply liquid has completely cured the toenail fungus and I am going to order another bottle to keep on hand in case the ailment returns.</li>
            <li>and sometimes I add gold Listerine) and cut the nail down so that only clear healthy nails reamin.</li>
            <li>Like pure oregano only about 10 times stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had been using tea tree oil twice a day every day for more than 3 months with little to no improvement of a fungal infection on both big toenails.</li>
            <li>I received about a week and an half ago and have seen significant improvement in nails.</li>
            <li>The product comes all the way from Greece and the merchant included a nice little sample of Greek oregano that my wife actually used in a dish.  </li>
            <li>and it looks clear.  </li>
            <li>and you will see your toenails begin to clear</li>
            <li>This will so so relieve immediate discomfort and will help clear up that fungus.</li>
            <li>and I would guess that I am about clear</li>
            <li>After just one week the fungus feelers have disappeared and the naik ends are clear again.</li>
            <li>and I can see clear toenails.</li>
            <li>Made from natural ingredients</li>
            <li>After 1 week seeing much improvement but had the fungus for years so monitoring for the next couple weeks..</li>
            <li>early days but seems to be working,only in week one.</li>
            <li>So far I feel it is benefiting, but this process takes time.</li>
            <li>so as far as I am concerned...</li>
            <li>That is really helping and it is not such a pain.  </li>
            <li>like how natural this product is.  </li>
            <li>tea tree oil and Epsom salts nightly to help get rid of this fungus and formerly was using OPI Nail Fungus treatment after (very drying).  </li>
            <li>advice for speeding up the foot fungus at home- exfoliate all soft skin off around the nails after a foot bath (with tea tree oil</li>
            <li>I was embarrassed and was at point of looking into medical fungus procedures, which are very costly.</li>
            <li>I have faith that this will work finally as at least my toenail is much better than when I started with problems.</li>
            <li>but I am going to recommend this product like the ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD that really cures the toenail fungus.</li>
            <li>but its a big difference than how it looked before I started using Fungus Stop and from the price of this product and the fast results</li>
            <li>The only OTC that really works.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been trying it long enough to give full review but so far no results.</li>
            <li>I had a very persistent case of nail fungus on one of my big toes.  </li>
            <li>I suspect it works by both the antimicrobial action of the oregano oil, and the fact that the oil suffocates the fungus.  </li>
            <li>Was hoping for it to work as it is a natural product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for about 3 weeks now and a marked improvement to my toe fungus.</li>
            <li>At 57 years old, the fungus in my toe nails has been there for years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products over the last 2yrs without results and this is the only product that actually worked.</li>
            <li>Not as nearly deformed or warped.  </li>
            <li>After about two weeks one of my toe nails is almost completely cleared up.  </li>
            <li>Early on I also added cayenne pepper to the vinegar because some guy in Indonesia swore by it, so I thought, &amp;#34;What the heck - I&#x27;ll give that a shot, too.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>While deployed overseas, I developed some toenail fungus because of the humid conditions.  </li>
            <li>Fungus Stop worked very well for me and if you have the patience to keep applying it daily for&lt;br /&gt;one</li>
            <li>/&gt;Treating as directed, my nails started showing marked improvement in about three weeks.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend to give this oil a try, at least I was spending a lot more money for the chemicals than for two bottles of this.....  </li>
            <li>Smells like oregano and hasn&#x27;t done anything for my toenails so far.</li>
            <li>It has cleared up a problem toe, but it has not yet completely removed the problem.</li>
            <li>I bought this initially because I didn&#x27;t want to use chemicals that would be absorbing into my feet.</li>
            <li>I had a fungus it was in the early stages, probably within a time frame of 6 months when I would get my pedicure</li>
            <li>probably the ones complaining have sensitive noses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems to be working well so far</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been three weeks so far</li>
            <li>It takes time for the nail to grow out completely.  </li>
            <li>I have a ways to go, but nothing, nothing has produced the results this natural product has given me.</li>
            <li>never missing a day yet</li>
            <li>So we shall see.&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the commentary so far.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to be doing something.</li>
            <li>I have read a lot about the benefits of oregano oil and so far I like it.</li>
            <li>Finally, a naturally based product that works.</li>
            <li>AND AFTER TRIMMING THE AFFECTED NAIL BACK A FEW TIMES AND APPLYING THE PRODUCT 2-3 TIMES A DAY (MOST DAYS, ANYWAY)</li>
            <li>Worth the wait to arrive from Greece, although it did arrive sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li>I knew that it was nail fungus when near the end of the first month, the original affected nail had almost cleared up entirely, but I noticed a similar infection on another nail on my other foot.</li>
            <li>It does seem to be helping so far, albeit SLOWLY, but I am noticing quicker and better results with apple cider vinegar and baking soda and soaking my feet for 15-30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I read alot of good reviews, this actually made the situation worse.</li>
            <li>So far only some very slight improvement, hopefully more improvement with time.</li>
            <li>The price was right, especially considering it came all the way from Greece with Greek stamps on the envelope!</li>
            <li>Please know that I am a real person (and an English major!)</li>
            <li>so I just get half way full.</li>
            <li>When my bottle arrived, it leaked a bit, as the top didn&#x27;t screw down tight, but this stuff really works!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product has steadily worked over the last 3-4 months I&#x27;ve been using it, and now 2 out of 7 pretty badly infected toenails are about a third grown out with healthy nails clearly visible :) The other 5 (including a big toenail) look like they could take longer, but are certainly no worse than when I started applying this product.</li>
            <li>On my right foot, the discoloration is still slightly there and only on the upper right side does the nail seem to still be stubbornly growing irregularly still, but it is lessened from before I started.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On my right foot, the discoloration is still slightly there and only on the upper right side does the nail seem to still be stubbornly growing irregularly still, but it is lessened from before I started.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I applied this product 2x daily (2 bottles worth) and filed my nails back as far as possible and the fungus is still remains.</li>
            <li>Just this week it had traveled high enough up to clip.</li>
            <li>I was very diligent about applying it to my affected nail every day and allowing it to dry completely before putting on any shoes or socks.</li>
            <li>It seems good,but I don&#x27;t know how long the effect will be absolutely.</li>
            <li>NOT COMPLETELY GONE AFTER 6 WEEKS, BUT MUCH IMPROVED.</li>
            <li>A side note, Another thing that countered my impression of Fungus Stop was that the price is really reasonable which initially made me suspect since I had spent so much on medications already.</li>
            <li>If you have full blown fungus, it would also be helpful to get the fungus soap wash, it will be a long tedious process, but with time, it will get better.</li>
            <li>I bought this product and now the fungus has FINALLY cleared up and luckily for me, never spread to my other nails.</li>
            <li>we don&#x27;t live in the same town.....</li>
            <li>For thicker nails, such as toe nails, it takes a longer time to heal, but the progress is visible as the new nail coming out</li>
            <li>Your new &amp;#34;Feetza&amp;#34; Parlor is open for business!</li>
            <li>I have a mild toe fungus on a few toes</li>
            <li>HAVE NOT YET SEEN ANY MAJOR IMPROVEMENT.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After 2 weeks, major improvements showing, already.  </li>
            <li>Currently about 80% of the fungus on my big toe has cleared up, my toe nail seem to be growing at a faster pace than when the toe was completely covered in fungus, also the nail bed is not lifted anymore as prior to using this product almost the whole nail bed was lifted.</li>
            <li>I had two different types of fungus and both nails are clear now.  </li>
            <li>I have spent so much money on treatments and products.  </li>
            <li>It started as a blue dot under the nail, then it evolved into a complete fungal nail over the years.</li>
            <li>Thus I could completely control the &amp;#34;experiement&amp;#34; without outside factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used Fungus Stop once daily after showering for about a month before the Fungus had grown off the nail almost completely.</li>
            <li>To early to tell yet, I like only have to use it once a Day</li>
            <li>I have battled toenail fungus for over a year and tried numerous naturally based products.</li>
            <li>It made my toe nails look better but not great.</li>
            <li>She is on week 3 (daily regiment, some missed days), and has seen noticeable changes in appearance: all dry and brittle texture of skin and nail was given much needed nourishment and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>After trying everything OTC, I finally stumbled across this product and due to the reviews, reasonable cost, and desperation!</li>
            <li>I am very optimistic as I never saw the slightest improvement with other products in over 1 year.</li>
            <li>The vapors from the spilled solution is quite intense and is leaked onto other mail.</li>
            <li>From reading other reviews I am very hopeful.</li>
            <li>On my big toe especially, the new growth has come out about one third of the way and keeps getting clearer.</li>
            <li>excited to finally find a product that does what it says - I&#x27;ve tried most of the major ones, and they all without fail seemed to start off well, but after a few months the infection looked like it did at the beginning, and didn&#x27;t budge any further even with continued perseverance for months or sometimes</li>
            <li>Also, I have noticed that my toe does not seem to hurt like it use to before starting &amp;#34;Fungus Stop.&amp;#34;  So far, this is the only topical medication I have tried that seems to be doing anything to help clear up the fungus on my big toe; which I have had for years.  </li>
            <li>The nail needs a chance to grow and it took a solid year for my big toe to completely grow out.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t win :(</li>
            <li>In the first few days, I started seeing changes and by the time 2 weeks passed, I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>Far better than that expensive stuff you get in the pharmacy, that you use for years and still have the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Week 5, BINGO, I noticed it looked like the nail was lifting up, all that gross brown stuff was kind of puffed up and dried looking, so, I started pulling on it slowly and lifting it off.  </li>
            <li>I am just really grateful my athlete&#x27;s foot is gone and want to help other people who are suffering as I did!</li>
            <li>I even received a small sample of Greek oregano (complimentary with their shipment to explain the product).</li>
            <li>I was pretty skeptical, but thought it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>I am still using it in hopes that the nail will improve, but I&#x27;m disappointed especially since this product got such great reviews.  </li>
            <li>The black fungal dot took about 6 months to grow from a very tiny one to the whole toe nail.</li>
            <li>and I got this off of a blog I found while reading extensively online for various other success stories from other people all over the world.  </li>
            <li>Ok, left big toe, have been fighting a gross thick fungus nail for about 2 years; tried every over the counter product out there, no success at all.  </li>
            <li>I even cut my bad toe nail off as far as I could get it and even soaked my feet in very warm water to get my toenails softened up so this could get deep down in the nail..</li>
            <li>, soles of feet breakouts, secondary infections (within a day or so), helps shed the excess skin being produced, and the skin to be a little more supple during the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Effective.</li>
            <li> Having said that, when it runs out I will buy more, this will also be good for maintenance.</li>
            <li> Tastes wonderful on real pizza!&lt;br /&gt;:)toes, but to all my toes.</li>
            <li> Tastes wonderful on real pizza!&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> Nothing was effective.</li>
            <li> you letter and a present - a good size bag of wonderful oregano spice.</li>
            <li> Also smelled very strong of oregano.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, just paint it on once a day</li>
            <li> Did not work for me, has very strong herbs smell that is overpowering.</li>
            <li> Best advice, stop it early!</li>
            <li> Very good product, responsible seller, they even put a gift in the package.</li>
            <li> Excellent product so far.</li>
            <li> This product proved to be an inexpensive, completely safe, and effective way to remove toe nail fungus from three nails</li>
            <li> This is the best anti-fungus that I have used so far.</li>
            <li> They are not yet cured but it is the best treatment I have used so far</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is all natural ingredients and again, that burn is the most wonderful kind of burn.  </li>
            <li> so far this is the best.</li>
            <li> I MISS having my feet looking pretty with nailpolish, and I don&#x27;t enjoy walking around in flip flops without perfectly pedicured feet.</li>
            <li> I MISS having my feet looking pretty with nailpolish, and I don&#x27;t enjoy walking around in flip flops without perfectly pedicured feet.</li>
            <li> , just smells like strong oregano to me!</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love!</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels like its working on the first try.</li>
            <li> Arrived well packaged, with good info and gift, and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> On the positive side, I received a bag of oily (in a really great way) oregano for cooking.</li>
            <li> It did come with a free bag of oregano which I love !</li>
            <li> I have been battling toe nail fungus for many years now</li>
            <li> so you feel safe using it</li>
            <li> And nails look better.</li>
            <li> My toe nails are looking healthy.</li>
            <li> Im glad I did-</li>
            <li> The seller is also amazing, I received a free organic oregano sample from Greece.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased and will order another bottle to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have tried many many things and nothing</li>
            <li> but I think the soaking is doing more to fight it than this.  </li>
            <li> But, I figured I had tried so many things and nothing worked why not try this stuff.</li>
            <li> It feels nice and smooth applying it.</li>
            <li> Apply this product after the bath while the skin/nail is softened so it absorbs the treatment better.</li>
            <li> You should be on your way to healthy nails in no time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am SO GLAD I did.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I can deal with it given the outstanding results.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I found this product</li>
            <li> A phenomenal product.</li>
            <li> but i think its getting better</li>
            <li> Will not know for sure until the nail grows out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is my favorite product.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products with prescriptions and so many over the counter</li>
            <li> and I know you will love it too.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> so it was able to be cut with nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> I am of course satisfied with on going results...</li>
            <li> I hope that in a couple of months I have better news.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using it once a day just to be sure.</li>
            <li> Now my nails are growing much better.</li>
            <li> I continue to use the product until my nail are healthy again</li>
            <li> product was impressive on my initial use.</li>
            <li> It has been about 3 weeks and his toes look better than they have in years.</li>
            <li> He is really pleased.</li>
            <li> Customer service was 5 stars for sure......  </li>
            <li> I am glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy in years.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be working better than so called anti fungus medicine .</li>
            <li> This is one of many that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a sure fire solution for that</li>
            <li> HAVE TRIED MANY OVER THE COUNTER LIQUIDS AND NONE OF THEM WORK.</li>
            <li> I also started doing it after I got out of the shower, because I read somewhere that having your nail be softer (after showering or swimming) allows it to absorb better.</li>
            <li> A truly outstanding product.</li>
            <li> The oil moisturizes the nail giving them a healthy appearance</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s clearly better than when I started.  </li>
            <li> Would probably work better...</li>
            <li> Product works wonders and I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better to cure my toenail fungus.</li>
            <li> Love it love</li>
            <li> it love it. :)</li>
            <li> I got a real good pedicurist and had with her toghether a fight against fungal infestation about the last 5 years.....</li>
            <li> Will reorder for sure if this problem ever happens again.  </li>
            <li> have battled  toe nail fungus for most of my life, and I will be keeping a bottle of this product on hand at all times from now on.  </li>
            <li> more than expect,amazing.satisfy</li>
            <li> Kerasal works MUCH better, I threw this away.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to thank him, for having such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Well, after 3 months of dedicated use, I am pleased to report that this stuff works.  </li>
            <li> Application twice a day is better than just once.  </li>
            <li> and that the smell was overwhelming.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, the question of whether or not wearing nailpolish is okay or not while using this???</li>
            <li> All Zane Hellas products are of the highest quality and highest effectiveness - most probably in the world.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product for the reviews that it received, hoping that I would be another satisfied customer</li>
            <li> I have been through more anti fungal remedies/medicines than I can count.  </li>
            <li> Nothing seemed to change the appearance or fix the problem, so I decided to order this product, solely based on it being the top rated solution on amazon.</li>
            <li> After using this for 4 weeks now, I can better describe its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> The combination seems to work better than either one alone.   </li>
            <li> I will keep you posted for more results</li>
            <li> and soon I will be able to wear sandles without hiding&lt;br</li>
            <li> My nails look and feel much better.</li>
            <li> but it just made my nails LOOK better.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel ok.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of Oregano as well as most herbs and spices.</li>
            <li> My toe nails look better.</li>
            <li> Ok</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s my verdict after 1 month of use: IT&#x27;S OKAY.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easier and more convenient to use.</li>
            <li> This does even more for the toenail fungus that you get under the nail.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the burn that says relief in so many ways.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff and will be ordering again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The strong is also very very strong...</li>
            <li> My order got here with pretty good timing.</li>
            <li> Product shipped quickly and was nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> Still, mild discoloration remains that should have grown out at this stage, if this product was that effective.</li>
            <li> Excellent product; however, the two bottles that were shipped within a single bubble-wrap envelope had leaked during shipment from its origin in Greece.  </li>
            <li> I think it is still to early to say it is a perfect medication for the problem, but, I am willing to buy another bottle to keep this working.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> My nails have grown out, and really look  good.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much I&#x27;ll be ready for the summer!!! :)</li>
            <li> Positive vibes!!!</li>
            <li> This product comes from Greece and it arrived very quickly - just 10 days after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> The product came very quickly.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s so happy and relieved, as he&#x27;s tried so many different medicines and nothing has worked...until now!</li>
            <li> Arrived fast, smells nice and came with a free gift!</li>
            <li> This stuff is STRONG.</li>
            <li> The product itself is STRONG.</li>
            <li> The smell was way to strong.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like its smell which is a bit strong.</li>
            <li> It is strong also because all the death nail fall off within days of using the oil.</li>
            <li> smells too strong oregano.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get over how strongly it smells of oregano...</li>
            <li> The smell of this stuff is really strong of Oregano.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recall if I put my sneakers on if the smell is still that strong</li>
            <li> within 5-6 days I started noticing the nail becoming clear; it has been 2 weeks since I started using it and the nail is about 70% normal, incredible!!!</li>
            <li> it &#x27;worked fine&#x27;.....</li>
            <li> I have an extremely mild case of toenail fungus, it worsened!</li>
            <li> My toenail fungus (I know...not the most pleasant topic, but we&#x27;re all in the same boat here)</li>
            <li> At this point I am giving the product a 4star review but most certainly see a huge improvement!</li>
            <li> Thorough instructions, easy to apply, and smells like fresh herbs!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nearly everything and this works best and is by far the easiest to use.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> It came with a free gift.</li>
            <li> So this didn&#x27;t work for me, but I would still recommend trying it based on the success that many people seem to have had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on a few of my toenails and the results are just as impressive.</li>
            <li> Also came with a free sample of oregano to put on my food  </li>
            <li> must admit that, I might be having advanced toe fungus.</li>
            <li> When my item was delivered I also got a free gift of oregano.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to fit the bill</li>
            <li> I would expect that a 30 day treatment will make both of my toes looking fantastic.  </li>
            <li> So I tried this stuff because it was cheap in spite of the fact that I have never believed in</li>
            <li> It does work, and it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, I have ordered a second bottle to share with family.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would say this is definitely worth giving a shot (much better and safer than going to the podiatrist and getting a pill that can screw up your liver.)</li>
            <li> When it did arrive there was a free sample of oregano (which has nothing to do with the product</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Would work the best by removing as much of the fungus infected nail as possible before using this product.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So, far it&#x27;s working good.</li>
            <li> You made my life a whole lot more enjoyable again with this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural, so I feel good about using it.</li>
            <li> Zane Hellas sent a free gift in my package of dried Oregano which is delicious!  </li>
            <li> It really works!!!  </li>
            <li> This really works!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry folks, I&#x27;ve got no other good advice rather than visiting a doc to get oral medication or a compounded liquid prescription, if you want something</li>
            <li> I am already seeing significant improvement.</li>
            <li> But so worth the wait!</li>
            <li> This company is by far the most professional I have experienced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m two weeks in  and already see a difference,  I&#x27;m so excited.</li>
            <li> And the small gift was wonderful as well!</li>
            <li> -- it now  takes a close look to see the difference between the originally infected and uninfected nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Original review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to go ahead and order my 2nd bottle now :o)</li>
            <li> Will purchase more in the future for sure!</li>
            <li> Once I start seeing a significant difference I will update my review.</li>
            <li> cause I got too excited.</li>
            <li> Excess fungal infected nail was filed off, and then scrubbed clean with a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> so glad and appreciative that today&#x27;s medicine technology are so advancing, I can treat my fungal nail in such an efficient way.</li>
            <li> I was able to effectively record nail growth as I had a pin dot mark (some form of fungus, I assume) halfway up my big toe.</li>
            <li> I used this nightly before bed, and after 3-4 months my nail is growing out cleanly.  </li>
            <li> would recommend the product to somebody with a mild toe fungus problem, but not for curing advanced toe fungus.</li>
            <li> you clean underneath your nailbeds  thoroughly each time you shower.  </li>
            <li> Before applying Fungus Stop, in case your toenail has already separated from the nail bed, clean under the nail, and remove the excess keratin that has built up.</li>
            <li> and/or clean under the toenail without washing your hands immediately afterwards with soap an water.</li>
            <li> So far I have not seen results, maybe required of more treatment time, I need more information</li>
            <li> It also works great on dry scaly skin on the bottom of my feet.</li>
            <li> Will give 5 stars if it works, overall I am happy right now.</li>
            <li> AND MY NAILS HAVE GROWN IN GREAT AND UNAFFECTED!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my large toe have toe nail fungus for most of my life, so when I tried&lt;</li>
            <li> Well packaged with a thank you letter, clear instructions and a nice sized sample of their oregano.</li>
            <li> It shipped way faster than it said it was so that was cool.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the free gift of oregano!</li>
            <li> Really seems to be working after more than a month.  </li>
            <li> Thanks fungus stop :)</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks the bottle is still 2/3 full, so no need to buy another.  </li>
            <li> It takes 12 mos for toe nails to grow in full so....</li>
            <li> Right after the first use I checked, I knew my condition wasn&#x27;t better</li>
            <li> The brush that comes with it makes application nice with no mess.</li>
            <li> is pretty strong, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> At first, I was just putting it on the two toe nails in question, but now I&#x27;m using it on the others as well since fungus can spread easily.</li>
            <li> I have been very neglectful in using this &amp;#34;Fungus Stop&amp;#34; and much to my delight and surprise my toenails are much better!  </li>
            <li> Love it and so far it seems to be working just fine</li>
            <li> The other one is clearing up to the point that I am happy to go barefoot now.  </li>
            <li> so i dont have a mild case.</li>
            <li> So happy to finally find something that works and works fast.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and</li>
            <li> Started working quite quickly.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very happy with the product, just can&#x27;t give it a 5 because it has yet to totally resolve the problem.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect a quick result.  </li>
            <li> and how do you get it to adequately absorb in and</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how quickly it arrived, even faster than some USA shipping I have had, and after two weeks of use I can say, without a doubt, it is working.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I guess this will work if you&#x27;re super patient....</li>
            <li> too much of them causes my Athlete&#x27;s Foot to happily come back.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the packet of dried Oregano - it&#x27;s wonderfully tasty!</li>
            <li> I switched to this product because it was all natural,  very strong and moisturizes while killing all the bacteria and fungus.</li>
            <li> : Love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and  seems effective, also enjoyed the free sample of dried  oregano that was inhcluded</li>
            <li> The scent is strong- pure oregano</li>
            <li> Wow, it does have a strong odor, but I thought, heck, I need something strong to kick this fungus&#x27; tail.  </li>
            <li> Ok so after 3 mos, the 2 toe nails on my left were looking better, but not the 5 ones on the right.</li>
            <li> Great product - I have used oregano oil in the past so was not disappointed, arrived quickly and quickly cleared up the issue</li>
            <li> Not to mention they sent me a small gift of extremely potent and delicious Greek Oregano.</li>
            <li> YOu have to be consistent with this!</li>
            <li> My toe nails are definitely looking better and it is so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Yes, your feet smell like oregano, but I just put it on at night and a quick morning shower washes it right off.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for more than 4 weeks, I was really exited and positive about it.</li>
            <li> I do have to complement the seller on their fast shipping and free oregano, ergo the two stars.</li>
            <li> Honest and goes the extra mile.</li>
            <li> From there, I was able to clear away the debris from under the nail.  </li>
            <li> all whit the healthy looks and natural color like the rest of my nails.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t use it in your bedroom unless you want to give your room a powerful, lingering stuffy pizza smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural ingredients make it safe.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a product worth trying.  </li>
            <li> I think it is useful.</li>
            <li> Just one application a day and wait 5-7 minutes for it to soak in vs. ReNew which requires twice a day application using fresh band-aids for each application, keeping the band-aids on all night and all day.  </li>
            <li> WORTH</li>
            <li> It made my big toenail look discolored and didn&#x27;t seem effective.  </li>
            <li> But it is worth it to suffer and fix the problem than to hide</li>
            <li> But it is worth it to suffer and fix the problem than to hide</li>
            <li> and I am seeing fresh nail growing out with NO traces to fungus.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit strong as far as the odor is concerned, but it worked quickly.  </li>
            <li> , I would say it&#x27;s very well worth the buy!</li>
            <li> My hope is, that my other problem nails will also look this good in time.</li>
            <li> The top of my nail is still discolored, but the lower half is completely clear and healthy looking, and as my nail continues to grow, all of the discoloration rises to the top where I can clip off the nail.</li>
            <li> and well i cant see nothing right now</li>
            <li> and I started using it right away after it arrived from Greece.  </li>
            <li> I am using it right now,don</li>
            <li> When I read that it kills 99.9% nail fungus, Lysol came to my mind right away.</li>
            <li> started using it right away</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this stuff at all, has a very strong smell like you have a greek salad on your toes.  </li>
            <li> Remember that fungus likes a moist, warm, dim place to live and thrive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After this regimen I was already starting to see results, but the Fungus Stop got things cleared up more quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been two weeks and the new growth of my nail is coming in fine.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed is how powerful the smell is.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend as I believe this is so far better than any chemical concoction 😎</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on week 3 and can already see new, fresh and clean nail growth from the nail bed.</li>
            <li> Its the best product out here to safely get rid of fungus or bad infections.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying to cure fungus on one of my big toes for the last 5 years, I saw this product on Amazon with great views and decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really find the answer, and in my opinion, if you have that layer of nailpolish on your nails then how is the application supposed to adequately absorb into the nail?</li>
            <li> This product is very useful, it helps kill fungus, you have just a little on your nails or toenails, this should help clear it up, make sure you clip your nail down till all the infected part is gone, then apply this to the affected area and let it soak in, if you use it consistently, you should start seeing progress within 3 weeks, make sure to repeat the steps above for best results.</li>
            <li> I have found that it is so much more effective if I remove as much of the effective nail as possible, as opposed to just filing it, which can be tricky, but given the nature of the loose nail, it wasn&#x27;t so much an issue to get most of it cut down.</li>
            <li> It has gone from super yellow (a la corn on the cob) to more of a pastel yellow (like a super light colored Easter egg).</li>
            <li> It works very fast.  </li>
            <li> Did exactly nothing to solve problem</li>
            <li> This stuff really works with fungus of the nails!  </li>
            <li> And I was consistent too.</li>
            <li> Started seeing results within the first week.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I see a difference in my toenail.  </li>
            <li> I CAN SEE IT WORKING, and I see a better nail future in my life.</li>
            <li> The prescription did not work for me I first bought from office.</li>
            <li> and I used this product a month ago for the first time.</li>
            <li> My left toe will take a while longer as it was covered more.</li>
            <li> For those discouraged by lack of results, it is my understanding the fungus must grow out first.</li>
            <li> After using consistently, I still don&#x27;t see results.</li>
            <li> You can really tell the difference between their oregano and ours (US)!</li>
            <li> initially got the fungus on my toe last year after my best friend stepped on my toe with her giant combat boots.</li>
            <li> This is the third week, I have 3 more before I can comment</li>
            <li> but this is my first experience with nail fungus...</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it was doing anything</li>
            <li> My only advice is to make sure  </li>
            <li> This is the best deal for the price, too as I have only used a small portion of the bottle.</li>
            <li> and at first, they wanted to remove the toenail.  </li>
            <li> I first received and opened the package I noted the product is made in Greece and thought, oops - that probably is not&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can really see a difference!</li>
            <li> Since the product is an oil, obviously you will see a color change  immediately - into a more transparent-healthy looking toenail.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the reasonable price.    </li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> First off, let me tell what I&#x27;ve done to my toenail fungus over the yrs.</li>
            <li> first month that I applied it, I did see a difference.</li>
            <li> They are starting to look healthy again.</li>
            <li> and I am happy to report he has no more whatever it was In his toenail!</li>
            <li> If you want a fine and natural toe and nail fungus product that is pure  </li>
            <li> This was really going to be my last try before I went to the podiatrist (which I am sure</li>
            <li> I kept going because what I did notice was while my nail looked much the same, I could tell the fungus was not replicating any more; something changed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a little over a month now, and I&#x27;m very, very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using 2x every day for over a month, and while I am making progress and my nails look much better, it does take a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on other reviews, and  So far so good..</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s some kind of spot where I got some days before a down falling tile on.</li>
            <li> After examining a number of options (including the new prescription medication that costs HUNDREDS of dollars) and reading the reviews here, I decided this was worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> The results are very decent.</li>
            <li> Less effective than tea tree oil for my nail fungus.</li>
            <li> it worked for me and its easy to use, shipping was going to take from 6 to 8 weeks but on my case it only took two weeks.</li>
            <li> It actually worked very quickly for me.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using oil of oregano on his toes but it must have not been strong enough.  </li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell of Oregano, which I don&#x27;t mind - it makes me hungry for pizza actually.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be certain it isn&#x27;t helping but the soaking made a rapid improvement.</li>
            <li> While it did take a while to come in, and has certainly taken a while to work (through no fault of</li>
            <li> All new nail growth is smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> Lots of positive reviews and recommendations on German AMAZON but that oil isn&#x27;t available at the moment.....  </li>
            <li> Great product my husband had one toenail that started looking a little yellow</li>
            <li> but im very optimistic of the results.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> They are the real deal.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for your service</li>
            <li> This item arrived much faster than the 3 week quote.</li>
            <li> be patient,it really does work.</li>
            <li> This is really working on my toenail fungus.</li>
            <li> highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> This thing really works.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> I can not say this will work completely but worth a try.</li>
            <li> and I hope one day I can give my thanks to you in person when I travel to Greece.</li>
            <li> really works.</li>
            <li> Fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> Havent noticed a real change</li>
            <li> Well, it really works.</li>
            <li> As you can see really fast shipping.</li>
            <li> THANKS, ZANE HELLAS</li>
            <li> Despite continual use of this product, much of the fungus has returned.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really hoping it works.</li>
            <li> This stuff has really made a difference</li>
            <li> Nails didn&#x27;t get worse and it smells great,</li>
            <li> Works fast.</li>
            <li> Priced reasonably and their service is good.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> It has not worworked as fast as I thought it would...</li>
            <li> This really does work.</li>
            <li> THANKS ZANE HELLAS</li>
            <li> Seeing fast results, I have been using for two weeks on a toenail.</li>
            <li> Before I used Vicks vapor rub and covered with a bandaid for 2 months without much change.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The product has an unusual pungent odor that dissipates within 25 to 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that it seems to really work.  </li>
            <li> I was about ready to try taking the anti-fungal pills until my dermatologist said they would not work for toenails.  </li>
            <li> I think this really works.</li>
            <li> stuff and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it, the whole nail was coming off.  </li>
            <li> I really hope it works.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Packaged well and fairly fast shipping, but it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> I feel that I caught it fast, and the people who say that they can&#x27;t rid their fungus</li>
            <li> The smell is a gentle oregano scent that does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work and had hi hopes after reading all these reviews however I have seen no improvement</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li> This is really work</li>
            <li> I was using Tea Tree Oil straight before.</li>
            <li> Ok....so I&#x27;ve waited a whole month of use of this before I decided to write this review.  </li>
            <li> I wish this product was available in a bigger bottle with a roll-on applicator for doing the bottom of your feet.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work and works very well.  </li>
            <li> really works.</li>
            <li> this works fast too.</li>
            <li> - the toenail has grown out significantly and it is apparent that the new growth is fungus-free!</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised at how quickly my nail infection was cured, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I do strongly suggest though to file your nail before using this, even lightly if there&#x27;s no more thickness to be filed.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t clear up right away; I think the product needs time and nightly applications to get to the root of the problem.</li>
            <li> So, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll buy this item again, but I am so pleased, that I am going to look into other products they carry.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product daily for 3 weeks and do see a significant difference on my fingernail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at now, letting the normal nail grow out!  </li>
            <li> Other foot lotion and moisturizer with peppermint are ok but</li>
            <li> Now I tried that oil and have seen even right behind the first days that there has been some kind of &#x27;brightness&#x27; that I even thought it might be helpful.</li>
            <li> Be patient apply daily to clean filed nails.</li>
            <li> Also clean your bathroom floors and shower regularly.  </li>
            <li> my left big toe, the discoloration has pretty much disappeared and the toe looks healthy and is growing normally.</li>
            <li> my left big toe, the discoloration has pretty much disappeared and the toe looks healthy and is growing normally.</li>

            <li> Way better than the other high priced products.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think you should give it a try, because it&#x27;s free of hormones and works better than other natural costly remedies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this to both toes daily for about 2 months now and slowly but surely, the fungus toenail is growing out and the healthy toenail is growing in.</li>
            <li> The left corner of mytoenail is starting to grow promising, healthy.</li>
            <li> So far, does the job really well!</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad at all, it smells as if I am cooking an Italian dinner, but not for my toe.</li>
            <li> Brittle, dry, jagged nails are now smooth and healthier looking and feeling.</li>
            <li> Two weeks with this and healthy toenail has grown out half way.</li>
            <li> and I only have a mild case of nail fungus.</li>
            <li> I didnt expect such quick results</li>
            <li> After only four (4) applications, I have seen a tremendous mark of improvement.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the main reason I gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I read tons of reviews and the main things that stuck out were people complaining that they had &amp;#34;feetza&amp;#34; (feet that smelled like pizza)</li>
            <li> When I noticed a yellow and disfigured lump on my toenail, I suspected the fungus, but wasn&#x27;t sure because it didn&#x27;t cover the entire nail, like I&#x27;ve seen on others.</li>
            <li> or I may see if I can cut this stuff with another Essential Oil with the same properties and a better smell.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> This is the only one that has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I used ALL of mine in high hopes that just maybe...just maybe it would take it all to get rid of the fungus..</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the medicine and this seller.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for nail fungus.</li>
            <li> Currently, the next time I clip my toenails, my right toe will be completely fungus free.</li>
            <li> I give it a little more time to kick in before I could say if it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> Just because you still see discoloration on your nail after 4 weeks does NOT mean the product isn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> Achieved better results from OTC products sold by large and small retailers.</li>
            <li> So far it has done absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> fast service from Greece seems to work early days</li>
            <li> The shipment too longer than expected, so they decided not to charge me for the product, but in addition, they sent  me additional quantity again free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As few drugs are able to penetrate the nail.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure after a few weeks the discoloration will be gone.  </li>
            <li> Obviously, people have had success but not me.</li>
            <li> I honestly think it has helped with the smaller toe nails but the big toe nail is still yellow but seems to be getting clearer</li>
            <li> We have used this for 2 months now, and she says it is allowing her toenail t recover and look normal, I agree.</li>
            <li> It took a few months of  every day use, but this product, unlike so many others that I have tried, got the job done.  </li>
            <li> If you have ever dealt with that burning itch that comes with cracked toes, from althetes foot, that no matter how hard you scratch or twist, it still drives you mad with the itching, I put this stuff on and got that burn, they mentioned, and it was the most wonderful burn</li>
            <li> That alone made me feel ok about my purchase because it made me less conscious.</li>
            <li> WOW, I hadn&#x27;t seen a normal nail on that toe in 2 years!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was fungus until recently, despite having issues with my toes right after the pedicure.</li>
            <li> Two toenails on my left foot, and all 5 toenails on the right.</li>
            <li> I gotta try especially after reading all these positive reviews!</li>
            <li> and I can see my new nail growing out</li>
            <li> My husband HATES the smell, but he will live..</li>
            <li> The directions say to use every day for a month, however being a new mother of two babies there were days I forgot to do it.  </li>
            <li> I thought a new nail would be growing underneath</li>
            <li> /&gt;this, within a couple of days, I could already see it regrowing a new toe</li>
            <li> I suck at getting into new habits</li>
            <li> We have a new term in our house.</li>
            <li> It was only after using that product for a few days, that I read the micro-print label under a magnifying glass and discovered that it was \\&quot;...not effective for scalp or nails.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Again, I am very sensitive to smell so it may not bother others.</li>
            <li> and it looks like in two weeks I will be clear of this fungus!</li>
            <li> My nails are clear and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> To answer a question by another potential customer:  You can use Fungus stop over your pretty pedicure.  </li>
            <li> Like it so far, but have not completed it yet!</li>
            <li> I have used many fungus killer in the past</li>
            <li> The other is making significant progress.</li>
            <li> I am currently on my third week of using this product and it appears to be in the first stage of working.  </li>
            <li> Still to early to tell!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 years old and my toenails almost look 22 again!  </li>
            <li> First time I used my toe got sore and turned red.  </li>
            <li> Like the first, the affected part of the second nail is growing out and gradually getting trimmed off.</li>
            <li> It has the exact same effect of Oreganol Oil.</li>
            <li> If the nail is clear with new growth below the discolored area, then be patient and keep applying the product.</li>
            <li> I have been doing so for about a month now, the first infection is entirely clear and the second infection is not spreading.</li>
            <li> First off wanted to say that shipping was much faster than expected.</li>
            <li> so I can not really sasay how quickly it should have worked...</li>
            <li> In just a few months, this inexpensive and easy to apply liquid has completely cured the toenail fungus and I am going to order another bottle to keep on hand in case the ailment returns.</li>
            <li> and sometimes I add gold Listerine) and cut the nail down so that only clear healthy nails reamin.</li>
            <li> Like pure oregano only about 10 times stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had been using tea tree oil twice a day every day for more than 3 months with little to no improvement of a fungal infection on both big toenails.</li>
            <li> I received about a week and an half ago and have seen significant improvement in nails.</li>
            <li> The product comes all the way from Greece and the merchant included a nice little sample of Greek oregano that my wife actually used in a dish.  </li>
            <li> and it looks clear.  </li>
            <li> and you will see your toenails begin to clear</li>
            <li> This will so so relieve immediate discomfort and will help clear up that fungus.</li>
            <li> and I would guess that I am about clear</li>
            <li> After just one week the fungus feelers have disappeared and the naik ends are clear again.</li>
            <li> and I can see clear toenails.</li>
            <li> Made from natural ingredients</li>
            <li> After 1 week seeing much improvement but had the fungus for years so monitoring for the next couple weeks..</li>
            <li> early days but seems to be working,only in week one.</li>
            <li> So far I feel it is benefiting, but this process takes time.</li>
            <li> so as far as I am concerned...</li>
            <li> That is really helping and it is not such a pain.  </li>
            <li> like how natural this product is.  </li>
            <li> tea tree oil and Epsom salts nightly to help get rid of this fungus and formerly was using OPI Nail Fungus treatment after (very drying).  </li>
            <li> advice for speeding up the foot fungus at home- exfoliate all soft skin off around the nails after a foot bath (with tea tree oil</li>
            <li> I was embarrassed and was at point of looking into medical fungus procedures, which are very costly.</li>
            <li> I have faith that this will work finally as at least my toenail is much better than when I started with problems.</li>
            <li> but I am going to recommend this product like the ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD that really cures the toenail fungus.</li>
            <li> but its a big difference than how it looked before I started using Fungus Stop and from the price of this product and the fast results</li>
            <li> The only OTC that really works.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been trying it long enough to give full review but so far no results.</li>
            <li> I had a very persistent case of nail fungus on one of my big toes.  </li>
            <li> I suspect it works by both the antimicrobial action of the oregano oil, and the fact that the oil suffocates the fungus.  </li>
            <li> Was hoping for it to work as it is a natural product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 3 weeks now and a marked improvement to my toe fungus.</li>
            <li> At 57 years old, the fungus in my toe nails has been there for years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products over the last 2yrs without results and this is the only product that actually worked.</li>
            <li> Not as nearly deformed or warped.  </li>
            <li> After about two weeks one of my toe nails is almost completely cleared up.  </li>
            <li> Early on I also added cayenne pepper to the vinegar because some guy in Indonesia swore by it, so I thought, &amp;#34;What the heck - I&#x27;ll give that a shot, too.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> While deployed overseas, I developed some toenail fungus because of the humid conditions.  </li>
            <li> Fungus Stop worked very well for me and if you have the patience to keep applying it daily for&lt;br /&gt;one</li>
            <li> /&gt;Treating as directed, my nails started showing marked improvement in about three weeks.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend to give this oil a try, at least I was spending a lot more money for the chemicals than for two bottles of this.....  </li>
            <li> Smells like oregano and hasn&#x27;t done anything for my toenails so far.</li>
            <li> It has cleared up a problem toe, but it has not yet completely removed the problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this initially because I didn&#x27;t want to use chemicals that would be absorbing into my feet.</li>
            <li> I had a fungus it was in the early stages, probably within a time frame of 6 months when I would get my pedicure</li>
            <li> probably the ones complaining have sensitive noses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well so far</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been three weeks so far</li>
            <li> It takes time for the nail to grow out completely.  </li>
            <li> I have a ways to go, but nothing, nothing has produced the results this natural product has given me.</li>
            <li> never missing a day yet</li>
            <li> So we shall see.&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the commentary so far.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be doing something.</li>
            <li> I have read a lot about the benefits of oregano oil and so far I like it.</li>
            <li> Finally, a naturally based product that works.</li>
            <li> AND AFTER TRIMMING THE AFFECTED NAIL BACK A FEW TIMES AND APPLYING THE PRODUCT 2-3 TIMES A DAY (MOST DAYS, ANYWAY)</li>
            <li> Worth the wait to arrive from Greece, although it did arrive sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> I knew that it was nail fungus when near the end of the first month, the original affected nail had almost cleared up entirely, but I noticed a similar infection on another nail on my other foot.</li>
            <li> It does seem to be helping so far, albeit SLOWLY, but I am noticing quicker and better results with apple cider vinegar and baking soda and soaking my feet for 15-30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I read alot of good reviews, this actually made the situation worse.</li>
            <li> So far only some very slight improvement, hopefully more improvement with time.</li>
            <li> The price was right, especially considering it came all the way from Greece with Greek stamps on the envelope!</li>
            <li> Please know that I am a real person (and an English major!)</li>
            <li> so I just get half way full.</li>
            <li> When my bottle arrived, it leaked a bit, as the top didn&#x27;t screw down tight, but this stuff really works!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product has steadily worked over the last 3-4 months I&#x27;ve been using it, and now 2 out of 7 pretty badly infected toenails are about a third grown out with healthy nails clearly visible :) The other 5 (including a big toenail) look like they could take longer, but are certainly no worse than when I started applying this product.</li>
            <li> On my right foot, the discoloration is still slightly there and only on the upper right side does the nail seem to still be stubbornly growing irregularly still, but it is lessened from before I started.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On my right foot, the discoloration is still slightly there and only on the upper right side does the nail seem to still be stubbornly growing irregularly still, but it is lessened from before I started.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I applied this product 2x daily (2 bottles worth) and filed my nails back as far as possible and the fungus is still remains.</li>
            <li> Just this week it had traveled high enough up to clip.</li>
            <li> I was very diligent about applying it to my affected nail every day and allowing it to dry completely before putting on any shoes or socks.</li>
            <li> It seems good,but I don&#x27;t know how long the effect will be absolutely.</li>
            <li> NOT COMPLETELY GONE AFTER 6 WEEKS, BUT MUCH IMPROVED.</li>
            <li> A side note, Another thing that countered my impression of Fungus Stop was that the price is really reasonable which initially made me suspect since I had spent so much on medications already.</li>
            <li> If you have full blown fungus, it would also be helpful to get the fungus soap wash, it will be a long tedious process, but with time, it will get better.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and now the fungus has FINALLY cleared up and luckily for me, never spread to my other nails.</li>
            <li> we don&#x27;t live in the same town.....</li>
            <li> For thicker nails, such as toe nails, it takes a longer time to heal, but the progress is visible as the new nail coming out</li>
            <li> Your new &amp;#34;Feetza&amp;#34; Parlor is open for business!</li>
            <li> I have a mild toe fungus on a few toes</li>
            <li> HAVE NOT YET SEEN ANY MAJOR IMPROVEMENT.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 2 weeks, major improvements showing, already.  </li>
            <li> Currently about 80% of the fungus on my big toe has cleared up, my toe nail seem to be growing at a faster pace than when the toe was completely covered in fungus, also the nail bed is not lifted anymore as prior to using this product almost the whole nail bed was lifted.</li>
            <li> I had two different types of fungus and both nails are clear now.  </li>
            <li> I have spent so much money on treatments and products.  </li>
            <li> It started as a blue dot under the nail, then it evolved into a complete fungal nail over the years.</li>
            <li> Thus I could completely control the &amp;#34;experiement&amp;#34; without outside factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used Fungus Stop once daily after showering for about a month before the Fungus had grown off the nail almost completely.</li>
            <li> To early to tell yet, I like only have to use it once a Day</li>
            <li> I have battled toenail fungus for over a year and tried numerous naturally based products.</li>
            <li> It made my toe nails look better but not great.</li>
            <li> She is on week 3 (daily regiment, some missed days), and has seen noticeable changes in appearance: all dry and brittle texture of skin and nail was given much needed nourishment and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> After trying everything OTC, I finally stumbled across this product and due to the reviews, reasonable cost, and desperation!</li>
            <li> I am very optimistic as I never saw the slightest improvement with other products in over 1 year.</li>
            <li> The vapors from the spilled solution is quite intense and is leaked onto other mail.</li>
            <li> From reading other reviews I am very hopeful.</li>
            <li> On my big toe especially, the new growth has come out about one third of the way and keeps getting clearer.</li>
            <li> excited to finally find a product that does what it says - I&#x27;ve tried most of the major ones, and they all without fail seemed to start off well, but after a few months the infection looked like it did at the beginning, and didn&#x27;t budge any further even with continued perseverance for months or sometimes</li>
            <li> Also, I have noticed that my toe does not seem to hurt like it use to before starting &amp;#34;Fungus Stop.&amp;#34;  So far, this is the only topical medication I have tried that seems to be doing anything to help clear up the fungus on my big toe; which I have had for years.  </li>
            <li> The nail needs a chance to grow and it took a solid year for my big toe to completely grow out.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t win :(</li>
            <li> In the first few days, I started seeing changes and by the time 2 weeks passed, I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Far better than that expensive stuff you get in the pharmacy, that you use for years and still have the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Week 5, BINGO, I noticed it looked like the nail was lifting up, all that gross brown stuff was kind of puffed up and dried looking, so, I started pulling on it slowly and lifting it off.  </li>
            <li> I am just really grateful my athlete&#x27;s foot is gone and want to help other people who are suffering as I did!</li>
            <li> I even received a small sample of Greek oregano (complimentary with their shipment to explain the product).</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical, but thought it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I am still using it in hopes that the nail will improve, but I&#x27;m disappointed especially since this product got such great reviews.  </li>
            <li> The black fungal dot took about 6 months to grow from a very tiny one to the whole toe nail.</li>
            <li> and I got this off of a blog I found while reading extensively online for various other success stories from other people all over the world.  </li>
            <li> Ok, left big toe, have been fighting a gross thick fungus nail for about 2 years; tried every over the counter product out there, no success at all.  </li>
            <li> I even cut my bad toe nail off as far as I could get it and even soaked my feet in very warm water to get my toenails softened up so this could get deep down in the nail..</li>
            <li> , soles of feet breakouts, secondary infections (within a day or so), helps shed the excess skin being produced, and the skin to be a little more supple during the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> before starting any new product, so that you can compare this with your toenails eg 6 months down the line, when you may have forgotten what they looked like before - and get an unbiased view on whether the product is working.</li>
            <li> So, I pulled it all off to reveal a normal looking half nail growing in the nailbed below.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks, and my toenail is almost back to normal.  </li>
            <li> My nails are like half and half now, half of the old thick nail growing out and what&#x27;s coming in is new and smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> It came within 2 weeks and when I first applied it I was thrown away by the oregano smell, but, I said I will stick with it for at least a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I roughed up the nails a bit first and chose to leave it on for at least 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Been using it for 1 month; so far no success.</li>
            <li> The nail discoloration is gone and it is growing out flat again.</li>
            <li> did not clear up fungus but soften the nail enough to fall off.  </li>
            <li> But, in my observation, this product is the only one so far that has made a little dent to my my toe fungus problem.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s  been using it for a few weeks now and his fungus has stopped in its tracks and new (fungus-free) nails are growing out.</li>
            <li> I will say that I am sensitive to smell and there is a slight smell to it.</li>
            <li> and so far none of them have done what this product has done to me in less that three weeks that I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> I put a dab on each toe, wait for it to dry and put white cotton socks on.</li>
            <li> I saw multiple doctors about it and essentially got a resounding, &amp;#34;There&#x27;s not much you can do.</li>
            <li> This natural solution started working after only a few applications.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell seemed a little strong to me, it&#x27;s not pleasant</li>
            <li> It burns a little, but oregano oil will burn naturally.</li>
            <li> know some reviewers have been repelled by the smell of the main ingredient of oregano oil -- somewhat like that of dipping oils at pretentious Italian restaurants.  </li>
            <li> The toenails quickly became less thick</li>
            <li> All natural, so you know you&#x27;re not putting any harsh chemicals on your skin.</li>
            <li> Try to apply whenever you can have some time to be without shoes, also be careful to ONLY apply to toe nail area.  </li>
            <li> It works well, but it&#x27;s been almost a month that I&#x27;m using it(which is a recommended time of use), and a problem is not completely gone yet.</li>
            <li> and I had it for so long.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a long time as it goes a long ways as you just use couple drops.</li>
            <li> However, from all the research I have done, it can take a long time of care to eliminate a nail fungus.  </li>
            <li> Takes a long time to see results but does work.</li>
            <li> The battle wasn&#x27;t closed totally</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 bottles after hearing the glowing reviews but long wait for product.</li>
            <li> Expect to smell like oregano while using this as long as it is on your skin (if it burns/hurts, wash it off).</li>
            <li> Complete waste of time; didn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
            <li> I know it took a long time for me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not completely cleared up</li>
            <li> This item took long to get here and about 30% of bottle was gone</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know how long they took before they started their treatments?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was well packed and arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> In addition, shipping took way too long.</li>
            <li> Toenail fungus is a serious problem especially with older people.</li>
            <li> After several years of having black toe nails on each foot (one toe on each foot), I finally decided that I must have some type of fungus.  </li>
            <li> all i can say is after using this for a whole month {NO MORE TOE FUNGUS!}</li>
            <li> I had recently purchased other products,and they didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> A plus is, it being an oil it isn&#x27;t drying out my nails and cuticles like my other topical treatment did!</li>
            <li> IMHO, as long as there&#x27;s no cure for toe nail fungus, there will be no cure for cancer!</li>
            <li> So as long as you&#x27;re disciplined enough to use it every single day -- I actually use it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night -- you will see results after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I KNOW IT TAKES AVERY, VERY LONG TIME</li>
            <li> Always wash your feet and let them dry for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Always disinfect your utensils - if you have no alcohol at hand drop them into boiling water and leave the utensils in to the boiling water for 15 minutes, then air dry.</li>
            <li> Once a nite and let dry before socks or shoes.</li>
            <li> Even now, I apply the alcohol and let it dry after getting out of the shower and then apply the Fungus Stop.</li>
            <li> I mean they&#x27;re not even super thick and yellow.</li>
            <li> It did not work for me, i used it for 10 weeks, every single day.</li>
            <li> and I can go back to going without dark nail polish</li>
            <li> The price at least is reasonable compared to prescriptions of other products from  a pharmacy.</li>
            <li> My toe went from dark purple to yellow in a matter of a week.</li>
            <li> However, although it was packaged well, the cap was loose and some leaked out.</li>
            <li> It is necessary to keep them filed down on a weekly basis.</li>
            <li> I see the therapy result after 2 months: the new growing nails are pink and healthy, not those thick, yellow sick</li>
            <li> I have a slight fungal infection on 2 of my fingers and both my big toes.  </li>
            <li> Now three weeks later, it never fell out just a black looking nail.</li>
            <li> Now, after 5 weeks I have only a small place left with that fungus</li>
            <li> After about 30 days of treating just one nail, and over 30 days of treating all 10 toe nails, I stillhave over half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had toe fungus on my 2nd toe &amp; a little on my pinky toe</li>
            <li> I have only had it a little over a week.</li>
            <li> Finally I asked my dad who is a family doctor of 45 years, and he goes to his medicine cabinet and pulls out this little bottle of FUNGUS STOP and says, &amp;#34;Why</li>
            <li> I just proofread this little box here, and it sounds like such a pitch!</li>
            <li> Only product that worked for my little pinky toe.</li>
            <li> I figured that I probably need to do the laser thing a couple of times to actually see all these little monsters on my nails gone.</li>
            <li> ...will not hesitate to order from Zane Hellas again - and thank you for the loose oregano sample!</li>
            <li> Worst case scenario you get some really great oregano out of it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely clear it up, but at least it does help with the palm</li>
            <li> Not much to say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff religiously for a few months now</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do nothing even after using religiously for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
            <li> Nothing...used everyday as directed on moderate nail fungus.  </li>
            <li> I thought after all the money I&#x27;ve spent on my toe nails over the yrs why not give it a shot?</li>
            <li> then I expected</li>
            <li> I admit I did not apply as frequently as recommended and that could be the reason for slow progress.</li>
            <li> fungal infection causes my two big toes&#x27; nail grow thick and yellow.</li>
            <li> Right now, I&#x27;m looking at what was my worst toe nail, on my big toe, and it finally looks like a normal toe nail !</li>
            <li> and I mean EVERYTHING from natural cures to over the counter products to laser treatment.</li>
            <li> Only used it for a few days, no much improvement!</li>
            <li> but I would imagine one needs to buy two bottles and go a long period of time with nail fungus as it is very hard to clear up.</li>
            <li> I am giving this two stars because after a short time of using this maybe a month or less, my nail turned black and looked like it was going to fall out.</li>
            <li> Used as directed but no positive results.</li>
            <li> Also it has a very strong annoying odor.</li>
            <li> I had a slight, but noticeable case of toenail fungus on both of my big toes for a few years.</li>
            <li> see a slight difference in only a few days.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it&#x27;ll take to get completely clear of fungus, I&#x27;m guessing at least a couple</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it&#x27;ll take to get completely clear of fungus, I&#x27;m guessing at least a couple months.  </li>
            <li> Keep using daily, not sure if the fungus is out yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using religiously for the past two weeks</li>
            <li> Oregano oil helps fight colds and other ailments.</li>
            <li> The one downside is the oregano oil is extremely pungent.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s the other thing</li>
            <li> I have had fungal infections of my toenails for years that failed to respond to all the topical treatments that I tried, all of which were much more expensive.  </li>
            <li> Extremely offensive stinking oil smell, which lingers well beyond bathing and showers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product...as well as practically every other product for my nail fungus.  </li>
            <li> If you have a stubborn infection that won&#x27;t budge with other products, I thoroughly encourage you to try this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Other products just don&#x27;t work, but this does.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried endless other things and this works but be patient it can take months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, I&#x27;m not completely sure if I was plagued with fungus on my two big toes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering like other people stated</li>
            <li> I have not had problems with the infection spreading to any other nails, since using it on all toes.    </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waist your time on the other stuff</li>
            <li> i was expecting the fungus to disappear but itnstead of growing weird dis colored toenail, I grew healthy normal nail and the weird dis colored thick part just grew out until it was gone.</li>
            <li> But recently I noticed my nails where looking unhealthy, yellow,</li>
            <li> I stopped using it, not sure if I should go back to Fungiban which didn&#x27;t work but didn&#x27;t turn the nail black either.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, given that I have had tried other products and had little to no success.</li>
            <li> only got it one week ago - not effective yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled a nail fungus on my big toe for at least 10 years.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost of the product and shipping costs.</li>
            <li> From all of the reviews I expected it to make a small change within the 3 1/2  weeks of use, but absolutely no change at all.</li>
            <li> I would frown at my feet wondering why they looked dark.</li>
            <li> The bottles are small, but they go a long way.</li>
            <li> They just have dark spots on the nail tip, brittle, and just won&#x27;t grow.</li>
            <li> The yellowing of my toenails used to go halfway down my toenail, and now is almost gone.  </li>
            <li> one thing I am not satisfied is that it took too long for delivering!</li>
            <li> who has absolutely NO affiliation with this company!!  </li>
            <li> other thing I&#x27;d suggest is to take a photo of your toenails (if you can face it!)</li>
            <li> Product arrived well before the due date!</li>
            <li> I can see the difference now between my old sick nail and the new one that is coming</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to waste my time on the  other bottle.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for fungus hidden below toenail.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a SERIOUS improvement on my big toenail.</li>
            <li> it cleared it up entirely in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m about a month and a half in  </li>
            <li> the fungus gradually became less and less and did not spread.</li>
            <li> nothing less.</li>
            <li> and my toe was half cleared.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me not even a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> After a few months there is only a small discoloration remaining where the nail has not grown out completely-the big toenail grows very slowly.</li>
            <li> But when I say the house will smell like an Italian Salad Dressing or a heavily Oregnao loaded pizza, I mean it.</li>
            <li> He files my nail down a little each time I go in.</li>
            <li> I also use a nail filer to file down the nail so its as thin as possible for the medicine to reach down.</li>
            <li> Let it dry for at least 15 minutes before you put sheers, socks, shoes, etc.</li>
            <li> and he said it burned a little bit.</li>
            <li> There is a scent associated with this product so you may need to adapt a little.</li>
            <li> The other corner is not healthy yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using this little miracle in a bottle for about one month, and I am amazed at the progress.</li>
            <li> I keep my toe nails trimmed almost to the skin so that there&#x27;s little space between the applicator and the toe so that I can get optimal</li>
            <li> , I believe it does, with consistency and a little bit of suffering.</li>
            <li> I keep my toe nails trimmed almost to the skin so that there&#x27;s little space between the applicator and the toe so that I can get optimal</li>
            <li> , I believe it does, with consistency and a little bit of suffering.</li>
            <li> The directions say to use it nightly for 4 weeks, but I&#x27;m on week 5 and think I&#x27;ll continue to use it for a little while longer.</li>
            <li> but, I might just be getting a little use to the smell.</li>
            <li> Those little monsters are still there I could tell.</li>
            <li> It seems to be helping a little bit after one week.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Fungus Stop for a little over a week</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see why long-term use (as prevention) would be a problem, but I&#x27;ll take a little break for a few weeks from time-to-time.</li>
            <li> this was a REAL waste of hard earned money especially since I bought 2 bottles of it..</li>
            <li> Waste of Money, doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Would not reccommed or purchase again, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I will update in a few months when the nails have had a chance to grow out but for now, 5 stars for a product that does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I will update in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Killed the fungus in my toe nail.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks, one of the toes was almost healed.</li>
            <li> A FEW MONTHS,</li>
            <li> but it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> The order arrived within a few days, even though it was shipping from Greece.</li>
            <li> With in a few weeks it has been changed the appearance of my toenails.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t just put it on for a few days and expect the fungus to disappear.  </li>
            <li> once in the morning and once at night -- you will see results after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> cheaper to sprinkle my toes with dried oregano every day.</li>
            <li> Need to take it for a few weeks, even months</li>
            <li> I also used a rotary power nail file to remove the heavy fungus areas each week.</li>
            <li> so I wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> so I wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> A few tips:</li>
            <li> Took a few weeks to get this because it ships from Greece</li>
            <li> So 3 weeks in, even though I&#x27;ve skipped a few days my condition has not worsened.</li>
            <li> To name a few, I&#x27;ve tried ---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They actually got worse.</li>
            <li> My problem was not huge, but I had had it for over 2 years and nothing helped.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I first ordered this product as a few of my family members have been battling toenail fungus for decades and have had no luck with any treatment, including prescriptions.</li>
            <li> I am not only going to keep on buying this product for maintenance after my nail grows completely healthy.and with no more ugly color</li>
            <li> Albeit that it was pretty bad</li>
            <li> nail showed some improvement, but not cured and still pretty bad.</li>
            <li> But I must say I haven&#x27;t seen any change on my toe nails at all, been put it on fatefully everyday with no good results, this product might work for other people but not for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long I can take it because after while you just get tired of the smell.</li>
            <li> It also made my nail less thick</li>
            <li> Very very little improvement.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty bad toenail fungus and can&#x27;t take oral medication because it would be too hard on my organs</li>
            <li> I received this item just broken in a wet envelope.</li>
            <li> It killed the fungus, which is slowly growing out with the toe nail.</li>
            <li> Estimated delivery time was supposed to be past July 13-Aug5.</li>
            <li> It DOES NOT WORK,plus, I never received any instructions with this product, a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> My toes affected by fungus, showed small signs of improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not sure what is happening when I use this product?  </li>
            <li> I didnt care for the smell but its a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> Absolutely unbelievable.</li>
            <li> They gave me a small bottle of KitoNail.  </li>
            <li> But bear with it, the smell goes away or weakens in time and the results are unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> The pharmacy will make it for you, and you apply it with a small brush.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my nail fungus on my thumbnail (not sure if it was nail fungus or a wart)</li>
            <li> So, I started using it daily without fail.  </li>
            <li> Speedy shipping from Greece and included in the package a small gift.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure it could be returned</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure it could be returned</li>
            <li> If it helps we will order a couple more bottles for my son who has a terrible fungus on his toenails.</li>
            <li> He cut back his affected toe nails and then filed them very thin and applied it once a day.  </li>
            <li> My toenails are starting to look a healty pink and that dreadful, thick yellow crust is gone.</li>
            <li> And guess what -- every single product, including this one, has failed.  </li>
            <li> Was broken and a mess when received had to throw away.</li>
            <li> but nope..waste of time and hard earned money....</li>
            <li> My husband has had a hard time getting rid of toe fungus.</li>
            <li> And sadly it didn&#x27;t get my attention until I felt my big toes loose and a little painful after kicking on wall.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact I think it looks a little worse.</li>
            <li> Was not effective for me and followed the directions.  </li>
            <li> I waited  at least 6 weeks before revising my review.</li>
            <li> and it was not nearly as effective.</li>
            <li> Sometimes there has been a bit improvement (at least it seemed to work that way...)</li>
            <li> Shipping time was at least 3 weeks, maybe 4.</li>
            <li> the treatment is working albeit slowly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working, but it is slow.</li>
            <li> , they grow so slow.</li>
            <li> Shipping was a bit slow but not unreasonable.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was a bit slow but not unreasonable.  </li>
            <li> but the process is slow</li>
            <li> I mean I&#x27;ve tried everything...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping time -- Don&#x27;t be afraid to order by the long shipping time.</li>
            <li> Seriously, the relief was like crossing the finish line of a flipping marathon.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a bit hard to tell at this stage of the game.  </li>
            <li> Is it possible for nails to just go bad &amp;</li>
            <li> Having bad fungus under 4 toenails on one foot has been a problem for me for the last 5 years.</li>
            <li> The bad nail underneath fell off and there is no visible fungus growing back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for less than a month and am seeing big improvement in a toe nail that was very bad.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t have the worst case, it was bad enough that if I was at the beach or pool I would use a semi-opaque &amp;#34;brightener&amp;#34; that brushes on and  conceals much of it.</li>
            <li> Have had a bad nail infection for weeks that would not clear up.</li>
            <li> Fungus is a tough thing to kill - so be vigilant.</li>
            <li> I have a few of those toes that you just want to hide the nail, they are so ugly, but after soaking my feet and then a pedicure, I got an eye dropper and forced this stuff in and under the toenail, where you are trying to kill the fungus to get it to away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but felll short, I decided to try this one base on the reviews, and</li>
            <li> BUT it smells just like Tea Tree Oil (awful) which can be bought at any Whole Foods, or like store, without the wait or postage and</li>
            <li> Always apply a thin layer and let it sit on your toenails for about 10 mins and then take some tissue/napkin and remove some of the excess</li>
            <li> SO SO frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to admit that my fungus issue isn&#x27;t as bad as other buyers, whose reviews i read and helped me determine the purchase.</li>
            <li> Cause the weather was still cold, I worn socks as usually.</li>
            <li> Nothing too bad, I just can smell it and its not a sweet smell.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s raunchy smell.</li>
            <li> Was hoping this item would work, unfortunately it did not.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but all it does is make your toes smell like oregano.</li>
            <li> , after a few days I thought myself stupid NOT to try it-</li>
            <li> Useless ineffective stinking gunk.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li> But understand that toe fungus is a difficult thing to deal with.</li>
            <li> does not work for me, sorry.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I cannot be happier.</li>
            <li> This is just unfortunate that this product did not work.</li>
            <li> it has a weird burning sensation that lingers.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and the fungus on my toes are already improving, and to say the least I been fighting this crap for about 8 years now.</li>
            <li> Get used to it.&amp;#34; I began to think I was resigned to having grotesque toenails for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried 3 other fungus products and have been very disappointed with the results.  </li>
            <li> The stuff stinks.</li>
            <li> Now my sheets stink, the mattress cover stinks, mattress stinks</li>
            <li> It works miracle preventing cold at the beginning stage.</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;--- not a doctor, just desperate to find a non-steroid remedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it goes numb.  </li>
            <li> It will itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> Received a broken bottle and it smelled so bad that it made me almost sick.</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get past the awful smell even after washing a couple of times.</li>
            <li> I heard that in the past people have to pluck the sick nail, sounds really cruel and wretched.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> However, it still does not look badly at all.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work and smells bad</li>
            <li> While not 100% yet, I can now go without nail polish and not feel bad or embarrassed.</li>
            <li> But once you apply it and cover with a sock, its not so bad.</li>
            <li> how bad could that be?</li>
            <li> no, it did nothing, applied it twice a day for 2 weeks, it smells really bad.</li>
            <li> BAD AN</li>
            <li> The bottle also leaks, and it smells so bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like it suppresses the bad coloring.</li>
            <li> and I am going to use it as I said before for life as maintenance not to see those ugly fungus again in my toe.</li>
            <li> Toenail fungus is so horrible to deal with, so stubborn and painful and frustrating.</li>
            <li> The smell made me sick.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me :(</li>
            <li> Was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had hope based on the reviews, but not.. not worked for me :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointing</li>
            <li> Worthless junk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m that person who have been suffering from toe nail fungus and their equally annoying cousins of athlete&#x27;s foot for over 15 yrs.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect to see underneath, but I was like this bad boy is coming off!  </li>
            <li> Terrible!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible, tried it for 6 weeks, no effect whatsoever</li>
            <li> I am experiencing a burning sensation which isn&#x27;t totally awful and tells me (hopefully) that this product is working.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell awful either.</li>
            <li> They smelled terrible and did nothing at the end.</li>
            <li> Horrible stuff</li>
            <li> , sometimes even it seemed to be worst.</li>
            <li> The toenail has gone through getting embedded into the nailbed (in a corner, followed by horrible pain), the separation from the nail bed, over production of keratine under the nail bed.</li>
            <li> MY NAILS ARE WORST.....</li>
            <li> I have real bad toe nail fungus where my nail came off ....</li>
            <li> Horrible stuff....</li>
            <li> the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mind you, my toenail fungus aren&#x27;t even the worst case there is.</li>

            <li> To answer a question by another potential customer:  You can use Fungus stop over your pretty pedicure.  I do, and the only effect is that maybe after a week of using the product the nail polish color is not as shiny.  However, it still does not look badly at all.  I have been using Fungus Stop for two weeks now and I can see my new nail growing out and it looks clear.  Also, I have noticed that my toe does not seem to hurt like it use to before starting &amp;#34;Fungus Stop.&amp;#34;  So far, this is the only topical medication I have tried that seems to be doing anything to help clear up the fungus on my big toe; which I have had for years.  I think it is still to early to say it is a perfect medication for the problem, but, I am willing to buy another bottle to keep this working.  I do recommend this brand since it seems to be the only topical solution that has helped at all.  I would give it 5 stars if I saw a faster improvement; but, I think it is a matter of time and patience.</li>
            <li> Did exactly nothing to solve problem</li>
            <li> Keep using daily, not sure if the fungus is out yet.</li>
            <li> First off wanted to say that shipping was much faster than expected. That was a pleasant surprise. I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now and i could def see a difference. I have been battling toe nail fungus for many years now so i dont have a mild case. I know its going to take some time but im very optimistic of the results.</li>
            <li> Great product, works well.</li>
            <li> Works well. Made from natural ingredients so you feel safe using it</li>
            <li> It is not yet enough time to evaluate</li>
            <li> This stuff really works with fungus of the nails!  My toenails are looking really good!</li>
            <li> After 1 week seeing much improvement but had the fungus for years so monitoring for the next couple weeks..</li>
            <li> I applied this product 2x daily (2 bottles worth) and filed my nails back as far as possible and the fungus is still remains. As soon as the nail grows back the fungus comes back.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me :( And I was consistent too. Maybe my nails just don&#x27;t have a chance. Is it possible for nails to just go bad &amp; there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it??</li>
            <li> I have been very impressed with the results at the three week mark. The fungus is dying. And nails look better. I will continue until all fungus nail has grown out. The treatment smells like oregano so our joke is that I have &amp;#34;Oregan-toes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Like it so far, but have not completed it yet!</li>
            <li> Not much to say. It works very well.</li>
            <li> This is as good as the prescription stuff. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It hasnt done anything, and i dont think it will.</li>
            <li> It seems good,but I don&#x27;t know how long the effect will be absolutely.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work and smells bad</li>
            <li> Just got it 2 weeks ago so am still looking forward to good results</li>
            <li> I have been fighting this problem for several years and have tried prescription medication, blue laser treatment, etc. This really works.</li>
            <li> The stuff stinks. Now my sheets stink, the mattress cover stinks, mattress stinks and I cannot wear it during the day because of it&#x27;s raunchy smell.</li>
            <li> This seller is amazing. Honest and goes the extra mile. Fantastic product. They are the real deal. I can’t say enough about their kindness and professionalism. If you want a fine and natural toe and nail fungus product that is pure  this is your best bet. Thanks so much for your service</li>
            <li> early days but seems to be working,only in week one.</li>
            <li> So far so good. It&#x27;s been two weeks and the new growth of my nail is coming in fine. We will see what happens.</li>
            <li> Waste of Money, doesn&#x27;t work. The people that sell this junk should be arrested for Fraud</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doing the job!!!</li>
            <li> Spilled out in envelop</li>
            <li> Works just great! Smells good too! All natural, so you know you&#x27;re not putting any harsh chemicals on your skin.</li>
            <li> Great product. Started seeing results within the first week. No over powering oder.</li>
            <li> Was hoping this item would work, unfortunately it did not. Would not reccommed or purchase again, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This item arrived much faster than the 3 week quote. Well packaged with a thank you letter, clear instructions and a nice sized sample of their oregano. I have only been using this for 2 days so I will return to give an update.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but all it does is make your toes smell like oregano.</li>
            <li> Was not effective for me and followed the directions.  Also smelled very strong of oregano.</li>
            <li> I had recently purchased other products,and they didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;This one was incredible. For some reason this mixture,healed the fungus. My toe nails are looking healthy. I&#x27;m thrilled beyond.I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;But be patient,it really does work.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait  use for my husband</li>
            <li> I received this item just broken in a wet envelope. Terrible!!!</li>
            <li> The only thing that has worked!!</li>
            <li> It really works!!!  I have used many fungus killer in the past -that promised cure- but felll short, I decided to try this one base on the reviews, and Im glad I did- it has only been a couple of weeks and I can see a difference already.  Try it for your self- you wont be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Still using it.</li>
            <li> Quality product.  So far I feel it is benefiting, but this process takes time.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for more than 4 weeks, I was really exited and positive about it. But I must say I haven&#x27;t seen any change on my toe nails at all, been put it on fatefully everyday with no good results, this product might work for other people but not for me.😔</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff religiously for a few months now and I&#x27;ve noticed improved differences. I use fungus soap on every shower I take and combine this after. The results are very decent.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;ve never suffered from nail fungus until just recently I returned from Bali and have noticed a fungus on my  nail. I used this product for a week now and have already seen results. The seller is also amazing, I received a free organic oregano sample from Greece. My uncle who is a master chef loved it!</li>
            <li> I had been using tea tree oil twice a day every day for more than 3 months with little to no improvement of a fungal infection on both big toenails. After 1 week using this oil of oregano I am already seeing significant improvement. I am truly amazed. I will update in a few months when the nails have had a chance to grow out but for now, 5 stars for a product that does what it says it does. UPDATE: This product is great. After a few months there is only a small discoloration remaining where the nail has not grown out completely-the big toenail grows very slowly. All new nail growth is smooth and clear. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased and will order another bottle to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> This is really working on my toenail fungus. I see results after just 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Smells foul, and I had used it now for several months and no improvement in appearance.</li>
            <li> did not clear up fungus but soften the nail enough to fall off.  From there, I was able to clear away the debris from under the nail.  I&#x27;m waiting to see what happens.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you. This stuff is AMAZING !! My husband and I have only been using this for a week and we can&#x27;t believe the improvement in our toenails. Brittle, dry, jagged nails are now smooth and healthier looking and feeling. My search for an effective anti-fungal is over!! This product comes from Greece and it arrived very quickly - just 10 days after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Terrible, tried it for 6 weeks, no effect whatsoever and I only have a mild case of nail fungus.</li>
            <li> I received about a week and an half ago and have seen significant improvement in nails. I am very pleased and will buy again!</li>
            <li> highly recommend!  I&#x27;ve had toenail fungus for years.  This is the first time I see a difference in my toenail.  Nothing has worked until now!  LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> It shipped way faster than it said it was so that was cool.  It arrived in 7 days.  My husband has only been using it for 3 days and ALREADY this is a visible difference.  We&#x27;ve been using oil of oregano on his toes but it must have not been strong enough.  This stuff is the bomb!  He cut back his affected toe nails and then filed them very thin and applied it once a day.  Try to apply whenever you can have some time to be without shoes, also be careful to ONLY apply to toe nail area.  One time it got on his skin and he said it burned a little bit.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have tried many many things and nothing has worked yet..I bought 2 bottles of this...one for my daughter and one for myself...we don&#x27;t live in the same town.....We both used it twice a day for about 2 months...there was no change in our toe nails at all...I even cut my bad toe nail off as far as I could get it and even soaked my feet in very warm water to get my toenails softened up so this could get deep down in the nail..NOTHING...so as far as I am concerned...this was a REAL waste of hard earned money especially since I bought 2 bottles of it..I used ALL of mine in high hopes that just maybe...just maybe it would take it all to get rid of the fungus..but nope..waste of time and hard earned money....</li>
            <li> It does seem to be helping so far, albeit SLOWLY, but I am noticing quicker and better results with apple cider vinegar and baking soda and soaking my feet for 15-30 minutes.  That is really helping and it is not such a pain.  I am still using this after I soak my feet but I think the soaking is doing more to fight it than this.  I can&#x27;t be certain it isn&#x27;t helping but the soaking made a rapid improvement.</li>
            <li> It works well, but it&#x27;s been almost a month that I&#x27;m using it(which is a recommended time of use), and a problem is not completely gone yet. Overall, I think you should give it a try, because it&#x27;s free of hormones and works better than other natural costly remedies.</li>
            <li> I just received this! I have no idea if it works BUT it smells just like Tea Tree Oil (awful) which can be bought at any Whole Foods, or like store, without the wait or postage and handling!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Well, after a few days I thought myself stupid NOT to try it- I did and am now a believer. I have had fungus on my fingernails on and off for years so I looks, and study them alllll the time. I CAN SEE IT WORKING, and I see a better nail future in my life. A plus is, it being an oil it isn&#x27;t drying out my nails and cuticles like my other topical treatment did!</li>
            <li> I came to amazon to buy an antifungal for one of my toe nails and I found this product. I saw all the really good reviews and was hesitant to believe it. But, I figured I had tried so many things and nothing worked why not try this stuff. It came within 2 weeks and when I first applied it I was thrown away by the oregano smell, but, I said I will stick with it for at least a couple of weeks. Oh my goodness, this thing is amazing!!! within 5-6 days I started noticing the nail becoming clear; it has been 2 weeks since I started using it and the nail is about 70% normal, incredible!!! I wish I had taken pictures before and after. This thing really works. Now, I love the oregano smell, doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore!! Good Stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. Used as directed but no positive results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a change in color yet but my nails are healthier . I give it a little more time to kick in before I could say if it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> The product came very quickly. Over a week earlier than the suggested time. It came with a free gift. I&#x27;ve only used it for 3 days. But, I feel like there is already an improvement. It burns a little, but oregano oil will burn naturally. Nothing you couldn&#x27;t handle, so don&#x27;t panic. It feels nice and smooth applying it. It comes with great instructions and info about product. I bought two. So, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll buy this item again, but I am so pleased, that I am going to look into other products they carry. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> I just received this product today.  I have a slight fungal infection on 2 of my fingers and both my big toes.  The smell is pleasant and I&#x27;m hopeful this will work.  I am experiencing a burning sensation which isn&#x27;t totally awful and tells me (hopefully) that this product is working.  I will update in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I like how natural this product is.  Positive vibes!!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have been using religiously for the past two weeks I can say the fungus on my toenails from getting pedicures is almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was great and the free surprise of Oregano was a nice touch. Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for only 1 week, but actually it seems to be improving. I can see the corners of the nail lightening up.  I am very optimistic as I never saw the slightest improvement with other products in over 1 year.</li>
            <li> This stuff is STRONG. I&#x27;m doing foot baths with tea tree oil and Epsom salts nightly to help get rid of this fungus and formerly was using OPI Nail Fungus treatment after (very drying).  I switched to this product because it was all natural,  very strong and moisturizes while killing all the bacteria and fungus. You can feel it burn a bit after a foot bath and exfoliating- avoid contact with your face or eyes- OUCH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some advice for speeding up the foot fungus at home- exfoliate all soft skin off around the nails after a foot bath (with tea tree oil and sometimes I add gold Listerine) and cut the nail down so that only clear healthy nails reamin. Apply this product after the bath while the skin/nail is softened so it absorbs the treatment better. You should be on your way to healthy nails in no time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s helping and it looks like in two weeks I will be clear of this fungus!</li>
            <li> product does not work! I followed instructions to the letter, over the course of eight weeks. I have an extremely mild case of toenail fungus, it worsened! Total shame!</li>
            <li> Killed the fungus in my toe nail.  Used it twice a day for 4 months and my toe fungus went away.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, given that I have had tried other products and had little to no success. I have had a fungus on both big toes for over a year. I was embarrassed and was at point of looking into medical fungus procedures, which are very costly. And then after reading the reviews, I thought I would give one last try. I am SO GLAD I did. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results. After a few weeks, one of the toes was almost healed. The other is making significant progress. Albeit that it was pretty bad and I had it for so long. While not 100% yet, I can now go without nail polish and not feel bad or embarrassed. I am thrilled that I saved my nails with this product and I can go back to going without dark nail polish 24/7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product. I will say that I am sensitive to smell and there is a slight smell to it. Nothing too bad, I just can smell it and its not a sweet smell. But once you apply it and cover with a sock, its not so bad. Again, I am very sensitive to smell so it may not bother others. It lingers for a short time. I can deal with it given the outstanding results.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the free gift of oregano! Can&#x27;t wait to use this product!</li>
            <li> Really seems to be working after more than a month.  I admit I did not apply as frequently as recommended and that could be the reason for slow progress. Definitely better!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a long time as it goes a long ways as you just use couple drops. I have not had real good results from using it but I would imagine one needs to buy two bottles and go a long period of time with nail fungus as it is very hard to clear up. The price at least is reasonable compared to prescriptions of other products from  a pharmacy. I can not say this will work completely but worth a try. August 2016 I am still using the Zane Hellas and not a prescription from the doctor I am going to. He files my nail down a little each time I go in. He has told me it takes awhile to get a toe nail to regrow as prior to fungas. Toenail has been removed. Toenail started growing again and about the same place started fungus. The prescription did not work for me I first bought from office. They have a second one now but I am still using this one. Toenail fungus is a serious problem especially with older people. I have faith that this will work finally as at least my toenail is much better than when I started with problems.</li>
            <li> Useless ineffective stinking gunk.</li>
            <li> I ha ve to start saying that I&#x27;ve been having this toenail fungus for over 20 years trying everything that I see in the market and also from All over the World. (Spain, Argentina,  USA, etc. and so far none of them have done what this product has done to me in less that three weeks that I&#x27;ve been using it. I can see the difference now between my old sick nail and the new one that is coming all whit the healthy looks and natural color like the rest of my nails. I am not only going to keep on buying this product for maintenance after my nail grows completely healthy.and with no more ugly color but I am going to recommend this product like the ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD that really cures the toenail fungus. TKANKS ZANE HELLAS. and I hope one day I can give my thanks to you in person when I travel to Greece. THANK YOU FOR BELIEVE AGAIN IN THE TRULY GOOD PRODUCTS THAT ONLY COMES FROM MOTHER EARTH and the techniques developed only so far in Europe. I am really glad I found this product and I am going to use it as I said before for life as maintenance not to see those ugly fungus again in my toe.</li>
            <li> Less effective than tea tree oil for my nail fungus. Also, don&#x27;t use it in your bedroom unless you want to give your room a powerful, lingering stuffy pizza smell. On the positive side, I received a bag of oily (in a really great way) oregano for cooking. So this didn&#x27;t work for me, but I would still recommend trying it based on the success that many people seem to have had. Worst case scenario you get some really great oregano out of it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get it on your skin good look severe burn</li>
            <li> I contracted a fungal infection last summer from a salon spa while getting a  pedicure (ugghh, gross!!) I didn&#x27;t realize it was fungus until recently, despite having issues with my toes right after the pedicure. I purchased this based on other reviews, and  So far so good..week 2 and I have seen some improvement. I have found that it is so much more effective if I remove as much of the effective nail as possible, as opposed to just filing it, which can be tricky, but given the nature of the loose nail, it wasn&#x27;t so much an issue to get most of it cut down. My husband HATES the smell, but he will live..I don&#x27;t mind it  , just smells like strong oregano to me! Fingers crossed this cures the issue!I update: IT HAS BEEN A FEW MONTHS, AND AFTER TRIMMING THE AFFECTED NAIL BACK A FEW TIMES AND APPLYING THE PRODUCT 2-3 TIMES A DAY (MOST DAYS, ANYWAY) THE FUNGAL INFECTION IS TOTALLY GONE AND MY NAILS HAVE GROWN IN GREAT AND UNAFFECTED!! THIS WORKED WONDERS FOR ME!!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. But only use as directed.</li>
            <li> seems to have worked!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work!  Who writes these reviews? Nice company but it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Good stuff and worked for me me. Good value for your money.</li>
            <li> I have toe nail fungus on one of my pinkie toes.  I have been using this for around two months now and there is no improvement.  I am still using it in hopes that the nail will improve, but I&#x27;m disappointed especially since this product got such great reviews.  I do have to complement the seller on their fast shipping and free oregano, ergo the two stars.</li>
            <li> Product arrived damage and would not buy again!</li>
            <li> only got it one week ago - not effective yet</li>
            <li> NOT COMPLETELY GONE AFTER 6 WEEKS, BUT MUCH IMPROVED.</li>
            <li> Bought for treating nail fungus, but it did not work for me.  Also it has a very strong annoying odor.</li>
            <li> This works vey good. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a person who has toenail fungus, and has delayed fungal treatment two to three years. Excess fungal infected nail was filed off, and then scrubbed clean with a toothbrush. She is on week 3 (daily regiment, some missed days), and has seen noticeable changes in appearance: all dry and brittle texture of skin and nail was given much needed nourishment and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Seems to Help although its a challenge to rid toe fungus</li>
            <li> This product did what they said it would do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had toe fungus on my 2nd toe &amp; a little on my pinky toe and I used this product a month ago for the first time. In the first few days, I started seeing changes and by the time 2 weeks passed, I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference. In the pic I shared, you can see it hasn&#x27;t totally cleared up but its a big difference than how it looked before I started using Fungus Stop and from the price of this product and the fast results, I would say it&#x27;s very well worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Was not helpful at all</li>
            <li> Didnt use long enough to see a difference :O{ i sure it work if you keep using!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately. But understand that toe fungus is a difficult thing to deal with.</li>
            <li> I have only had it a little over a week. So far it has done absolutely nothing. I will keep trying it.</li>
            <li> i was expecting the fungus to disappear but itnstead of growing weird dis colored toenail, I grew healthy normal nail and the weird dis colored thick part just grew out until it was gone. I no longer have what I referred to as my &amp;#34;dragon claw&amp;#34;. Lol</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who has struggled with toenail fungus for years. This is an AMAZING product. He noticed a difference immediately. He&#x27;s  been using it for a few weeks now and his fungus has stopped in its tracks and new (fungus-free) nails are growing out. He&#x27;s so happy and relieved, as he&#x27;s tried so many different medicines and nothing has worked...until now! Shipping takes maybe 10 or so days as coming from Greece. But so worth the wait! And I find the price amazing! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This company is by far the most professional I have experienced. I just started using this product and the fungus on my toes are already improving, and to say the least I been fighting this crap for about 8 years now. Thank you so much I&#x27;ll be ready for the summer!!! :)</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;It really works. Fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> The order arrived within a few days, even though it was shipping from Greece. The product works great. It killed the fungus, which is slowly growing out with the toe nail. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> A phenomenal product. I bought it for my thumb nails and saw results within 1 week. I roughed up the nails a bit first and chose to leave it on for at least 10 minutes. It&#x27;s all natural ingredients make it safe. I&#x27;m on week 3 and can already see new, fresh and clean nail growth from the nail bed. I&#x27;ve also used it on a few of my toenails and the results are just as impressive.</li>
            <li> Excellent product; however, the two bottles that were shipped within a single bubble-wrap envelope had leaked during shipment from its origin in Greece.  Recommend an improved method of ensuring that the bottle caps are sealed in order to prevent leakage.  The vapors from the spilled solution is quite intense and is leaked onto other mail.</li>
            <li> Havent noticed a real change but i think its getting better</li>
            <li> I am currently on my third week of using this product and it appears to be in the first stage of working.  Still to early to tell!  However, from all the research I have done, it can take a long time of care to eliminate a nail fungus.  Best advice, stop it early!</li>
            <li> Have only used for 2 weeks.  Looks like it could be working.  Will not know for sure until the nail grows out.  I would doubt that it would work through the nail.  As few drugs are able to penetrate the nail.  Would work the best by removing as much of the fungus infected nail as possible before using this product.</li>
            <li> Bottom line: this stuff works. I had a slight, but noticeable case of toenail fungus on both of my big toes for a few years. I saw multiple doctors about it and essentially got a resounding, &amp;#34;There&#x27;s not much you can do. Get used to it.&amp;#34; I began to think I was resigned to having grotesque toenails for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being ever-persistent, I decided to search Amazon for an answer. Low and behold, this oregano oil saved the day. While it did take a while to come in, and has certainly taken a while to work (through no fault of it&#x27;s own), it WORKS! I&#x27;ve been applying this to both toes daily for about 2 months now and slowly but surely, the fungus toenail is growing out and the healthy toenail is growing in. Currently, the next time I clip my toenails, my right toe will be completely fungus free. My left toe will take a while longer as it was covered more. I do have photos, but I out of consideration for your eyes, I won&#x27;t post them...for now.</li>
            <li> Well, it really works. fungal infection causes my two big toes&#x27; nail grow thick and yellow. The black fungal dot took about 6 months to grow from a very tiny one to the whole toe nail. And sadly it didn&#x27;t get my attention until I felt my big toes loose and a little painful after kicking on wall. I bought this fungus stop, trim my toes nail as short as possible, use it once every day on all the toe nails because the fungal may pass from one toe nail to another. Cause the weather was still cold, I worn socks as usually. I see the therapy result after 2 months: the new growing nails are pink and healthy, not those thick, yellow sick nails.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad and appreciative that today&#x27;s medicine technology are so advancing, I can treat my fungal nail in such an efficient way. I heard that in the past people have to pluck the sick nail, sounds really cruel and wretched.&lt;br /&gt;Only one thing I am not satisfied is that it took too long for delivering!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product daily for 3 weeks and do see a significant difference on my fingernail. Not to mention they sent me a small gift of extremely potent and delicious Greek Oregano. It takes a while to receive from Greece but I would recommend this product. I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is my favorite product. Thank you Zane Hellas ltd!</li>
            <li> I read alot of good reviews, this actually made the situation worse. I used it for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Ordered last Wednesday. Estimated delivery time was supposed to be past July 13-Aug5. As you can see really fast shipping. Also came with a free sample of oregano to put on my food  (: . Will give 5 stars if it works, overall I am happy right now.</li>
            <li> This is our home emergency medicine.  It works miracle preventing cold at the beginning stage.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast, smells nice and came with a free gift! Love it and so far it seems to be working just fine so I&#x27;m happy as a clam.</li>
            <li> Product shipped quickly and was nicely packaged. I have a mild toe fungus on a few toes and I have followed the instructions for four weeks as requested and do not notice any results. Product application is simple and cost is low at $10 but no results to date.</li>
            <li> did not work at all&lt;br /&gt;very dissappointed</li>
            <li> Totally works.  I was hesitant, but now &amp;#34;I&#x27;m a believer&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Used for almost a month now no real big change just smells</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to see results but does work.</li>
            <li> The battle wasn&#x27;t closed totally so I just get half way full.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING.  So happy to finally find something that works and works fast.  The toenails quickly became less thick and I&#x27;m sure after a few weeks the discoloration will be gone.  THANKS, ZANE HELLAS</li>
            <li> Only used it for a few days, no much improvement!</li>
            <li> I think it is too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t solve the problem</li>
            <li> I used this product for 5 months following instructions. While I didn&#x27;t have the worst case, it was bad enough that if I was at the beach or pool I would use a semi-opaque &amp;#34;brightener&amp;#34; that brushes on and  conceals much of it. I was able to effectively record nail growth as I had a pin dot mark (some form of fungus, I assume) halfway up my big toe. Just this week it had traveled high enough up to clip. Still, mild discoloration remains that should have grown out at this stage, if this product was that effective. I will continue to use this product and report back by Summer&#x27;s end.  I waited  at least 6 weeks before revising my review. Despite continual use of this product, much of the fungus has returned.I purchased 2 bottles after hearing the glowing reviews but long wait for product. I&#x27;m not going to waste my time on the  other bottle. Obviously, people have had success but not me. I can&#x27;t recommend this product for that reason. Hope it works for you. Good luck.  For those discouraged by lack of results, it is my understanding the fungus must grow out first. Therefore, any treatment is going to require months. It&#x27;s still easier than brushing one&#x27;s teeth!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work, period! Even after 2 months there is no sign of progress. Worthless junk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m two weeks in  and already see a difference,  I&#x27;m so excited. ..I&#x27;m documenting my progress with pictures.  Can&#x27;t wait for a months progress! I will be posting  pics stay tune!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t really do anything for me. The strong is also very very strong...</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a timely manner, undamaged in a package properly designed for size, protection, and ease of opening.  Product is as advertised and does what is advertised.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed. After using consistently, I still don&#x27;t see results.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Excellent!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and really works!</li>
            <li> Best product for toenail fungus.  I have tried so many products with prescriptions and so many over the counter and none have ever worked.  This product is amazing.  With in a few weeks it has been changed the appearance of my toenails.  One thing that must be done is to never over apply it. Always apply a thin layer and let it sit on your toenails for about 10 mins and then take some tissue/napkin and remove some of the excess so buildu of the product doesn&#x27;t happen. Do this morning and night and you will see your toenails begin to clear up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product worth trying.  Good luck and I know you will love it too.</li>
            <li> I ordered this a week ago and it came. Consideringthe fact Amazon is saying it will be here on August 7 is definitely a win for me! Lol! It did come with a free bag of oregano which I love ! You can really tell the difference between their oregano and ours (US)! Its so much better! And the fact that its organic is great. I opened the bottle and I&#x27;ve read some of the review. I think it&#x27;s tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really hoping it works. I will update every month to let you guys know how my nails are going.</li>
            <li> Still using it,non improvements</li>
            <li> This stuff has really made a difference</li>
            <li> This is basically oregano oil.... it smells the same as the oregano oil I already owned. Oregano oil helps fight colds and other ailments.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for fungus hidden below toenail.</li>
            <li> Its taking time, but I do see an improvement in the clarity of the nail.  Its only been 3 wks.  Use it as soon as you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> it worked for me and its easy to use, shipping was going to take from 6 to 8 weeks but on my case it only took two weeks.</li>
            <li> Within a week of using this product (combined with the Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak; I got both together for a deal) I have noticed a SERIOUS improvement on my big toenail. It has gone from super yellow (a la corn on the cob) to more of a pastel yellow (like a super light colored Easter egg). It&#x27;s like the Terminator of nail fungus treatments! &amp;#34;Hasta la vista, baby.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I initially got the fungus on my toe last year after my best friend stepped on my toe with her giant combat boots. My toe went from dark purple to yellow in a matter of a week. I have been fighting it ever since with every product you can imagine. Nothing worked until I bought this product. This was really going to be my last try before I went to the podiatrist (which I am sure would&#x27;ve cost me a buttload of money).&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the herbs in this oil is pretty strong, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product,Thank you ZANE HELLAS. And the small gift was wonderful as well!</li>
            <li> At this point I am giving the product a 4star review but most certainly see a huge improvement! I would certainly recommend as I believe this is so far better than any chemical concoction 😎</li>
            <li> Just started using it and well i cant see nothing right now but the smell of is horrendous.</li>
            <li> it works!  AND excellent customer service</li>
            <li> This product is very useful, it helps kill fungus, you have just a little on your nails or toenails, this should help clear it up, make sure you clip your nail down till all the infected part is gone, then apply this to the affected area and let it soak in, if you use it consistently, you should start seeing progress within 3 weeks, make sure to repeat the steps above for best results. If you have full blown fungus, it would also be helpful to get the fungus soap wash, it will be a long tedious process, but with time, it will get better.</li>
            <li> Everything was excellent!!</li>
            <li> This is the third week, I have 3 more before I can comment</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;--- not a doctor, just desperate to find a non-steroid remedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product -- This is excellent. The product itself is STRONG. Expect to smell like oregano while using this as long as it is on your skin (if it burns/hurts, wash it off). This worked for my Palmoplantar Eczema!! (Mine is NOT severe, you might not want to try it on severe cases as it could harm rather than help). It doesn&#x27;t completely clear it up, but at least it does help with the palm, soles of feet breakouts, secondary infections (within a day or so), helps shed the excess skin being produced, and the skin to be a little more supple during the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping time -- Don&#x27;t be afraid to order by the long shipping time. mine arrived within a week from Greece!! This company (Zane) fulfills orders as received. I even received a small sample of Greek oregano (complimentary with their shipment to explain the product).</li>
            <li> As soon as I received this, I started using it, on my 4fingernails with the fungus, for almost 2 months! It DOES NOT WORK,plus, I never received any instructions with this product, a waste of my money! Using JUBLIA now,which I need to use every day for 48 weeks!</li>
            <li> The only OTC that really works.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work.  Nails didn&#x27;t get worse and it smells great, hence the 2 stars instead of one, but didn&#x27;t fix the problem.</li>
            <li> Great product my husband had one toenail that started looking a little yellow so I bought this he applies it after shower its been a week or so since he started and I am happy to report he has no more whatever it was In his toenail! Thanks fungus stop :)</li>
            <li> I like this product…it works for me!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been trying it long enough to give full review but so far no results.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works fast.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Definitely notice improvement in the appearance of my nails. Using it in conjunction with laser fungus removal on toenails.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product because I believe in the brand and the quality. Trust me, it has definitely lived up to expectations and would do business again!</li>
            <li> So, far it&#x27;s working good. I&#x27;ve already notice a difference and it&#x27;s only been 3 weeks!!</li>
            <li> Great customer service. Currently using the product. Hope I get good results &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for just over a month.  So far only some very slight improvement, hopefully more improvement with time.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It works very fast.  Have had a bad nail infection for weeks that would not clear up. I didnt expect such quick results&lt;br /&gt;but it cleared it up entirely in less than a week.  My Manicurist is going to order it.  I&#x27;ve tried everything she suggested &amp; nothing worked&lt;br /&gt;but this product.  Its the best product out here to safely get rid of fungus or bad infections.  Priced reasonably and their service is good.&lt;br /&gt;It ships from Greece.  They throw in a delicious sample of their awesome Oregano.</li>
            <li> the treatment is working albeit slowly.</li>
            <li> This really works!!!  I was quite surprised at how quickly my nail infection was cured, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This cleared my discolored nail within 2 - 3 weeks.  It also made my nail less thick so it was able to be cut with nail clippers.  This product does not do anything for foot fungus, but, works well on nails.  There is a scent associated with this product so you may need to adapt a little.</li>
            <li> Working great after 2 weeks! Fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> It has not worworked as fast as I thought it would...but this is my first experience with nail fungus...so I can not really sasay how quickly it should have worked...I am of course satisfied with on going results...</li>
            <li> fast service from Greece seems to work early days</li>
            <li> I had a very persistent case of nail fungus on one of my big toes.  I used this nightly before bed, and after 3-4 months my nail is growing out cleanly.  I suspect it works by both the antimicrobial action of the oregano oil, and the fact that the oil suffocates the fungus.  The one downside is the oregano oil is extremely pungent.  For that reason I only applied it at night.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would work for me as it did for everyone else who reviewed the product, but it didn&#x27;t. I followed the instructions religiously and nothing. Was hoping for it to work as it is a natural product.</li>
            <li> smells just like oregano and  seems effective, also enjoyed the free sample of dried  oregano that was inhcluded</li>
            <li> Effective, smells like oregano so my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> Seems to work well and I&#x27;ve tried lots of different products.  People complain about the smell, but I don&#x27;t see why.  It smells like oregano....how bad could that be?</li>
            <li> This Product has great results.</li>
            <li> frankly speaking. I think it is useful. of course i eat tablets at the same time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 3 weeks now and a marked improvement to my toe fungus. I&#x27;ve tried just about every over the counter product to rid me of my toe fungus but this is the only stuff that has worked.</li>
            <li> At 57 years old, the fungus in my toe nails has been there for years.  I have spent so much money on treatments and products.  I have used this product for over a month now.  Since this product is applied to the nail I also got another product that I apply to the cuticle area around the nail. I honestly think it has helped with the smaller toe nails but the big toe nail is still yellow but seems to be getting clearer so I am getting another order of it.  I hope that in a couple of months I have better news.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  The best my husband has used.  Starts working immediately.  Worth the wait to arrive from Greece, although it did arrive sooner than expected.  Did order another product to use while he was waiting for this one and it was not nearly as effective.</li>
            <li> This thing makes miracles LOL. Highly recommended. If you can deal with your foot smelling like oregano for 5 minutes then this is for you. The Oregano smell fades away within minutes after putting it in. This really does work.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month with no results.</li>
            <li> Started seeing results in DAYS! I&#x27;ve tried many different products over the last 2yrs without results and this is the only product that actually worked.</li>
            <li> Great product! Would buy again. Arrived well packaged, with good info and gift, and arrived quickly. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The smell was way to strong.  The smell made me sick.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  The price was right, especially considering it came all the way from Greece with Greek stamps on the envelope! This is an oregano oil product and a very good one. Your toes will smell like pizza. Anybody who doesn&#x27;t like that, is nuts!</li>
            <li> My wife has suffered from fungal toenail - big toe only. We have used this for 2 months now, and she says it is allowing her toenail t recover and look normal, I agree. Not as nearly deformed or warped.  We will order again...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and it seems to be working well. I just don&#x27;t like its smell which is a bit strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working, but it is slow. I&#x27;ve been using 2x every day for over a month, and while I am making progress and my nails look much better, it does take a long time.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and work after about month using it....I am ordering another one for any future uses if needed...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled a nail fungus on my big toe for at least 10 years. I haven&#x27;t tried any prescription medicine, but have experimented with every OTC remedy with no results. I used this product religiously a couple of times each day starting in February, 2015. At first I didn&#x27;t think it was doing anything but as the nail grew out, I started to get optomistic. Now it&#x27;s July - the toenail has grown out significantly and it is apparent that the new growth is fungus-free! I&#x27;ve probably got another 5 or 6 weeks before the last of the damaged nail grows out but I am convinced that the fungus is gone.  I&#x27;m still using it once a day just to be sure. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Brilliant stuff!! Worked for me!!</li>
            <li> Applied almost every day for four months. Complete waste of time; didn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
            <li> Excellent product so far. It is strong also because all the death nail fall off within days of using the oil. Now my nails are growing much better. I continue to use the product until my nail are healthy again&lt;br /&gt; Thank you Zane Hellas.</li>
            <li> First all, the owners of this product have excellent customer service. The shipment too longer than expected, so they decided not to charge me for the product, but in addition, they sent  me additional quantity again free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was impressive on my initial use. My toes affected by fungus, showed small signs of improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I must admit that, I might be having advanced toe fungus. But, in my observation, this product is the only one so far that has made a little dent to my my toe fungus problem. Continuous application of product was not fruitful (no further improvement on the toe nails).&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the product to somebody with a mild toe fungus problem, but not for curing advanced toe fungus.</li>
            <li> My husband has had a hard time getting rid of toe fungus. It has been about 3 weeks and his toes look better than they have in years. It doesn&#x27;t smell awful either. He is really pleased.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  I&#x27;m 33 years old and my toenails almost look 22 again!  I was pretty skeptical, but thought it was worth a shot. The directions say to use every day for a month, however being a new mother of two babies there were days I forgot to do it.  So I&#x27;m about a month and a half in  and my results are amazing.  The yellowing of my toenails used to go halfway down my toenail, and now is almost gone.  My only advice is to make sure  you clean underneath your nailbeds  thoroughly each time you shower.  Also, when I could remember I would coat my toenails with coconut oil,  and do not use any nail polish during this time! This will help maximize your results!</li>
            <li> This product works!  I used it faithfully for 30 days, applying it in the morning and at night.  I&#x27;m.  The toe nail fungus is gone!  I tried tea oil, Vicks, and Epsom salt.  This product out did them all for me.</li>
            <li> smelll never leaves you.You should not sell this product.</li>
            <li> Customer service was 5 stars for sure......  I am glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> Only have been using it for about two weeks.  Toe nail seems to be clearing up.  First time I used my toe got sore and turned red.  Tried again after a week toe was slightly red but no pain, after the second day no problems at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working great.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks, and my toenail is almost back to normal.  It hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy in years.  And it smells like Oregano.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working better than so called anti fungus medicine .</li>
            <li> I have been trying to cure fungus on one of my big toes for the last 5 years, I saw this product on Amazon with great views and decided to purchase it. This is one of many that I have tried. I started using this product on 28th March, so I have been using it for one month and one day and applying the product once a day before I go to bed. Currently about 80% of the fungus on my big toe has cleared up, my toe nail seem to be growing at a faster pace than when the toe was completely covered in fungus, also the nail bed is not lifted anymore as prior to using this product almost the whole nail bed was lifted. I will definitely recommend this product to others. When my item was delivered I also got a free gift of oregano. THANKS ZANE HELLAS</li>
            <li> After several years of having black toe nails on each foot (one toe on each foot), I finally decided that I must have some type of fungus.  This product seemed to fit the bill and I started using it right away after it arrived from Greece.  I cannot be happier as the results were almost immediate.  After about two weeks one of my toe nails is almost completely cleared up.  The other one is clearing up to the point that I am happy to go barefoot now.  I would expect that a 30 day treatment will make both of my toes looking fantastic.  This product is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone who has fungus problems.  This is the best deal for the price, too as I have only used a small portion of the bottle.</li>
            <li> smells too strong oregano. I don&#x27;t want to turn my home into oregano smell.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me after using it twice daily since purchasing it. I&#x27;m still using it and hoping.</li>
            <li> Tried it but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Seeing fast results, I have been using for two weeks on a toenail. Before I used Vicks vapor rub and covered with a bandaid for 2 months without much change. Two weeks with this and healthy toenail has grown out half way. I&#x27;m applying then covering with fabric bandaid when wearing shoes. When I remove them I take off bandaid and reapply. Awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> Finally a product that works on nail fungus. Be patient apply daily to clean filed nails. The product came from Greece, seller send a gift also, I&#x27;ve tried 4 or 5 fungal treatments from this site and I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> After 2-3 weeks I have seen an improvement in the fungus spot on my big toe by using this about 2 times daily along with soaking my feet in a tee tree oil soak. The fungus has stopped spreading and the color is fading as well.</li>
            <li> does not work for me, sorry.</li>
            <li> It is a bit strong as far as the odor is concerned, but it worked quickly.  I noticed an improvement in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> no, it did nothing, applied it twice a day for 2 weeks, it smells really bad.</li>
            <li> I am giving this two stars because after a short time of using this maybe a month or less, my nail turned black and looked like it was going to fall out. Now three weeks later, it never fell out just a black looking nail. I thought a new nail would be growing underneath but I don&#x27;t see anything. I stopped using it, not sure if I should go back to Fungiban which didn&#x27;t work but didn&#x27;t turn the nail black either. Did this happen to anyone else?</li>
            <li> All it is, is liquid Oregeno. And it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nearly everything and this works best and is by far the easiest to use.  Just one application a day and wait 5-7 minutes for it to soak in vs. ReNew which requires twice a day application using fresh band-aids for each application, keeping the band-aids on all night and all day.  Also, the Zane Hellas Fungus Stop makes my feet smell like gourmet pasta (from the oregano) which my husband loves.  He hates the smell of tea tree oil.  I will definitely be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> I am still in the process of using it.</li>
            <li> Not sure what is happening when I use this product?  I apply to my big toe that has stubborn fungus and it goes numb.  Shortly there after my foot is hurting also.  Has anyone else had this problem?</li>
            <li> SEEMS TO BE WORKING WELLL OVER TIME! WORTH THE MONEY GETTING!</li>
            <li> all i can say is after using this for a whole month {NO MORE TOE FUNGUS!} I didnt care for the smell but its a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> Be patient it takes weeks to see a change</li>
            <li> it didnt help one bit</li>
            <li> I have been very neglectful in using this &amp;#34;Fungus Stop&amp;#34; and much to my delight and surprise my toenails are much better!  It&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was battling athlete&#x27;s foot for a couple years.  I went through products like Tinactin and Lotrimin as directed which relieved but didn&#x27;t permanently cure the infection.  SO SO frustrating.  Finally I asked my dad who is a family doctor of 45 years, and he goes to his medicine cabinet and pulls out this little bottle of FUNGUS STOP and says, &amp;#34;Why didn&#x27;t you ask me before?  This stuff works.&amp;#34;  Yeah, good question - sh#%@t.  I applied it as directed and even within a day I saw results and felt relief.  After 2-3 weeks you could see no sign of athlete&#x27;s foot!! Halleluiah!!! Seriously, the relief was like crossing the finish line of a flipping marathon.  A side note, Another thing that countered my impression of Fungus Stop was that the price is really reasonable which initially made me suspect since I had spent so much on medications already. Don&#x27;t be fooled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the other thing though - you are going to need to take the steps to rid your infected shoes of the fungus which is another project.  I don&#x27;t have a sure fire solution for that and so ended up getting rid of a bunch of shoes as I didn&#x27;t want to risk getting reinfected. Also clean your bathroom floors and shower regularly.  Remember that fungus likes a moist, warm, dim place to live and thrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last thing, and I got this off of a blog I found while reading extensively online for various other success stories from other people all over the world.  SOAK your infected areas in white distilled vinegar for 15-20 minutes in am and in pm.  This will so so relieve immediate discomfort and will help clear up that fungus. Early on I also added cayenne pepper to the vinegar because some guy in Indonesia swore by it, so I thought, &amp;#34;What the heck - I&#x27;ll give that a shot, too.&amp;#34;  It seemed to actually help though you could feel the heat for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best to you all who are suffering from this!  The drug business is a bit of a shifty deal from what I can tell, but FUNGUS STOP works.  Thank you to this company for producing a product that does what it says it does.  You made my life a whole lot more enjoyable again with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps.  I just proofread this little box here, and it sounds like such a pitch! Please know that I am a real person (and an English major!) who has absolutely NO affiliation with this company!!  I am just really grateful my athlete&#x27;s foot is gone and want to help other people who are suffering as I did! Ok, I&#x27;m done here!  :~)</li>
            <li> USING IT 2X EVERY DAY. HAVE NOT YET SEEN ANY MAJOR IMPROVEMENT. I KNOW IT TAKES AVERY, VERY LONG TIME FOR THESE TOPICALS TO WORK. HAVE TRIED MANY OVER THE COUNTER LIQUIDS AND NONE OF THEM WORK. HOPE THIS ONE FROM GREECE WILL WORK</li>
            <li> I had fungus growth on just my great toe. I tried several remedies but the fungus continued to spread throughout the nail. I bought this product and now the fungus has FINALLY cleared up and luckily for me, never spread to my other nails. It took me way longer than the 4 weeks that it says on the instructions (bought this in February 2015 and it has finally grown out of my nail now in August 2015). I was very diligent about applying it to my affected nail every day and allowing it to dry completely before putting on any shoes or socks. I also started doing it after I got out of the shower, because I read somewhere that having your nail be softer (after showering or swimming) allows it to absorb better. I know it took a long time for me but I think that without using this product, the fungus would have continued to spread. Instead, everytime I clipped my nail the fungus gradually became less and less and did not spread.</li>
            <li> no improvement on toe nail fungus</li>
            <li> Absolutely unbelievable. While deployed overseas, I developed some toenail fungus because of the humid conditions.  I went to the Troop/Tactical Medical Clinic (TMC) and at first, they wanted to remove the toenail.  Then I asked them for some liquid fungicide.  They gave me a small bottle of KitoNail.  I have been trying it for three (3) months.  Very very little improvement.  I went on Amazon and found Fungus Stop.  It took a while to get to me, but I saw immediate results.  After only four (4) applications, I have seen a tremendous mark of improvement.  A truly outstanding product.</li>
            <li> This product proved to be an inexpensive, completely safe, and effective way to remove toe nail fungus from three nails&lt;br /&gt;that effected me for several years. Daily treatment for one month of a simple brush on liquid saved the time, money, and effort&lt;br /&gt;of visiting a podiatrist for laser removal. The product has an unusual pungent odor that dissipates within 25 to 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received and opened the package I noted the product is made in Greece and thought, oops - that probably is not&lt;br /&gt;a good indication of things to come. Wrong! Fungus Stop worked very well for me and if you have the patience to keep applying it daily for&lt;br /&gt;one to two months, it should do the same for anyone else.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that it seems to really work.  I have had fungal infections of my toenails for years that failed to respond to all the topical treatments that I tried, all of which were much more expensive.  I was about ready to try taking the anti-fungal pills until my dermatologist said they would not work for toenails.  So I tried this stuff because it was cheap in spite of the fact that I have never believed in nature-based cures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treating as directed, my nails started showing marked improvement in about three weeks.  I am now almost three months into treatment and I would guess that I am about clear -- it now  takes a close look to see the difference between the originally infected and uninfected nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some reviewers have been repelled by the smell of the main ingredient of oregano oil -- somewhat like that of dipping oils at pretentious Italian restaurants.  But bear with it, the smell goes away or weakens in time and the results are unbelievable.  In fact, I can&#x27;t believe some pharmaceutical company hasn&#x27;t pursued a medication of this type.</li>
            <li> This product has a foul, pervasive smell, and after several weeks of use, showed no results.</li>
            <li> Not patient enough I guess...went to something else</li>
            <li> This solution is amazing. I had a stubborn fungus on one nail for years. I also tried a lot of drug store over the counter treatments. They smelled terrible and did nothing at the end. This natural solution started working after only a few applications. Seller is also wonderful. The item was shipped promptly with a nice thank you letter and a present - a good size bag of wonderful oregano spice. Highly recommend the medicine and this seller.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and it works! I will purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 weeks and cant say that I notice Any difference but that&#x27;s the problem with toenails, they grow so slow. I will get another bottle and see hopefully this does the trick. The oil moisturizes the nail giving them a healthy appearance so I gave it an extra star for that.  I will say Dr. Blaines Tineacide worked faster but plateaued after 1 year. I also use a nail filer to file down the nail so its as thin as possible for the medicine to reach down.</li>
            <li> I think this really works.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost of the product and shipping costs. Extremely offensive stinking oil smell, which lingers well beyond bathing and showers. Smell quite noticeable to others and household members. Applied daily and used up all of the product, which provided no visible and tested results of improvement and or cure. It does not work! Achieved better results from OTC products sold by large and small retailers.</li>
            <li> **UPDATE on 7/26/15***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product...as well as practically every other product for my nail fungus.  Everything!  And guess what -- every single product, including this one, has failed.  In my experience there are two ways to deal with nail fungus, both requiring a trip to the doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Option 1: take the oral medication called Terbinafine (brand name is Lamisil).  For nail fungus, you need to take it for three months, maybe even a bit longer.  It does work, and it&#x27;s cheap.  You need to take a blood test to check your liver levels after you&#x27;ve been on it for several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Option 2:  Go to a foot doc that can call you in a compounded prescription (liquid) of Saicylic Acid, 5-FU, and DMSO.  The pharmacy will make it for you, and you apply it with a small brush.  The 5-FU is a chemotherapy medicine that stops the DNA in the cells from replicating.  My podiatrist gave it to me for a plantar wart, which it worked great on.  I tried it on my nail fungus on my thumbnail (not sure if it was nail fungus or a wart)...but in any case, it definitely did the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry folks, I&#x27;ve got no other good advice rather than visiting a doc to get oral medication or a compounded liquid prescription, if you want something that actually works.&lt;br /&gt;***********************************************************************************************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed is how powerful the smell is.  Like pure oregano only about 10 times stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I&#x27;ve been using it on my big toenail for a couple weeks now and I definitely notice a difference.  It&#x27;s not completely cleared up but it&#x27;s clearly better than when I started.  The thing about any of these topical treatments is that you have to use them day in &amp; day out in order to get results.  You can&#x27;t just put it on for a few days and expect the fungus to disappear.  So as long as you&#x27;re disciplined enough to use it every single day -- I actually use it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night -- you will see results after a few weeks.  Not sure how long it&#x27;ll take to get completely clear of fungus, I&#x27;m guessing at least a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff and reasonably priced.  Shipping was a bit slow but not unreasonable.  Seller sent some good oregano that we used on a pizza and it was awesome!  Really nice bonus for them to send that too.ay, once in the morning and once at night -- you will see results after a few weeks.

            <li> After a konth iI&#x27;m starting to see a difference in my nails</li>
            <li> It seems to be working</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do nothing even after using religiously for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;Be cheaper to sprinkle my toes with dried oregano every day. Would probably work better...</li>
            <li> Nothing...used everyday as directed on moderate nail fungus.  Had no results whatsoever.</li>
            <li> would not recommend!!! Received a broken bottle and it smelled so bad that it made me almost sick. Horrible stuff</li>
            <li> Great product and great service. Arrived waaayyyy before shipping date posted on Amazon, so that was awesome-sauce. Product works wonders and I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better to cure my toenail fungus. It works faster than any product or remedy that I&#x27;ve used. That&#x27;s the main reason I gave it 5 stars. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to and nothing less. Love it love it love it. :)</li>
            <li> This item took long to get here and about 30% of bottle was gone</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has worked for me</li>
            <li> Give it time to work.</li>
            <li> I got a real good pedicurist and had with her toghether a fight against fungal infestation about the last 5 years..... Sometimes there has been a bit improvement (at least it seemed to work that way...), sometimes even it seemed to be worst. I tried lots of chemicals and what the industry gives us to get her profite but it never worked longer than 3 up to 5 weeks. Now I tried that oil and have seen even right behind the first days that there has been some kind of &#x27;brightness&#x27; that I even thought it might be helpful. Now, after 5 weeks I have only a small place left with that fungus and that&#x27;s some kind of spot where I got some days before a down falling tile on. This nail has been damaged and with the fungus together it &#x27;worked fine&#x27;..... Nevertheless I tried to get that fungus away and nothing nothing nothing .....  Now I hope the fungus stop will find the way to the future to get the last signs of fungus drubbed. I would recommend to give this oil a try, at least I was spending a lot more money for the chemicals than for two bottles of this.....  Only to mention it; I&#x27;m German and I&#x27;ve to order that oil about US account what gives me some questions.... Might it help most of the people and the pharmacy is loosing money coze of the public wan&#x27;t buy their expensive  ??? Lots of positive reviews and recommendations on German AMAZON but that oil isn&#x27;t available at the moment.....  ?????&lt;br /&gt;And again; I recommend Fungus Stop strongly!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So excited to finally find a product that does what it says - I&#x27;ve tried most of the major ones, and they all without fail seemed to start off well, but after a few months the infection looked like it did at the beginning, and didn&#x27;t budge any further even with continued perseverance for months or sometimes years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has steadily worked over the last 3-4 months I&#x27;ve been using it, and now 2 out of 7 pretty badly infected toenails are about a third grown out with healthy nails clearly visible :) The other 5 (including a big toenail) look like they could take longer, but are certainly no worse than when I started applying this product. It&#x27;s very easy to use, just paint it on once a day (I do it before I go to sleep). If you have a stubborn infection that won&#x27;t budge with other products, I thoroughly encourage you to try this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing I&#x27;d suggest is to take a photo of your toenails (if you can face it!) before starting any new product, so that you can compare this with your toenails eg 6 months down the line, when you may have forgotten what they looked like before - and get an unbiased view on whether the product is working.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. I was allergic to it.</li>
            <li> I have not had any remarkable change in my condition in 23 days of use</li>
            <li> I believe I could take some olive oil and oregano and bottle this myself.  I did not see any results.</li>
            <li> Ok, left big toe, have been fighting a gross thick fungus nail for about 2 years; tried every over the counter product out there, no success at all.  Enter Fungus Stop.  Wow, it does have a strong odor, but I thought, heck, I need something strong to kick this fungus&#x27; tail.  So, I started using it daily without fail.  The directions say that it takes 4 weeks to work, but if it doesn&#x27;t work in 4, then it&#x27;s prolly not going to, so you can stop.  I didn&#x27;t stop at four weeks.  I kept going because what I did notice was while my nail looked much the same, I could tell the fungus was not replicating any more; something changed.  So I kept going.  Week 5, BINGO, I noticed it looked like the nail was lifting up, all that gross brown stuff was kind of puffed up and dried looking, so, I started pulling on it slowly and lifting it off.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it, the whole nail was coming off.  I didn&#x27;t know what to expect to see underneath, but I was like this bad boy is coming off!  So, I pulled it all off to reveal a normal looking half nail growing in the nailbed below.  WOW, I hadn&#x27;t seen a normal nail on that toe in 2 years!  So, that&#x27;s the point I&#x27;m at now, letting the normal nail grow out!  I&#x27;m so encouraged!  Keeping it going!!!  Give this a try guys!  Just don&#x27;t hold the bottle underneath your nose when you are using it.</li>
            <li> Excellent service. I am using it for two weeks and seen changes in the toe nail.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! ALREADY see a difference!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;ve used it 2 days and I can really see a difference!</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave a 3 star rating to this product is that it&#x27;s my 3rd week of treatment and I am still waiting to see if there is any improvement. I am fighting toenail fungus for the last 6 years - just a  big toenail, but it is enough. It started as a blue dot under the nail, then it evolved into a complete fungal nail over the years. The toenail has gone through getting embedded into the nailbed (in a corner, followed by horrible pain), the separation from the nail bed, over production of keratine under the nail bed. My advice to all of you guys si to respect the following rules during the treatment: 1. Always wash your feet and let them dry for 30 minutes. 2. Before applying Fungus Stop, in case your toenail has already separated from the nail bed, clean under the nail, and remove the excess keratin that has built up. I do this every 5 days. 3. Apply Fungus Stop under the nail and on the surface of the nail. Since the product is an oil, obviously you will see a color change  immediately - into a more transparent-healthy looking toenail. This happens in fact because you are dealing with an oil, so the nail keratin is impregnated with the oil. 4. Let it dry for at least 15 minutes before you put sheers, socks, shoes, etc. Never ever apply nail fungus treatment and/or clean under the toenail without washing your hands immediately afterwards with soap an water. Toenail fungus apparently gets under the toenail and infects it if there is any injury, even a minor one. We have plenty of those on our skin without even noticing, not to mention under or around our nails. Always disinfect your utensils - if you have no alcohol at hand drop them into boiling water and leave the utensils in to the boiling water for 15 minutes, then air dry. I have tried a lot of remedies over the years - Dr Scholl, over the counter /CVS products that promised miraculous cure - nothing worked. What I am trying now is a combination of vinegar bathing before Fugus Stop. The left corner of mytoenail is starting to grow promising, healthy. The other corner is not healthy yet. I will insist to continue the treatment even for longer than 4 weeks - until I finish the content of the bottle and then I will update the review. I really hope it works. Toenail fungus is so horrible to deal with, so stubborn and painful and frustrating. But maybe this treatment works.</li>
            <li> This stuff works.  It actually worked very quickly for me.  Will reorder for sure if this problem ever happens again.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Smells like oregano and hasn&#x27;t done anything for my toenails so far.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Effective. Thank you.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLLEEEE SMELLS BAD AN HAVENT SEEN ANY GOOD RESULTS HONESTLY LOOKS LIKE MY NAILS ARE WORST.....LOOOSING HOPE...DONOT WAIST UR TIME AN NONEY</li>
            <li> Excellent! Way better than the other high priced products.</li>
            <li> I have real bad toe nail fungus where my nail came off .... This helping it to grow back but the process is slow but it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> This works! Also affordable!</li>
            <li> Fungus Stop worked so well. I see a noticeable difference already on my toes in just three weeks. I feel this product will do the trick!</li>
            <li> So far I have not seen results, maybe required of more treatment time, I need more information</li>
            <li> I have been using this little miracle in a bottle for about one month, and I am amazed at the progress. Other products just don&#x27;t work, but this does.&lt;br /&gt;I have battled  toe nail fungus for most of my life, and I will be keeping a bottle of this product on hand at all times from now on.  Right now, I&#x27;m looking at what was my worst toe nail, on my big toe, and it finally looks like a normal toe nail ! My hope is, that my other problem nails will also look this good in time. I give this product a A+++++++++++++++++++++++++.</li>
            <li> It did not help at all. From all of the reviews I expected it to make a small change within the 3 1/2  weeks of use, but absolutely no change at all. As a matter of fact I think it looks a little worse. The smell is not bad at all, it smells as if I am cooking an Italian dinner, but not for my toe. I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> see a slight difference in only a few days. Need to take it for a few weeks, even months</li>
            <li> It helped some, but didn&#x27;t get rid of the fungus entirely, I ended up going a podiatrist.</li>
            <li> Started working quite quickly.  The smell is a added bonus...very refreshing!</li>
            <li> good prouduct ,,,will use it again  ,,,good service</li>
            <li> Love this product! I combined this with a foot soak in organic apple cider vinegar every day. I have tried endless other things and this works but be patient it can take months. I also used a rotary power nail file to remove the heavy fungus areas each week. Fungus is a tough thing to kill - so be vigilant.</li>
            <li> Only product that worked for my little pinky toe. Saw results after a couple of days. Recommended product. All others I have tried gave not work.</li>
            <li> more than expect,amazing.satisfy</li>
            <li> This product works and works well. It has cleared up a problem toe, but it has not yet completely removed the problem. It has been about two months of use. I&#x27;m now switching between this and others trying to wield the final death blow. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with the product, just can&#x27;t give it a 5 because it has yet to totally resolve the problem. Having said that, when it runs out I will buy more, this will also be good for maintenance.</li>
            <li> Used for 3 months... nail showed some improvement, but not cured and still pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m two weeks into my treatment and I have seen progress.. funky smell but you get used to it after a couple of days. Speedy shipping from Greece and included in the package a small gift.</li>
            <li> Amazing. I used it once and my toe was half cleared.</li>
            <li> Used it diligently and as directed and did not see improvement. Packaged well and fairly fast shipping, but it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My problem was not huge, but I had had it for over 2 years and nothing helped. THIS HAS ALREADY. After just one week the fungus feelers have disappeared and the naik ends are clear again. THANKS</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad toenail fungus and can&#x27;t take oral medication because it would be too hard on my organs me having Type 1 Diabetes.  I tried tea tree oil, NonyX and foot washes to no avail.  This is the only topical treatment that actually worked for me.  It takes a while to see actual results though.  The nail needs a chance to grow and it took a solid year for my big toe to completely grow out.  My nails are clear and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this stuff at all, has a very strong smell like you have a greek salad on your toes.  It made my big toenail look discolored and didn&#x27;t seem effective.  Kerasal works MUCH better, I threw this away.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!  It took a few months of  every day use, but this product, unlike so many others that I have tried, got the job done.  My nails have grown out, and really look  good.  The seller sent the product out in a timely manner, and even included a &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34; note with the order.  I&#x27;d like to thank him, for having such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Looks like it is working, will review further when the fungus is all gone!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.  After examining a number of options (including the new prescription medication that costs HUNDREDS of dollars) and reading the reviews here, I decided this was worth the effort.  Well, after 3 months of dedicated use, I am pleased to report that this stuff works.  You have to be diligent about using it.  Don&#x27;t expect a quick result.  You have to have the material penetrate into the nail bed and into the nail.  You have to wait for the nail to grow out.  You can&#x27;t skip days.  Application twice a day is better than just once.  Just stay on it.  I had two different types of fungus and both nails are clear now.  Needless to say, I cannot be happier.</li>
            <li> I bought this initially because I didn&#x27;t want to use chemicals that would be absorbing into my feet. I read tons of reviews and the main things that stuck out were people complaining that they had &amp;#34;feetza&amp;#34; (feet that smelled like pizza) and that the smell was overwhelming. I made the purchase months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I&#x27;m not completely sure if I was plagued with fungus on my two big toes. They were yellowing and the tips of the toenails were starting to recede (?). To me that is signs of possible fungal infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the question of whether or not wearing nailpolish is okay or not while using this??? I couldn&#x27;t really find the answer, and in my opinion, if you have that layer of nailpolish on your nails then how is the application supposed to adequately absorb into the nail? Painting it on and around the nail only works so well and how do you get it to adequately absorb in and under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had a fungus it was in the early stages, probably within a time frame of 6 months when I would get my pedicure I would frown at my feet wondering why they looked dark. I thought maybe it was the nailpolish, but when it looked like it was worsening then I became concerned. I feel that I caught it fast, and the people who say that they can&#x27;t rid their fungus, I don&#x27;t know how long they took before they started their treatments?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways I opted for NO nailpolish and to stop going to get pedicures and just care for my feet myself while using this. Thus I could completely control the &amp;#34;experiement&amp;#34; without outside factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The smell is a gentle oregano scent that does not bother me at all. It&#x27;s not overpowering like other people stated and I do not feel like I have &amp;#34;feetza&amp;#34;. I am thinking everyone&#x27;s sense of smell is different, so probably the ones complaining have sensitive noses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since I received it immediately after my shower. I am not only applying it to the big toes, but to all my toes. I place a generous amount to where it can soak in and around the nail to get under the nail. I keep my toe nails trimmed almost to the skin so that there&#x27;s little space between the applicator and the toe so that I can get optimal coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my left big toe, the discoloration has pretty much disappeared and the toe looks healthy and is growing normally. On my right foot, the discoloration is still slightly there and only on the upper right side does the nail seem to still be stubbornly growing irregularly still, but it is lessened from before I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I have fungus? The symptoms pointed to yes. Does this work, I believe it does, with consistency and a little bit of suffering. I MISS having my feet looking pretty with nailpolish, and I don&#x27;t enjoy walking around in flip flops without perfectly pedicured feet. But it is worth it to suffer and fix the problem than to hide it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone, I think it would have helped me decide on what to buy sooner if I had read something like this, because I had also bought another fungus eliminator but that one was all chemicals and gross. I never used it but I had opened it and I&#x27;m not sure it could be returned so I wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;In addition it was awesome that along in the package was a sample of kitchen oregano. Tastes wonderful on real pizza!&lt;br /&gt;:)toes, but to all my toes. I place a generous amount to where it can soak in and around the nail to get under the nail.

            <li> I was very skeptical when I first ordered this product as a few of my family members have been battling toenail fungus for decades and have had no luck with any treatment, including prescriptions. When I noticed a yellow and disfigured lump on my toenail, I suspected the fungus, but wasn&#x27;t sure because it didn&#x27;t cover the entire nail, like I&#x27;ve seen on others. Nevertheless, I immediately went to the store and bought Fungi-Nail brand toe and fungus treatment. It was only after using that product for a few days, that I read the micro-print label under a magnifying glass and discovered that it was \\&quot;...not effective for scalp or nails.\\&quot; So, I found this product on Amazon and ordered it. Shipping time was at least 3 weeks, maybe 4. It came from Greece.    I used Fungus Stop once daily after showering for about a month before the Fungus had grown off the nail almost completely. The yellow disfigured part of the nail did not disappear, but did not spread and grew out to the tip, where I eventually clipped it off during regular trimming. To begin with, I was only treating the nail with the obvious infection. I knew that it was nail fungus when near the end of the first month, the original affected nail had almost cleared up entirely, but I noticed a similar infection on another nail on my other foot. I now use the product on each nail on both feet each morning. I have been doing so for about a month now, the first infection is entirely clear and the second infection is not spreading. Like the first, the affected part of the second nail is growing out and gradually getting trimmed off. I have not had problems with the infection spreading to any other nails, since using it on all toes.    This is a great product, I have ordered a second bottle to share with family. The bottles are small, but they go a long way. I use one dip of the brush to cover all five nails on each foot. After about 30 days of treating just one nail, and over 30 days of treating all 10 toe nails, I stillhave over half a bottle left. It&#x27;s well worth the reasonable price.    Update 1/27/2015: The second bottle arrived in only 8 days.</li>
            <li> I have tried 3 other fungus products and have been very disappointed with the results.  This actually works as stated. 2 weeks into usage and I can see clear toenails. It is necessary to keep them filed down on a weekly basis. Once a nite and let dry before socks or shoes. I do beleive that I have found the answer this time. We shall find out. The brush that comes with it makes application nice with no mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this once or twice a day for the last 5 days or so and I would say that I definitely see a visible improvement in the look of my affected toenails.  The product comes all the way from Greece and the merchant included a nice little sample of Greek oregano that my wife actually used in a dish.  The only thing I would recommend the seller do is put the instructions on the bottle.  I still don&#x27;t know how often they recommend me to apply this solution and whether I should do it before or after showering, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say this is definitely worth giving a shot (much better and safer than going to the podiatrist and getting a pill that can screw up your liver.)</li>
            <li> This is the best I have used so far and there are very great results</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get past the awful smell even after washing a couple of times. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> the smell is SO incredibly overpowering that I could not use it.</li>
            <li> YOu have to be consistent with this! It works. My nails are like half and half now, half of the old thick nail growing out and what&#x27;s coming in is new and smooth and shiny. Be patient. There is literally a line where you can see the difference.</li>
            <li> Great product. Seems to be working well so far</li>
            <li> All Zane Hellas products are of the highest quality and highest effectiveness - most probably in the world.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest to everyone.</li>
            <li> The fungus is going away.  I&#x27;m glad that I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> It believe I acquired toe nail fungus after getting a pedicure. For over a year, I have tried different products, both prescription and over-the-counter. Nothing was effective. In just a few months, this inexpensive and easy to apply liquid has completely cured the toenail fungus and I am going to order another bottle to keep on hand in case the ailment returns. I have never written a review before, but without reservation, I can recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a little over a month now, and I&#x27;m very, very pleased with the results. My toenail fungus (I know...not the most pleasant topic, but we&#x27;re all in the same boat here) didn&#x27;t clear up right away; I think the product needs time and nightly applications to get to the root of the problem. After about 3 weeks, however, I saw a noticeable improvement. At first, I was just putting it on the two toe nails in question, but now I&#x27;m using it on the others as well since fungus can spread easily. I wait the recommended 7-8 minutes before putting socks on. Yes, your feet smell like oregano, but I just put it on at night and a quick morning shower washes it right off. The directions say to use it nightly for 4 weeks, but I&#x27;m on week 5 and think I&#x27;ll continue to use it for a little while longer. I don&#x27;t see why long-term use (as prevention) would be a problem, but I&#x27;ll take a little break for a few weeks from time-to-time. Bottom line: Love this product and highly recommend it. It&#x27;s natural, so I feel good about using it. It also arrived ahead of schedule and with a generous sample-size of their food-grade oregano.</li>
            <li> This is the best anti-fungus that I have used so far. It is very effective. It takes about 4-6 weeks to heal thinner nails. For thicker nails, such as toe nails, it takes a longer time to heal, but the progress is visible as the new nail coming out is fungus-free. I believe with time, all the fungus will be out of my feet. I am very happy that I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product for the reviews that it received, hoping that I would be another satisfied customer but it was not so for me. I followed the directions in how to use the product for the amount of time it recommended and did not see any difference. This is just unfortunate that this product did not work.</li>
            <li> Excellent product..!! It was well packed and arrived earlier than expected. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me, has very strong herbs smell that is overpowering. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have been through more anti fungal remedies/medicines than I can count.  Having bad fungus under 4 toenails on one foot has been a problem for me for the last 5 years. Nothing seemed to change the appearance or fix the problem, so I decided to order this product, solely based on it being the top rated solution on amazon. It&#x27;s been three weeks so far and I am seeing fresh nail growing out with NO traces to fungus.  Iv&#x27;e been applying once in the morning and once at night and allowing 10 minutes after application before putting on socks and shoes. On my big toe especially, the new growth has come out about one third of the way and keeps getting clearer. I highly recommend this product for nail fungus.</li>
            <li> Been using it for 1 month; so far no success. Let us see what unfolds over the next month.</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping with the toenail fungus, and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months and it has made no difference what so ever.</li>
            <li> I am using it right now,don no how it is working I need time to see</li>
            <li> On second bottle.  This product delivers what it promises.  The fungus toes are gone.</li>
            <li> Updated review: After using this for 4 weeks now, I can better describe its effectiveness. The product does work. But, you must be diligent and patient with it. This is not something you can put on your nails every now and then and hope for fungus-free nails in the morning. After almost 4 weeks of using this product, I can definitely see improvement. The top of my nail is still discolored, but the lower half is completely clear and healthy looking, and as my nail continues to grow, all of the discoloration rises to the top where I can clip off the nail. As my nail continues to grow, I will keep using this product (even though the directions only say 4 weeks). After 4 weeks the bottle is still 2/3 full, so no need to buy another.  A few tips: 1.I used the product morning and night 2x a day, and sometimes 3 if I was changing socks after going to the gym. I would recommend applying twice a day. 2. While waiting for this product to arrive in the mail, I poured isopropyl alcohol (91%) on my nail every day, morning and night, and then applied tea tree oil. After this regimen I was already starting to see results, but the Fungus Stop got things cleared up more quickly. 3. Even now, I apply the alcohol and let it dry after getting out of the shower and then apply the Fungus Stop. The combination seems to work better than either one alone.   4. Just because you still see discoloration on your nail after 4 weeks does NOT mean the product isn&#x27;t working. If the nail is clear with new growth below the discolored area, then be patient and keep applying the product. It takes time for the nail to grow out completely.  Original review: I just received this in the mail, so I can&#x27;t give a review on how well the product works yet; I&#x27;ll write an updated review after a month of use. But, I was very pleased with the shipping. Seller said it would take 4-6 weeks to receive, and I got it 2 weeks from the order date. Thorough instructions, easy to apply, and smells like fresh herbs! Hope itworks.</li>
            <li> Shipping was good ,but product didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> Took a few weeks to get this because it ships from Greece but it is a great product and Zane Hellas sent a free gift in my package of dried Oregano which is delicious!  The product smells like Oregano because it is made from the oil but I have only been using it for a week and I can already see a big improvement!  I&#x27;m going to go ahead and order my 2nd bottle now :o)</li>
            <li> Great product and great company to do business with.</li>
            <li> After trying everything OTC, I finally stumbled across this product and due to the reviews, reasonable cost, and desperation! I ordered it. I was amazed at how quickly it arrived, even faster than some USA shipping I have had, and after two weeks of use I can say, without a doubt, it is working. My toenails are starting to look a healty pink and that dreadful, thick yellow crust is gone. I have a ways to go, but nothing, nothing has produced the results this natural product has given me. PLEASE give this wonderful treatment a try. My only regret is that I did not order 3 bottles of it!</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get over how strongly it smells of oregano...</li>
            <li> Was broken and a mess when received had to throw away.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for about 2 weeks now and it&#x27;s working . I will keep you posted for more results</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels like its working on the first try.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me not even a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Will purchase more in the future for sure! Love, Love, Love!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my large toe have toe nail fungus for most of my life, so when I tried&lt;br /&gt;this, within a couple of days, I could already see it regrowing a new toe nail!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sooooo happy with this and soon I will be able to wear sandles without hiding&lt;br /&gt;my toe!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work and had hi hopes after reading all these reviews however I have seen no improvement what so ever after a month of use. I have used it daily and some times twice a day never missing a day yet still no sign of improvement just like others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I am happy to have purchased it, but I have not used it yet!</li>
            <li> Horrible stuff.... it has a weird burning sensation that lingers. The bottle also leaks, and it smells so bad I can&#x27;t even describe it. The smell stays forever, even after washing your hands multiple times. In addition, shipping took way too long. When it did arrive there was a free sample of oregano (which has nothing to do with the product so I don&#x27;t know why it was included) and the oregano had busted open. This stuff is an oil so it was all over the bottle and all over the floor. Very disappointing</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.  This is really work</li>
            <li> I have been using it for two weeks. My nails look and feel much better. They are not yet cured but it is the best treatment I have used so far and I&#x27;ve used close to a dozen.</li>
            <li> My order got here with pretty good timing. I&#x27;ve got to admit that my fungus issue isn&#x27;t as bad as other buyers, whose reviews i read and helped me determine the purchase. But recently I noticed my nails where looking unhealthy, yellow, the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen them.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks. You are suppose to use it once daily. I suck at getting into new habits so I have skipped a day or two, maybe even three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell seemed a little strong to me, it&#x27;s not pleasant but it&#x27;s bearable. Right after the first use I checked, I knew my condition wasn&#x27;t better but it just made my nails LOOK better. It&#x27;s like it suppresses the bad coloring. That alone made me feel ok about my purchase because it made me less conscious. I always painted my toe nails because I didn&#x27;t like how it looked without nail polish. So 3 weeks in, even though I&#x27;ve skipped a few days my condition has not worsened. For the price I paid. It makes me feel ok.  Once I start seeing a significant difference I will update my review.</li>
            <li> For now, just giving it four stars. Took about 20 days to get here and I&#x27;m only on my 3rd day. So we shall see.&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the commentary so far. We have a new term in our house. It&#x27;s called &amp;#34;Feetza&amp;#34;... Like Pizza. The smell of this stuff is really strong of Oregano. I love the smell of Oregano as well as most herbs and spices. But when I say the house will smell like an Italian Salad Dressing or a heavily Oregnao loaded pizza, I mean it. I put a dab on each toe, wait for it to dry and put white cotton socks on. The socks don&#x27;t help. Smell just bleeds through. I don&#x27;t recall if I put my sneakers on if the smell is still that strong but, I might just be getting a little use to the smell. My wife came home from work and wondered what the smell was. Told here we are having &amp;#34;Feetza&amp;#34; for dinner tonight. LOL...&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, just be forwarned. I don&#x27;t know how long I can take it because after while you just get tired of the smell. But I will keep trying as I want my prob to go away. I was using Tea Tree Oil straight before. Might have to go back to that or I may see if I can cut this stuff with another Essential Oil with the same properties and a better smell.&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck... Your new &amp;#34;Feetza&amp;#34; Parlor is open for business! ;-)</li>
            <li> My husband has been only using it for about a week so it&#x27;s a bit hard to tell at this stage of the game.  From reading other reviews I am very hopeful. If it helps we will order a couple more bottles for my son who has a terrible fungus on his toenails. My husband clipped my sons toenails and did not disinfect the clipper, so now he has it also.  Crossing my fingers that it is as good as others state.</li>
            <li> It was the best than others I attempted to treat.</li>
            <li> Ok....so I&#x27;ve waited a whole month of use of this before I decided to write this review.  First off, let me tell what I&#x27;ve done to my toenail fungus over the yrs. I&#x27;m that person who have been suffering from toe nail fungus and their equally annoying cousins of athlete&#x27;s foot for over 15 yrs. I have tried everything....and I mean EVERYTHING from natural cures to over the counter products to laser treatment. You name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. To name a few, I&#x27;ve tried ---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- tea tree oil&lt;br /&gt;- apple cider vinegar with the &amp;#34;mother&amp;#34; and white vinegar&lt;br /&gt;- vicks vapor rub&lt;br /&gt;- menthol mouthwash&lt;br /&gt;- diluted bleach&lt;br /&gt;- toe nail fungus topical creams, ointments, etc...advertised on tv&lt;br /&gt;- emuaid (extra strength)&lt;br /&gt;- sriracha sauce (i don&#x27;t know...i got crazy!)&lt;br /&gt;- etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After yrs of having an OCD on my toe nails I finally tried the laser treatment (the PinPointe) as advertised on the The Doctor&#x27;s show. I thought after all the money I&#x27;ve spent on my toe nails over the yrs why not give it a shot? I have that $300 coupon online anyway. So I did it. Two toenails on my left foot, and all 5 toenails on the right. I was asked to apply a topical thing afterwards...similar to hydrogen peroxide which cost me $40 cause it&#x27;s sold out online which only cost $14. Agh...how abt that? Ok so after 3 mos, the 2 toe nails on my left were looking better, but not the 5 ones on the right. They actually got worse. I wasn&#x27;t going back...I figured that I probably need to do the laser thing a couple of times to actually see all these little monsters on my nails gone. Well...no money on that so bleh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soooo.....I came across a page that says Oreganol with P73 is the only treatment that will work on toe nail fungus. Here&#x27;s the link:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/North-American-Herb-Spice-0-45-Ounce/dp/B00012NJ4G&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first month that I applied it, I did see a difference. My toe nails look better. The bigger bottle (1 oz) cost me around$50 at a local health store. I applied it twice a day cause I got too excited. It made the skin around my toes irritated and itchy. I then stopped using it...then I came across this product. Could it be similar to Oreganol Oil with P73? I got to try cause it&#x27;s a lot cheaper...but wait it will come all the way from Greece? Ok well what have I got to lose unless if it gets lost in the mail? When I read that it kills 99.9% nail fungus, Lysol came to my mind right away. lol It&#x27;s gotta work and it probably has oreganol oil for which amount is only intended for toe nails? I don&#x27;t know...I gotta try especially after reading all these positive reviews! I mean I&#x27;ve tried everything...so why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s my verdict after 1 month of use: IT&#x27;S OKAY. It has the exact same effect of Oreganol Oil. The only difference is it has a built-in nail polish brush so it&#x27;s easier and more convenient to use. It made my toe nails look better but not great. Those little monsters are still there I could tell. Mind you, my toenail fungus aren&#x27;t even the worst case there is. I mean they&#x27;re not even super thick and yellow. They just have dark spots on the nail tip, brittle, and just won&#x27;t grow. Anyway, I guess this will work if you&#x27;re super patient....maybe after a couple of months...or even yrs. It takes 12 mos for toe nails to grow in full so....I don&#x27;t suggest for this to be used 2x a day cause it will definitely irritate the skin around your toes. It will itch like crazy. I do strongly suggest though to file your nail before using this, even lightly if there&#x27;s no more thickness to be filed. This dries out my cuticles so I apply coconut oil on my toes. Coconut oil has anti-fungal properties in it so that&#x27;s what I use. Other foot lotion and moisturizer with peppermint are ok but too much of them causes my Athlete&#x27;s Foot to happily come back. I just can&#x27;t win :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know that thing they say? That &amp;#34;They can send a man to the moon but they can&#x27;t do this and that?&amp;#34;.....well toe nail fungus cure is one of them.  IMHO, as long as there&#x27;s no cure for toe nail fungus, there will be no cure for cancer!</li>
            <li> Well, I love it! I&#x27;ve used this for less than a month and am seeing big improvement in a toe nail that was very bad. The nail discoloration is gone and it is growing out flat again. I don&#x27;t have the sensitivity to pressure on that nail anymore either. It also works great on dry scaly skin on the bottom of my feet. Just one application got rid of that problem! It does have a strong smell of Oregano, which I don&#x27;t mind - it makes me hungry for pizza actually. I wish this product was available in a bigger bottle with a roll-on applicator for doing the bottom of your feet. Something to think about. Thanks for the packet of dried Oregano - it&#x27;s wonderfully tasty!</li>
            <li> I just got it and started the treatment. So far it seems to be doing something. Have to wait and seem.</li>
            <li> I have used this alternately with another product &amp;#34;Clearly Fungi Free&amp;#34; for the last two months.  My big toenail is almost cleared of fungus now.  I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> So far, does the job really well!</li>
            <li> When my bottle arrived, it leaked a bit, as the top didn&#x27;t screw down tight, but this stuff really works!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it right away and I am already noticing a difference.  The instructions mentioned a light burning sensation, but when I felt it, it was WONDERFUL!  If you have ever dealt with that burning itch that comes with cracked toes, from althetes foot, that no matter how hard you scratch or twist, it still drives you mad with the itching, I put this stuff on and got that burn, they mentioned, and it was the most wonderful burn I have ever loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The itch went away immediately and did not come back.  After 48 hours and only 2 applications, all signs of the athletes foot was gone.  This does even more for the toenail fungus that you get under the nail.  I have a few of those toes that you just want to hide the nail, they are so ugly, but after soaking my feet and then a pedicure, I got an eye dropper and forced this stuff in and under the toenail, where you are trying to kill the fungus to get it to away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks, major improvements showing, already.  This stuff really does work and works very well.  Far better than that expensive stuff you get in the pharmacy, that you use for years and still have the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is all natural ingredients and again, that burn is the most wonderful kind of burn.  It&#x27;s the burn that says relief in so many ways.  I love this stuff and will be ordering again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really works.</li>
            <li> Great product - I have used oregano oil in the past so was not disappointed, arrived quickly and quickly cleared up the issue...will not hesitate to order from Zane Hellas again - and thank you for the loose oregano sample!</li>
            <li> seems to work. seems to be the ONLY thing that works.</li>
            <li> I used this twice daily until the bottle was used up. Made no difference. And the shipping took FOREVER.</li>
            <li> Got these and it works don&#x27;t waist your time on the other stuff this works fast too.</li>
            <li> Very good product, responsible seller, they even put a gift in the package. Thank you. I have read a lot about the benefits of oregano oil and so far I like it.</li>
            <li> It did not work for me, i used it for 10 weeks, every single day. I do not see any change or improvement. I had hope based on the reviews, but not.. not worked for me :(</li>
            <li> To early to tell yet, I like only have to use it once a Day</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> This has been a very good product for my husbands toe nails. They are starting to look healthy again.</li>
            <li> My toe nails are definitely looking better and it is so easy to apply. The scent is strong- pure oregano but I love it!</li>
            <li> Thank you!  Product arrived well before the due date! I also appreciate your extra gift!</li>
            <li> I have battled toenail fungus for over a year and tried numerous naturally based products. This is the only one that has helped tremendously. I cut back the nail and applied twice a day and it&#x27;s been 2 weeks. The bad nail underneath fell off and there is no visible fungus growing back. Finally, a naturally based product that works. Very happy and hopefully will have good toenails for this summers sandal season.</li>
            <li> I have tried allot of remedy&#x27;s that are over the counter and by a Dr. so far this is the best. Shipping was a bit longer then I expected but I did not realize it was from Greece.I am seeing results so it is a great product .</li>
            <li> Product is excellent and delivery was perfect.</li>
            <li> Too soon to know.  It seems to be helping a little bit after one week.  However, although it was packaged well, the cap was loose and some leaked out.</li>
            <li> I have been using Fungus Stop for a little over a week and it seems to be working.</li>
