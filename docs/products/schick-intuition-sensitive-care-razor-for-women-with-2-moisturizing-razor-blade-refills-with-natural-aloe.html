            <li>perfect.</li>
            <li>I did not have the best experience with these razors.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>It is a great idea - I just wish the razor had a bit of longevity.</li>
            <li>Another great thing is that this is a brand name razor so there are often coupons</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Great razor but</li>
            <li>Still, the convenience is great.</li>
            <li>However, each time you rinse the blades to remove hair the moisturizing bar attached melts away a great deal.  </li>
            <li>Great quality at great price.</li>
            <li>Very smooth , I have Veins and am scared to nik them ,very impressed with the product ,</li>
            <li>Its good for traveling though.</li>
            <li>Good buy</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good razor...and am still looking.</li>
            <li>There is nothing good to say about this razor.</li>
            <li>Recippient of gift loved it.</li>
            <li>I thought this razor was wonderful at first.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This shaver claims to be best for women due to it being made to shave a women&#x27;s curves best.</li>
            <li>This shaver claims to be best for women due to it being made to shave a women&#x27;s curves best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of razors over the years looking for one that would be both kind to my skin and effective at shaving.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great for a quick fix/on-the-go shave.</li>
            <li>Best razor I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li>The Sensitive Care Naturals is one of the best!</li>
            <li>No mess shaving with a perfect close shave every time.  </li>
            <li>It also feel very cheap, the razor blade wobbles while you shave and water</li>
            <li>I love this product and you can&#x27;t beat this price</li>
            <li>I Love this aspect.</li>
            <li>My favorite razor.</li>
            <li>until I dropped it so many times it broke.</li>
            <li>will not buy any more of your products even though the Schick razors are better than Gillette.</li>
            <li>I love how you don&#x27;t need shaving cream with this since when you shave, it has a bar of &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; or whatever it is on the razor itself</li>
            <li>I have a lot of allergies so was glad to find the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; version of this product.</li>
            <li>In fact, my skin felt better after using the Intuition.</li>
            <li>One more razor into the garbage.</li>
            <li>I always love using Schick razors...</li>
            <li>They do clog more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worked great for me with no negative skin reactions.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of not needing shaving cream, body wash or soap while shaving my legs and underarms and this razor also seemed like it was designed well to lather, moisturize and shave in one easy step.  </li>
            <li>They do clog more easily.  </li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>I really love the sweet smell that fills the shower when I use it.</li>
            <li>I liked this razor for the first 2 or 3 times I used it</li>
            <li>I was even less impressed.</li>
            <li>then it does with a cheap disposable razor.</li>
            <li>Makes shaving faster and easier and leaves my legs feeling silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I very rarely get razor burn, and I have fine/light hair, so please keep that in mind with this review.</li>
            <li>This review was originally 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;old</li>
            <li>With this razor, I couldn&#x27;t clean it.</li>
            <li>but I have to run the razor over my leg 4 times before I get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>then the blades die IF you clean the blades well</li>
            <li>suggest going with something else with a smaller, pivoting head and investing in a really good shave gel, like Coochy.</li>
            <li>Now I use them when I&#x27;m in a rush or just want a quick shave.</li>
            <li>the stuff around razor wears out too quick</li>
            <li>Turns out it leaves me feeling super itchy.</li>
            <li>If your super hairy whether a women or not.</li>
            <li>If your super hairy whether a women or not.</li>
            <li>It actually seems kind of cheaply made when you examine how the blade allows movement.</li>
            <li>and IF you keep the soap when not in use away from very hot water.</li>
            <li>and IF you keep the soap when not in use away from very hot water.</li>
            <li>so it makes it really easy and fast to shave.</li>
            <li>I did have to go over the same spots in some areas (mostly my knees) on my legs, but my skin felt super smooth</li>
            <li>every couple of days will not be fun on the pocket</li>
            <li>I love that you don&#x27;t need shaving cream because of the soap around the razor head and that you can order different scents of razor head to fit into the one razor.</li>
            <li>they melt right off.</li>
            <li>I always buy this and the price was right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rinse the head in warm to hot ( NOT very hot water) right before use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rinse the head in warm to hot ( NOT very hot water) right before use.</li>
            <li>Normally I put on shaving gel and shave and dip the razors in water to clean it and then repeat.</li>
            <li>Chunky of hair were stuck inside the razor after the first use and they wouldn&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re not using Intuition razors, you&#x27;re wasting everybody&#x27;s time.&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>I have perfected as much as possible the products I use to make sure none of them give me issues, and all of them work well.</li>
            <li>but, I no longer need cream with a better razor and different</li>
            <li>The blade and soap will last more then</li>
            <li>The blade and soap will last more then</li>
            <li>My first thought was that this was a pretty decent razor.</li>
            <li>I noticed a few natural oils (after the list of chemicals) and see that the box is an &#x27;earth friendly&#x27; box (which is nice)....</li>
            <li>I also noticed the bar degraded quickly whenever I would pause to rinse off the hair, which, without the bar, the gimmick of the razor seemed moot as I had to use shaving cream along with it after all to avoid nicking my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive to shaving in general and this is the first product I have tried that leaves my skin smooth after use.  </li>
            <li>Hair grows back fast, and the razor did not give me a smooth shave</li>
            <li>The shave isn&#x27;t very close at all.</li>
            <li>Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really like the product because it&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li>(I guess I should have read the whole description).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really figure out what&#x27;s so \\&quot;NATURAL\\&quot; about it???</li>
            <li>The big glob of moisturizer around the razor is slimy, and the handle is completely smooth.</li>
            <li>The soap melts really fast.</li>
            <li>The shave, while non-irritating, wasn&#x27;t as smooth as I had initially thought.</li>
            <li>The bar that surrounds the razor itself &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; unevenly and does not come close to being as effective as shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive  to everything!!!</li>
            <li>I bought these because they are &#x27;natural&#x27;...not realizing that they have shaving cream built right into it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure, how accurate that is, but, I know the occasional man who&#x27;s liked it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure, how accurate that is, but, I know the occasional man who&#x27;s liked it.</li>
            <li>Recently I just started appreciating completely bare arms and legs more.</li>
            <li>to clean with a disposable toothbrush ( that I re-use ONLY for this job) if the soap is around it.</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t see how the block of shave gel can possibly be touching my skin before the blades do once it gets down to about halfway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bar was completely misshapen and unusable after 4 or 5 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the head doesn&#x27;t pivot really well.</li>
            <li>Also, as soon as the &amp;#34;skin conditioning solid&amp;#34; has been used up, the razor blade is pretty much useless, which means you have to buy more replacement blades with skin conditioning solid more often.  </li>
            <li>and I have since been using the razor that is left with shaving cream just to get my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>the moisture bar can evaporate quickly also difficult to maneuver around knees, especially when it&#x27;s a brand new bar, good for underarms too but not for bikini area so much</li>
            <li>The back of the box has &amp;#34;fragrance/parfum&amp;#34; written right on it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new and made the mistake of buying Intuition.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely convenient, however you only really get one (maybe two) good use out of this before you feel like you need to replace the cartridge... and they&#x27;re not cheap!</li>
            <li>The first shave was great, but, as others have noted, it seems impossible to get all the hairs out of the blades after a while (even with the shower head on Power Needle Blast mode).</li>
            <li>Even though I strictly use natural and organic personal care products, one of the things I have a hard time finding is a good shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I usually use men&#x27;s razors - they have more blades and hold up longer.</li>
            <li>I mostly just use this in my arm pits and other private area.  </li>
            <li>it is not as good at avoiding this now.&lt;br /&gt;One of the least toxic ways ( Especially for sensitive skin) to shave  update-</li>
            <li>and you can easily see what spots you are missing.</li>
            <li>I love the moisture bars on these razors, however if you leave them remotely wet or where they will not dry back out</li>
            <li>to the sensitivity/ingrown situation, I think I have fairly sensitive skin, but I have not noticed any adverse reactions so far.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sort of natural.</li>
            <li>As an Asian girl I acutally never bothered with shaving my legs and arms because there wasn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li>BUT, in practice the blade just has too much going on around it to reach the skin properly....</li>
            <li>leaving missed spots and hair that grows back much faster.  </li>
            <li>Cause I notice nearly everything, I&#x27;m hypersensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Naturals Sensitive Care are often advertised (including on this page) as &amp;#34;fragrance free.&amp;#34; They are not.</li>
            <li>I do love these razors--I first started using them in college, when it was difficult to shave in the dorm showers.</li>
            <li>Then, I&#x27;d only use warm or cold water to rinse the blades from the back side quickly after use or if the blades get clogged while shaving.  </li>
            <li>Then, I&#x27;d only use warm or cold water to rinse the blades from the back side quickly after use or if the blades get clogged while shaving.  </li>
            <li>The blades are pretty sharp and do the job well.</li>
            <li>a few uses if you clean it properly</li>
            <li>a few uses if you clean it properly</li>
            <li>Can only use dove sensitive skin soap and Aveno lotion or baby lotion, this product is amazing however be wary of how you store it otherwise</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not enough to call it &#x27;natural&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle is super bulky and the razors need to be replaced only after a few times shaving.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go back to cheaper razors though as the Intuition Sensitive Care keeps me from getting red bumps or nicking myself.</li>
            <li>But, I can say, I&#x27;ve never cut myself using one of these razors, and they are just so much quicker/easier than lathering up, losing half the shaving foam/gel to shower spray.</li>

            <li> The bar that surrounds the razor itself &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; unevenly and does not come close to being as effective as shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive  to everything!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these because they are &#x27;natural&#x27;...not realizing that they have shaving cream built right into it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, how accurate that is, but, I know the occasional man who&#x27;s liked it.</li>

            <li> Recently I just started appreciating completely bare arms and legs more.</li>
            <li> to clean with a disposable toothbrush ( that I re-use ONLY for this job) if the soap is around it.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t see how the block of shave gel can possibly be touching my skin before the blades do once it gets down to about halfway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bar was completely misshapen and unusable after 4 or 5 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the head doesn&#x27;t pivot really well.</li>
            <li> Also, as soon as the &amp;#34;skin conditioning solid&amp;#34; has been used up, the razor blade is pretty much useless, which means you have to buy more replacement blades with skin conditioning solid more often.  </li>
            <li> and I have since been using the razor that is left with shaving cream just to get my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> the moisture bar can evaporate quickly also difficult to maneuver around knees, especially when it&#x27;s a brand new bar, good for underarms too but not for bikini area so much</li>
            <li> The back of the box has &amp;#34;fragrance/parfum&amp;#34; written right on it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new and made the mistake of buying Intuition.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely convenient, however you only really get one (maybe two) good use out of this before you feel like you need to replace the cartridge... and they&#x27;re not cheap!</li>
            <li> The first shave was great, but, as others have noted, it seems impossible to get all the hairs out of the blades after a while (even with the shower head on Power Needle Blast mode).</li>
            <li> Even though I strictly use natural and organic personal care products, one of the things I have a hard time finding is a good shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I usually use men&#x27;s razors - they have more blades and hold up longer.</li>
            <li> I mostly just use this in my arm pits and other private area.  </li>
            <li> it is not as good at avoiding this now.&lt;br /&gt;One of the least toxic ways ( Especially for sensitive skin) to shave  update-</li>
            <li> and you can easily see what spots you are missing.</li>
            <li> I love the moisture bars on these razors, however if you leave them remotely wet or where they will not dry back out</li>
            <li> to the sensitivity/ingrown situation, I think I have fairly sensitive skin, but I have not noticed any adverse reactions so far.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sort of natural.</li>
            <li> As an Asian girl I acutally never bothered with shaving my legs and arms because there wasn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li> BUT, in practice the blade just has too much going on around it to reach the skin properly....</li>
            <li> leaving missed spots and hair that grows back much faster.  </li>
            <li> Cause I notice nearly everything, I&#x27;m hypersensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Naturals Sensitive Care are often advertised (including on this page) as &amp;#34;fragrance free.&amp;#34; They are not.</li>
            <li> I do love these razors--I first started using them in college, when it was difficult to shave in the dorm showers.</li>
            <li> Then, I&#x27;d only use warm or cold water to rinse the blades from the back side quickly after use or if the blades get clogged while shaving.  </li>

            <li> The blades are pretty sharp and do the job well.</li>
            <li> a few uses if you clean it properly</li>
            <li> a few uses if you clean it properly</li>
            <li> Can only use dove sensitive skin soap and Aveno lotion or baby lotion, this product is amazing however be wary of how you store it otherwise</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not enough to call it &#x27;natural&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle is super bulky and the razors need to be replaced only after a few times shaving.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go back to cheaper razors though as the Intuition Sensitive Care keeps me from getting red bumps or nicking myself.</li>
            <li> But, I can say, I&#x27;ve never cut myself using one of these razors, and they are just so much quicker/easier than lathering up, losing half the shaving foam/gel to shower spray.</li>
            <li> then my other Venus women&#x27;s shaver for sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;Harder</li>
            <li> Every time you rinse it to get rid of the small hair stuck, the moisturizer attached melts really fast.</li>
            <li> heads don&#x27;t last as long because the soap surrounding the blades goes away quicker</li>
            <li> Was not very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I guess if you&#x27;re not a poor college student its not a big deal, but if you are its DEFINITELY not a good buy.</li>
            <li> Took me twice as long to shave my legs</li>
            <li> Absolutely hate it, I can&#x27;t imagine how it got even some good reviews.</li>
            <li> As some other reviewers said, you have to go over the same area again and again to remove the hair.  </li>
            <li> The bar was worn down by the fourth use</li>
            <li> Works very well, though the cartridges don&#x27;t seem to last as long as I&#x27;d like &amp; the refills are expensive.  </li>
            <li> The huge moisturizing bar also makes getting smaller areas (armpits, bikini area, knees, ankles) nearly impossible to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but even though I tried to keep it dry, one side of the gel area dried up and wouldn&#x27;t lather the next time I tried it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that one side of the soap/lather wears down quicker than the other side, so I have to change the blade even when there is still some soap left.</li>
            <li> but I still think it is inappropriate, and it&#x27;s certainly not funny or clever.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this razor to eliminate the need for shaving cream when I shave my legs.  Though it does put out a lot of lotion, it did not give me a close shave.  As some other reviewers said, you have to go over the same area again and again to remove the hair.  Took me twice as long to shave my legs then it does with a cheap disposable razor.</li>
            <li> No mess shaving with a perfect close shave every time.  I have given up shaving cream for years now and only use the Intuition razors.  The Sensitive Care Naturals is one of the best!</li>
            <li> Was not very sensitive. I still had a rash!</li>
            <li> I love this product and you can&#x27;t beat this price</li>
            <li> The shave isn&#x27;t very close at all. It says you don&#x27;t need shave gel, but you do or else the razor bites up your skin. Chunky of hair were stuck inside the razor after the first use and they wouldn&#x27;t come out. Really gross. The shape is awkward to shave with. Over all terrible product. Avoid!</li>
            <li> I do love these razors--I first started using them in college, when it was difficult to shave in the dorm showers. Now I use them when I&#x27;m in a rush or just want a quick shave. I very rarely get razor burn, and I have fine/light hair, so please keep that in mind with this review. But, I can say, I&#x27;ve never cut myself using one of these razors, and they are just so much quicker/easier than lathering up, losing half the shaving foam/gel to shower spray. They&#x27;re great for a quick fix/on-the-go shave. My only complaint is that one side of the soap/lather wears down quicker than the other side, so I have to change the blade even when there is still some soap left.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor after Anna Kendrick extolled its virtues in an article (&amp;#34;If you&#x27;re not using Intuition razors, you&#x27;re wasting everybody&#x27;s time.&amp;#34;). I like the idea that I don&#x27;t have to juggle a razor and shave gel in the shower anymore, but in practice it doesn&#x27;t work so well. The first shave was great, but, as others have noted, it seems impossible to get all the hairs out of the blades after a while (even with the shower head on Power Needle Blast mode). Also, I don&#x27;t see how the block of shave gel can possibly be touching my skin before the blades do once it gets down to about halfway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the sensitivity/ingrown situation, I think I have fairly sensitive skin, but I have not noticed any adverse reactions so far. But I did have an adverse reaction to the price tag on the refills I tried to buy at Target last night. For that money I can get 4 Venus cartridges! So I may have to go back to wasting Anna Kendrick&#x27;s time...</li>
            <li> I usually use men&#x27;s razors - they have more blades and hold up longer. However; I had an opportunity to check out both the Naturals and Pomegranate version of this razor. The pomegranate smells so yummy!!! I really love the sweet smell that fills the shower when I use it. I love the moisture bars on these razors, however if you leave them remotely wet or where they will not dry back out they melt right off. This includes during use, standing in the shower can melt your entire bar of lubricant. It is a great idea - I just wish the razor had a bit of longevity. Another great thing is that this is a brand name razor so there are often coupons available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this razor if you shave less often then 1x per week - it is just what you will need to cut through longer hair, no shaving cream needed. However; this is not the razor for you if you shave daily. I feel that you will be disappointed and having to replace a $9 razor every couple of days will not be fun on the pocket book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I recently used a coupon to purchase another one of these - I was even less impressed. The blades seem to be duller than I remember and the soap part melted in one use. I did discover that the razor floated - I Love this aspect.</li>
            <li> I liked this razor for the first 2 or 3 times I used it but even though I tried to keep it dry, one side of the gel area dried up and wouldn&#x27;t lather the next time I tried it. Waste of time and money! I now use liquid Castile soap to lather and it goes a lot farther.</li>
            <li> My favorite razor. Hands down. I never ever have gotten cut by this razor and I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 7 years. I love that you don&#x27;t need shaving cream because of the soap around the razor head and that you can order different scents of razor head to fit into the one razor. I had my last one for years until I dropped it so many times it broke. lol My fault, not the product. I get a close shave every time. perfect.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving faster and easier and leaves my legs feeling silky and smooth. Hopefully that soap/cream part won&#x27;t crack off after lots of usage.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive  to everything!!! Can only use dove sensitive skin soap and Aveno lotion or baby lotion, this product is amazing however be wary of how you store it otherwise the moisture bar can evaporate quickly also difficult to maneuver around knees, especially when it&#x27;s a brand new bar, good for underarms too but not for bikini area so much</li>
            <li> This is definitely convenient, however you only really get one (maybe two) good use out of this before you feel like you need to replace the cartridge... and they&#x27;re not cheap! Its good for traveling though.</li>
            <li> I always buy this and the price was right</li>
            <li> I did not have the best experience with these razors. Maybe I don&#x27;t know how to shave. Normally I put on shaving gel and shave and dip the razors in water to clean it and then repeat. With this razor, I couldn&#x27;t clean it. The razor springs down. Like it moves. I guess for comfort. The surrounding aloe or whatever melts when u dip it. I tried cleaning it with a towel which was a fail. I like the Schick brand so I&#x27;ll just say not the razor for me.</li>
            <li> Great razor but the stuff around razor wears out too quick</li>
            <li> I decided to try a different razor since I have always used a Venus razor, so I bought this one. What a mistake! It&#x27;s bulky and doesn&#x27;t give a close shave AT ALL. It also feel very cheap, the razor blade wobbles while you shave and water gets inside it while you rinse it off. Absolutely hate it, I can&#x27;t imagine how it got even some good reviews.</li>
            <li> Your current advertisement for the Schick Hydro Sensitive razor is tasteless and obscene. I have &amp;#34;been around the block&amp;#34; a few times but I still think it is inappropriate, and it&#x27;s certainly not funny or clever.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy any more of your products even though the Schick razors are better than Gillette. I am no longer a customer. Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li> Even though I strictly use natural and organic personal care products, one of the things I have a hard time finding is a good shaving cream. So I use this..it&#x27;s sort of natural. I love how you don&#x27;t need shaving cream with this since when you shave, it has a bar of &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; or whatever it is on the razor itself so it makes it really easy and fast to shave. The bar does run out quickly which is annoying. Every time you rise the razor, I feel like the bar is wasting. I still like it though.</li>
            <li> have used this razor for years. it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Very smooth , I have Veins and am scared to nik them ,very impressed with the product ,</li>
            <li> I think shaving is hassle for everyone. As an Asian girl I acutally never bothered with shaving my legs and arms because there wasn&#x27;t much. Recently I just started appreciating completely bare arms and legs more. I got this razor because my friends gave me some refulls and I didn&#x27;t have the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like the product because it&#x27;s very convenient. I don&#x27;t have to put shaving cream on and you can easily see what spots you are missing. The blades are pretty sharp and do the job well. I did cut myself on a couple places a few time so be careful with the difficult areas. Still, the convenience is great. I don&#x27;t know how this works on hairier arms and legs though.</li>
            <li> I thought this razor was wonderful at first.  My skin is very sensitive to shaving in general and this is the first product I have tried that leaves my skin smooth after use.  However, each time you rinse the blades to remove hair the moisturizing bar attached melts away a great deal.  It is definitely this bar that I attribute the change in skin reaction to shaving, so the fact that I have to replace the razor heads so often to reap the benefits of the product makes for an expensive situation.  I guess if you&#x27;re not a poor college student its not a big deal, but if you are its DEFINITELY not a good buy.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of allergies so was glad to find the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; version of this product. Worked great for me with no negative skin reactions. In fact, my skin felt better after using the Intuition. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of razors over the years looking for one that would be both kind to my skin and effective at shaving. This one fills the bill. Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> easy to use. Good buy</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good razor...and am still looking. I bought these because they are &#x27;natural&#x27;...not realizing that they have shaving cream built right into it (I guess I should have read the whole description). Turns out it leaves me feeling super itchy. Not only that...but I have to run the razor over my leg 4 times before I get a clean shave. The handle is super bulky and the razors need to be replaced only after a few times shaving. I can&#x27;t really figure out what&#x27;s so \\&quot;NATURAL\\&quot; about it??? There are still a ton of chemicals in the moisturizer. I noticed a few natural oils (after the list of chemicals) and see that the box is an &#x27;earth friendly&#x27; box (which is nice)....but that&#x27;s not enough to call it &#x27;natural&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most definitely will not be buying these again. One more razor into the garbage. : (</li>
            <li> I always love using Schick razors...</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a close shave then you have found the wrong razor!  I love the idea of not needing shaving cream, body wash or soap while shaving my legs and underarms and this razor also seemed like it was designed well to lather, moisturize and shave in one easy step.  BUT, in practice the blade just has too much going on around it to reach the skin properly....leaving missed spots and hair that grows back much faster.  Also, as soon as the &amp;#34;skin conditioning solid&amp;#34; has been used up, the razor blade is pretty much useless, which means you have to buy more replacement blades with skin conditioning solid more often.  When I saw promoters giving these razors away at a festival 4 at a time, I should have known that there was something amiss with this razor!</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of money!  I wanted to try something new and made the mistake of buying Intuition.  I had to go over the same spots several times to actually get my leg shaved.  The bar that surrounds the razor itself &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; unevenly and does not come close to being as effective as shaving cream.  In fact, it gave me razor burn as if I wasn&#x27;t using anything at all.  The bar was worn down by the fourth use and I have since been using the razor that is left with shaving cream just to get my money&#x27;s worth.  I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.  How is it still on the market?</li>
            <li> There is nothing good to say about this razor. It&#x27;s terrible. The suction cup to hang it from does not hold, despite the fact that I cleaned the area thoroughly before applying it. The cap for the razor does not stay on. The big glob of moisturizer around the razor is slimy, and the handle is completely smooth. There are no ridges or any texture to make it less slippery when wet.</li>
            <li> Recippient of gift loved it.</li>
            <li> The soap melts really fast. The hair gets stuck in the blades which prevents shaving the rest of the hair. Every time you rinse it to get rid of the small hair stuck, the moisturizer attached melts really fast. Hair grows back fast, and the razor did not give me a smooth shave</li>
            <li> Below you&#x27;ll see my review of this product written  BEFORE they updated it. Now that they have changed it I DON&#x27;T recommend it. It has fragrance. It bothers me. And has other issues too.  This review was originally 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;old review-  I have multiple diagnoses that effect my sensory issues in multiple ways. I have perfected as much as possible the products I use to make sure none of them give me issues, and all of them work well. Because of this, I&#x27;m a Sensory solutions 1. Com expert ( no caps or spaces if u search to visit it.) .  With that said, I have used this for yrs and here&#x27;s my review. Please note, I mostly just use this in my arm pits and other private area.  I don&#x27;t recommend anything that gives me issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of use  update-same&lt;br /&gt;No soap or cream needed. ( and I need cream if I don&#x27;t use this)  update- same but, I no longer need cream with a better razor and different soap.&lt;br /&gt;A hanging hole in the handle. Similar, but, now worse.&lt;br /&gt;Changeable shaving heads&lt;br /&gt;The razor soap or whatever doesn&#x27;t let the cut hair or filth stick to it  update- it is not as good at avoiding this now.&lt;br /&gt;One of the least toxic ways ( Especially for sensitive skin) to shave  update- Not anymore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral not a pro or con&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are scents in this product. However, without being a sensory expert or reading and recognizing them on the ingredient label. You might never know. I can&#x27;t tell at all. And that&#x27;s saying a lot. Cause I notice nearly everything, I&#x27;m hypersensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little heavier perhaps from what your use to&lt;br /&gt;Like another reviewer states, it&#x27;s not the sharpest tool in the shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads don&#x27;t last as long because the soap surrounding the blades goes away quicker then the blades die IF you clean the blades well regularly.&lt;br /&gt;Not the cheapest, but, if you don&#x27;t need shaving cream or gel it might be.&lt;br /&gt;The blades clog easier and quicker then my other Venus women&#x27;s shaver for sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;Harder to clean with a disposable toothbrush ( that I re-use ONLY for this job) if the soap is around it. Because then the soap dissolves quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike atleast 1 other reviewer states. The blade and soap will last more then a few uses if you clean it properly and IF you keep the soap when not in use away from very hot water. I&#x27;d rinse the head in warm to hot ( NOT very hot water) right before use.

They do clog more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver claims to be best for women due to it being made to shave a women&#x27;s curves best. I&#x27;m not sure, how accurate that is, but, I know the occasional man who&#x27;s liked it. If your super hairy whether a women or not. This shaver however, will defiantly not cut it.b) if the soap is around it. Because then the soap dissolves quicker.  Unlike atleast 1 other reviewer states.

            <li> The Naturals Sensitive Care are often advertised (including on this page) as &amp;#34;fragrance free.&amp;#34; They are not. The back of the box has &amp;#34;fragrance/parfum&amp;#34; written right on it.</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li> Tried this razor on a whim to replace my trusty Venus Embrace, which after years of use finally broke. My first thought was that this was a pretty decent razor. I did have to go over the same spots in some areas (mostly my knees) on my legs, but my skin felt super smooth afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it went downhill from there. The next day, it felt like I hadn&#x27;t shaved at all. The shave, while non-irritating, wasn&#x27;t as smooth as I had initially thought. I shower at night, so this is problematic when I don&#x27;t want visible body hair showing in the day. I also noticed the bar degraded quickly whenever I would pause to rinse off the hair, which, without the bar, the gimmick of the razor seemed moot as I had to use shaving cream along with it after all to avoid nicking my sensitive skin. The bar was completely misshapen and unusable after 4 or 5 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the head doesn&#x27;t pivot really well. It actually seems kind of cheaply made when you examine how the blade allows movement. The huge moisturizing bar also makes getting smaller areas (armpits, bikini area, knees, ankles) nearly impossible to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest going with something else with a smaller, pivoting head and investing in a really good shave gel, like Coochy.</li>
            <li> Works very well, though the cartridges don&#x27;t seem to last as long as I&#x27;d like &amp; the refills are expensive.  I wouldn&#x27;t go back to cheaper razors though as the Intuition Sensitive Care keeps me from getting red bumps or nicking myself.</li>
