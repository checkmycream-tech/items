            <li>Fit the bed perfectly, bought two sets once I saw the first set worked.  </li>

            <li>They are just OK, nothing outstanding.</li>
            <li>sheets seem to pop off the top corners of hospital mattresses when the head of the bed is raised.</li>

            <li>Bought this set for my moms bed and they are soft and fit great.</li>

            <li>now i have to spend more money to find what i really needed...</li>

            <li>These were very well priced when compared to what was available at Brick and Mortar stores.  </li>
            <li>The sheets fit perfectly and are exactly what I was looking for, they are thick enough to help you stop sweating on the plastic of the mattress.  </li>

            <li>Soft and smooth for my dad to lie on.</li>

            <li>These worked very well for us.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really complain too much for the price.</li>
            <li>i need the extra give from a knit sheet to fit over my daughters hospital bed mattress and topper.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe it improves with washing, but I was looking for something soft</li>
            <li>Sheets were NOT knit which I really needed to go on a relative&#x27;s hospital bed.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend them for comfort for people with fragile skin.</li>
            <li>Rather thin and very cheaply finished.  </li>

            <li> It is not a very soft material and is too big for the mattress which came with our hospital bed.</li>
            <li> They were for a hospital bed for my terminally ill wife and they worked fine.</li>
            <li> and I love the feel of the flannel when I have to get into a cold bed.</li>

            <li> Sheets arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> Bought top, bottom sheets and pillow case and all are good quality and wash well.  They fit a hospital bed perfectly so good for home use.  Also soft and comfortable for the patient.  Will buy more if needed.</li>
            <li> These are very good fits and I love the feel of the flannel when I have to get into a cold bed.</li>
            <li> These worked very well for us.  Fit the bed perfectly, bought two sets once I saw the first set worked.  Arrived quickly, no problems with transaction.</li>
            <li> These are advertised as &amp;#34;knit&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;They are NOT knit!!&lt;br /&gt;I will keep them as they are needed for this week-otherwise they&#x27;d be returned-</li>
            <li> The sheet set is very disappointing. It is not a very soft material and is too big for the mattress which came with our hospital bed.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred that the bottom sheet be fitted as well.  They are just OK, nothing outstanding.</li>
            <li> These sheets are somewhat thin.</li>
            <li> These sheets are not knit sheets, as the description implies.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is marginal and the fabric is stiff and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it improves with washing, but I was looking for something soft&lt;br /&gt;for a hospice bed. I returned them.</li>
            <li> Bought this set for my moms bed and they are soft and fit great.</li>
            <li> These were very well priced when compared to what was available at Brick and Mortar stores.  They were for a hospital bed for my terminally ill wife and they worked fine.</li>
            <li> word knit does not describe accurately.</li>
            <li> Fitted bottom sheet will not stay tucked in on the 6&amp;#34; mattress.</li>
            <li> The sheets fit perfectly and are exactly what I was looking for, they are thick enough to help you stop sweating on the plastic of the mattress.  I have used them for two months now and they have had no problem being washed or any issues of wear.  I wash them using regular detergent and a little bleach with fabric softener 2 to 3 times per week and haven&#x27;t seen any fraying  or stretching of the material.</li>
            <li> These are great and fit really well.</li>
            <li> Soft and smooth for my dad to lie on. Also fit over a memory foam mattress cover with no problems. Great but for my dads comfort.</li>
            <li> The sheets fit perfectly and glide with the mattress as we raise and lower the bed. We made an excellent choice  and will be ordering another set.</li>
            <li> These linens fit the hospital bed. They worked out well.</li>
            <li> I use the fitted bottom Invacare sheet to keep the foam topper aligned with the hospital mattress. I use a regular sheet over the Invacare bottom sheet. I use the Invacare pillowcase as a liner. Use a regular cotton pillowcase over it. If I had it to do over again, I&#x27;d buy just the bottom fitted sheet.</li>
            <li> My mother was virtually bedridden for the last few years following a stroke. Anyone a victim of, or familiar with this knows that skin breakdown (bedsores) is a seriously uncomfortable health threat. Ordered these knit sheets hoping they&#x27;d be more gentle on her fragile skin than cotton. They were absolutely delightful in their softness, comfort, quality, and hospital-bed fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All sheets seem to pop off the top corners of hospital mattresses when the head of the bed is raised. These were much less likely to pop off than the regular cotton hospital bed sheets. Highly recommend them for comfort for people with fragile skin.</li>
            <li> We are using them but they were disappointing. Rather thin and very cheaply finished.  They could be nicer for the price.</li>
            <li> Sheets were NOT knit which I really needed to go on a relative&#x27;s hospital bed.  Rather thin also.  I consider the ad as &amp;#34;false advertising&amp;#34;.  Brand was different from the one shown.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve received anything through Amazon that was not acceptable so I still think it&#x27;s a great place to shop!</li>
            <li> this bed sheets and pillowcase works ok. I can&#x27;t really complain too much for the price. I might buy from someone else next time</li>
            <li> False advertising....this is not a knit sheet....i specifically ordered a knit fitted sheet....it is just a plain cotton/poly sheet.....i need the extra give from a knit sheet to fit over my daughters hospital bed mattress and topper.....that was what i ordered however when i opened it, it was NOT knit at all....and a message inside the package says i cant return it for any reason.....so i&#x27;m stuck....so if you want a cotton sheet , this will work for you...its a nice quality cotton, but not what i ordered.....now i have to spend more money to find what i really needed...not happy</li>
            <li> Awesome glad I got this item it works great it does the job great. I received this item so quick I was blown away.</li>
            <li> As expected - no concerns</li>
