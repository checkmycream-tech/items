            <li>They didn&#x27;t fit the fixture.</li>
            <li>I love the tooth brush and the price is right for the replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li>He also said that since I have slightly impacted wisdom teeth a power toothbrush is a great choice since I can just park the brush on top of the wisdom teeth and let it do the work.</li>
            <li>Squeaky clean, polished</li>
            <li>This has certainly kept our gums healthy.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>It does a deep cleaning and is good at removing plaque.</li>
            <li>Came quickly.  </li>
            <li>and therefore you will think these are huge when first use them.  </li>

            <li>The brush head goes straight and smoothly over your teeth without jerking and nearly knocking&lt;br /&gt;out</li>
            <li>Wow. Feels clean.</li>
            <li>But, just as you used to use the manual brushes with large heads on them, you will get used to large head ones again.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper to purchase on line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very quiet and precise.  </li>

            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Seems to work ok but the bristles seem to be software than other refills I have received.  </li>
            <li>Same as the original.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s easy to do, but for me I have a problem being consistent with the up and down motion.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend these replacement toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The extra money is well worth it to save your teeth from being knocked out or</li>
            <li>it does rotate from left to right</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>/&gt;These brush heads are shaped like a traditional oval toothbrush head as opposed to the round heads that most Oral-B brushes come with.  </li>

            <li> we will see how long these last me,</li>
            <li> These work well and are long lasting.</li>
            <li> They have alternating rows of bristles, where one row is stationary and the other row sweeps back and forth, basically mimicking the up and down motion.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are neither soft nor hard.  </li>
            <li> packaging and website info does not state if they are soft medium or hard...</li>

            <li> Have used this tooth brush for 2 years and love it.  Much cheaper to purchase on line.</li>
            <li> This has certainly kept our gums healthy.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, and they work well.</li>
            <li> Im a fan of this electric brushers. I have 4 or 5 different heads but to me this is the best. Soft, larger, side to side movement, just loved it. Recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect brush recommended by the dentist. Other heads can brush your gums away. These are for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Using these things feels like those scrubbing bubble guys flying all over my mouth. Wow Great Wow. Feels clean. Nice.</li>
            <li> This is a purchase I made to make things easier for myself, some times for the better and some times not.</li>
            <li> Expensive but what I needed</li>
            <li> These oral b original toothbrushes are far superior to the generics I&#x27;ve used the last three years.&lt;br /&gt;#1 The brush head goes straight and smoothly over your teeth without jerking and nearly knocking&lt;br /&gt;out your teeth with the plastic head.  I can&#x27;t tell you what a relief it is to have the brush head not&lt;br /&gt;nearly knocking my teeth out with its jerky motion.  I guess it&#x27;s true you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;#2  It&#x27;s very quiet and precise.  It cleans your teeth quietly and expertly without any fuss or muss.&lt;br /&gt;#3  The bristles are neither soft nor hard.  Just right I&#x27;d say.  Comfortable on gums while giving&lt;br /&gt;  you that &amp;quot;just left the dentist&#x27;s cleaning&amp;quot; feel.  Squeaky clean, polished teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these replacement toothbrushes.  I thought there wouldn&#x27;t be any difference, but&lt;br /&gt;boy was I mistaken.  The extra money is well worth it to save your teeth from being knocked out or&lt;br /&gt;damaged.  I actually look forward to brushing my teeth now  No fuss or extra effort anymore.</li>
            <li> I liked ti when I first bought one of these.  It is so easy to order replacements from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Looked at replacement heads and saw these.  We have been used to the small round ones and over the years, you get used to those and therefore you will think these are huge when first use them.  But, just as you used to use the manual brushes with large heads on them, you will get used to large head ones again.  This assumes you have been using the small round ones for some time.  If you just now switched to electric ones from manual ones, then you will feel these are just the same.</li>
            <li> full size brush head unlike oral-b&#x27;s other brushes which makes me feel like my teeth are getting a better clean.  it does rotate from left to right so it also brushes in a way the circular ones cant. the bristles are longer so they get into the crevices. I noticed that the bristles do seem to wear faster as the color is fading after just one week.  we will see how long these last me,</li>
            <li> I have bought and used all the Oral-B brushes... this is probably one of the best ones.  I like the deep-floss too but they both rank evenly at my number 1.</li>
            <li> This is the best (oral-b) brush I ever used and it lasts longer as well.&lt;br /&gt;I feel much better after brushing then before...</li>
            <li> Seems to work ok but the bristles seem to be software than other refills I have received.  Would prefer a firmer brush.</li>
            <li> These replacements work well, keep teeth very clean, would buy again.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement.  Pleased.</li>
            <li> Like these very much.</li>
            <li> Same as the original. Nice price, and didn&#x27;t have to go out in the cold and drive to the store.</li>
            <li> Glad I switched from another name brand electric toothbrush. These work well and are long lasting.</li>
            <li> works good, fits perfect, but the bristles are a little stiff for my preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the packaging and website info does not state if they are soft medium or hard... so i took a gamble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but these are somewhere between medium and hard by judgment.</li>
            <li> It does a deep cleaning and is good at removing plaque. The price is reasonable for this item. Try it.</li>
            <li> I rated 5 stars because performed as advertised and as stated in reviews. I do rotate with their floss head and my hygenest said great job. I also flush and find very little food between teeth. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> What can I say. I love the tooth brush and the price is right for the replacement brush heads. My wife and I each  have the same tooth brush and use the same brush heads so this is a perfect way to keep supplied.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job cleaning your teeth. Whole family loves it.  Especially like the timer.  It&#x27;s a clock and times your brushing. If you do a good job you get 5 stars</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.Works perfect for me.</li>
            <li> We all know that dentists recommend that you brush your teeth in an up and down and side to side motion, for some that&#x27;s easy to do, but for me I have a problem being consistent with the up and down motion.  Thankfully, these Oral-B brush heads do the up and down work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brush heads are shaped like a traditional oval toothbrush head as opposed to the round heads that most Oral-B brushes come with.  They have alternating rows of bristles, where one row is stationary and the other row sweeps back and forth, basically mimicking the up and down motion.  The brush heads work well, feel good while in use, and fit and perform perfectly on my Braun Oral-B 5000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... does the up and down cleaning for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;01/16/2014 Update: I just had my 6 month dental check-up and the dentist said my teeth look great.  He also said that since I have slightly impacted wisdom teeth a power toothbrush is a great choice since I can just park the brush on top of the wisdom teeth and let it do the work.</li>
            <li> Came quickly.  Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral B products for several years, and these brush heads do a great job of deep cleaning without any irritation.</li>
            <li> I had to return them. They didn&#x27;t fit the fixture.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.  We have been using them for quite some time and get them on subscribe and save so we can always change out our brushes every three months.</li>
