            <li>and I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li>this headband is PERFECT.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Beautiful!</li>
            <li>This accessory is very good and practical for a gorgeous hairstyle in your hair.</li>
            <li>but \\&quot;ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that!\\&quot; :P</li>
            <li>I like it and it is bright.</li>
            <li>But good quality.</li>
            <li>This band is a good buy.</li>
            <li>This is very nice on my head and even though the price was cheap which is great</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The gold color is eye catching and goes with just about any outfit and any hair color.</li>
            <li>Loved it :) I recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>Might be more suitable for a child or for someone who likes them quite snug.</li>
            <li>Very very light colored..</li>
            <li>This product seems to be durably made, however the gold is very, very light in color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a cute headband.</li>
            <li>It stays in place and doesn&#x27;t slip--much--as the day wears on, but I also put some salt spray in my hair to give it a bit more texture.</li>
            <li>in all, satisfied with the purchase and would buy another item from this brand.</li>
            <li>(because I love it...</li>
            <li>SO cute)</li>
            <li>i always get compliments, not specifically on the headband itself, as it is a simple braided gold headband, but that my hair looks awesome when im wearing it.  </li>
            <li>i love it.  </li>
            <li>i think i need more colors.</li>
            <li>many times&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li>use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty good quality</li>
            <li>Super cute and doesn&#x27;t stretch out(I</li>
            <li>i guess i could&#x27;ve used bobby pins to secure it</li>
            <li>comfortable hair band as a mother</li>
            <li>it does not look cheap</li>
            <li>May not have longevity, so enjoy it while it lasts.</li>
            <li>Very comfy and cute.  </li>
            <li>but the elasticity is not that great and tend to slide and mess up my hair.</li>
            <li>Mine is red and it looks spectacular.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Can be used as an everyday headband and also with a nice elegant outfit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love: The second band has no elastic, so it sort of floats around the top of my head and doesn&#x27;t actually do anything--except look cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it is a double band - gives a neat detail.  </li>
            <li>I recently bought this product and already love it.</li>
            <li>this headband is perfect to throw in my hair to make a loose messy bun look like i put in some effort.  </li>
            <li>Rubber wears out really fast.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of money on hair accessories...</li>
            <li>Its definitely a soft gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any reason to believe my head is other than standard size, but this feels pretty tight on me, so I haven&#x27;t been able to wear it.  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t by elastic headbands like this since they never stay on my head - they constantly slip off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>headache\\&quot; but because of the unadjustable design you have to have exactly the right head size to wear this without it slipping off or being too tight.</li>
            <li>This is a cute headband, but I had a LOT of trouble keeping it on my head, because it&#x27;s a little big.</li>
            <li>This headwrap is cute but very tight, and I have a fairly small head (I wear size S in bicycle helmets).</li>

            <li> Will definitely consider buying some other hair pieces from this Elle brand.</li>
            <li> i bought the headband last summer, and the elastic still hasn&#x27;t let me down.  </li>
            <li> usually by now it will be all stretched out and too big for my head.  </li>
            <li> It is tighter than I expected and slips a lot.</li>
            <li> Comfortable just a really ugly color and not gold</li>
            <li> It looks like a slightly tarnished silver, rather than gold.</li>
            <li> Its not a bright cheesy gild color, but a more subtle gold color.  </li>
            <li> have long, thick hair).</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t shown any signs yet of stretching or heavy</li>
            <li> hard to use this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Jazzes up a dull look.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m used to shoddy quality and things snapping and breaking.</li>

            <li> What I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a cute headband. The gold color is eye catching and goes with just about any outfit and any hair color. Mine is red and it looks spectacular. It stays in place and doesn&#x27;t slip--much--as the day wears on, but I also put some salt spray in my hair to give it a bit more texture. This is a trick I use with headbands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t love: The second band has no elastic, so it sort of floats around the top of my head and doesn&#x27;t actually do anything--except look cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, satisfied with the purchase and would buy another item from this brand.</li>
            <li> i bought this thinking i could avoid \\&quot;headband headache\\&quot; but because of the unadjustable design you have to have exactly the right head size to wear this without it slipping off or being too tight. i guess i could&#x27;ve used bobby pins to secure it but \\&quot;ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that!\\&quot; :P</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of money on hair accessories... I tend to gravitate toward headbands in the 4-10 dollar range. So, I&#x27;m used to shoddy quality and things snapping and breaking. I&#x27;ve used this headband A LOT (because I love it... SO cute) and it hasn&#x27;t shown any signs yet of stretching or heavy use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty good quality and I&#x27;m impressed! Will definitely consider buying some other hair pieces from this Elle brand.</li>

            <li> Definitely is silver and not gold.</li>
            <li> hard to use this.&lt;br /&gt;pretty.&lt;br /&gt;useless though.&lt;br /&gt;my hair were stuck many times&lt;br /&gt;not comfortable hair band as a mother</li>
            <li> Not nearly as gold as in the picture almost looks silver. Comfortable just a really ugly color and not gold</li>
            <li> This is definitely not gold like shown in picture. Very very light colored..</li>
            <li> Very comfy and cute.  I love that it is a double band - gives a neat detail.  I feel like a princess when i wear this.  Its not a bright cheesy gild color, but a more subtle gold color.  Love it!</li>

            <li> It is tighter than I expected and slips a lot.</li>
            <li> A bit big for my head . But good quality.</li>

            <li> This headwrap is cute but very tight, and I have a fairly small head (I wear size S in bicycle helmets). It is being returned.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be durably made, however the gold is very, very light in color. It looks like a slightly tarnished silver, rather than gold.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product and already love it. I normally don&#x27;t by elastic headbands like this since they never stay on my head - they constantly slip off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This headband actually stay on..maybe because its not elastic all around. The gold part is plastic. I saw some complaints in the reviews about the color being off, but I like the color mine came in. Its definitely a soft gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can be used as an everyday headband and also with a nice elegant outfit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend!</li>
            <li> This band is a good buy. Always receive compliments. Jazzes up a dull look. May not have longevity, so enjoy it while it lasts.</li>
