            <li>Smells great!!!</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t smell very good and does not thicken your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have experienced thickness and some growth with this product line.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff.  </li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re good for your hair.</li>
            <li>But still a good product.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love it!!!  </li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and does wonders for your hair.</li>
            <li>This spray is super lightweight and provides great hold.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li>But since using this my ends have been so healthy and</li>
            <li>BTW THIS SMELLS BETTER THAN ANYTHING FROM THE COCONUT AND HIBSCIOUS Line.</li>
            <li>I actually love this line from Shea moisture...</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it, but you can get it from target.com for 9.74$.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy unlike most leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li>Works really great with my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I do not like the new line as I have heard not so good reviews about it and my hair does well with this one.</li>
            <li>But this doesn&#x27;t,  it feels great and dries instantly.</li>
            <li>My hair definitely has more moisture and a nice looser curl on my roots.</li>
            <li>I continued the use for another week and noticed mild breakage.</li>
            <li>Amazing product I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>It has taken me too long to get my hair in a healthy state to use this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the mask for a year now and it has kept my natural hair strong and resilient against breakage.</li>
            <li>First of all,the spray bottle did not mist but instead placed a dollop of product in one spot.</li>
            <li>My hair normally grows quickly (with care)</li>
            <li>makes hair soft and full and helps with regrowth.  </li>
            <li>I use this product on my hair every night before going to bed....makes my hair full, soft and new growth is coming in.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have fine or thin hair, but I love this product.</li>
            <li>Do not believe any negative reviews this product is natural hair friendly and healthy.</li>
            <li>I am glad that this carrier still carries this same product and the same line.</li>
            <li>mainly from the alcohol I believe.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest you use the milk with this.</li>
            <li>My hair is super fine and this really gives it that little extra body to perk it up during the day.  </li>
            <li>This spray is great for quenching my coarse, thick naturally kinky (4a/b) hair.</li>
            <li>It plays well with other products (no flaking), which is important when I need to treat dryness midday.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended if you have new growth that you need to get a comb through without ripping out your hair by their roots.</li>
            <li>am not sure if I see much more thickness</li>
            <li>Listen guys, i have never had a product that has has such a positive impact on my hair.</li>
            <li>Even if I mist with this product liberally, it dries clear.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and dope &amp;#60;3  </li>
            <li>Shea Moisture is all natural.</li>
            <li>You obviously have to be gentle, but gentle only gets you so far...</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair soft and even detangle it</li>
            <li>It helps the comb glide through my hair, especially when I have new growth.</li>
            <li>the biotin I figure, leaves a small white residue on your scalp), so I recommend following up with Shea Reconstructive elixir or grease to add more shine.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t expect to see any major &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li>and I barely have any tangles or breakage anymore.</li>
            <li>And it seems to help slightly loosen an overly stiff style on the rare occasions that I accidentally use too much product for twists.</li>
            <li>Its pin straight and almost anything will way it down!</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t have fine or thin hair, but I love this product. This spray is great for quenching my coarse, thick naturally kinky (4a/b) hair. And it seems to help slightly loosen an overly stiff style on the rare occasions that I accidentally use too much product for twists. However, I have not lost a style after spraying as often happens with other water-based sprays. Even if I mist with this product liberally, it dries clear.  I have also used it on my 5 year old&#x27;s wavy/curly (3a/b) hair to refresh her texture without weighing it down.  The pump delivers a well-directed mist. It plays well with other products (no flaking), which is important when I need to treat dryness midday. The scent is mild and pleasant. Most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy unlike most leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li> Helped maintain my ends. I am black African American and I have a mixed pattern 3b/3c/4a and it helped me maintain my ends so well. My hair normally grows quickly (with care) But since using this my ends have been so healthy and my wash n goes are bomb!!!!! Like my curls pop and I barely have any tangles or breakage anymore. BTW THIS SMELLS BETTER THAN ANYTHING FROM THE COCONUT AND HIBSCIOUS Line. I highly suggest you use the milk with this. It makes my hair so soft and dope &amp;#60;3  And the &amp;#34;alcohols&amp;#34; are fatty alcohols so they&#x27;re good for your hair. don&#x27;t fret. Shea Moisture is all natural.</li>
            <li> I actually love this line from Shea moisture...I&#x27;ve been using the mask for a year now and it has kept my natural hair strong and resilient against breakage. This mist provides both moisture and softness to my hair and braids...will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t smell very good and does not thicken your hair.  I use it now just to moisten my hair when I don&#x27;t wash it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this. It thickens your hair as it claims. Do not believe any negative reviews this product is natural hair friendly and healthy. As I am doing the Curly Girl Method I am not putting a lot of products in my hair. I usually get this at Walmart or Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Smells great!!! A little goes a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if I see much more thickness but, I have only been using for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have experienced thickness and some growth with this product line. My hair definitely has more moisture and a nice looser curl on my roots. I am glad that this carrier still carries this same product and the same line. I do not like the new line as I have heard not so good reviews about it and my hair does well with this one. I hope that Shea Moisture either brings back this line or does not do away with its Yucca and Baobab line.</li>
            <li> It dries out your hair a lil bit (the biotin I figure, leaves a small white residue on your scalp), so I recommend following up with Shea Reconstructive elixir or grease to add more shine. There is no shine associated with this product, but I use it on my edges and have seen some changes in thickness!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  My hair is super fine and this really gives it that little extra body to perk it up during the day.  Careful not to add too much though, it can weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know it had alcohol. Not good for natural hair. I will not repurchase. It has taken me too long to get my hair in a healthy state to use this!</li>
            <li> I use this to spray on my hair before styling it. It helps the comb glide through my hair, especially when I have new growth. It also feels and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended if you have new growth that you need to get a comb through without ripping out your hair by their roots. You obviously have to be gentle, but gentle only gets you so far...</li>
            <li> Did not like this product at all. First of all,the spray bottle did not mist but instead placed a dollop of product in one spot. I did not notice any difference in my hair at all.</li>
            <li> Works really great with my natural hair. Amazing product I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This spray is super lightweight and provides great hold. A little background on my hair - Its pin straight and almost anything will way it down! But this doesn&#x27;t,  it feels great and dries instantly. If you want something that will add texture and hold some curls in then this is it. But don&#x27;t expect to see any major &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; . I feel that it just adds a bit texture which is why I rate it four stars instead of five. But still a good product.</li>
            <li> it contains alcohol and you will know after a week because it dries out your hair. I continued the use for another week and noticed mild breakage. mainly from the alcohol I believe.</li>
            <li> Love it, but you can get it from target.com for 9.74$. I&#x27;m always on the look out for a deal.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love it!!!  I use this product on my hair every night before going to bed....makes my hair full, soft and new growth is coming in.  I was losing my hair, because of stress, and lots of coloring.  this product is every womans dream.  makes hair soft and full and helps with regrowth.  It has a nice smell and does wonders for your hair.</li>
            <li> Did not do what is was suppose to, did not notice any difference in my hair at all. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Listen guys, i have never had a product that has has such a positive impact on my hair. i use it every morning and evening and it makes my hair soft and even detangle it</li>
