            <li>This is the best of all the denture adhesive I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>They are the VERY BEST.  </li>
            <li>These used to be the best ever.</li>
            <li>These used to be perfect and I don&#x27;t know what they did.  </li>
            <li>It is a very good product.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll most assuredly continue to buy these!  </li>
            <li>This provides a good hold for most of the day.</li>
            <li>these are, by far, the very best.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the distributor and was able to order from them.</li>
            <li>Sure wish they made a comparable product for uppers.    </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>It holds all day most days.</li>
            <li>Make sure you cut the strip to fit inside your denture.</li>
            <li>I trim them to fit and am able to be comfortable for most of the day.</li>
            <li>If one side was sticky and one side soft they would work great, but as is these things will hurt your gums.</li>
            <li>Luckily I am now able to get these through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Performs much better than expected -- FAR superior to anything available at the drug store!!</li>
            <li>the strips work but not as long as i thought i use them with the secure adhesive which is good</li>
            <li>I would like to return them for a full refund.</li>
            <li>The product is effective but being he had to receive further adjustments to his dentures</li>
            <li>Recently I ran across a package I had in an old bag and they are the old ones and they are the best ever!</li>
            <li>If good hold is important to you, you owe it to yourself to at least try one box.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>These are the only adhesives I have been able to use because I have an allergy to all the others.</li>
            <li>I would rather use ezo cushions there is nothing that holds better than ezo extra hold cushions- which I have used for thepast 20+ years.</li>
            <li>What a pity that they managed to mess them up because they used to be the BEST!</li>
            <li>This matches the name..though it says for lower , even with upper dentures you are secure for several days..much better than cream..</li>
            <li>Austria, where I was able to order a very large amount (year&#x27;s supply)  Obviously not cheap but worth it.  </li>
            <li>From my experience I would expect these strips to be really beneficial for their intended use on lower dentures.</li>
            <li>This really works.  </li>
            <li>These adhesive strips hold all day long and after removal, the strip comes off easily.</li>
            <li>Better than any other adhesive</li>
            <li>I actually use these to secure my upper denture that was supposed to be kept in place by a series of implants.</li>
            <li>So disappointed because they could be perfect with some changes.</li>
            <li>compared the old strips to the new ones</li>
            <li>Too much gooey and not enough gauze in the strips.</li>
            <li>But when he first used the tape it had lasted longer than any other store bought brand</li>
            <li>do not wet before using.</li>
            <li>I used most other denture product but they were very messy to put on or take off.</li>
            <li>He can get up to two whole meals without having to reapply glue, which makes life a little easier for him.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Make sure you cut the strip to fit inside your denture. do not wet before using. It is a very good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not possible to rate a product that never arrives.    No delivery, no response to contact.    Perhaps they&#x27;ve been taken up in the Rapture.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for someone who had recently acquired dentures.  The product is effective but being he had to receive further adjustments to his dentures it was no fault of the product.  But when he first used the tape it had lasted longer than any other store bought brand</li>
            <li> the strips work but not as long as i thought i use them with the secure adhesive which is good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in total agreement with PJ Lutrell&#x27;s opinion.  These are the best.  Don&#x27;t know how long my husband and I have been using them.  Used to find them at the drugstore and then they disappeared.  I contacted the distributor and was able to order from them. Eventually they sold their distributorship to another company and I ordered from them.  Eventually I couldn&#x27;t find them at all.  SO I contacted the manufacturer in (I think) Austria, where I was able to order a very large amount (year&#x27;s supply)  Obviously not cheap but worth it.  I&#x27;ve ordered them from England and just about every where else I could find them.  Luckily I am now able to get these through Amazon.  Saving a lot on phone bills.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line.... these ARE the best.  If good hold is important to you, you owe it to yourself to at least try one box.  I think you&#x27;ll be sold.&lt;br /&gt;xox&lt;br /&gt;MEF</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything ... these are, by far, the very best.  Somewhat on the expensive side (but that&#x27;s entirely relative to personal income) but I&#x27;ll most assuredly continue to buy these!  Sure wish they made a comparable product for uppers.    Jerry</li>
            <li> This provides a good hold for most of the day. My dad has a flattened gumline on the lower jaw. He can get up to two whole meals without having to reapply glue, which makes life a little easier for him.</li>
            <li> I actually use these to secure my upper denture that was supposed to be kept in place by a series of implants. The implants do not work so I devised a way to use these strips to do the job. While I realize these were designed for lower dentures the fact that work for my uppers is commendable. I trim them to fit and am able to be comfortable for most of the day. The only issue I have with them is the cost. They cost me $15.00 a month as I have to replace them daily. From my experience I would expect these strips to be really beneficial for their intended use on lower dentures.</li>
            <li> This is the best of all the denture adhesive I have ever tried.  I will find them where ever they are sold.  I started using these about 10 or 12 years ago. and I got them in Houston, Texas.  Now I have to find them thru the internet.  They are the VERY BEST.  patty luttrell</li>
            <li> This matches the name..though it says for lower , even with upper dentures you are secure for several days..much better than cream..</li>
            <li> They melt in my mouth. I would like to return them for a full refund. they were hard too get out of my mouth.</li>
            <li> This is coming from a lady that has tried EVERYTHING from in stores to on the Internet and I&#x27;m here to tell you I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I will NOT use anything else on my lower dentures. It holds all day most days. The only time it starts to feel loose is at the end of the day after I have worn them all day and I also eat tons of ice (bad habbit).. if you are unsure of this product, give it a try anyway. I am so thankful I finally did..</li>
            <li> Did not work for lower. I was disappointed. Difficult to use. Difficult to put in denture. Peel and stick and cutting for size. Did not work for me</li>
            <li> These used to be the best ever. Sometimes I could use a strip for several days. Then they changed, although the company denies they changed anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strips are made of a gauze like material covered with a coating that when moistened by your saliva adheres to your dental plate and molds to your gums.  The last couple of years the gauze material seems thinner and the coating is thicker. This results in there being too much gooey stuff on a thinner gauze strip and the strip slides off your dental plate after a few hours. The result is it becomes a gooey mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called the company and they deny any change but that&#x27;s not so! Recently I ran across a package I had in an old bag and they are the old ones and they are the best ever! But when they&#x27;re gone I guess that&#x27;s it - back to the slipy slidy stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared the old strips to the new ones and that&#x27;s how I figured out just what changed. Too much gooey and not enough gauze in the strips. What a pity that they managed to mess them up because they used to be the BEST!</li>
            <li> These are the only adhesives I have been able to use because I have an allergy to all the others.</li>
            <li> My order is always late and sometimes incomplete</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to replace the thermoplastic I used to get but since it has been discontinued I can not afford the big prices that the sellers on amazon on wanting this has shown to be a help in keeping my dentures in place I like it very much</li>
            <li> This really works.  Better than any other adhesive</li>
            <li> These used to be perfect and I don&#x27;t know what they did.  If one side was sticky and one side soft they would work great, but as is these things will hurt your gums. And the gooey resin they leave on your gums is awful.  So disappointed because they could be perfect with some changes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all.  Says to replace every 24 hors but didn&#x27;t last 30 Min.</li>
            <li> I would rather use ezo cushions there is nothing that holds better than ezo extra hold cushions- which I have used for thepast 20+ years.</li>
            <li> I used most other denture product but they were very messy to put on or take off. These adhesive strips hold all day long and after removal, the strip comes off easily.</li>
            <li> Performs much better than expected -- FAR superior to anything available at the drug store!!</li>
