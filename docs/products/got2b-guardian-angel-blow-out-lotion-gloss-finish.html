    <ol>
            <li>and I must that I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>Some of the Got 2b products are wonderful, but this one does not get my recommendation.</li>
            <li>Best find for under $10.</li>
            <li>But this is very good too.</li>
            <li>Great heat protection.  </li>
            <li>Works great on my curly hair.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully and I love the packaging.</li>
            <li>They all work great, including this product, and the prices are so fair.</li>
            <li>Its a really nice product that I think I just got hooked on!</li>
            <li>This product smells really good.</li>
            <li>If you want a good heat protector spray, use Beyond the Zone turn up the heat protection spray.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Smells lovely!</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>And she is an amazing blogger.</li>
            <li>Although, to be honest, my hair looks nicer than before even though it wasn&#x27;t frizzy before.</li>
            <li>Smells good :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply and there is NO BREAKAGE while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good alternative to the very pricey products out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure product I got is a nice product</li>
            <li>it would be amazing, for me is ok.</li>
            <li>So I like this product, and I&#x27;ve been able to make it work for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so glossy and smooth and makes me feel like I just went to the salon!  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I used this both before blow drying and straightening my hair, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I only spray twice and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Love these schwarzkopf products.</li>
            <li>You should follow her. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>First, it doesn&#x27;t smell good at all.</li>
            <li>This is a very good heat protectant spray for flat ironing, curling iron, blow dryer.</li>
            <li>It left a nice shine to my hair &amp; it feels &amp; smells so good.</li>
            <li>But, what can you expect with something as cheap as this.</li>
            <li>then if it&#x27;s higher like most good professional styling tools it will fry your hair</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time this morning, and my hair looks fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I spray this stuff before i blow dry my hair and it works great.</li>
            <li>I finally gave in to buying this product because I heard good things about it</li>
            <li>Makes your hair super manageable and easier to straighten, as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of different heat protectors Tresemme, Redken, John Frieda and many more.</li>
            <li>I rarely will get a split end.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>right through</li>
            <li>It makes your hair super straight after blow drying...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind dealing with \\&quot;a little stinky and frizzy\\&quot; in order to get a really good result.    </li>
            <li>I love this product for the affordability of daily use.</li>
            <li>Would most definitely recommend to users of heat hair styling tools</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t notice the product helping against heat.</li>
            <li>My iron went through it fast!</li>
            <li>I normally use the Its a 10 Leave in as my flat iron spray, which I love!</li>
            <li>I think I will use it too when I curl my hair with hot rollers too.</li>
            <li>I like this product a lot, it protects my hair a lot better than any other heat protectant I&#x27;ve tried (though I haven&#x27;t tried the super fancy ones).</li>
            <li>Read all the reviews which were so positive.</li>
            <li>I will still use Its a 10, but I think I will use this product more so bc its good for using on wet hair as a styler, helps to keep my hair from looking frizzy &amp; messy.</li>
            <li>This is a rather large bottle</li>
            <li>I dye my hair and it is very curly.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and I spritz it all over my hair and cannot believe how much is still in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Second, my hair is indeed more soft and shiny but its also frizzy now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now and it does work pretty well for heat protection by making the hair feel sleek and soft rather than crispy and stringy.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty does give me a soft feel to the hair</li>
            <li>After that I blow dry my hair and don&#x27;t really do anything special.</li>
            <li>It smells kind of like a generic hairspray when you first spray it, but I can&#x27;t smell anything after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair super soft and shiny without looking oily and gross.</li>
            <li>Big bottle leaves hair smooth my flat iron runs</li>
            <li>At first, didn&#x27;t notice much besides how good it smelled and the gloss shine once I finished but now, I can tell my split ends are not as nearly bad as they use to be.     </li>
            <li>I sprayed it on my wet hair after I washed it, woke up next moring &amp; lightly sprayed it again before I ironed.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and non crunchy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this product nearly as often as I thought I would.</li>
            <li>And as far as I can see, it doesn&#x27;t help a bit with protecting from my hair from blow dryer/curler/  or straightener.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that another product would work as well as the Its a 10.</li>
            <li>The extra step is well worth it, and I don&#x27;t mind the extra time it takes.    </li>
            <li>AND I really needed something to help my hair not look dry with split ends all over.</li>
            <li>This bottle will last me a few months at least which is amazing for the price!</li>
            <li>To me this smells like a mixture of cheap deodorants in the high school locker room after a girls field hockey game, but then again I bought this product for its purpose - not the scent.</li>
            <li>Some other reviews mentioned that it made their hair greasy and they might have different hair than I do, but I would suggest to not use as much product.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> you almost wont have to use your flat iron afterwards.</li>
            <li> As long you don&#x27;t mind the smell, don&#x27;t worry about, especially if you wear purfume</li>
            <li> And it lasts a very long time especially for using it as often as I do.</li>
            <li> I think it probably protects as well as possible, but it&#x27;s a little too heavy for me and gives my hair that oily look that I really dislike.</li>
            <li> It is not too oily as long as you spray it a distance from your hair.</li>
            <li> I blow dry and straighten my hair 7 days a week.</li>
            <li> and I blow dry my hair 6 days out of the week, if not 7.</li>
            <li> I straighten and blow dry my hair every morning.</li>
            <li> and then it stopped showing up in stores which was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a particularly strong scent, and it won&#x27;t double as a perfume.</li>
            <li> When I used other products they would give me split ends and my hairdresser always asked if I even used protector</li>
            <li> After I take a shower and wrap my hair in a towel, I let it dry just a little bit and then spray this on it and comb it through.</li>
            <li> Not right for me.</li>
            <li> A trick I&#x27;ve been using to get an boosted sealed-in shine is to use the heat protection spray as directed before a bowl out, then after blowing my hair with the hottest setting, I immediately turn the heat down to the lowest setting and hold down the cold shot button all while my hair is still hot, then use the super cold air as though I were thoroughly drying my hair again.</li>
            <li> I wrap my hair in towel and then let it down.</li>
            <li> This left my hair hard and stiff.</li>
            <li> But after 1 week of using it everyday I did notice improvements.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long hair (past my bra line)</li>
            <li> Seems to dull my hair; doesn&#x27;t hold well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what makes that process work, but it does!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in this lotion.</li>
            <li> Gave my hair a weird texture.</li>
            <li> It smells awful, and it flattens down my hair.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff! It works wonderfully and I love the packaging. I have never tried any of their products until this one and I must that I&#x27;m impressed. It&#x27;s very easy to apply and there is NO BREAKAGE while you&#x27;re using it. It makes your hair super straight after blow drying...you almost wont have to use your flat iron afterwards. Try it!</li>
            <li> I blow dry and straighten my hair 7 days a week. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now and it does work pretty well for heat protection by making the hair feel sleek and soft rather than crispy and stringy. I like this product and will continue to use it, but I have two issues with it. First, it doesn&#x27;t smell good at all. To me this smells like a mixture of cheap deodorants in the high school locker room after a girls field hockey game, but then again I bought this product for its purpose - not the scent. As long you don&#x27;t mind the smell, don&#x27;t worry about, especially if you wear purfume then you won&#x27;t even notice. Second, my hair is indeed more soft and shiny but its also frizzy now. I have to use an additional hold spray to keep the frizz from acting up that I didn&#x27;t need to use prior. Although, to be honest, my hair looks nicer than before even though it wasn&#x27;t frizzy before. The extra step is well worth it, and I don&#x27;t mind the extra time it takes.    So I like this product, and I&#x27;ve been able to make it work for me. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind dealing with \\&quot;a little stinky and frizzy\\&quot; in order to get a really good result.    A trick I&#x27;ve been using to get an boosted sealed-in shine is to use the heat protection spray as directed before a bowl out, then after blowing my hair with the hottest setting, I immediately turn the heat down to the lowest setting and hold down the cold shot button all while my hair is still hot, then use the super cold air as though I were thoroughly drying my hair again. I&#x27;m not sure what makes that process work, but it does!</li>
            <li> This left my hair hard and stiff. I am not a fan. Some of the Got 2b products are wonderful, but this one does not get my recommendation.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING.  Used it for the first time this morning, and my hair looks fabulous!  It&#x27;s so glossy and smooth and makes me feel like I just went to the salon!  Makes your hair super manageable and easier to straighten, as well.  Smells good :)</li>
            <li> I dye my hair and it is very curly. I love this product for the affordability of daily use. I wrap my hair in towel and then let it down. I spray this stuff before i blow dry my hair and it works great. It is not too oily as long as you spray it a distance from your hair. Best find for under $10.</li>
            <li> Product received was not item pictured. I&#x27;m sure product I got is a nice product but it is not the item in the picture.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty does give me a soft feel to the hair but it only protects 425 then if it&#x27;s higher like most good professional styling tools it will fry your hair</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Got2be Guardian Angel Gloss Finish Blow out lotion for almost two months now and I love it! This is a rather large bottle and I spritz it all over my hair and cannot believe how much is still in the bottle. I have very thick, long hair (past my bra line) and I blow dry my hair 6 days out of the week, if not 7. I finally gave in to buying this product because I heard good things about it AND I really needed something to help my hair not look dry with split ends all over. At first, didn&#x27;t notice much besides how good it smelled and the gloss shine once I finished but now, I can tell my split ends are not as nearly bad as they use to be.     I would recommend this blow out lotion simply because it helps protect your hair from the harmful effects of blow dryers/straighteners/curling irons and because it does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different heat protectors Tresemme, Redken, John Frieda and many more. I straighten and blow dry my hair every morning. This works for both. When I used other products they would give me split ends and my hairdresser always asked if I even used protector and I always did! When I switched to this over two years ago, I was never asked again if I used heat protector. I rarely will get a split end. I love this product. And it lasts a very long time especially for using it as often as I do.</li>
            <li> I use this both for blowing out my hair and for straightening my hair. It&#x27;s a very good alternative to the very pricey products out there.</li>
            <li> Great heat protection.  Leaves hair soft and non crunchy. Smells lovely! Would most definitely recommend to users of heat hair styling tools</li>
            <li> This product smells really good. It gives your hair a glossy effect. At first I didn&#x27;t notice the product helping against heat. My hair still got damaged. But after 1 week of using it everyday I did notice improvements.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot, it protects my hair a lot better than any other heat protectant I&#x27;ve tried (though I haven&#x27;t tried the super fancy ones). I used this both before blow drying and straightening my hair, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure if it&#x27;s supposed to be used for both. My hair seems to stay straighter for longer when I use this. It smells kind of like a generic hairspray when you first spray it, but I can&#x27;t smell anything after a few minutes. Definitely not a particularly strong scent, and it won&#x27;t double as a perfume. Overall, I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> I had been using this stuff for years and then it stopped showing up in stores which was a huge disappointment. I love this stuff. After I take a shower and wrap my hair in a towel, I let it dry just a little bit and then spray this on it and comb it through. After that I blow dry my hair and don&#x27;t really do anything special. This stuff makes my hair super soft and shiny without looking oily and gross. Some other reviews mentioned that it made their hair greasy and they might have different hair than I do, but I would suggest to not use as much product. I only spray twice and it works perfectly. A friend of mine has longer hair so she does three pumps and doesn&#x27;t have issues. This bottle will last me a few months at least which is amazing for the price! I hope I can always find this stuff on here. I will be purchasing it again!!!</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews which were so positive. Seems to dull my hair; doesn&#x27;t hold well. Not right for me.</li>
            <li> Love these schwarzkopf products. I use a bunch of their stuff for when I leave my hair curly and when I straighten it. I also use their purple shampoo for my blonde hair. They all work great, including this product, and the prices are so fair.</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is too coarse. I thing for a thiner hair it would be amazing, for me is ok.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in this lotion. I think it probably protects as well as possible, but it&#x27;s a little too heavy for me and gives my hair that oily look that I really dislike. I don&#x27;t use this product nearly as often as I thought I would.</li>
            <li> It smells awful, and it flattens down my hair. And as far as I can see, it doesn&#x27;t help a bit with protecting from my hair from blow dryer/curler/  or straightener. If you want a good heat protector spray, use Beyond the Zone turn up the heat protection spray. But, what can you expect with something as cheap as this.</li>
            <li> Big bottle leaves hair smooth my flat iron runs right through I get done straightening my hair within 5 mins now definitely woul buy again</li>
            <li> This is a very good heat protectant spray for flat ironing, curling iron, blow dryer. I sprayed it on my wet hair after I washed it, woke up next moring &amp; lightly sprayed it again before I ironed. My iron went through it fast! It left a nice shine to my hair &amp; it feels &amp; smells so good. I normally use the Its a 10 Leave in as my flat iron spray, which I love! But this is very good too. I was surprised that another product would work as well as the Its a 10. Cheaper too, by like $10. I will still use Its a 10, but I think I will use this product more so bc its good for using on wet hair as a styler, helps to keep my hair from looking frizzy &amp; messy. I think I will use it too when I curl my hair with hot rollers too. Its a really nice product that I think I just got hooked on! I will look for it in stores, but if I cant find it, I&#x27;ll buy in on Amazon!</li>
