    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product that some men may need.</li>
            <li>What an awesome product.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to supplement DHEA I am in my 70s</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to recommend it.</li>
            <li>lol..</li>
            <li>Very effective.</li>
            <li>This is the most effective and best priced of the DHEA creams.  </li>
            <li>As it turns out, one bottle is good for about 60 doses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is a good value for women also.</li>
            <li>Good Product, Works</li>
            <li>product works for me, and does a good job as it is with anything moderation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this stuff seems to rewind the clock a good bit</li>
            <li>Just good effects.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good to apply 1/2 doses.</li>
            <li>My husband is very pleased w/ this product reccomended by a family member who uses it as well.</li>
            <li>This product is better than testoserone hormone replacement!</li>
            <li>Nice not to have to measure dosage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nowhere on the packaging does it say how many doses it contains.</li>
            <li>Seems to work better than the sublinguals:</li>
            <li>Most notably is the improvement in mood and well-being.  </li>
            <li>price is OK</li>
            <li>noticed acne when using it more then three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I did notice I am in a better mood more often.</li>
            <li>Much more affordable through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Glad its available!</li>
            <li>OK, I BELIEVE I HAVE REVIEWED THIS BEFORE</li>
            <li>I think this is OK</li>
            <li>but I have tried another supplement that I like much more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those done with ages 60-80 showed most had youthful blood levels with</li>
            <li>Blood tests show it works just as well and the price is better than the prescription.</li>
            <li>Husband says he feels better</li>
            <li>u react.... and don&#x27;t be testing more than one product at a time, otherwise, its easy to confuse what is the culprit when you have a reaction.  </li>
            <li>Works great, as effective as the prescription that I had from a local compounding pharmacy.  </li>
            <li>While I am glad these products are available and bypass the FDA approval process, this should not give people the peace of mind that every supplement will provide benefits and no risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Of course, this is true with foods as well, some love peanuts, others it can almost kill them.  </li>
            <li>found more frequent breaks were better, I am seeing much better concentration, and libido.</li>
            <li>But so far so good.</li>
            <li>Original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>then try two days full dose.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>try three days full dose etc</li>
            <li>Apply one full press of the pump once a day as needed.</li>
            <li>and I always get full blood work (including free/total testosterone)</li>
            <li>Following the startup period, I noticed more energy, I seemed to sweat more during the day</li>
            <li>But if it does work for you like it did me, it helped me feel more normal.</li>
            <li>At 41 my doctor tells me all is normal and healthy</li>
            <li>If you feel better with no negative side effects then keep it up.</li>
            <li>I was previously on a doctor-prescribed pharmaceutical transdermal DHEA lotion, and in my opinion, this formulation is more effective.</li>
            <li>So if you are experimenting with this stuff, and like me, tend to think that if a little is good, then a lot would be better -- resist the impulse to slather a whole bunch of this all over your body.</li>
            <li>it goes directly to the blood stream making the exposure better for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s worth taking a look at</li>
            <li>I recommend trying different approaches and do your own research.</li>
            <li>The cream itself works very well, and is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>I recommend that book for anyone interested in using hormone replacement.</li>
            <li>This is my first order for this product</li>
            <li>Will order more in the future.  </li>
            <li>I will purchase a second one just to make sure</li>
            <li>More energetic and no more afternoon naps</li>
            <li>Without blood tests one cannot say how effective this product might be but it is convenient, dries quickly and has little odor.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to be able to apply topically &amp; does the job!</li>
            <li>I am not planning on having any blood work done, so this is purely my subjective evaluation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t get prescription testosterone supplementation, but I certainly don&#x27;t feel 25 anymore...</li>
            <li>Large individuals and those over 80 might require twice-daily dosage.</li>
            <li>Younger women experienced slight masculinization symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>\\&quot;4 ounces\\&quot; isn&#x27;t very informative when you don&#x27;t know how much one dose weighs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s no way to tell how much you&#x27;ve used, or if you&#x27;re close to running out.</li>
            <li>Having used this for over two weeks, I&#x27;ve absolutely felt and seen a difference.</li>
            <li>That said, I advise being very cautious and indeed cycling off and on.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it did much else.</li>
            <li>worked really well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This works really well.  </li>
            <li>It seems to have boisted my drive somewhAt but hasn&#x27;t really done much for my erectile dysfuction vitamins in conjunction help</li>
            <li>My spouse wants to reorder this product before it runs out.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>He really noticed the difference.</li>
            <li>very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>Seems to work as well or better than other dhea creams,Ive used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First use it one day 1/2 dose then second day full dose.&lt;br /&gt;Stop</li>
            <li>, I discovered that for me, less is more.</li>
            <li>some help people tremendously, while the same product can cause harm to others.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Company stood behind the product, was very responsive, they offered a full refund, can&#x27;t ask for better customer service.  </li>
            <li>Also, the first doses you get out of the pump are smaller than they should be, because the pump isn&#x27;t primed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am eating more not sure why that is .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with other supplements and it seems to be helpful, I am now on my 3rd bottle and will continue to use it as recommended, I don&#x27;t use any more than the recommended dosage, and I do cycle off for 5 days after each bottle runs out.</li>
            <li>Try just a small amount, applied regularly once a day before bed, and see if that&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>It may not be related, but I do have mild psoriases and it flared up towards the end of the usage period at the same time</li>
            <li>This cream has helped tremendously with periodic skin rashes (mostly due to stress).  </li>
            <li>Like all these supplements, its like the Wild Wild West....</li>
            <li>i am not much into the idea of something being absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>I now use WAY less than the full dose of this stuff -- just a dollop of the cream on each wrist before bedtime -- and I get all the benefits associated with DHEA without noticeable side effects.</li>
            <li>My main objection is that the price has ranged from $12-$27 in the last year.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little while to take full effect.</li>
            <li>have only been using this product for a few days, but subjectively, I am seeing significant improvements in libido, energy levels, mood, and sleep.</li>
            <li>this product has helped me to be more active but a word of caution the dosage by recommendations set forth by Dr David Browstein in his book The miracle of natural Hormones is excessive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently on HRT therapy through my doctor and he states that DHEA in this circumstance is typically not additionally beneficial</li>
            <li>so I can gauge what effects are good or bad.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m currently on HRT therapy through my doctor and he states that DHEA in this circumstance is typically not additionally beneficial</li>
            <li> so I can gauge what effects are good or bad.</li>
            <li> Since I do use other supplements and have been spending much more time being active, it&#x27;s difficult to say how much exactly this product helps</li>
            <li> It works, its not magic in a bottle but it works without damaging your kidneys or producing Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or to much of it anyways.</li>
            <li> I have used for only 2 weeks, so I cant tell whther it works or not, but the product was as expected.</li>
            <li> It is not a fix all, it will not give you erections or have you running down the street naked chasing the ladies.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling only slightly sticky but moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Growing old sucks.  </li>
            <li> Everythng, as  expected.</li>
            <li> Possibly placebo effect as my lab results didn&#x27;t show a dramatic increase in DHEA blood levels but in my experience there is often a complicated relationship between the hormones and one can see and feel considerable differences that aren&#x27;t immediately evident in labs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed the other effects.</li>
            <li> U also have to be concerned about interactions with other supplements or pharma products.  </li>
            <li> The DHEA does not crystallize out of solution as I have seen with other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> 1/2 pump gives me the dose I&#x27;m looking for...which means I can use less cream...when you add together your other hormone creams it can be hard to find enough skin to apply it all.</li>
            <li> Not worth calling and exchanging.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a little changes but, I am on other supplements too.</li>
            <li> Ihave used this product previously, and it has done the job.</li>
            <li> But I have a few frustrations with the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No idea if this works because there&#x27;s a hole in the bottom of the package with leaked, dried out product.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would help with a few problems.  </li>
            <li> I reacted to this product quite harshly....  </li>
            <li> immediately stopped, took a few days to recover.  </li>
            <li> Super annoying.</li>
            <li> but like all these products, u should test them very slowly in case</li>
            <li> Frustratingly, includes Saw Palmetto extract which is known to reduce DHT.</li>
            <li> Very frustrated.</li>

            <li> Frustratingly, includes Saw Palmetto extract which is known to reduce DHT. Also contains the toxic phenoxyethanol, which could be the reason it caused a rash on my face.</li>
            <li> The cream itself works very well, and is quickly absorbed. But I have a few frustrations with the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowhere on the packaging does it say how many doses it contains. \\&quot;4 ounces\\&quot; isn&#x27;t very informative when you don&#x27;t know how much one dose weighs. As it turns out, one bottle is good for about 60 doses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no way to tell how much you&#x27;ve used, or if you&#x27;re close to running out. Also, the first doses you get out of the pump are smaller than they should be, because the pump isn&#x27;t primed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I deduct one star for packaging.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Very effective.</li>
            <li> Been using almost every day since I got it. But who knows if it actually works or not</li>
            <li> Trims up, while adding muscle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve altered my review. Having used this for over two weeks, I&#x27;ve absolutely felt and seen a difference. I&#x27;m convinced it works.It took over 2 weeks of daily use before I was noticing. Following the startup period, I noticed more energy, I seemed to sweat more during the day (I&#x27;d use is in the AM before work), so it seems that my metabolism was up. It may not be related, but I do have mild psoriases and it flared up towards the end of the usage period at the same time I noticed the other effects. This all indicates to me that this indeed does work. That said, I advise being very cautious and indeed cycling off and on. 3 weeks on / 1 off, as opposed to continuous usage.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to supplement DHEA I am in my 70s this product has helped me to be more active but a word of caution the dosage by recommendations set forth by Dr David Browstein in his book The miracle of natural Hormones is excessive. I recommend that book for anyone interested in using hormone replacement.</li>
            <li> No idea if this works because there&#x27;s a hole in the bottom of the package with leaked, dried out product. The pump doesn&#x27;t create anything. Super annoying. Not worth calling and exchanging. Very frustrated.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective and best priced of the DHEA creams.  Seems to work better than the sublinguals: I notice the difference in my energy level and mood.  Leaves skin feeling only slightly sticky but moisturized.  My main objection is that the price has ranged from $12-$27 in the last year.  I finally bought from another company to avoid the price shocks.</li>
            <li> Most notably is the improvement in mood and well-being.  I can&#x27;t say that it did much else.</li>
            <li> Only stuff that works for me price is OK just wish you could see how much is left for reorder</li>
            <li> Original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this product for a few days, but subjectively, I am seeing significant improvements in libido, energy levels, mood, and sleep. I was previously on a doctor-prescribed pharmaceutical transdermal DHEA lotion, and in my opinion, this formulation is more effective. I am not planning on having any blood work done, so this is purely my subjective evaluation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a lot of trial and error with this product, I discovered that for me, less is more. I now use WAY less than the full dose of this stuff -- just a dollop of the cream on each wrist before bedtime -- and I get all the benefits associated with DHEA without noticeable side effects. So if you are experimenting with this stuff, and like me, tend to think that if a little is good, then a lot would be better -- resist the impulse to slather a whole bunch of this all over your body. Try just a small amount, applied regularly once a day before bed, and see if that&#x27;s effective. I also think it may be helpful to cycle this product, 5 days on, 2 or 3 days off, but I am still experimenting with that procedure.</li>
            <li> This is my first order for this product so i don&#x27;t think it has had time to affect any changes. But so far so good.</li>
            <li> This product is a good value for women also. 1/2 pump gives me the dose I&#x27;m looking for...which means I can use less cream...when you add together your other hormone creams it can be hard to find enough skin to apply it all.</li>
            <li> I have used for only 2 weeks, so I cant tell whther it works or not, but the product was as expected.</li>
            <li> Good Product, Works Well.  Use Caution.&lt;br /&gt;The product works for me, and does a good job as it is with anything moderation.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a Doctor, however this product in my opinion should be used to test in titration.&lt;br /&gt;First use it one day 1/2 dose then second day full dose.&lt;br /&gt;Stop then try two days full dose.&lt;br /&gt;Then try three days full dose etc .&lt;br /&gt;I found for me 2-3days on with two to three days off worked really well.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed acne when using it more then three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions say : Apply one full press of the pump once a day as needed. Rotate application each time between face, hands, chest, inner arms and thighs. Use once a day for a maximum of 25 consecutive days. Resume after a five-day break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found more frequent breaks were better, I am seeing much better concentration, and libido. I am eating more not sure why that is .&lt;br /&gt;I have taken DHea in pill form but worried about Kidney and liver issues with such medication, being this is external use it goes directly to the blood stream making the exposure better for me. As with any over the counter medication, use in moderation. This is designed to help your bodies depletion of testosterone. It is not a fix all, it will not give you erections or have you running down the street naked chasing the ladies. But if it does work for you like it did me, it helped me feel more normal. I am 52 and only had semi-low T on occasion this seems to help and I did notice I am in a better mood more often.</li>
            <li> In November 2013, my husband had his testosterone levels and DHEA levels checked as part of his routine bloodwork. His testosterone serum level was 331, which is low; and his DHEA level was 57.8, which is also low. I found this cream on Amazon website in April 2014 and decided to give it a try. He had his bloodwork redone in June. This time his testosterone levels had risen to 440 and his DHEA levels had risen to 83.9. We will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This works really well.  No obnoxious smell.  Much more affordable through Amazon.  Will order more in the future.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and I think it works.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with other supplements and it seems to be helpful, I am now on my 3rd bottle and will continue to use it as recommended, I don&#x27;t use any more than the recommended dosage, and I do cycle off for 5 days after each bottle runs out. Since I do use other supplements and have been spending much more time being active, it&#x27;s difficult to say how much exactly this product helps but I can say it seems to make a difference (for me anyway) if used regularly. At 41 my doctor tells me all is normal and healthy so I can&#x27;t get prescription testosterone supplementation, but I certainly don&#x27;t feel 25 anymore... this stuff seems to rewind the clock a good bit and I will be continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> I had a severe allergic reaction to the oral dhea. This product with the topical application through the skin, no severe allergic reaction. Glad its available!</li>
            <li> Guys,  this is the one ! Get It !</li>
            <li> OK, I BELIEVE I HAVE REVIEWED THIS BEFORE SO I AM GOING TO JUST SAY ..EXCELLENT. BUT OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IT WORKS AND IT WILL.</li>
            <li> It seems to have boisted my drive somewhAt but hasn&#x27;t really done much for my erectile dysfuction vitamins in conjunction help</li>
            <li> Growing old sucks.  I&#x27;ve been using DHEA as an antedote to aging for years.  Guess what, it doesn&#x27;t work, but it helps.  Of all the versions, tablets, sublingual pills and creams, I&#x27;ve chosen this one.  I&#x27;m happy to recommend it.</li>
            <li> Everythng, as  expected. It has always met my expectations. Ihave used this product previously, and it has done the job.</li>
            <li> This product is better than testoserone hormone replacement! Which I have done for a while and then stopped. No side effects. Just good effects. It takes a little while to take full effect. The body needs to absorb and saturate. My spouse wants to reorder this product before it runs out.</li>
            <li> i have been on it for 2 weeks. I have noticed a little changes but, I am on other supplements too. I will purchase a second one just to make sure</li>
            <li> I am 50+ and suffer from Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroid.  This cream has helped tremendously with periodic skin rashes (mostly due to stress).  I no longer have to go get a prescription for the stronger steroid creams.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would help with a few problems.  It really didn&#x27;t work but it&#x27;s good to apply 1/2 doses.</li>
            <li> I think this is OK but I have tried another supplement that I like much more. I will not order this again.</li>
            <li> Like all these supplements, its like the Wild Wild West.... some help people tremendously, while the same product can cause harm to others.  Of course, this is true with foods as well, some love peanuts, others it can almost kill them.  I reacted to this product quite harshly....  immediately stopped, took a few days to recover.  I am prob. in the minority...but like all these products, u should test them very slowly in case u react.... and don&#x27;t be testing more than one product at a time, otherwise, its easy to confuse what is the culprit when you have a reaction.  U also have to be concerned about interactions with other supplements or pharma products.  While I am glad these products are available and bypass the FDA approval process, this should not give people the peace of mind that every supplement will provide benefits and no risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Company stood behind the product, was very responsive, they offered a full refund, can&#x27;t ask for better customer service.  I understood there is risks in taking these products, and this time I reacted...I don&#x27;t blame the maker... so my rating is for the product and its effect on me, not the maker (or re seller) of the product.</li>
            <li> It works, its not magic in a bottle but it works without damaging your kidneys or producing Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or to much of it anyways. If you purchase give your self about 2 weeks to notice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently on HRT therapy through my doctor and he states that DHEA in this circumstance is typically not additionally beneficial but I noticed a difference and have been taking this or the lower dose version (alternate day to day now) for about 3 months. Possibly placebo effect as my lab results didn&#x27;t show a dramatic increase in DHEA blood levels but in my experience there is often a complicated relationship between the hormones and one can see and feel considerable differences that aren&#x27;t immediately evident in labs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth taking a look at and I always get full blood work (including free/total testosterone) 3-4x a year so I can gauge what effects are good or bad. I recommend trying different approaches and do your own research. If you feel better with no negative side effects then keep it up.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that some men may need. Very convenient to be able to apply topically &amp; does the job! My husband is very pleased w/ this product reccomended by a family member who uses it as well. Will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Without blood tests one cannot say how effective this product might be but it is convenient, dries quickly and has little odor. The DHEA does not crystallize out of solution as I have seen with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is difficult to say whether the dosage is appropriate when one is not getting regular blood tests. Research done with college students showed no benefit and overdose symptoms. Younger women experienced slight masculinization symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those done with ages 60-80 showed most had youthful blood levels with 50 mg/d orally and women surpassed youthful levels at 100 mg/d orally. The effect of 30 mg/d transdermally probably overlaps that same range but also probably differs among individuals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the product for both sexes over age 60. Large individuals and those over 80 might require twice-daily dosage.</li>
            <li> I believe it gives me the amount of DHEA that my body needs and it is via topically. My liver does not screen it out. Amen.</li>
            <li> What an awesome product. I was skeptical at first. i am not much into the idea of something being absorbed into the skin. But I ried this product and it seems to work.</li>
            <li> Works great, as effective as the prescription that I had from a local compounding pharmacy.  Blood tests show it works just as well and the price is better than the prescription.</li>
            <li> Husband says he feels better and I can see it.  More energetic and no more afternoon naps lol.. He has gone thru several but stopped for a while and I could tell and so did he ....when he restarted agin....He really noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> very convenient to use. Seems to work as well or better than other dhea creams,Ive used. Nice not to have to measure dosage.</li>
