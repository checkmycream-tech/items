            <li>Good deal, ships quickly.</li>
            <li>With free shipping and super pricing, this was a great deal.  </li>
            <li>For a better shave try Astras and Feathers.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re better than voskhods (to me).</li>
            <li>MUCH MUCH better than the house-label you&#x27;ll find in chain stores.</li>
            <li>on par with astra sp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;about 90% of sharpness of feather but much more forgiving and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Blades are OK for the price.</li>
            <li>He could not be leave a 12 cent razor blade worked better then</li>
            <li>i saw all these great reviews barbers highly recommend these blade are supposed to be 25% sharper then the rest</li>
            <li>it makes my face smooth as a babies bottom</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands and for me these would rate as decent blades but NOT the magic miracle blades</li>
            <li>These are a mild blade good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Do these fit personna magic straight razor?</li>
            <li>I have 4 other brands on hand that shave great.  </li>
            <li>regret my decision and Gillette gave me a far smooth and irritation free shave and the blade</li>
            <li>For me, with thick hair, but a fairly sensitive face, they provide the best balance of sharpness and comfort.</li>
            <li>These are okay for daily use.</li>
            <li>Everybody is different and you might love them.</li>
            <li>The blade was very, very&lt;</li>
            <li>Fast service</li>
            <li>Im very dissapointed in these blades</li>
            <li>so i figured its been long over due for some new blades saw these read the review i thought it was a great deal</li>
            <li>Much better than any other blade .. and made in the USA !</li>
            <li>/&gt;In comparison, Personna blue was rough and gave a burning sensation, the blades didnt seem to be effective after 1st shave and didn&#x27;t give me a close shave as Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and comfortable.</li>
            <li>i couldnt wait to try these new blades out....</li>
            <li>i been using the same exact blade every shave since</li>
            <li>liked the way the Personna were extra sharp and he only needed to shave once a day.</li>
            <li>I am just under 50 yrs old, so I have shaved a couple of times.</li>
            <li>So far, they&#x27;ve provided a very close shave with minimal discomfort.</li>
            <li>This blade really works for me and has truly enhanced my wet shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>well i completely disagree i bought a double sided razor about a year ago for $3.00 here on amazon</li>
            <li>they did not cut no where near as close as my other blade did nowhere near as sharp not as clean shave all around no comparison to the shave i got for the past year for my $3.00 razor with 1 double sided blade when i use my 1 year old blade</li>
            <li>Prior to using these, I tried the Derby brand that came with my razor and stopped using them, not sharp enough.</li>
            <li>They are decent blades but for my money there are TONS of other brands that outperform these.</li>
            <li>I am fairly new to wet shaving</li>

            <li> This blade really works for me and has truly enhanced my wet shaving experience.  I received the package nearly a week before&lt;br /&gt;estimated delivery, and it arrived in excellent shape.  With free shipping and super pricing, this was a great deal.  The blade was very, very&lt;br /&gt;comfortable and there was no nicking or pulling as in previous blades.  For me....this is the blade.</li>
            <li> Much better than any other blade .. and made in the USA !</li>
            <li> These blades work great! I would recommend them to buy!!</li>
            <li> Loving not having to spend and arm and a leg for razor blades.</li>
            <li> Sweet blades!! Good smooth cut, get ya lined up in no time &amp; save a ton of $$$$!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these razors!  They are the best I have ever used. They are perfect for someone with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> These work for me. Sharp and smooth. Can&#x27;t beat them</li>
            <li> Great blades, clean cut every time.</li>
            <li> So far, they&#x27;ve provided a very close shave with minimal discomfort.</li>
            <li> I can just about get from Friday to Friday on one blade!! Just switched to DE safety razors and yes, there&#x27;s a learning curve. Prior to using these, I tried the Derby brand that came with my razor and stopped using them, not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> These are okay for daily use. For a better shave try Astras and Feathers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried blades from Derby, Shark, Feather and others, but always come back to the Personna. For me, with thick hair, but a fairly sensitive face, they provide the best balance of sharpness and comfort. I&#x27;m through trying others-I&#x27;m always disappointed. Sticking with these from now on. American made too!</li>
            <li> Excellent blades...and made in USA.close shavers and smooth..cant be beat for the price.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re better than voskhods (to me). MUCH MUCH better than the house-label you&#x27;ll find in chain stores. on par with astra sp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;about 90% of sharpness of feather but much more forgiving and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;about 95% of sharpness and smoothness of polsilver SI</li>
            <li> These are a mild blade good for sensitive skin. Not as aggressive as Feather or even Wilkinson. On par with Derby. Good deal, ships quickly.</li>
            <li> Blades are OK for the price.</li>
            <li> I  still have the 100 pack with about 80  left,. Every  blade has been terrible. What I have been doing is trying one every so often with the same result. Mind you I have 4 other brands on hand that shave great.  I gave my co worker 5 blades and is a veteran wet shaver and he came to the same conclusion .To  me this has to be a dud pack.</li>
            <li> Good price.  Fast service</li>
            <li> Does not give me a good shave. Blood everywhere. Will continue my search for a quality blade.</li>
            <li> Do these fit personna magic straight razor?</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to wet shaving so I have only tried 2 or 3 brands of blades. These are the best blades so far that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave, excellent price! Can&#x27;t find anything to complain about with these razor blades!</li>
            <li> I order this for my son who is in the military. He was home on leave and complaining about how he had to shave twice a day for his assignment and it was irritating his face. He said he bought the best razor he could find a 3 blade razor.&lt;br /&gt;I loaned him my extra safety razor with Personna blades made in America to try.&lt;br /&gt;He liked the way the Personna were extra sharp and he only needed to shave once a day. He could not be leave a 12 cent razor blade worked better then the $15 a pack 3 blade razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps. these razors are sharp be careful. If I could I would give them a 6 star + Rating</li>
            <li> Meets my expectations. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Best razor blade there is. I have tried quite a few double-edge blades, but none of them beats this one. They work well in every DE razor I own. They are sharp and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Im very dissapointed in these blades i saw all these great reviews barbers highly recommend these blade are supposed to be 25% sharper then the rest well i completely disagree i bought a double sided razor about a year ago for $3.00 here on amazon i been using the same exact blade every shave since so i figured its been long over due for some new blades saw these read the review i thought it was a great deal they came i couldnt wait to try these new blades out....not impressed one bit feel like i threw my money down the drain to be honest. they did not cut no where near as close as my other blade did nowhere near as sharp not as clean shave all around no comparison to the shave i got for the past year for my $3.00 razor with 1 double sided blade when i use my 1 year old blade it makes my face smooth as a babies bottom feel no hair i use these blades i just bought u can feel the hair n still even see it!</li>
            <li> I have a medium beard and usually get about 4 shaves on a single razor.</li>
            <li> I stopped using derby blades to give these a try, and theres no comparison. These blades are butter!</li>
            <li> I was using Gillette blades before I bought this personna blue pack (100) to save money on blades.&lt;br /&gt;I regret my decision and Gillette gave me a far smooth and irritation free shave and the blade lasted for 2 to 3 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison, Personna blue was rough and gave a burning sensation, the blades didnt seem to be effective after 1st shave and didn&#x27;t give me a close shave as Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the price difference I am saving is not worth the shaving experience. Hope this review helps others especially those moving from Gillette.</li>
            <li> They are decent blades but for my money there are TONS of other brands that outperform these. Everybody is different and you might love them. I have tried many brands and for me these would rate as decent blades but NOT the magic miracle blades people make them out to be. I am just under 50 yrs old, so I have shaved a couple of times. Bottom Line is try them and see if they work for you. If you love them great. They are razor blades, your not buying a house. One person can tell you if they will work for \\&quot;YOU\\&quot; and he isn&#x27;t the guy who loves to make YouTube videos because people send him FREE crap to review. He isn&#x27;t the guy writing this review either. I tried them I don&#x27;t think they are wonderful blades. They work but for the money they are not much better then say a Derby etc... etc....</li>
            <li> Perfect razors, quick shipping.</li>
