            <li>Colors are pretty bright, kind of powdery.</li>

            <li>I Love it.  </li>
            <li>Really works great</li>
            <li>I suggest a better packing for items like this one.</li>
            <li>and the colors were more subdued.</li>
            <li>In the picture looks more like a blush bronzer palette, while it is more of just a blush set.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty fair</li>
            <li>and when I saw this palette on amazon I was really excited!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit me but its ok</li>
            <li>Nice colors and a great pallet, lasts me a very long time.</li>
            <li>the colors are so pretty i love it!</li>
            <li>I am a caramel complecte dafrican american woman and although I liked the quality of the product, the colors didn&#x27;t look good on me</li>
            <li>I EVEN USE THE LIGHT MAUVE COLOR AS A LID COLOR</li>
            <li>I was excited about these blushes but bummed out the didn&#x27;t qualify for prime.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to receive this</li>
            <li>lol it&#x27;s not very sturdy</li>
            <li>i love this so much</li>
            <li>I love the colors matte finish very pigmented</li>
            <li>Still not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>My teen daughter is having fun on special occasions and loved these colors on her.</li>
            <li>What I found is that this is a pretty good blush set, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They stay on pretty well throughout the day also!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>it was worth the wait</li>
            <li>HOWEVER IT WAS WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>and I am pretty pleased with the palette so far.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the picture and the blush has nice pigment and last me the whole day.</li>
            <li>If you are a fan of morphe brushes make up this is an exact dupe for their 10 blush set.</li>
            <li>GREAT filler for a makeup artist kit, the colors are much brighter than in the image above, lots of hot not much for cool skin tones.</li>
            <li>I really love blush but they can get pretty pricey when you by them individually</li>
            <li>I wish the colors would last longer and be more vibrant</li>
            <li>Very pigmented.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>They work very well</li>
            <li>The product was very well wrapped in bubble wrap and even had bubble wrap between the blush and the lid of the case to protect them.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really know I was going to feel about that</li>
            <li>At first, when I looked at them I thought the colors were too bright and pigmented, but after careful consideration and using them a few times I think the colors are pretty.  </li>
            <li>What I received was 6x4 with really vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>its really big more than what i expected ..</li>
            <li>Wow !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not to dark or too light</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Blush Wells are large in size ( Bigger than the largest MAC</li>
            <li>I am extremely sensitive and this product works well for me.</li>
            <li>Two of the blushes were completely shattered.</li>
            <li>was not messy or chalk all over the palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pot)&lt;br /&gt;The colors showed exactly like I expected.</li>
            <li>Nothing was broken, like previous reviews have warned, and everything was packaged very nicely in copious amounts of bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>The product came before expected, which is a positive thing.  </li>
            <li>but it sucks I kind of wasted my money.</li>

            <li> Smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> I am African American and it&#x27;s hard to find blushes that show up on our skin without looking chalky.</li>
            <li> Almost half the price.</li>
            <li> They came in an unmarked black box.  </li>
            <li> Does have a little bit of shine after applying, almost like there is a little bit of glitter powder it the colors.</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit to achieve the desired color on the cheeks.</li>
            <li> I have used a few of them at this point.</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m seriously in awe about the price.</li>
            <li> BUT they were broken when they came in so</li>
            <li> the package was all colored because one color was broken</li>
            <li> Lots of people were complaining that their blushes came broken</li>
            <li> Came broken though it was packed well.</li>
            <li> case is thin..</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s sad to pay for something damaged...</li>
            <li> I was afraid it was going to be broken when I opened the package, but it wasn&#x27;t!!</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t look bad on your face.</li>
            <li> so I was very mad.</li>
            <li> this was very terrible and</li>

            <li> Great blush pallate defenetly worth it. Great color oviously not like a highend brand but gets the job done.</li>

            <li> I am a caramel complecte dafrican american woman and although I liked the quality of the product, the colors didn&#x27;t look good on me so I gave it away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price</li>

            <li> I gave this a 5 because it desrves a 10!! The price, quality, packaging, early arrival, color playoff is GREAT!! No complaints here. I will be ordering another. i am a makeup fanatic. I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better pallet. Coraal Scents has the same one but for double what I paid including the shipping and handling. CAN&amp;#34;T BE BEAT!</li>
            <li> Love all the colors. My teen daughter is having fun on special occasions and loved these colors on her.</li>
            <li> The color pigmentation is very great. It&#x27;s not to dark or too light and it&#x27;s very easy to apply. Great product.</li>
            <li> It came in earlier than I thought.  I love the palette.  They work very well BUT they were broken when they came in so the package was all colored because one color was broken so I was very mad.</li>
            <li> I Love it.  Really works great I am actually going to buy my daughter and sister a Palette.  Thank You!</li>
            <li> This is nice. I like it. No complaints. Great for beginners.</li>
            <li> The palette looks like the one presented in the photo. But... I got it all destroyed. I suggest a better packing for items like this one. Because it&#x27;s sad to pay for something damaged...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit me but its ok</li>
            <li> Lots of people were complaining that their blushes came broken but when I got mine, they were perfect! The product was very well wrapped in bubble wrap and even had bubble wrap between the blush and the lid of the case to protect them. I love all of the colors! I really love blush but they can get pretty pricey when you by them individually and when I saw this palette on amazon I was really excited! Some the blushes do contain a bit of sparkle and I didn&#x27;t really know I was going to feel about that but it doesn&#x27;t look bad on your face. I guess it might depend on your skin tone but I&#x27;m pretty fair so I wouldn&#x27;t be worried about it. They stay on pretty well throughout the day also!</li>
            <li> The description said 11x4 and the colors were more subdued. What I received was 6x4 with really vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive and this product works well for me. I wish the colors would last longer and be more vibrant but I guess for the price it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> i purchased this palette after seeing reviews that it was nice for WOC as well .. most of the shades are too light!</li>
            <li> In the picture looks more like a blush bronzer palette, while it is more of just a blush set. There are some orangey colors I didn&#x27;t like but there are a couple colors that can work great as highlighters!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase, there are some matte and shimmer colors, all the colors are wearable, the shipping was within 2 weeks and I am pretty pleased with the palette so far.</li>
            <li> Came broken though it was packed well. Colors are pretty bright, kind of powdery. Still not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Beautiful pigmented colors and many to choose from</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this but I was upset when I opened it. Two of the blushes were completely shattered. They&#x27;re colors that were not damaged were beautiful colors but it sucks I kind of wasted my money.</li>
            <li> THE SHIPPING TIME TOOK A WHILE.  HOWEVER IT WAS WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it was going to be broken when I opened the package, but it wasn&#x27;t!! :) Looks exactly like the picture and the blush has nice pigment and last me the whole day. I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought quite a few products from Amazon for filler products for my kit. I was thinking I could use a cheaper product for when I do family stuff like birthdays, going out etc. What I found is that this is a pretty good blush set, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Blush Wells are large in size ( Bigger than the largest MAC Pot)&lt;br /&gt;The colors showed exactly like I expected. I am African American and it&#x27;s hard to find blushes that show up on our skin without looking chalky. These did not look chalky.&lt;br /&gt;Case is thin.&lt;br /&gt;Product was not messy or chalk all over the palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The case is thin..lol it&#x27;s not very sturdy but it definitely does the job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for a Pro artist if you want to add something to your kit</li>
            <li> I just got this today and all one of mine blush was wasted everywhere this was very terrible and I would never order from you guys again</li>
