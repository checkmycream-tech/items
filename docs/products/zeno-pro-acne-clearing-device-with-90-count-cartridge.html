    <ol>
            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to friends (and their kids).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with this product!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it works!</li>
            <li>All in all, I am happy with my purchase and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for people with mild-moderate acne.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of getting rid of pimples.</li>
            <li>And it actually kind of helped!</li>
            <li>, it makes a remarkable difference.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with the Hot Spot and in fact had to adjust to some differences when using the Pro.  </li>
            <li>The Zeno Pro is a great tool for combating mild acne, i.e. the occassional pimple.  </li>
            <li>and I used it for a while and found that when you are able to feel the sore spots on your face that it works amazingly.  </li>
            <li>The best thing about this product is it is all natural and there are no chemicals and stuff of that nature that you are putting into your body.  </li>
            <li>Although many reviews said that this product was effective, it did not work at all for me.</li>
            <li>I decided to go to a dermatologist, who prescribed medication for me that has been much more effective that any treatment that I have tried.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best solution for clearing up acne I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>Not wanting to go through another course of Accutane this appeared to be a viable alternative for me ... and thus far it has proved to be the best alternative</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot of experience with a number of products and consider this to be by far the best solution.</li>
            <li>It is a great product for certain skin types!</li>
            <li>can cause the most pain not the device.</li>
            <li>can cause the most pain not the device.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this, charged it for 24 hours and used it on three pimples I could feel emerging from my pores to make my life that much more embarrassing.</li>
            <li>For $120, plus a $30 replacement cartridge, it should work for more than one time.</li>
            <li>(since I was able to use my FSA card to purchase it).</li>
            <li>get better results with peter thomas roth acne spot treatment.</li>
            <li>Turns out, I&#x27;m quite sure that the people who say this DOESN&#x27;T work must be using it on the incorrect forms of acne it was intended for.</li>
            <li>w/ my ZENO!!! :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and cute to carry in my purse.</li>
            <li>I also clean the device with an alcohol pad after each use just to be safe.</li>
            <li>I also clean the device with an alcohol pad after each use just to be safe.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled about spending this much money on a product I knew nothing about, but I&#x27;m glad I took the chance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cool concept and love the design and portability</li>
            <li>The Pro does seem to get hotter than the Hot Spot, which makes sense since it takes longer to get up to speed and is a more sophisticated version.    </li>
            <li>The best I can say is that after using the Zeno, the pimple is somewhat less swollen, making it easier to conceal with makeup.</li>
            <li>I knew this was one that was going to be huge.</li>
            <li>I really like that!!!  </li>
            <li>It works best on newly formed pimples that are red and sore.    </li>
            <li>It does clear up the pimples quickly!!!</li>
            <li>With the Pro, you need to wait a full minute after pressing power in order to get the three beeps and use it.  </li>
            <li>There are so many things on the market today that claim to help you, but really don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>i did return the product and receive the full refund.</li>
            <li>I recently had a huge one on my cheek, the kind you can feel</li>
            <li>Since others had issues with the longevity of this item, I returned it quickly.</li>
            <li>From the very first time I used Zeno, I have been amazed.</li>
            <li>The product itself mechanically worked great, but I could not see any drastic change of my pimples going down when i used the zeno...</li>
            <li>I am so impressed because usually these bumps get large and become a head</li>
            <li>This worked even the first time I tried it!  </li>
            <li>Just dip a clean washcloth in hot water and press on your pimples.</li>
            <li>I could not be happier with this product and it is totally worth the price.     </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice just the same).    </li>
            <li>Idk i was just kind of pissed that i couldn&#x27;t even get it fixed or replaced when it was most likely their product malfunction...</li>
            <li>+ price tag, not to mention the cost of replacement cartridges, but it certainly does work for me!</li>
            <li>I get cystic acne, and have had a very high success rate with it.  </li>
            <li>Also, my skin is fair, and as the directions state can happen, I experienced angry red spots where the device was applied.  </li>
            <li>I ended up returning it and will stick with warm, wet soaks for emerging break-outs.  </li>
            <li>I charged it for the first six hours</li>
            <li>I purchased the Pro after trying the Zeno Hot Spot - which is a disposable version of the product for about $35-40.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptial at first</li>
            <li>There are two things I appreciate about this product: first, I love not having to wait on a zit to come to a head, be tempted to pop it, which often resulted in it recurring and later leaving a scar; and second, I love that it shortens the life of the zit</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to put up with the soreness and unsightly red bump for more than a day or two.</li>
            <li>It surely didn&#x27;t work on my big zits.  </li>
            <li>It seems to have no impact whatsoever on my acne, even when used at the first tingle of an outbreak.</li>
            <li>Most people never noticed but it is because I never left the house if it was very severe.</li>
            <li>read all the reviews on the product before I purchased it and found them to be overwhelmingly positive.  </li>
            <li>As far as treatments they are not bad at all.</li>
            <li>As far as treatments they are not bad at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact same concept, and is literally free.     </li>
            <li>What I did find nice is that, even when it doesn&#x27;t stop the pimple, it makes them less sore, and reduces the puffiness of them.</li>
            <li>Also, be aware that this particular packaging comes with a carry case so don&#x27;t order a separate one</li>
            <li>but I drink a ton of water and never touch fast food.</li>
            <li>I just should have read about it more carefully.</li>
            <li>I really do think it works.     </li>
            <li>What this thing did tonight proved it works on even the most deep seeded acne that will take weeks to clear.</li>
            <li>What this thing did tonight proved it works on even the most deep seeded acne that will take weeks to clear.</li>
            <li>Also, after using the product for two months, I&#x27;m not having nearly as many pimples as I was before (don&#x27;t know for sure if this is due to the Zeno or some other reason,</li>
            <li>The redness fades and is much more comfortable than a dry patch of skin most acids leave behind.</li>
            <li>As it takes 2.5 minutes per pimple, I&#x27;m not sure it is as useful for those who have more severe acne.  </li>
            <li>This tool works best when used on a pimple in its early stages, to prevent it from becoming a larger, more nasty eyesore.    </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend that you buy this product and try it for yourself.</li>
            <li>Given that it was recommended by an MD, I had *extremely* high hopes.</li>
            <li>I am a 34 year old female who has had mild acne my whole life.</li>
            <li>Just as the instructions say, it doesn&#x27;t really work on cystic acne; I tried it on several (the kind that don&#x27;t come to a head and take weeks to eventually go away) and it had little effect.</li>
            <li>As I bet most people are, I was very skeptical of this product before I bought it, but I have to tell you, it is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>The Zeno has done absolutely nothing to clear my skin.</li>
            <li>I have spent so many dollars on acne products and believed one recent \\&quot;acne kit\\</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through numerous treatments of Accutane and every topical product available.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m not sure if this product is effective enough to be worth the $100</li>
            <li>I was completely amazed that after a couple (2 or 3) treatments, it was gone!    </li>
            <li>It keeps new pimples from growing, and while it says it doesn&#x27;t work on existing acne, I used it on a cluster of 3 pimples I&#x27;d had for a month, and within 2 days, they were completely gone.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything, and will try anything to clear it up.</li>
            <li>Depending on the severity, it takes 3-5 treatments before mine would clear up.</li>
            <li>would return if i could but am too busy so by the time i got around to it , the time period to return was over.</li>
            <li>I would not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Really the only thing which helps the situation at all</li>
            <li>He is a believer in the product &amp; thought it would help with my frequent bouts of cystic acne along the jawline.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid twenties and this product did nothing to treat new pimples....</li>
            <li>does make acne smaller, but did not make them clear up for me.</li>
            <li>Apparently it works for some people, but for me it did not.</li>
            <li>I am a busy mom of 3 and still get the occasional pimple.  </li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t discourage trying it out since other reviews indicate it can work effectively, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t perform as hoped for my specific skin issues.  </li>
            <li>Then tonight I got a really big one next to the old one on my cheek.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s only because I&#x27;m bitter and already spend SO MUCH MONEY trying to keep my face from looking like a war zone, but</li>
            <li>You can use the Hot Spot immediately after pushing the button and hearing the three little beeps.  </li>
            <li>Repeated use keeps them less active and more or less flush with the skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was disappointed that this device didn&#x27;t work for me.  I gave it several tries over several days in accordance with the instructions, but rather than speed healing it actually prolonged my break-outs by making them hard, solid little knots.  Also, my skin is fair, and as the directions state can happen, I experienced angry red spots where the device was applied.  I ended up returning it and will stick with warm, wet soaks for emerging break-outs.  I certainly don&#x27;t discourage trying it out since other reviews indicate it can work effectively, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t perform as hoped for my specific skin issues.  Also, be aware that this particular packaging comes with a carry case so don&#x27;t order a separate one if given the option in the \\&quot;combo\\&quot; offer.  The return was hassle-free, just disappointed this wasn&#x27;t effective!</li>
            <li> As I bet most people are, I was very skeptical of this product before I bought it, but I have to tell you, it is absolutely amazing. I have struggled with acne since I was a teen, and while it has cleared up a lot, I still get menstrual acne, and always have at least one pimple. From the very first time I used Zeno, I have been amazed. It keeps new pimples from growing, and while it says it doesn&#x27;t work on existing acne, I used it on a cluster of 3 pimples I&#x27;d had for a month, and within 2 days, they were completely gone. I could not be happier with this product and it is totally worth the price.     Buy it!!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this item. I am a 34 year old female who has had mild acne my whole life. Most people never noticed but it is because I never left the house if it was very severe. I have tried everything. I have spent so many dollars on acne products and believed one recent \\&quot;acne kit\\&quot; worked but the acne was still there. I must have tried every brand out there. Every cream, gel, lotion, ointment, mask, toner, astringent, etc. I thought it was the way I ate but I drink a ton of water and never touch fast food. I then though maybe it was because I was over washing. You name it I have thought of it. I bought this after I have had a few zits that would not clear up. Nobody likes to talk or even read about zits/acne but it is a problem for some of us. It literally kept me from going out. I recently had a huge one on my cheek, the kind you can feel and it is still healing. I received the ZENO 90 last week. I charged it for the first six hours and it states to use it on acne that is not at the surface already but acne that you can feel coming on. I had a few small ones and tried it on those and they went away. Still skeptical because they were not big and never hit the surface so how was I to know it was the ZENO or not. Then tonight I got a really big one next to the old one on my cheek. I got depressed. I know it is pathetic. I knew this was one that was going to be huge. It was one like the others I have had. You cannot help but pick at it and it takes weeks to go away. Scabs up and bleeds, no make up will cover it. Since it was so deep I truly did not think the ZENO would get it. I could literally feel pain on my cheek that is how bad this new acne was. I used the ZENO twice on it tonight and I cannot even feel the acne pain anymore and within hours it is clearing up! I did not believe it would work until I tried it tonight. I almost want to cry. This little device is giving me part of my life back. I was so embarrassed at some of my recent acne I could not bare to face people. What this thing did tonight proved it works on even the most deep seeded acne that will take weeks to clear. As far as treatments they are not bad at all. They have some heat but nothing too uncomfortable. I truly think it is the acne that you apply it to that can cause the most pain not the device. I also clean the device with an alcohol pad after each use just to be safe. I cannot say enough about this product. I was very skeptical but after tonight, I am a believer and will never use anything else besides this. Of course I will still wash my face with a cleanser but if I feel anything coming on, I am using my ZENO. It rocks!bare to face people.

            <li> I felt a little stinging at each use and at first it seemed like my bumps would go down, but by the next morning, my zits become bigger.</li>
            <li> The Zeno Pro is a great tool for combating mild acne, i.e. the occassional pimple.  As it takes 2.5 minutes per pimple, I&#x27;m not sure it is as useful for those who have more severe acne.  Also, it does not work as well of pimples that are already severely inflammed.  This tool works best when used on a pimple in its early stages, to prevent it from becoming a larger, more nasty eyesore.    I purchased the Pro after trying the Zeno Hot Spot - which is a disposable version of the product for about $35-40.  I was very happy with the Hot Spot and in fact had to adjust to some differences when using the Pro.  You can use the Hot Spot immediately after pushing the button and hearing the three little beeps.  With the Pro, you need to wait a full minute after pressing power in order to get the three beeps and use it.  Both tools allow three continuous uses before needing about a minute or two to \\&quot;rest\\&quot; and then allowing another three use cycle.  The Pro does seem to get hotter than the Hot Spot, which makes sense since it takes longer to get up to speed and is a more sophisticated version.    All in all, I am happy with my purchase and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This worked even the first time I tried it!  I had a small tender red bump coming up on my chin.  I used ZENO two times and the tenderness and soreness were GONE.  The bump was smaller.  Then I used ZENO a third time on the same bump and it became so small I hardly felt it!  It never got bigger or came to a head.  I am so impressed because usually these bumps get large and become a head and nothing works to keep it from getting larger.  ZENO is working to keep my occasional acne from getting to the pus stage.  I love it.  I was skeptial at first but now I wouldn&#x27;t think of using anything else.  When I feel the red bump and a soreness I grab the ZENO.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time acne sufferer. I get small, insignificant pimples, and deep, painful, cystic zits. I have tried everything, and will try anything to clear it up. I&#x27;m currently seeing a specialist to help me deal with all this crap, and I&#x27;m not completely unfamiliar with treatment plans and acne issues. I bought this, charged it for 24 hours and used it on three pimples I could feel emerging from my pores to make my life that much more embarrassing. And it actually kind of helped! I even noticed the bigger cystic one going down faster. So I plug it back into the charger, and charge it all night and all day. I go to use it that night, and it&#x27;s still flashing blue (meaning low battery). I try turning it on, and nothing happens. I change outlets and charge it all night again. The next night it&#x27;s still flashing blue and won&#x27;t turn on. I leave it in still another outlet ALL WEEKEND while I&#x27;m out of town and come home hoping it works. Still nothing. Still flashes blue and won&#x27;t turn on. For $120, plus a $30 replacement cartridge, it should work for more than one time. I&#x27;ll admit, I didn&#x27;t buy it from amazon, but drugstore.com instead (since I was able to use my FSA card to purchase it). I&#x27;m so disappointed and am returning it immediately. Just dip a clean washcloth in hot water and press on your pimples. It&#x27;s the exact same concept, and is literally free.     I know it&#x27;s only because I&#x27;m bitter and already spend SO MUCH MONEY trying to keep my face from looking like a war zone, but honestly...screw you Zeno.</li>
            <li> does make acne smaller, but did not make them clear up for me. for holding the thing in place for 2 minutes per zit, takes too much effort and too expensive for just making them smaller.  get better results with peter thomas roth acne spot treatment. put it on and overnight its gone. no fuss. would return if i could but am too busy so by the time i got around to it , the time period to return was over.</li>
            <li> Lets just start this off by saying that i have severe acne. This is a great product for people with mild-moderate acne. The device does not work on black heads, white heads, cysts, nodules, or zits. It only works on pimples have not yet surfaced. It does a great job of getting rid of pimples. If you are a person who gets a 2-3 pimples at a time this is the product for you. If you have bad acne. I would not waste your money. The one or two pimples that it clears up in a day is not going to make all that big of a difference. It does clear up the pimples quickly!!! It is a great product for certain skin types!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000LQ9950 Zeno Pro Acne Clearing Device with 90 Count Cartridge, Pink]]    This item is not reviewed or recommended as helping with cycstic acne, but it makes an immense difference. I have hormonal acne from IVF drugs. This device substainially brings down the swelling of these cysts within hours. Repeated use keeps them less active and more or less flush with the skin. A godsend! Really the only thing which helps the situation at all, it makes a remarkable difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for use on my moderate-to-severe acne (I use Renova (Rx), but I still have occasional pimples). Just as the instructions say, it doesn&#x27;t really work on cystic acne; I tried it on several (the kind that don&#x27;t come to a head and take weeks to eventually go away) and it had little effect. It works best on newly formed pimples that are red and sore.    Depending on the severity, it takes 3-5 treatments before mine would clear up. Usually I don&#x27;t notice much difference until after the 3rd, 4th, or sometimes 5th treatment, when the zit actually dries up and disappears! There are two things I appreciate about this product: first, I love not having to wait on a zit to come to a head, be tempted to pop it, which often resulted in it recurring and later leaving a scar; and second, I love that it shortens the life of the zit so I don&#x27;t have to put up with the soreness and unsightly red bump for more than a day or two. Also, after using the product for two months, I&#x27;m not having nearly as many pimples as I was before (don&#x27;t know for sure if this is due to the Zeno or some other reason, but it&#x27;s nice just the same).    Overall I&#x27;m not sure if this product is effective enough to be worth the $100+ price tag, not to mention the cost of replacement cartridges, but it certainly does work for me!</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptic when it came to purchasing this product because like many things I&#x27;ve tried in the past, I was sick of wasting a lot of money on a product that turned out to be a disappointment. I searched all over the internet for reviews and information and finally made the decision to fork over the cash and give it a whirl. Turns out, I&#x27;m quite sure that the people who say this DOESN&#x27;T work must be using it on the incorrect forms of acne it was intended for. It works like a CHARM on the indicated types it was designed for. I&#x27;m still amazed every time I use it!! Obviously with any acne product, you&#x27;re still going to have a side effect though: a red, irritated circle from where the device is held. The redness fades and is much more comfortable than a dry patch of skin most acids leave behind. I get relief IMMEDIATELY w/ my ZENO!!! :-)</li>
            <li> Apparently it works for some people, but for me it did not. I have monthly breakouts of the painful \\&quot; under the skin\\&quot; blemishes...this products not made to treat this type of acne I&#x27;m not mistaken, it might even state that. It&#x27;s a cool concept and love the design and portability so I gave it 3 stars. I just should have read about it more carefully.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product starting out and I used it for a while and found that when you are able to feel the sore spots on your face that it works amazingly.  They are never able to even come out.  The best thing about this product is it is all natural and there are no chemicals and stuff of that nature that you are putting into your body.  I really like that!!!  There are so many things on the market today that claim to help you, but really don&#x27;t and some things (I think) make things worse, but this is natural and you don&#x27;t have to worry about those types of situtations.  I would highly recommend that you buy this product and try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> So, I bought this after reading reviews about it for a couple years. My aesthetician has one that she uses during facials, and it seemed to help a little, so I finally broke down and spent the money. Here is what I have found. It SOMETIMES stops the pimple from forming. The rest of the time, it does not. I&#x27;m not sure why or how this happens, but I know the manufacturer says you have to catch the pimple in its early stages. Perhaps that is the problem.       What I did find nice is that, even when it doesn&#x27;t stop the pimple, it makes them less sore, and reduces the puffiness of them. Less puffiness &#x3D; less redness &#x3D; less noticable pimples. Excellent. I&#x27;m going to keep using this product, and once I figure out the why&#x27;s and wherefore&#x27;s, I&#x27;ll update.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid twenties and this product did nothing to treat new pimples....its also way over priced.  I returned it after a week.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled about spending this much money on a product I knew nothing about, but I&#x27;m glad I took the chance. Surprisingly, it works! And it doesn&#x27;t leave a scar! It heats up the \\&quot;spot\\&quot; and in some cases, it&#x27;s gone within 24hrs. I wish this was around when I was a teenager! It&#x27;s easy to use and cute to carry in my purse. Try it for yourself!</li>
            <li> Although many reviews said that this product was effective, it did not work at all for me. In some places it actually made my acne worse. i did return the product and receive the full refund. I decided to go to a dermatologist, who prescribed medication for me that has been much more effective that any treatment that I have tried. My advice is, before you purchase &#x27;miracle&#x27; products consider going to a dermatologist. They are usually covered by insurance but if you do not have insurance the visit charge is about $50, and the Rx is about $25 with rebates that can make them 0.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, i had issues with this item. I charged it as instructed and could not get it to turn on. Nothing. Since others had issues with the longevity of this item, I returned it quickly. Def do not recommend</li>
            <li> Well I bought this product 2 years ago and it came with one 90 tip head. The product itself mechanically worked great, but I could not see any drastic change of my pimples going down when i used the zeno... I may have been usuing them on the wrong type of pimples... who knows, I dont really have terrible acne I just wanted to give it a try. If anything this device gave me a little bit of hope and kept me from picking my face when I got pimples. I really do think it works.     Now heres my problem... I only used the product 90 times (the 90 tip head it came with) I never even bought a replacement tip. I stored the product in my bathroom and didn&#x27;t use it for a year or a year and a half... and now recently i go to plug it in and charge it and the zeno is completely broken. The charger has no effect on the zeno at all, it doesn&#x27;t work anymore. I looked back in the manual and it says do not store it in humid temperatures and since it was in the bathroom I guess that could be why something went wrong, but what really bothered me was that I called zeno up and said I paid 200 dollars for this thing... and it doesn&#x27;t work after one tip! They basically said the product battery is irreplacable and usually only lasts for about 3 years anyway. She said she cannot do anything because they only replace zenos after 1 year of purchase and mine was purchased 2 years ago...... but i haven&#x27;t used it.... Idk i was just kind of pissed that i couldn&#x27;t even get it fixed or replaced when it was most likely their product malfunction... I&#x27;m considering writing them on this</li>
            <li> I am a busy mom of 3 and still get the occasional pimple.  I tried Zeno as soon as I felt that \\&quot;undergrounder\\&quot;.  I was completely amazed that after a couple (2 or 3) treatments, it was gone!    I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to friends (and their kids).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this product!</li>
            <li> I think this company is out of business.  It surely didn&#x27;t work on my big zits.  If you have cystic zit, nothing works.  clearsil, creams, toothpaste, nothing.  see a dermatologist and ask to inject steroid into the zit.  It will be gone in 2 days.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Zeno Pro at the advice of my dermatologist. He is a believer in the product &amp; thought it would help with my frequent bouts of cystic acne along the jawline. Given that it was recommended by an MD, I had *extremely* high hopes. Unfortunately, the results have been very disappointing. The Zeno has done absolutely nothing to clear my skin. It seems to have no impact whatsoever on my acne, even when used at the first tingle of an outbreak. The best I can say is that after using the Zeno, the pimple is somewhat less swollen, making it easier to conceal with makeup. All in all, though, I would say that this is a pretty expensive product that has given me very little return for my money. I would definitely not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and was well packaged, but it will not charge.  Charged for 2 24 hour periods on two different outlets.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing.  Am returning it and will purchase from a store where it can be returned the next day if it is dead out of box</li>
            <li> I only just recently discovered the Zeno.  I wish I&#x27;d heard about it sooner.  I&#x27;ve been through numerous treatments of Accutane and every topical product available.  This is by far the best solution for clearing up acne I&#x27;ve found.  Within hours of my applying the third (sometimes second) treatment to the affected area it is cleared up.  I get cystic acne, and have had a very high success rate with it.  Not wanting to go through another course of Accutane this appeared to be a viable alternative for me ... and thus far it has proved to be the best alternative I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all the reviews on the product before I purchased it and found them to be overwhelmingly positive.  While this product is quite an investment when I compare it to what I&#x27;ve spent in treating acne over the  years the cost is trivial.  I&#x27;ve been battling acne since my teen years and am now in my 40&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve had a lot of experience with a number of products and consider this to be by far the best solution.</li>
            <li> Never saw any improvement.</li>
