            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product for the happy bold colors , but would hesitate based on their functionality.</li>
            <li>I put them in a clear vase and it brings a beautiful accent to my kitchen!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve not been able to find any until I saw these.</li>
            <li>but I also love the fact they are silicone.</li>
            <li>but as it turns out it helps me have a better &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; on the situation.</li>
            <li>The nice smooth edges make for easy stirring of sauces.  </li>
            <li>Customer service for California Home Goods sent me a friendly email from the &amp;#34;Customer Happiness Manager&amp;#34; which made me smile and gave me the impression that this is a vendor I would most definately use again.</li>
            <li>I also really love the bright, cheerful colors in my kitchen; it makes it easy to grab the right tool since I know what color I need, plus I just like the looks of it.</li>
            <li>Not only are the colors bright and cheerful, but the handles also fit well in your hand with a great heft.</li>
            <li>Already making cooking more fun! :)</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve also used them on a hot cast iron skillet, and they&#x27;ve held up nicely under the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted a good quality set so that I don&#x27;t damage the new cookware.  </li>
            <li>Of course at first glance you see how cute they are, but they&#x27;re proving to be more than just eye candy.</li>

            <li>Clean up is easy also.</li>
            <li>Great company and products, will buy again, Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Love them  Not soft and floppy like others  good and still easy to use.</li>
            <li>Nothing is worse than having good quality of cookware and then damaging it with tools that are not of good quality which is very easy to do when you are cooking.  </li>
            <li>We like them, except for the ladle:  it doesn&#x27;t seem to us that a ladle that bends is very useful.</li>
            <li>in all I&#x27;m thoroughly enjoying these little utensils happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Bonus - in a week I’ve noticed that the colors make it easy for me to reach for the right utensil over and over again.</li>
            <li>I bought this very colorful set as a present for my mother who was delighted with them and used them straight away!</li>
            <li>I love the vibrant colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this particular set is that each item is made of silicone and</li>
            <li>The red slotted turner is the same way and since it&#x27;s silicone covered, it&#x27;s perfect to use in non-stick pans.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a really cute utensil set at a reasonable price, and I am enjoying using it so far!</li>
            <li>After looking at a few listings online, I was sold on the beautiful colors used in this set.</li>
            <li>Not only do all the vibrant colors look great in our utensil caddy</li>
            <li>These are fantastic; so pretty and colorful</li>
            <li>This set is made with very high quality materials and is bpa free.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and that fact that it&#x27;s silicone with a pretty high temp rating.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy, enjoy using them.</li>
            <li>Heavy duty and works great.</li>
            <li>Their size is nice, not too big...</li>
            <li>Utensils nice -- colorful, balanced and solid.  </li>
            <li>Nice heavy plastic and love the colors</li>
            <li>, however, she felt like they were the quality that she was looking for as well as being fun to look at.</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>The food doesn&#x27;t stick * slides right off.  </li>
            <li>I threw them in the dishwasher and started using them right away.</li>
            <li>Even the tiny spatula has been good so far!</li>
            <li>I suspect it&#x27;s because of the silicone build, but it&#x27;s fine for most things, just requires an extra scoop than normal to fill a bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like these colorful utensils.  </li>
            <li>Thanks elite deals!</li>
            <li>Love all of them, including the different colors.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Many silicone utensils are often flimsy through the entire length.</li>
            <li>I used the blue ladle for spaghetti sauce and was pleased that it did not stain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll know exactly what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li>Items Were Exactly As PictureD</li>
            <li>Recommend them highly to anyone!!</li>
            <li>These are wonderful for my expensive no stick cookware</li>
            <li>Good quality silicone utensils...durable without being too heavy.  </li>
            <li>The red spatula is nice and flexible so it&#x27;s great for getting the last little bit of batter out of a bowl or jar.</li>
            <li>Oh and they fit so much nicer in my countertop holder than my old ones, which btw have already found they&#x27;re way into the trash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that they’re multi-colored as it makes the process of identifying the proper utensil to use much easier.</li>
            <li>I love the size and feel of them all except for the ladle with has a small capacity than most main ladles do.</li>
            <li>Love the fact of easy cleaning, but the spoons and the ladle are too small.</li>
            <li>Just make sure tools are dry before putting them away.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, as replacements for my more traditional black, hard plastic, tools, I think these are great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more challenging with the slightly smaller heads, but I still end up using these utensils all the time</li>
            <li>Much to my dismay, I realized two weeks ago that the plastic utensils I’ve been using for an eternity have put some damage into my collection.</li>
            <li>And, I really like the colors and know they will be among my favorites.  </li>
            <li>We have a newborn baby, so I was really attracted to using silicone utensils given that they don’t absorb odor, liquid and therefore, bacteria.</li>
            <li>My issue for not noticing and really thinking about the size.  </li>
            <li>soft , comportable and colorful utensil.  </li>
            <li>Much better then I expected.</li>
            <li>The colors add so much cheerfulness in my kitchen.</li>
            <li>These Are Very Well Made And ComeIn</li>
            <li>Nice and stiff for scraping a pan or pot.  </li>
            <li>I’ve spent the better part of the year collecting a bunch of great, albeit expensive pots and pans.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a very high quality set of silicone utensils that not only look great but perform extremely well!</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a problem for the spoons, but I really liked that my old spatula had a big, long rectangle head</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>These obviously have a heavy center material which obviously makes them better for cooking with a good hand feel.</li>
            <li>These are not only pretty, but they have a lifetime warranty.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no signs of discoloration (the yellow one has even been used in red sauce and tea), warping or melting (and they&#x27;ve been used in some very hot cast iron pans)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish the orange were a little more &amp;#34;orange-y&amp;#34; because it would be much easier to tell it apart from the red, but they&#x27;re not close enough that you can&#x27;t tell which is which.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the weight and strength of the handles.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised by how the colors look in my kitchen.</li>
            <li>I had them delivered directly to her home</li>
            <li>They arrived a few days ago and I have already used many of them multiple times.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stain and they are thick enough not to have the plastic fall off easily and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Look, feel and behave exactly as described and as I expected.  </li>
            <li>Size of the &amp;#34;business ends&amp;#34; is a little small on all of them -- would be better if the spatula were wider and the spoons/ladle held a little more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these daily for over a month and they still look like new.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The utensils are on the smaller size, and the ladle in particular is not as large as those in other sets.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so hard to find smaller utensils amid the common HUGE ones mostly sold now.  </li>
            <li>These utensils are a smaller scale than I expected (think IKEA sized) but I really like them!</li>

            <li> I love these utensils.  </li>
            <li> They are a cheerful additional to my kitchen!</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and how they jazz up the container I put them in.</li>
            <li> but these are more aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Love the colors.</li>

            <li> Really love this set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been able to find any until I saw these.</li>
            <li> but I also love the fact they are silicone.</li>
            <li> but as it turns out it helps me have a better &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; on the situation.</li>
            <li> The nice smooth edges make for easy stirring of sauces.  </li>
            <li> Customer service for California Home Goods sent me a friendly email from the &amp;#34;Customer Happiness Manager&amp;#34; which made me smile and gave me the impression that this is a vendor I would most definately use again.</li>
            <li> I also really love the bright, cheerful colors in my kitchen; it makes it easy to grab the right tool since I know what color I need, plus I just like the looks of it.</li>
            <li> Not only are the colors bright and cheerful, but the handles also fit well in your hand with a great heft.</li>
            <li> Already making cooking more fun! :)</li>
            <li> They’re easy to wash, odor free, and my kids love using them with me when they’re helping out in the kitchen.</li>
            <li> These are cool!  </li>
            <li> They are sturdy and easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> They’re easy to watch and don’t stain or absorb any color.</li>
            <li> They are not only cute, but functional and take a beating in the kitchen and stand up great.  </li>
            <li> They wash easily and don&#x27;t stain.</li>
            <li> They are sturdy and strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used them on a hot cast iron skillet, and they&#x27;ve held up nicely under the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted a good quality set so that I don&#x27;t damage the new cookware.  </li>
            <li> Of course at first glance you see how cute they are, but they&#x27;re proving to be more than just eye candy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all one continuous piece, so it&#x27;s incredibly easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to clean, and don&#x27;t stain, even after I&#x27;ve used tomatoes or turmeric.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Overall it’s a great purchase</li>
            <li> Clean up is easy also.</li>
            <li> Great company and products, will buy again, Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Love them  Not soft and floppy like others  good and still easy to use.</li>
            <li> Nothing is worse than having good quality of cookware and then damaging it with tools that are not of good quality which is very easy to do when you are cooking.  </li>
            <li> We like them, except for the ladle:  it doesn&#x27;t seem to us that a ladle that bends is very useful.</li>
            <li> in all I&#x27;m thoroughly enjoying these little utensils happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Bonus - in a week I’ve noticed that the colors make it easy for me to reach for the right utensil over and over again.</li>
            <li> I bought this very colorful set as a present for my mother who was delighted with them and used them straight away!</li>
            <li> I love the vibrant colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this particular set is that each item is made of silicone and</li>
            <li> The red slotted turner is the same way and since it&#x27;s silicone covered, it&#x27;s perfect to use in non-stick pans.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a really cute utensil set at a reasonable price, and I am enjoying using it so far!</li>
            <li> After looking at a few listings online, I was sold on the beautiful colors used in this set.</li>
            <li> Not only do all the vibrant colors look great in our utensil caddy</li>
            <li> These are fantastic; so pretty and colorful</li>
            <li> This set is made with very high quality materials and is bpa free.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and that fact that it&#x27;s silicone with a pretty high temp rating.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy, enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty and works great.</li>
            <li> Their size is nice, not too big...</li>
            <li> Utensils nice -- colorful, balanced and solid.  </li>
            <li> Nice heavy plastic and love the colors</li>
            <li> , however, she felt like they were the quality that she was looking for as well as being fun to look at.</li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> The food doesn&#x27;t stick * slides right off.  </li>
            <li> I threw them in the dishwasher and started using them right away.</li>
            <li> Even the tiny spatula has been good so far!</li>
            <li> I suspect it&#x27;s because of the silicone build, but it&#x27;s fine for most things, just requires an extra scoop than normal to fill a bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like these colorful utensils.  </li>
            <li> Thanks elite deals!</li>
            <li> Love all of them, including the different colors.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Many silicone utensils are often flimsy through the entire length.</li>
            <li> I used the blue ladle for spaghetti sauce and was pleased that it did not stain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll know exactly what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> Items Were Exactly As PictureD</li>
            <li> Recommend them highly to anyone!!</li>
            <li> These are wonderful for my expensive no stick cookware</li>
            <li> Good quality silicone utensils...durable without being too heavy.  </li>
            <li> The red spatula is nice and flexible so it&#x27;s great for getting the last little bit of batter out of a bowl or jar.</li>
            <li> Oh and they fit so much nicer in my countertop holder than my old ones, which btw have already found they&#x27;re way into the trash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that they’re multi-colored as it makes the process of identifying the proper utensil to use much easier.</li>
            <li> I love the size and feel of them all except for the ladle with has a small capacity than most main ladles do.</li>
            <li> Love the fact of easy cleaning, but the spoons and the ladle are too small.</li>
            <li> Just make sure tools are dry before putting them away.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, as replacements for my more traditional black, hard plastic, tools, I think these are great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more challenging with the slightly smaller heads, but I still end up using these utensils all the time</li>
            <li> Much to my dismay, I realized two weeks ago that the plastic utensils I’ve been using for an eternity have put some damage into my collection.</li>
            <li> And, I really like the colors and know they will be among my favorites.  </li>
            <li> We have a newborn baby, so I was really attracted to using silicone utensils given that they don’t absorb odor, liquid and therefore, bacteria.</li>
            <li> My issue for not noticing and really thinking about the size.  </li>
            <li> soft , comportable and colorful utensil.  </li>
            <li> Much better then I expected.</li>
            <li> The colors add so much cheerfulness in my kitchen.</li>
            <li> These Are Very Well Made And ComeIn</li>
            <li> Nice and stiff for scraping a pan or pot.  </li>
            <li> I’ve spent the better part of the year collecting a bunch of great, albeit expensive pots and pans.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a very high quality set of silicone utensils that not only look great but perform extremely well!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a problem for the spoons, but I really liked that my old spatula had a big, long rectangle head</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> These obviously have a heavy center material which obviously makes them better for cooking with a good hand feel.</li>
            <li> These are not only pretty, but they have a lifetime warranty.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no signs of discoloration (the yellow one has even been used in red sauce and tea), warping or melting (and they&#x27;ve been used in some very hot cast iron pans)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish the orange were a little more &amp;#34;orange-y&amp;#34; because it would be much easier to tell it apart from the red, but they&#x27;re not close enough that you can&#x27;t tell which is which.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the weight and strength of the handles.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised by how the colors look in my kitchen.</li>
            <li> I had them delivered directly to her home</li>
            <li> They arrived a few days ago and I have already used many of them multiple times.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stain and they are thick enough not to have the plastic fall off easily and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Look, feel and behave exactly as described and as I expected.  </li>
            <li> Size of the &amp;#34;business ends&amp;#34; is a little small on all of them -- would be better if the spatula were wider and the spoons/ladle held a little more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these daily for over a month and they still look like new.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The utensils are on the smaller size, and the ladle in particular is not as large as those in other sets.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find smaller utensils amid the common HUGE ones mostly sold now.  </li>
            <li> These utensils are a smaller scale than I expected (think IKEA sized) but I really like them!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the size when they arrived (they are smaller/shorter than my other utensils), but it was stated in the description.  </li>
            <li> Some utensils are too long or short.</li>
            <li> I suggest you actually take a ruler and see how long they are before ordering</li>
            <li> This set was bought to replace our old black plastic cooking utensil set.</li>
            <li> The ladle will also need several scoops to fill a single serving bowl (note the ladle compared to the flipper).  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind that these are not stiff tools and will bend, so if you want something that can chop ground beef or do heavy scraping, use wood, plastic, or metal tools.</li>
            <li> Id never really heard of them before &amp; these have made my cooking life so simply.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite wide enough for pancakes.</li>
            <li> I use to have simple black spoons and such on my countertop</li>
            <li> only knocked off a star because the heads of these utensils are a little smaller than what I&#x27;m accustomed to cooking with.</li>
            <li> The green and yellow spoons are solid &amp; not flexible so you can use them for breaking up your ground beef, mixing your mashed potatoes, etc</li>
            <li> It is a single molded piece so there are crooks or crevices for food particles to get into.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a big metal shaft down the handle that is already trying to poke out at the business end.</li>
            <li> so when I&#x27;m flipping eggs or slipping cookies off a baking sheet, I had plenty of surface area to pick up the food.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> The material is firm enough to stir stews, flip an egg, and do whatever else I need when cooking, and the utensils don&#x27;t scratch or damage my non-stick pans.</li>
            <li> plus is that they are sturdy due to them having a nylon core covered in the silicon.  </li>
            <li> Wish there were other type of these with out some of the slots.</li>
            <li> I have been using them daily for the past two weeks now.</li>
            <li> No more scrubbing that awkward area where the head connects to the handle (like most other utensils are made) and grease and batter get stuck!</li>
            <li> I do not find the handles to be extra thick as others have reviewed.</li>
            <li> Having used plastic a long time, I was skeptical about how silicone would perform, but I’ve been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I made French toast and because the spatula is so thick, I couldn&#x27;t get under the bread to turn it over without using my hand or another utensil.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s made extremely well!</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re definitely not full sized.  </li>
            <li> Just wish they were a little longer.</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t know they were also heavy.  </li>
            <li> I like that they are not huge like a lot of cooking utensils.</li>
            <li> I needed small to keep the weight down in a camper.  </li>
            <li> The green spoon is probably the heaviest of them and I&#x27;m not sure why they either have to be that thick or that heavy.</li>
            <li> Yes, I already knew they were small.  </li>
            <li> Also the the multi color helps because I have a small kitchen</li>
            <li> One caveat - the handles are a bit thick</li>
            <li> Works well with all my expensive non-stick pots and pans.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This set is really durable which is great, and the non-stick coating makes cooking a lot easier. I also LOVE the bright colors of this kitchen set-- I put them in a clear vase and it brings a beautiful accent to my kitchen!</li>
            <li> My husband and I both like these kitchen tools.  Their size is nice, not too big...just right.  And, I really like the colors and know they will be among my favorites.  They arrived a few days ago and I have already used many of them multiple times.  Great product and nice value :)</li>
            <li> I really like these colorful utensils.  Just wish they were a little longer.</li>
            <li> They are sturdy and easily cleaned. Thanks elite deals!</li>
            <li> This set was bought to replace our old black plastic cooking utensil set. We have only had these for a week but are already sold on the quality and feel of silicone. You can tell at a glance in our crowded drawer which one of these to pick up. My only regret i that we didn&#x27;t buy these sooner.</li>
            <li> Good quality silicone utensils...durable without being too heavy.  The colors are nice and bright.  This 5 piece basic assortment is just what I needed!</li>
            <li> These are fantastic; so pretty and colorful and oh yes functional. I really like them; they make my kitchen bright and cheery.</li>
            <li> I bought this very colorful set as a present for my mother who was delighted with them and used them straight away!</li>

            <li> I have enjoyed using my silicone set in the Kitchen. It doesn&#x27;t stain and they are thick enough not to have the plastic fall off easily and very sturdy. I would definitely buy these again.</li>

            <li> I love these utensils.  Big plus is that they are sturdy due to them having a nylon core covered in the silicon.  Brought a spash of color to my kitchen.  They are proudly displayed on my counter instead of tucked away in my utensil drawer.  Customer service for California Home Goods sent me a friendly email from the &amp;#34;Customer Happiness Manager&amp;#34; which made me smile and gave me the impression that this is a vendor I would most definately use again.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and very functional.  The quality is great and works wonderfully with my new cookware.  I wanted a good quality set so that I don&#x27;t damage the new cookware.  Nothing is worse than having good quality of cookware and then damaging it with tools that are not of good quality which is very easy to do when you are cooking.  I also store them in a utensil crock filled with rice and it keeps them perfectly.  Just make sure tools are dry before putting them away.  Would definitely recommend.  God bless</li>
            <li> Sturdy, bright, use them all the time. They are a cheerful additional to my kitchen!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> Great company and products, will buy again, Thanks so much.</li>

My favorite thing about this particular set is that each item is made of silicone and it&#x27;s all one continuous piece, so it&#x27;s incredibly easy to clean. No more scrubbing that awkward area where the head connects to the handle (like most other utensils are made) and grease and batter get stuck!

I also really love the bright, cheerful colors in my kitchen; it makes it easy to grab the right tool since I know what color I need, plus I just like the looks of it.

            <li> Good quality. Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> great products, good quality that hold up well. great customer service by seller</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this 5-Piece Silicone Kitchen Cooking Utensils Set by California Home Goods! Not only do all the vibrant colors look great in our utensil caddy but this set contains everything we need and it&#x27;s made extremely well! The green and yellow spoons are solid &amp; not flexible so you can use them for breaking up your ground beef, mixing your mashed potatoes, etc and they won&#x27;t bend. The red slotted turner is the same way and since it&#x27;s silicone covered, it&#x27;s perfect to use in non-stick pans. The red spatula is nice and flexible so it&#x27;s great for getting the last little bit of batter out of a bowl or jar. The blue ladle spoon is flexible but sturdy enough to hold whatever your scooping. I&#x27;ve used these daily for over a month and they still look like new. There&#x27;s no signs of discoloration (the yellow one has even been used in red sauce and tea), warping or melting (and they&#x27;ve been used in some very hot cast iron pans)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a very high quality set of silicone utensils that not only look great but perform extremely well! I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Great utensil set. Heavy duty and works great. Wish there were other type of these with out some of the slots. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and that fact that it&#x27;s silicone with a pretty high temp rating.  I was surprised at the size when they arrived (they are smaller/shorter than my other utensils), but it was stated in the description.  Not a big deal.  The ladle will also need several scoops to fill a single serving bowl (note the ladle compared to the flipper).  My issue for not noticing and really thinking about the size.  I was just enthralled by the colors.  :)</li>
            <li> These are nice.  Smaller than I was hoping for.... they&#x27;re definitely not full sized.  But the shapes are very nice (with the exception of the ladle) and they clean up nicely.  Nice and stiff for scraping a pan or pot.  I&#x27;ve used these on hot pans and have experienced no melting or shape changing.</li>
            <li> Heavier than it looks.  Love the fact of easy cleaning, but the spoons and the ladle are too small.</li>
            <li> soft , comportable and colorful utensil.  i like it.</li>
            <li> Look, feel and behave exactly as described and as I expected.  It&#x27;s so hard to find smaller utensils amid the common HUGE ones mostly sold now.  These do not fall out of a pan if I let go of them.  The nice smooth edges make for easy stirring of sauces.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> These are very nice kitchen utensils. I have been using them regularly for over a month now, and they all still look pristine. They&#x27;re easy to clean, and don&#x27;t stain, even after I&#x27;ve used tomatoes or turmeric. The material is firm enough to stir stews, flip an egg, and do whatever else I need when cooking, and the utensils don&#x27;t scratch or damage my non-stick pans. I&#x27;ve also used them on a hot cast iron skillet, and they&#x27;ve held up nicely under the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The utensils are on the smaller size, and the ladle in particular is not as large as those in other sets. I wish it were a bit larger, but it&#x27;s not enough of an issue to deduct a star from my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with these utensils, and would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great set. Much better then I expected. Sturdy yet flexible. Have done well under heat. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> These are cool!  Love the colors.</li>
            <li> These cooking utensils are great! I have been using them daily for the past two weeks now. I love the bright colors! They have a great weight to them. They are sturdy and strong.They wash easily and don&#x27;t stain. The colors add so much cheerfulness in my kitchen. They are the perfect size. Some utensils are too long or short. I love love love these!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by California Home Goods&lt;br /&gt;Review provided by She-ra</li>
            <li> Utensils nice -- colorful, balanced and solid.  Size of the &amp;#34;business ends&amp;#34; is a little small on all of them -- would be better if the spatula were wider and the spoons/ladle held a little more.</li>
            <li> Nice heavy plastic and love the colors</li>
            <li> We bought this purposely to have a set of silicone utensils that were smallish.  We like them, except for the ladle:  it doesn&#x27;t seem to us that a ladle that bends is very useful.</li>
            <li> Good quality, awesome color, a bit smaller than I thought but still great!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the colors of this kitchen utensil set! It makes a great gift and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought these on a whim and I’m glad I did. Not only are the colors bright and cheerful, but the handles also fit well in your hand with a great heft. No problems tossing them into the dishwasher.</li>
            <li> Great set. Works well with all my expensive non-stick pots and pans. The colors are beautiful and stand out in my kitchen.</li>
            <li> These utensils are great! I love that they’re multi-colored as it makes the process of identifying the proper utensil to use much easier. I didn’t think it’d make a difference, but I’ve learned to move faster in my kitchen as a result.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these colors. Very happy with this set after a week of use. They’re easy to wash, odor free, and my kids love using them with me when they’re helping out in the kitchen. One caveat - the handles are a bit thick so it takes some getting used to. But I’ve adjusted and I think I prefer the heft now.</li>
            <li> Really love this set. I still kept my longer handles as these are just a tad short to cover all my cooking needs. Overall it’s a great purchase and I’m looking forward to using them over and over again in the kitchen. Bonus - in a week I’ve noticed that the colors make it easy for me to reach for the right utensil over and over again. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Love the bright bold colors. I like that I can use them on my cookware without scratching the bottom- if coated with a protective lining. That being said, the thickness &amp; weight of the silicone utensils are cumbersome. I made French toast and because the spatula is so thick, I couldn&#x27;t get under the bread to turn it over without using my hand or another utensil. The green spoon is probably the heaviest of them and I&#x27;m not sure why they either have to be that thick or that heavy. In exchange for an honest review I received this product at a reduced price. I&#x27;d recommend this product for the happy bold colors , but would hesitate based on their functionality.</li>
            <li> These are great tools both in look and feel. Keep in mind that these are not stiff tools and will bend, so if you want something that can chop ground beef or do heavy scraping, use wood, plastic, or metal tools. I love the size and feel of them all except for the ladle with has a small capacity than most main ladles do. I suspect it&#x27;s because of the silicone build, but it&#x27;s fine for most things, just requires an extra scoop than normal to fill a bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, as replacements for my more traditional black, hard plastic, tools, I think these are great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving this set of utensils. Of course at first glance you see how cute they are, but they&#x27;re proving to be more than just eye candy. I like the fact that they are a sturdy. Many silicone utensils are often flimsy through the entire length. These obviously have a heavy center material which obviously makes them better for cooking with a good hand feel. I used the blue ladle for spaghetti sauce and was pleased that it did not stain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen reviews where some don&#x27;t like then length; saying they are too short. But that&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. I&#x27;ve not been able to find any until I saw these. I cook in regular sized and smaller pots and pans for just me and my husband and the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; sized utensils are too unstable when propping inside one. I&#x27;ve flipped more than one out and all over the place, lol. I suggest you actually take a ruler and see how long they are before ordering and you&#x27;ll know exactly what you&#x27;re getting. Oh and they fit so much nicer in my countertop holder than my old ones, which btw have already found they&#x27;re way into the trash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m thoroughly enjoying these little utensils happy with my purchase. I recommend these to anyone!</li>
            <li> Yes, I already knew they were small.  I needed small to keep the weight down in a camper.  However, I didn&#x27;t know they were also heavy.  There&#x27;s a big metal shaft down the handle that is already trying to poke out at the business end.</li>
            <li> They work great and I like the colors</li>
            <li> I For This At A Discount In Exchange For An Honest Review. These Are Very Well Made And ComeIn So Handy. Items Were Exactly As PictureD</li>
            <li> I threw them in the dishwasher and started using them right away. I like that they are not huge like a lot of cooking utensils. They feel great. They wont scratch and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them.</li>
            <li> Hello, I actually purchased these utensils for my granddaughter for her 1st apartment while in college. I had them delivered directly to her home and she said she loved the way they looked and the feel of them. she has not used them yet, however, she felt like they were the quality that she was looking for as well as being fun to look at. She also said she does npt have to worry about getting her utensils mixed up with he roommate&#x27;s utensils.</li>
            <li> I love them!!!  Recommend them highly to anyone!!</li>
            <li> These are wonderful for my expensive no stick cookware</li>
            <li> I ordered them because of the beautiful colors but I also love the fact they are silicone. The handles are a bit shorter than what I am used to but as it turns out it helps me have a better &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; on the situation. My sister does not know it yet but I bought her some for a gift.</li>
            <li> I have been needing to replace some of my cooking utensils for awhile, and after trying and like CHG&#x27;s 3 compartment trays, I decided I would give these and shot. At the time of my purchase the price point was $19.95 so I figured not a big gamble seeing how some stuff is around $30 to $40 for a set. Also the the multi color helps because I have a small kitchen so I don&#x27;t always have the ability to open my drawer all the way. Being able to look a the handle color and know which utensil I am pulling is nice. Clean up is easy also. It is a single molded piece so there are crooks or crevices for food particles to get into. I would definitely recommend this product and this seller.</li>
