            <li>This does a nice job and does not irritate my eye area.</li>
            <li>I used it twice a day and honestly, you can do just as well with an over the counter product at the grocery store and save money.</li>
            <li>But I have yet to see how effective it is in reducing wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The cream goes on nicely and blends in</li>
            <li>this is the best eye cream I have found so far!</li>
            <li>I have very fine lines developing around my eyes</li>
            <li>I should have known it was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>I have used her products for many years and always like them.</li>
            <li>I know better than to expect miracles.</li>
            <li>But will write better review when I have used it for a longer period</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it as it feels refreshing on my skin</li>
            <li>My wrinkles looked more defined after using this.</li>

            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay cream.</li>
            <li>:) so far so good.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this cream, its great to add moisture, but doesn&#x27;t seem to do too much more than that..maybe with long term use you will see results.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is  fragrance free because I am allergic to all face creams that have fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Well, the product smells nice and is a decent moisturizer but don&#x27;t expect to see what the product claims.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special about this eye cream.</li>
            <li>It is mild and does not seem to irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>the last haft of the jar turned into some kind of petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li>do not think it is worth the money</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and will continue to use.</li>
            <li>Smoothed skin but thought it would be more Intensive of a product such as the wording in it&#x27;s name.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what you need.</li>
            <li>Stop using it and my 50-year-old eyes started to really show their age!</li>
            <li>If you use Patricia Wexler as directed it does exactly what it says it does....</li>
            <li>and I am willing to try anything although I have found anything that really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>Used it pretty fast...</li>
            <li>I expected more.  </li>
            <li>It really seems to help wake my eyes up</li>
            <li>Because of good jeans, staying out of the sun, drinking ph miracle Doc Brocks by doctor young and using proactiv since I was 21 I have always looked tens younger my age and been complemented as such....</li>
            <li>and i have noticed a slight difference in better looking skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have been able to maintain that ten yrs younger youthful look I have always had.</li>
            <li>I selected this product because it received high marks as a firming, lifting and anti-wrinkle cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced much better results with less expensive products, like Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li>They hydration is nice with this product and I would probably purchase again due to the feel and how hydrating it actually is.  </li>
            <li>Using Patricia Wexler was a choice made because of my sensitivity to retinal-A around the eye area, so I looked up eye cream for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, but I love this eye cream for someone with drier eye skin.</li>
            <li>As I got older the only place I saw</li>
            <li>Even though a bit expensive, this product will last a long time and it is very effective, so</li>
            <li>MY HUSBAND USES IT DAILY AND BEING 54 YEARS OLD</li>
            <li>At first i might have had an allergic reaction as my eyes got a little more puffy but after a few weeks it went down</li>
            <li>It feels a little firm going on, unlike most.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t notice the little lines as much.</li>

            <li> Not bad, not great.</li>
            <li> Product is expensive and didnt last more than a month, didnt see anything any other cream wouldnt have done, so think twice on purchasing it.</li>
            <li> After trying out several other brands, I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> I like Wexler&#x27;s products, they definitely make my skin soften and smoother, not sure how it stacks up compared to cheaper or more expensive products.</li>
            <li> It felt like it made my skin dry.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see in a few years if it actually worked.</li>

            <li> but I have not seen any improvement over the past few weeks that I have been using.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no better than any moistuizer.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had read the Amazon reviews before purchasing this product (like I usually do).  </li>
            <li> oz / 15ml which i was not satisfied with.</li>
            <li> Have been using it nightly and haven&#x27;t seen any difference, for the money I&#x27;m not impressed, will not buy again</li>
            <li> This was very expensive and use the rest of my legs</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t see results that I wanted</li>
            <li> I have used her products for many years and always like them.</li>
            <li> Great product. Happy with purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li> Product is expensive and didnt last more than a month, didnt see anything any other cream wouldnt have done, so think twice on purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Did not help with reducing crow&#x27;s feet.  Smoothed skin but thought it would be more Intensive of a product such as the wording in it&#x27;s name.  May try another Wexler product geared toward reducing crow&#x27;s feet.  Does Wexler have any recommendations?  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a good eye cream. I know better than to expect miracles. This does a nice job and does not irritate my eye area.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams and this one suits me best. It feels a little firm going on, unlike most. We&#x27;ll see in a few years if it actually worked. :) so far so good. I am almost 42 and no huge wrinkles</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this cream, its great to add moisture, but doesn&#x27;t seem to do too much more than that..maybe with long term use you will see results.</li>
            <li> Well, the product smells nice and is a decent moisturizer but don&#x27;t expect to see what the product claims.  I used it twice a day and honestly, you can do just as well with an over the counter product at the grocery store and save money.</li>
            <li> Not bad, not great. Moisturizes.  However, it makes the skin under my eyes itchy and red.  I think I may be allergic to an ingredient.</li>
            <li> After trying out several other brands, I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what you need. But will write better review when I have used it for a longer period ok</li>
            <li> this is the best eye cream I have found so far! Stop using it and my 50-year-old eyes started to really show their age! Never going without this wonderful eye cream again!</li>
            <li> I expected more.  It&#x27;s no better than any moistuizer.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and have not noticed any improvement in the circles or the darkness of the circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> GREAT STUFF. I USE SEVERAL BRANDS AND THIS ONE IS NO TERRIFIC. MY HUSBAND USES IT DAILY AND BEING 54 YEARS OLD NOT A LINE IN SIGHT......KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK PATRICIA WEXLER..</li>
            <li> I like this product, I have been using it for 3 months. At first i might have had an allergic reaction as my eyes got a little more puffy but after a few weeks it went down and i have noticed a slight difference in better looking skin around my eyes. I will continue to use it as it feels refreshing on my skin and i hope it is helping.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, but I love this eye cream for someone with drier eye skin.</li>
            <li> My wrinkles looked more defined after using this. It felt like it made my skin dry. I would recommend any other product over this one.</li>
            <li> This cream is aesthetically pleasing; I like the way the jar looks.  It is mild and does not seem to irritate my skin.  I like the fact that it is  fragrance free because I am allergic to all face creams that have fragrance.  But I have yet to see how effective it is in reducing wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the Amazon reviews before purchasing this product (like I usually do).  Instead I relied on the ratings in Allure magazine.  I selected this product because it received high marks as a firming, lifting and anti-wrinkle cream.  I should have known it was too good to be true.  I&#x27;ve used this product for several weeks and have seen no discernible improvement.  I&#x27;ve experienced much better results with less expensive products, like Neutrogena.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this eye cream.</li>
            <li> I like Wexler&#x27;s products, they definitely make my skin soften and smoother, not sure how it stacks up compared to cheaper or more expensive products. I&#x27;m going to test cheaper alternatives as buying her products adds up...</li>
            <li> From my research on this product I was expecting much more from it.  The cream goes on nicely and blends in but I have not seen any improvement over the past few weeks that I have been using.  I will not purchase again</li>
            <li> I have very fine lines developing around my eyes and I am willing to try anything although I have found anything that really makes a difference.  They hydration is nice with this product and I would probably purchase again due to the feel and how hydrating it actually is.  I did not see any noticeable results.</li>
            <li> Used it pretty fast...the last haft of the jar turned into some kind of petroleum jelly. This was very expensive and use the rest of my legs</li>
            <li> Even though a bit expensive, this product will last a long time and it is very effective, so a little dab will do ya. Excellent and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Used this for years. Its great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of eye creams, as well as read dozens of reviews, and this is the best I&#x27;ve found. It really seems to help wake my eyes up and I don&#x27;t notice the little lines as much.</li>
            <li> I can already see the difference. I love it</li>
            <li> Have been using it nightly and haven&#x27;t seen any difference, for the money I&#x27;m not impressed, will not buy again</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t that impressee</li>
            <li> Very appropriate price for the an excellent product.</li>
            <li> this product information was misleading as i am accustom to purchasing this item @1.7 oz/ 48g and the information given did not specify the size of container so i went ahead and purchase but when i receive the package it was .5oz / 15ml which i was not satisfied with.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks  I do not notice a difference&lt;br /&gt;I do not think it is worth the money</li>
            <li> If you use Patricia Wexler as directed it does exactly what it says it does.... I am only 36 w/4 children and I have never worn make up I don&#x27;t even know how to put it on... Because of good jeans, staying out of the sun, drinking ph miracle Doc Brocks by doctor young and using proactiv since I was 21 I have always looked tens younger my age and been complemented as such.... As I got older the only place I saw signs of aging was around my eyes.... Using Patricia Wexler was a choice made because of my sensitivity to retinal-A around the eye area, so I looked up eye cream for sensitive skin Patricia Wexler popped up..... I ordered it an with using it I have been able to maintain that ten yrs younger youthful look I have always had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay cream. Not fantastic.</li>
            <li> Reserving &amp;#34;love this&amp;#34; comment until have used for awhile.  My sister in Texas loves this product.</li>
            <li> I can feel instant results. Love it and highly recommend it. Worth every penny and will continue to use. Noticable firmess under eyes.</li>
