            <li>What I got was amazing!!!  </li>
            <li>But this lash serum is amazing!!</li>
            <li>Saw very good reviews on this item, but I have had zero results.</li>
            <li>No redness either, and the price is very fair.</li>
            <li>Word to the wise: if you are going to try it out...do as I did and purchase it on Amazon rather than paying the store prices!</li>
            <li>Then Dermstore has SmartLash on sale one day for $29.99(Orig. price $129), and I jumped at the chance to use it because of all the &#x27;great reviews&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I used this about 2 years ago and was happy with results.</li>
            <li>But I am so happy with my eyelashes now because of Rapidlash.  </li>
            <li>A great cheaper alternative to Latisse.</li>
            <li>I have attractive eyes, and of course, mascara helps draw attention to them.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Recommended it to my friend, and now she&#x27;s using it and find it effective as well!</li>
            <li>This one seemed to have some good reviews, and was at a great price point on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the $$$$!!!!</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super happy with this product and will buy it again!</li>
            <li>Every bit as good as Latise and maybe better!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product and I am very pleased with the result of my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love it works great for me.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>since most reviews here say it takes about 1 month to see results!</li>
            <li>and my eyelashes are better than they have ever been!</li>
            <li>Certainly a better price!  </li>
            <li>You just put on top lashes before going to bed and the bottom lashes grew too!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, and I will forever continue to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>and honestly I went from skimpy lashes to amazing length</li>
            <li>This is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Had extensions and loved them but just not practical as I felt that I was taking advantage of the girl that was doing them because I would lose so many and</li>
            <li>I know these products don&#x27;t work on everyone, but if they work on you, you&#x27;ll be thrilled.  </li>
            <li>My first experience with it was very good.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised and very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>I will gladly purchase this product again until I am fully satisfied because I know its effective.</li>
            <li>HUGE savings!</li>
            <li>Price was excellent compared to local retail.</li>
            <li>Well being a woman, and always in search of the &#x27;next best thing&#x27;, I then tried Obagi&#x27;s Elastilash.  </li>
            <li>It was just &#x27;ok&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Will buy more of this.</li>
            <li>How many times we buy something, expecting it to do what is advertised and it does nothing.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a bunch of money on a product that I was not too sure about.  </li>
            <li>There are so many lash lengtheners out there.</li>
            <li>I was able to get almost three months use out of one bottle.</li>
            <li>I got to use this and was so pleased to have my eyelashes and some of my&lt;br /&gt;eyebrow</li>
            <li>lovely longer eyelashes</li>
            <li>My eyelashes seem fuller and longer and my skin more moist.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it any more.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff....</li>
            <li>I had eyelash extension put on about a year ago and the glue caused most of my eyelashes to fall out</li>
            <li>love this product and will continue to use it for years to come.</li>
            <li>I apply it under my lower lashes, not on top because then the serum will get in your eyes.  </li>
            <li>maybe better on some people than others.  </li>
            <li>I am sure there will be even better results with continued use.</li>
            <li>this is a great product to try, your brows will appear significantly thicker in a month if you rarely pluck.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good just takes some time for the lashes to start growing</li>
            <li>I used on my eyebrow too and it filled up my eyebrow more than before.  </li>
            <li>Any cosmetic product that makes you look better with and without makeup is worth it!</li>
            <li>No muss,no fuss,very convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am sure Latisse is more powerful</li>
            <li>Easy to do do just apply as recommended.</li>
            <li>You do have to be consistent and patient with it though for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>Now I repurchased the Rapidlash Rapid Lash Eyelash Enhancing Serum, hoping to get my brows more full.</li>
            <li>really have had astonishing results with this product!</li>
            <li>and I can see a huge difference in the thickness there.</li>
            <li>Some nights I would feel a light stinging around my eye area, but it would dissipate before time to sleep, so not a problem.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are like they were when I was 20, love this stuff and will continue to use, well worth the money.</li>
            <li>At the end of my last bottle of Latisse I started using Rapidlash and am extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li>I have beautiful long lashes.  </li>
            <li>This product really works!!!</li>
            <li>I used Latisse for a year with good results, but had problems with my eyelids becoming red.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I went with the cheaper alternative first since I&#x27;m pretty satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Try it--it&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and worth the money.</li>
            <li>but it sure doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s really working.  </li>
            <li>it was like getting a full set every two weeks.  </li>
            <li>So far definitely loving the product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as quickly as I&#x27;d like but it does work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did my research and found &amp;#34;Rapid lash&amp;#34;, and by the first week I could tell a huge difference in my lashes.  </li>
            <li>(I also use a lash curler prior to applying mascara which enhances it even more) Can&#x27;t imagine what my lashes will look like in 1 month!</li>
            <li>After using Latisse for sometime(I&#x27;d won a $500 gift certificate thru my estitician&#x27;s office in a raffle drawing), I was in search of a comparable product, and this was the first one that I&#x27;d tried, and I was not disappointed with the results.  </li>
            <li>First review I&#x27;ve written, but I had to for this one!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely loved them, but they are time consuming to get filled every few weeks and can be spendy.</li>
            <li>Love it so far</li>
            <li>It took about 2 months to see results but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Good results and appropriately wet application.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I used Rapid Lash several years ago and had fast and amazing results.  </li>
            <li>Really like the product!</li>
            <li>Her eye lashes really have grown!</li>
            <li>thanks &amp;#34;Rapid lash&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit that I had higher expectations since reading the reviews on here</li>
            <li>were much longer!</li>
            <li>BUT she didn&#x27;t address her thyroid issue until her eyebrows and eyelash follicles were pretty much toast!</li>
            <li>Make sure you are not buying counterfiet stuff, either, and actual Rapidlash.</li>
            <li>The reason my title says \\&quot;For Lower Lashes Too\\&quot; is because from my experience with Rapid Lash is that my lower lashes show more effectiveness and results than my upper lashes.  </li>
            <li>It did absolutely NOTHING!  </li>
            <li>I am happy that I did not run back to putting extensions on, and a little bit of patience (a few weeks) and I am so happy with the result.</li>
            <li>It really had an effect - enough that many people have noticed.</li>
            <li>On a positive note, it also didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all or bother my contacts.</li>
            <li>After my eyelashes thinned out from a thyroid condition and my age over 40, I purchasd this product after all the positive reviews I read.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen positive results.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty upset as I have always loved mascara and the look of thick eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It felt so good to see that new growth and even those little hairs helped to make my eyelashes look</li>
            <li>I can certainly tell a difference if I &amp;#34;don&#x27;t&amp;#34; use it so that tells me that it works.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and it really helps strengthen and lengthen my lashes.</li>
            <li>I bought Lipo Flavinoid to stop tinnitus and absolutely nothing changed.</li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference in using the serum.</li>
            <li>I use it every night before I go to bed, and within 2 weeks I really started to see a difference.</li>
            <li>My lashes got so much longer, it&#x27;s crazy.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>Too much work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to try it, but was very skeptical.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using Rapidlash for a month now and my lashes have grown so much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like I can go without wearing Mascara because without Mascara, I don&#x27;t think it is very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I give it five stars because it really does work...</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than the prescription stuff.</li>
            <li>Was asked yesterday I&#x27;d my lashes were real.  </li>
            <li>Use only a small bit at first, to check for any iritation, which happened to two good friends of mine.</li>
            <li>I have always had short, light, thin lashes, and live a fairly \\&quot;make-up free\\&quot; lifestyle.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>wow!!  </li>
            <li>I think they are a little longer and fuller but not as great as I expected so far.</li>
            <li>but so far my results are promising.  </li>
            <li>Will update in a few weeks :).</li>
            <li>Hoping I will be able to tell if that is working in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase, use and recommend Rapid Lash because it makes enough of a difference that makes it worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This product is simpler as it has a built in wand rather than opening a new one every time.  </li>
            <li>and I can already tell that they have gotten longer because my eyelashes hit at a different (higher) spot on my eye lids.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product a year ago and it really made my lashes grow in a month, and 2 months on my browns, I use it mainly on my brows and notice results especially when I mix it with rogaine.</li>
            <li>So far after three weeks I have new growth and they appear to be coming in fuller.  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes grew really fast and they seemed to be back to normal for me.  </li>
            <li>I have long, beautiful thick lashes!!  </li>
            <li>I will use this supply until it is gone, and if I notice a change later, I will certainly change my review.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there has been a whole lot of improvement in the thickness of my lashes, but they are definitely longer than before I started using RapidLash.</li>
            <li>but when they do they get pretty long.....</li>
            <li>Makes them look lush and natural.</li>
            <li>I am 72 years old and I am losing my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>When I first showed my sister my long lashes, she was amazed and started using Rapidlash immediately.</li>
            <li>and i already see major results!!</li>
            <li>So, if the hair follicles are pretty much gone and the root is dead, this product may not help.</li>
            <li>When asked by my friends what I kind of mascara I am using to make my lashes look so long and thick, I&#x27;ve told them about Rapid Lash.  </li>
            <li>It takes about 6 weeks for your lashes to grow, and believe me, they really get long.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint - you have to commit to using it for longer time than I would like to:)</li>
            <li>I applied this only 2 nights so far and my lashes already became longer!</li>
            <li>After two months, they&#x27;re the same length as with Latisse, just not as dark, so a quick brush of mascara</li>
            <li>I already have long lashes but not necessarily thick.</li>
            <li>So far I have definitely noticed that my eyelashes are thicker and longer.</li>
            <li>Took several weeks to work, but then - wow.</li>
            <li>I had always had long thick lashes and healthy eyebrows</li>
            <li>but far, far inferior to Latisse, which I will return to though more expensive.</li>
            <li>Great price for this serum which can be expensive other sites!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month so haven&#x27;t really seen too much results, but I do feel that my bottom lashes grew a little!</li>
            <li>old and dry.  </li>
            <li>This may sound like a no-brainer, but I figured there were other people besides myself that were not sure where to apply it on your lower lashes.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It works pretty good just takes some time for the lashes to start growing</li>
            <li> I used on my eyebrow too and it filled up my eyebrow more than before.  </li>
            <li> Any cosmetic product that makes you look better with and without makeup is worth it!</li>
            <li> No muss,no fuss,very convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am sure Latisse is more powerful</li>
            <li> Easy to do do just apply as recommended.</li>
            <li> You do have to be consistent and patient with it though for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> Now I repurchased the Rapidlash Rapid Lash Eyelash Enhancing Serum, hoping to get my brows more full.</li>
            <li> really have had astonishing results with this product!</li>
            <li> and I can see a huge difference in the thickness there.</li>
            <li> Some nights I would feel a light stinging around my eye area, but it would dissipate before time to sleep, so not a problem.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are like they were when I was 20, love this stuff and will continue to use, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> At the end of my last bottle of Latisse I started using Rapidlash and am extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have beautiful long lashes.  </li>
            <li> This product really works!!!</li>
            <li> I used Latisse for a year with good results, but had problems with my eyelids becoming red.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I went with the cheaper alternative first since I&#x27;m pretty satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Try it--it&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and worth the money.</li>
            <li> but it sure doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s really working.  </li>
            <li> it was like getting a full set every two weeks.  </li>
            <li> So far definitely loving the product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as quickly as I&#x27;d like but it does work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did my research and found &amp;#34;Rapid lash&amp;#34;, and by the first week I could tell a huge difference in my lashes.  </li>
            <li> (I also use a lash curler prior to applying mascara which enhances it even more) Can&#x27;t imagine what my lashes will look like in 1 month!</li>
            <li> After using Latisse for sometime(I&#x27;d won a $500 gift certificate thru my estitician&#x27;s office in a raffle drawing), I was in search of a comparable product, and this was the first one that I&#x27;d tried, and I was not disappointed with the results.  </li>
            <li> First review I&#x27;ve written, but I had to for this one!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely loved them, but they are time consuming to get filled every few weeks and can be spendy.</li>
            <li> Love it so far</li>
            <li> It took about 2 months to see results but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Good results and appropriately wet application.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I used Rapid Lash several years ago and had fast and amazing results.  </li>
            <li> Really like the product!</li>
            <li> Her eye lashes really have grown!</li>
            <li> thanks &amp;#34;Rapid lash&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I had higher expectations since reading the reviews on here</li>
            <li> were much longer!</li>
            <li> BUT she didn&#x27;t address her thyroid issue until her eyebrows and eyelash follicles were pretty much toast!</li>
            <li> Make sure you are not buying counterfiet stuff, either, and actual Rapidlash.</li>
            <li> The reason my title says \\&quot;For Lower Lashes Too\\&quot; is because from my experience with Rapid Lash is that my lower lashes show more effectiveness and results than my upper lashes.  </li>
            <li> It did absolutely NOTHING!  </li>
            <li> I am happy that I did not run back to putting extensions on, and a little bit of patience (a few weeks) and I am so happy with the result.</li>
            <li> It really had an effect - enough that many people have noticed.</li>
            <li> On a positive note, it also didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all or bother my contacts.</li>
            <li> After my eyelashes thinned out from a thyroid condition and my age over 40, I purchasd this product after all the positive reviews I read.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen positive results.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty upset as I have always loved mascara and the look of thick eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It felt so good to see that new growth and even those little hairs helped to make my eyelashes look</li>
            <li> I can certainly tell a difference if I &amp;#34;don&#x27;t&amp;#34; use it so that tells me that it works.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and it really helps strengthen and lengthen my lashes.</li>
            <li> I bought Lipo Flavinoid to stop tinnitus and absolutely nothing changed.</li>
            <li> but I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference in using the serum.</li>
            <li> I use it every night before I go to bed, and within 2 weeks I really started to see a difference.</li>
            <li> My lashes got so much longer, it&#x27;s crazy.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> Too much work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to try it, but was very skeptical.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using Rapidlash for a month now and my lashes have grown so much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like I can go without wearing Mascara because without Mascara, I don&#x27;t think it is very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I give it five stars because it really does work...</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than the prescription stuff.</li>
            <li> Was asked yesterday I&#x27;d my lashes were real.  </li>
            <li> Use only a small bit at first, to check for any iritation, which happened to two good friends of mine.</li>
            <li> I have always had short, light, thin lashes, and live a fairly \\&quot;make-up free\\&quot; lifestyle.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> wow!!  </li>
            <li> I think they are a little longer and fuller but not as great as I expected so far.</li>
            <li> but so far my results are promising.  </li>
            <li> Will update in a few weeks :).</li>
            <li> Hoping I will be able to tell if that is working in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase, use and recommend Rapid Lash because it makes enough of a difference that makes it worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This product is simpler as it has a built in wand rather than opening a new one every time.  </li>
            <li> and I can already tell that they have gotten longer because my eyelashes hit at a different (higher) spot on my eye lids.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product a year ago and it really made my lashes grow in a month, and 2 months on my browns, I use it mainly on my brows and notice results especially when I mix it with rogaine.</li>
            <li> So far after three weeks I have new growth and they appear to be coming in fuller.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes grew really fast and they seemed to be back to normal for me.  </li>
            <li> I have long, beautiful thick lashes!!  </li>
            <li> I will use this supply until it is gone, and if I notice a change later, I will certainly change my review.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there has been a whole lot of improvement in the thickness of my lashes, but they are definitely longer than before I started using RapidLash.</li>
            <li> but when they do they get pretty long.....</li>
            <li> Makes them look lush and natural.</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and I am losing my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> When I first showed my sister my long lashes, she was amazed and started using Rapidlash immediately.</li>
            <li> and i already see major results!!</li>
            <li> So, if the hair follicles are pretty much gone and the root is dead, this product may not help.</li>
            <li> When asked by my friends what I kind of mascara I am using to make my lashes look so long and thick, I&#x27;ve told them about Rapid Lash.  </li>
            <li> It takes about 6 weeks for your lashes to grow, and believe me, they really get long.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint - you have to commit to using it for longer time than I would like to:)</li>
            <li> I applied this only 2 nights so far and my lashes already became longer!</li>
            <li> After two months, they&#x27;re the same length as with Latisse, just not as dark, so a quick brush of mascara</li>
            <li> I already have long lashes but not necessarily thick.</li>
            <li> So far I have definitely noticed that my eyelashes are thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> Took several weeks to work, but then - wow.</li>
            <li> I had always had long thick lashes and healthy eyebrows</li>
            <li> but far, far inferior to Latisse, which I will return to though more expensive.</li>
            <li> Great price for this serum which can be expensive other sites!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month so haven&#x27;t really seen too much results, but I do feel that my bottom lashes grew a little!</li>
            <li> old and dry.  </li>
            <li> This may sound like a no-brainer, but I figured there were other people besides myself that were not sure where to apply it on your lower lashes.  </li>
            <li> fill in as it has been hard to grown hair in certain parts of my btow.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 months and love it, seems like as I have aged my lashes got very thin, after about 3 weeks of using I could already see a change.  </li>
            <li> May sound silly, but I put it on every day for quite a while and nothing...</li>
            <li> My friends all remarked at how long my eyelashes are.</li>
            <li> I never have long eyelashes and using this product helping me grow longer eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> or if it just doesn&#x27;t work if you quit using it for a long time and then try again.  </li>
            <li> Once again DRY, no results, making me think the product has been sitting around too long.  </li>
            <li> I starting using Rapidlash a year ago when I noticed my eyelashes and eyebrows started thinning (falling out) due to my hypothyroidism.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a short time but it seems to have improved the length  of my eyelashes a little.</li>
            <li> No need for 2nd and 3rd coats and all the clumpy messy nuisance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had medium thick and long eyelashes, but this has brought it to a new level for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t willing to let them continue to thin while I figured out my dosage.</li>
            <li> Just some slight redness and at times a tiny bit of itching.</li>
            <li> I was using a $130.00 RX and it made my lashes very dry and fall out.</li>
            <li> After using for &#x27;3&#x27; months, I saw absolutely no difference.  </li>
            <li> wanted to buy something that would help accelerate the growth of my eyelashes as I knew it would take a few cycles before they would fully grow back.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months and this is my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Waste of $$ Used as instructed and had zero results only burning sensation around eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Especially considering that I have missed a few evenings.  </li>
            <li> Due to fake eyelashes being put on poorly and a medication that caused me to lose many lashes, I felt horribly naked.  </li>
            <li> I stopped the extensions and decided to look at other alternatives.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure if it is working yet because I have only been using it for 2 wk</li>
            <li> My eyelashes fell out years ago due to health issues.  </li>
            <li> And early on in the process I get a series of slightly uncomfortable pimples along my left eye lashline.</li>
            <li> This thing actually works but I feel like it gets into your eyes at least some of bit</li>
            <li> I have used Rapidlash for at least a couple of years, except for a short time when I used prescription Latisse.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s too soon to tell, it&#x27;s been less than a month.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes are so long &amp; thick</li>
            <li> had eyelash extensions that I refilled every few weeks for over a year and a half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little longer than 2 weeks every night before bed and it has not worked for me at all.</li>
            <li> YOU CAN TELL after just using it for a little while.</li>
            <li> a side note, my Mom, who has hypothyroidism too, used this product and said she saw just a little growth with her eyebrows</li>
            <li> I have had a small amount of eye itching due to this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my brows and eye lashes for a little over a month</li>
            <li> Absolutely no Changes or improvements with my eye lashes !!!</li>
            <li> I had hoped to save some $$ by using RapidLash, but if appears that I have wasted $$ instead.  </li>
            <li> that my eyelashes were very short and thin.  </li>
            <li> I constantly looked tired and had dryness in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I also got NOTICEABLE results in less than a week!  </li>
            <li> They are very thick and long.</li>
            <li> or so I started to see new tiny growth at the base of my eyelashes and the eyelashes I had</li>
            <li> But not so long I have to cut them or look like a clown with false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I noticed a little redness; not like what you hear about with latisse though!</li>
            <li> Also, there seems to be very little serum in container.  </li>
            <li> But once I went to the recommended once a day, I now have very little to no itchiness.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any resualts, I usually use another brand but you were sold out at the time...</li>
            <li> The fake stuff could look the same, watch whom you purchase from.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it had expired(?)</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t hard on my eyes which is a plus</li>
            <li> You have to give it at least a month.</li>
            <li> I decided to have mine removed at the end of August, and was shocked what my natural eyelashes had become since having extensions on.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least two years and my lashes are thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> If you have delicate lashes already, try to avoid itching or scratching!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> slow but growing).&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> Thankfully they slowly went away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good about using it every night</li>
            <li> My thin eyebrows have grown and got thicker in about a month or so.  </li>
            <li> ppl think I&#x27;m wearing eyelashes when in reality I&#x27;m not lol give it a try Girls</li>
            <li> so when they started to thin</li>
            <li> I knew that it was a hormonal issue and medication would help my poor eyelashes and eyebrows</li>
            <li> would say the only thing to look out for is some irritation on the base of the eyelid if you use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> Try it if your lashes are stubby and thin like mine were.  </li>
            <li> People look at my eyes and think I have false eyelashes on.  </li>
            <li> I picked up Rapidlash from a beauty salon and started applying a thin layer to the base of my upper eyelashes and outter eyebrows that day!</li>
            <li> I forgot that I had to return this item once or twice before because it seemed outdated.</li>
            <li> They were very thin, sparse and the technician had cut them to be an even length</li>
            <li> I apply the serum at the base of my eyelashes and also to my eyebrows where they have thinned and within approximately 8 weeks...</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, so I just had to write a review.  </li>
            <li> Some are very expensive.</li>
            <li> Well let me tell you, I was MAJORLY DISAPPOINTED.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> makes my eyebrows grow in thicker. be patient . takes a while for the product to start working but it does</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  I was very skeptical, so I just had to write a review.  My thin eyebrows have grown and got thicker in about a month or so.  When I looked back on the package, it did say &amp;#34;see results in 4 weeks&amp;#34;.  I was very surprised and very happy with the product.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It totally made my eyelashes grow longer! You do have to be consistent and patient with it though for it to be effective. I have sensitive eyes and it didn&#x27;t irritate me at all. Really like the product! Recommended it to my friend, and now she&#x27;s using it and find it effective as well!</li>
            <li> I noticed some growth in about 2 weeks.  Still using it and plan to keep on using it.  It isn&#x27;t hard on my eyes which is a plus and there is no warning about changes in eye color.  Price was excellent compared to local retail.</li>
            <li> My wife has been buying this product for 6 months now and she swears by it!  Her eye lashes really have grown!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using RapidLash for over a year and it really helps strengthen and lengthen my lashes. In the beginning I use it every day for 3 to 4 weeks and I noticed a difference right away. After that, I only use it 2 or 3 times a week to maintain. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have noticed no change in my eyelashes after four weeks.  I had hoped to save some $$ by using RapidLash, but if appears that I have wasted $$ instead.  I will use this supply until it is gone, and if I notice a change later, I will certainly change my review.  Go on...get Latisse...and stop fooling around with stuff that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Saw very good reviews on this item, but I have had zero results. I will stick with Nutraluxe. Saw almost instant results with that one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three weeks and there has been noticeable growth in my lashes. I don&#x27;t think there has been a whole lot of improvement in the thickness of my lashes, but they are definitely longer than before I started using RapidLash.</li>
            <li> I have been using Rapid Lash Eyelash Enhancing Serum for several years.  My friends all remarked at how long my eyelashes are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little longer than 2 weeks every night before bed and it has not worked for me at all. Absolutely no Changes or improvements with my eye lashes !!!</li>
            <li> I applied this only 2 nights so far and my lashes already became longer! They look like falsies when I apply mascara! (I also use a lash curler prior to applying mascara which enhances it even more) Can&#x27;t imagine what my lashes will look like in 1 month! Wish I could post a picture! I didn&#x27;t expect this at all since most reviews here say it takes about 1 month to see results! I&#x27;m super happy with this product and will buy it again! Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> After using Latisse for sometime(I&#x27;d won a $500 gift certificate thru my estitician&#x27;s office in a raffle drawing), I was in search of a comparable product, and this was the first one that I&#x27;d tried, and I was not disappointed with the results.  Well being a woman, and always in search of the &#x27;next best thing&#x27;, I then tried Obagi&#x27;s Elastilash.  It was just &#x27;ok&#x27;.  Then Dermstore has SmartLash on sale one day for $29.99(Orig. price $129), and I jumped at the chance to use it because of all the &#x27;great reviews&#x27;.  Well let me tell you, I was MAJORLY DISAPPOINTED.  After using for &#x27;3&#x27; months, I saw absolutely no difference.  I then went back to my ol faithful, Rapidlash, and after a month, I saw my lashes starting to take off.  This product is amazing, and I will forever continue to purchase it.  It&#x27;s well worth the $$$$!!!!</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any resualts, I usually use another brand but you were sold out at the time... Will go back to the brand I have used for 4 years...</li>
            <li> Amazing! I was using a $130.00 RX and it made my lashes very dry and fall out. I would recommend this to anyone with this problem.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and I am very pleased with the result of my eyelashes.  I&#x27;ve been using it everynight and my eyelashes has grown double of the length.  I never have long eyelashes and using this product helping me grow longer eyelashes.  I used on my eyebrow too and it filled up my eyebrow more than before.  I would recommend this product to anyone who want to grow longer eyelashes.  I will keep on using this product.....</li>
            <li> It does what its supposed to do. No muss,no fuss,very convenient and easy to use.Lasts a long time. Good value.</li>
            <li> It does work, you have to remember to do it every night, but if definitely see a difference in my eyelashes. Will buy more of this.</li>
            <li> Great product. If you keep using it is does what it says. Wonder of wonders. How many times we buy something, expecting it to do what is advertised and it does nothing. I bought Lipo Flavinoid to stop tinnitus and absolutely nothing changed. And they said &amp;#34;GUARANTEED RESULTS&amp;#34;. This product doesn&#x27;t say guaranteed results, it doesn&#x27;t need to. It is good!!</li>
            <li> When I hit 48 yrs. that my eyelashes were very short and thin.  I did my research and found &amp;#34;Rapid lash&amp;#34;, and by the first week I could tell a huge difference in my lashes.  People look at my eyes and think I have false eyelashes on.  I say no I do not!&lt;br /&gt;So thanks &amp;#34;Rapid lash&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile. There is no change is eyelashes at all. Will not buy again. I used this about 2 years ago and was happy with results. But they must have changed the formual because I have not seen any results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I had higher expectations since reading the reviews on here but I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference in using the serum. It says it could take 4 weeks to work but I&#x27;ve been using it as directed every night for 3 weeks and there isn&#x27;t a difference at all in length of my eyelashes. I was using the serum to lengthen my lashes and add some volume to them and neither of those things happened. On a positive note, it also didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all or bother my contacts. I think from here on out I&#x27;ll save my money and keep using lengthening mascara which is cheaper. Word to the wise: if you are going to try it out...do as I did and purchase it on Amazon rather than paying the store prices! HUGE savings!</li>
            <li> All I can say is that this stuff is amazing!!! You have to give it at least a month. I have been using it for about three months and honestly I went from skimpy lashes to amazing length and when I use mascara the lashes touch my sunglasses. You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had medium thick and long eyelashes, but this has brought it to a new level for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had eyelash extensions that I refilled every few weeks for over a year and a half. I absolutely loved them, but they are time consuming to get filled every few weeks and can be spendy. I decided to have mine removed at the end of August, and was shocked what my natural eyelashes had become since having extensions on.  They were very thin, sparse and the technician had cut them to be an even length so they were extremely short. I was pretty upset as I have always loved mascara and the look of thick eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to buy something that would help accelerate the growth of my eyelashes as I knew it would take a few cycles before they would fully grow back. I did some research online and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a bunch of money on a product that I was not too sure about.  This one seemed to have some good reviews, and was at a great price point on Amazon.  I bought it, and immediately started using it when I received it 2 days later.  I use it every night before I go to bed, and within 2 weeks I really started to see a difference. My eyelashes grew really fast and they seemed to be back to normal for me.  Now, it has been about 6 weeks since I started using it and my eyelashes are better than they have ever been! They are very thick and long. I was so nervous about getting my extensions off because I was concerned I would miss having the extensions, and I do like them. But I am so happy with my eyelashes now because of Rapidlash.  I am happy that I did not run back to putting extensions on, and a little bit of patience (a few weeks) and I am so happy with the result.</li>
            <li> I can certainly tell a difference if I &amp;#34;don&#x27;t&amp;#34; use it so that tells me that it works.  I am sure Latisse is more powerful but this does work.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good just takes some time for the lashes to start growing but when they do they get pretty long.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week and I might miss a day or two but I can tell a difference in the length and strength of my lashes.  Due to fake eyelashes being put on poorly and a medication that caused me to lose many lashes, I felt horribly naked.  I&#x27;m glad I went with the cheaper alternative first since I&#x27;m pretty satisfied.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a year ago and it really made my lashes grow in a month, and 2 months on my browns, I use it mainly on my brows and notice results especially when I mix it with rogaine. Now I repurchased the Rapidlash Rapid Lash Eyelash Enhancing Serum, hoping to get my brows more full.</li>
            <li> There are so many lash lengtheners out there. Some are very expensive. I have used this product for at least two years and my lashes are thicker and longer. But not so long I have to cut them or look like a clown with false eyelashes. Makes them look lush and natural. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I tried similar products and maybe you can see some difference after using it for a while. But this lash serum is amazing!! YOU CAN TELL after just using it for a little while. My lashes got so much longer, it&#x27;s crazy.&lt;br /&gt;If you want longer lashes I would definitely recommend you this product!</li>
            <li> I did not notice any difference after maybe 5 weeks. Should I have kept going longer?  Just bought Latisse which I know works.</li>
            <li> I did notice thicker lashes after a couple of weeks! A great cheaper alternative to Latisse. My eyelashes looked great with mascara!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months and this is my second bottle. After my eyelashes thinned out from a thyroid condition and my age over 40, I purchasd this product after all the positive reviews I read. I have found that my eyelashes have gotten thicker and are growing longer in length. It did take about three months for it to fill-in the gaps and now I am just using it to maintain the growth. I was able to get almost three months use out of one bottle. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I tried this product for a month and didn&#x27;t see any change. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again and don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got to use this and was so pleased to have my eyelashes and some of my&lt;br /&gt;eyebrow hair return!  I followed the nightly directions, and was rewarded&lt;br /&gt;with lovely longer eyelashes and my eyebrow is still growing (slow but growing).&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I have already purchased my next package!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s working.  I&#x27;ll keep on trying but it sure doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s really working.  Bummer</li>
            <li> Had extensions and loved them but just not practical as I felt that I was taking advantage of the girl that was doing them because I would lose so many and it was like getting a full set every two weeks.  I stopped the extensions and decided to look at other alternatives.  So far after three weeks I have new growth and they appear to be coming in fuller.  Still waiting for some length but so far my results are promising.  Will update in a few weeks :). Love it so far</li>
            <li> This product really works!!! My eyelashes are so long &amp; thick&lt;br /&gt;Now ppl think I&#x27;m wearing eyelashes when in reality I&#x27;m not lol give it a try Girls it does work believe me !!!</li>
            <li> I have been using rapid lash for about 6 months now and can definitely say it works. It took about 2 months to see results but it was worth it. I stopped doing eye lash extensions because I don&#x27;t need it anymore. Highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> This RapidLash is definitely working for me. I&#x27;ve purchased 4 tubes of it now and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Both products work!  I&#x27;ve seen positive results.  My eyelashes seem fuller and longer and my skin more moist.  Try both</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and I am losing my eyelashes.  I have used this product two times a day for about 6 weeks and my eyelashes are the same</li>
            <li> This thing actually works but I feel like it gets into your eyes at least some of bit no matter what.</li>
            <li> First review I&#x27;ve written, but I had to for this one!  I have always had short, light, thin lashes, and live a fairly \\&quot;make-up free\\&quot; lifestyle.  I have attractive eyes, and of course, mascara helps draw attention to them. But 3 coats of mascara?  Too much work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read about this type of product somewhere, did some research, and fell across this.  I decided to try it, but was very skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied per directions.  Some nights I would feel a light stinging around my eye area, but it would dissipate before time to sleep, so not a problem.  After a few weeks, I had decided I really wasn&#x27;t seeing a difference.  But then when I got out of the shower and my eyelashes were spiky from the water, I noticed it looked like I had mascara on.  Hmmmmm . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I continued using it.  About 6 weeks in, I had occasion to wear makeup, and wow!!  One coat of mascara, and I have beautiful long lashes.  No need for 2nd and 3rd coats and all the clumpy messy nuisance.  Absolutely wonderful, and I will be continuing to use this.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product.  When asked by my friends what I kind of mascara I am using to make my lashes look so long and thick, I&#x27;ve told them about Rapid Lash.  It&#x27;s incredible how the product works!  I&#x27;ll continue to use this product forever!!!</li>
            <li> I used Rapid Lash several years ago and had fast and amazing results.  All of a sudden I couldn&#x27;t find it any more.  Now using it again for about a month and have seen nothing.  Also, there seems to be very little serum in container.  I have to wiggle the brush around and it comes out with almost nothing on it.  Maybe my lashes just aren&#x27;t responding this time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as quickly as I&#x27;d like but it does work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can definitely see a difference in the length of my lashes and I&#x27;ve been using it for over three months. My lashes have NOT fallen out and overall it&#x27;s affordable!</li>
            <li> I starting using Rapidlash a year ago when I noticed my eyelashes and eyebrows started thinning (falling out) due to my hypothyroidism. I had always had long thick lashes and healthy eyebrows so when they started to thin I was frantic! I knew that it was a hormonal issue and medication would help my poor eyelashes and eyebrows but I wasn&#x27;t willing to let them continue to thin while I figured out my dosage. I picked up Rapidlash from a beauty salon and started applying a thin layer to the base of my upper eyelashes and outter eyebrows that day! I did this twice a day and I&#x27;d say within a week or so I started to see new tiny growth at the base of my eyelashes and the eyelashes I had were much longer! It felt so good to see that new growth and even those little hairs helped to make my eyelashes look fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say the only thing to look out for is some irritation on the base of the eyelid if you use it twice a day. I noticed a little redness; not like what you hear about with latisse though! No skin color changes or anything! Just some slight redness and at times a tiny bit of itching. If you have delicate lashes already, try to avoid itching or scratching!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, my Mom, who has hypothyroidism too, used this product and said she saw just a little growth with her eyebrows BUT she didn&#x27;t address her thyroid issue until her eyebrows and eyelash follicles were pretty much toast! So, if the hair follicles are pretty much gone and the root is dead, this product may not help. Just keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> Great price for this serum which can be expensive other sites!  I love this stuff....keeps my lashes full...been using for 2 years..I&#x27;m hooked....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Rapidlash for 2 weeks, but I already see a difference.  It is making my lashes longer AND thicker, unlike Revitalash, which only increased the length.  I know these products don&#x27;t work on everyone, but if they work on you, you&#x27;ll be thrilled.  Try it--it&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month.  I had eyelash extension put on about a year ago and the glue caused most of my eyelashes to fall out and I am just now getting them back in.  I believe I see some difference in the length and I would recommend this product with the understanding that some people may have a different result.  Also read the disclaimer well before buying.  It can cause some eye problems. I have had a small amount of eye itching due to this product.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for just one week and i already see major results!! I will Defiantly be buying this product again</li>
            <li> The Rapid Lash seems to be working well. I&#x27;m not good about using it every night but I have seen improvement in my lashes.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if it is working yet because I have only been using it for 2 wk and they say it takes 4 wks to see a difference.  It does not irritate my eyes,</li>
            <li> This product has worked for me.  After 10 years post chemo with no eyelashes or eyebrows.  Easy to use and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I forgot that I had to return this item once or twice before because it seemed outdated. old and dry.  My first experience with it was very good.  Good results and appropriately wet application.  Before this purchase I bought another more expensive brand, Elastilash by Obagi it burned my eyes so switched back to this.  Once again DRY, no results, making me think the product has been sitting around too long.  I already threw out packaging and invoice..ugh...what a dummy.</li>
            <li> Every bit as good as Latise and maybe better!  Certainly a better price!  I have used Latise twice and paid around $100 each time.  This product is simpler as it has a built in wand rather than opening a new one every time.  I also got NOTICEABLE results in less than a week!  No kidding!</li>
            <li> I have been using Rapidlash for a month now and my lashes have grown so much.  I&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t believe it!!!!!!  I noticed a difference after 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and will continue to use it for years to come.</li>
            <li> Yup! I now have longer an thicker lashes. Easy to do do just apply as recommended. So I do, almost every night after I wash my face before going to bed I apply the serum at the base of my eyelashes and also to my eyebrows where they have thinned and within approximately 8 weeks... Voila thicker and longer lashes and eyebrows.. Just great!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes tripled in legnth in about a month.  Use only a small bit at first, to check for any iritation, which happened to two good friends of mine. Make sure you are not buying counterfiet stuff, either, and actual Rapidlash. The fake stuff could look the same, watch whom you purchase from.</li>
            <li> I have used Rapidlash for at least a couple of years, except for a short time when I used prescription Latisse.  I have recommended it to friends and family members because it WORKS! It takes about 6 weeks for your lashes to grow, and believe me, they really get long.  When I first showed my sister my long lashes, she was amazed and started using Rapidlash immediately. Try it if your lashes are stubby and thin like mine were.  You&#x27;ll be very impressed.</li>
            <li> Waste of $$ Used as instructed and had zero results only burning sensation around eyes. Would not recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 months and love it, seems like as I have aged my lashes got very thin, after about 3 weeks of using I could already see a change.  My lashes are like they were when I was 20, love this stuff and will continue to use, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by the person that does my eyebrows.  It has lengthened them as also has helped by eyebrows fill in as it has been hard to grown hair in certain parts of my btow.</li>
            <li> I used Latisse for a year with good results, but had problems with my eyelids becoming red. At the end of my last bottle of Latisse I started using Rapidlash and am extremely happy with it. I was expecting some fallout, but my lashes just kept growing the same as with Latisse. After two months, they&#x27;re the same length as with Latisse, just not as dark, so a quick brush of mascara and I&#x27;m good. No redness either, and the price is very fair.</li>
            <li> I began using rapid lash about a month ago. So far I have definitely noticed that my eyelashes are thicker and longer. I already have long lashes but not necessarily thick. I can now \\&quot;see\\&quot; my eyelashes without having mascara on. I&#x27;m also using  it on my eyebrows and I can see a huge difference in the thickness there. So far definitely loving the product. Cons- I had  a bit of itchiness initially because I was being greedy and using it day and night. But once I went to the recommended once a day, I now have very little to no itchiness. I give this product two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s too soon to tell, it&#x27;s been less than a month.  I think they are a little longer and fuller but not as great as I expected so far.</li>
            <li> Lashes have stopped falling out but too soon to tell if they are growing.  Hoping I will be able to tell if that is working in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The reason my title says \\&quot;For Lower Lashes Too\\&quot; is because from my experience with Rapid Lash is that my lower lashes show more effectiveness and results than my upper lashes.  The instructions say for lower lashes too, however, they don&#x27;t tell you where to apply the serum.  I apply it under my lower lashes, not on top because then the serum will get in your eyes.  This may sound like a no-brainer, but I figured there were other people besides myself that were not sure where to apply it on your lower lashes.  Yes, my lower lashes are definitely longer and seem fuller, but my upper lashes, I don&#x27;t think I see a big, big difference.  It&#x27;s not like I can go without wearing Mascara because without Mascara, I don&#x27;t think it is very noticeable.  I give it five stars because it really does work... maybe better on some people than others.  I will continue to purchase, use and recommend Rapid Lash because it makes enough of a difference that makes it worth the money.  I have had no side effects from the product either.</li>
            <li> My cousin recommended this to me because she said it works. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month so haven&#x27;t really seen too much results, but I do feel that my bottom lashes grew a little!</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my brows and eye lashes for a little over a month and I am very satisfied. If you have ever over-plucked your eyebrows this is a great product to try, your brows will appear significantly thicker in a month if you rarely pluck. My eye lashes are also longer and thicker. I will gladly purchase this product again until I am fully satisfied because I know its effective. Any cosmetic product that makes you look better with and without makeup is worth it!</li>
            <li> but far, far inferior to Latisse, which I will return to though more expensive. And early on in the process I get a series of slightly uncomfortable pimples along my left eye lashline. Thankfully they slowly went away.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a short time but it seems to have improved the length  of my eyelashes a little.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes fell out years ago due to health issues.  I bought this product just hoping for some type of results.  What I got was amazing!!!  I have long, beautiful thick lashes!!  I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and my lashes are like they were when I was a child!!!  I never want to run out of this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Definitely noticed improvement in length and some in thickness and will definitely keep using it bc I am sure there will be even better results with continued use.</li>
            <li> If you use it daily as directed you will see results in about 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve been using for 2 years and continue to receive compliments on the length of my eyelashes!</li>
            <li> Took several weeks to work, but then - wow. It really had an effect - enough that many people have noticed.</li>
            <li> I tried this a couple of years ago and it worked well, so I don&#x27;t know why it didn&#x27;t work this time.  I&#x27;m not sure if it had expired(?) or if it just doesn&#x27;t work if you quit using it for a long time and then try again.  May sound silly, but I put it on every day for quite a while and nothing...</li>
            <li> I used this religiously!  Every night.................. It did absolutely NOTHING!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone!  It doesn&#x27;t work at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a few weeks and I can already tell that my lashes are getting thicker &amp; longers.  I am skeptical for sure....but truly they are getting thicker.  I use an eyelash curler and I can already tell that they have gotten longer because my eyelashes hit at a different (higher) spot on my eye lids.  This is amazing.  Especially considering that I have missed a few evenings.  Yeah.....I will keep buying.  So much cheaper than the prescription stuff.</li>
            <li> I love it works great for me.  Was asked yesterday I&#x27;d my lashes were real.  I told them that I use this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a yr now and it works!  A tube lasts about 3 months using it once a day. Very reasonably priced and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> really have had astonishing results with this product! You just put on top lashes before going to bed and the bottom lashes grew too!</li>
            <li> It took forever to see the results, maybe, 2 months. My lashes are longer. Nothing crazy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a generic version of Latisse. Got brown circles on my upper and lower eyelids where the product was applied. I constantly looked tired and had dryness in my eyes. Nothing like that with Rapidlash. My only complaint - you have to commit to using it for longer time than I would like to:)</li>
