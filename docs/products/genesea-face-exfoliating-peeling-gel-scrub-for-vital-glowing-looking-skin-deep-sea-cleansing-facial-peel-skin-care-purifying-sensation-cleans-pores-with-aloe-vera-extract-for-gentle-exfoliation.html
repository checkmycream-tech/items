            <li>Hey, gotta love this product.  </li>
            <li>This will be the second Genesea product that I&#x27;ve tried that I was very happy with both.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>This product is okay.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t burn, break me out OR make my face produce more oil which seems to be the problems I always encounter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Genesea product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t exfoliated in quite a while because I ran out and just never bought any more peels or exfoliator.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this peel</li>
            <li>This product did not have an overwhelming scent.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face feel refreshing.</li>
            <li>This purifying facial exfoliator is amazing!!</li>
            <li>This gel is very light and cool.</li>
            <li>It is a easy product to use, no steps 1 2 and 3, just an easy application and wash off with a cloth.</li>
            <li>this really keeps it nice and smooth!  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I opened the jar was that it smells really good, fresh, and clean.</li>
            <li>It made my face feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>I have never used a product that made my skin feel this smooth.</li>
            <li>try it, works great, smooth, creamy, fast acting and just warm towel away.  </li>
            <li>It appears Genesea has an entire product line, gonna try them all, nothing like having great skin, no one has a clue</li>
            <li>this Dead Sea Facial Peeling Gel is the best, it is great product.</li>
            <li>Afterward, my skin felt smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Bought this for me and suddenly my whole household is using it lol - very refreshing, works as intended; scoffs away dead cells and makes my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>Right after first use skin feels amazingly smoothed.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used so far!</li>
            <li>The ingredients are straightforward, nothing in there that scares me</li>
            <li>So I was excited to receive this at a discount for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I was going to give it a full week before reviewing it</li>
            <li>Am loving this product so far.  </li>
            <li>It was a mild fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few days and I am very impressed with how it really cleans my face and neck</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure this was going to do much since it is a gel and didn&#x27;t seem particularly exfoliating, but my skin really felt a lot smoother and more hydrated after using it.</li>
            <li>It is a very simple process but you get amazing quick results.</li>
            <li>Not only am i figuring out that this new face cleaner works better than any previous cleansers, it has an exceptional smell, which i appreciate because i cant stand the smell of most beauty products, as most make you feel</li>
            <li>I have combination dry and oily face and this does exactly what it says - exfoliates, hydrates, and makes my skin so silky smooth and more!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use a huge amount of the product, and it really makes my skin feel softer afterward.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The facial peeling gel exfoliates face nicely.</li>
            <li>Its amazing to see how many dead skin cells there really are!</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>face was priceless, my 14 year old was so amazed at how  much dead skin flaked off!</li>
            <li>My skin is noticeably softer, more smooth, with no breakouts or dry skin at all.</li>
            <li>skin is smoother, glowing, hydrated  and looking better and better everyday.</li>
            <li>It came super fast in the mail and was well packed to prevent damage of the container.</li>
            <li>It smells great and does th job, just hard to wash off.</li>
            <li>My pores are also smaller, and there is a more even tone to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, that was my first thought.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product!!</li>
            <li>I have finally found a product line that I absolutely love in the Genesea line.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The word &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; is scary ~ lol!  </li>
            <li>The difference between the two was very noticable!  </li>
            <li>Smaller pores, smooth and moisturized!  </li>
            <li>even after the 2nd use I love this product...</li>
            <li>The Genesea facial gel makes my skin feel so silky smooth!  </li>
            <li>and it helps to absorb the facial products better.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this product, it is a high quality one thanks to its powerful blend of  ingredients such as Aloe Vera and Chamomile along with Dead Sea  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin, and simply can&#x27;t use most skin products.</li>
            <li>you didn&#x27;t even know you had leaving you feeling fresh and new underneath.</li>
            <li>I thought it could just be a normal reaction of the gel turning more solid.</li>
            <li>have super sensitive and oily skin</li>
            <li>I am always leary to try new things on my face since I have sensitive skin with dry AND oily places that breaks out easily, but the reviews on this were favorable if you have sensitive skin, and I am SO glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been fortunate with my skin that even in the teenage years, I didn&#x27;t have a lot of breakouts</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Thanks developers.</li>
            <li>No burning or breakouts, and that was very encouraging.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see what all the fuss was about.</li>
            <li>I just discovered that this product is actually a gentle wound debrider.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to give this a try and see how it works.  </li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I also like the scent, very freshing, smells</li>
            <li>I really like the size of this jar</li>
            <li>After using this my skin felt much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>so it obviously wont last as long if you use it more often, but I still love to use it.</li>
            <li>It left my skin so soft and clean!</li>
            <li>Very unique quick beading action removing dead skin from your face and nape.  </li>
            <li>no oily face or dry stuff falling off your face is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It felt smooth going on, and right away I could feel dead skin cells coming off my skin.</li>
            <li>Well after years and years of my mother handing down face moisturizers and anti aging potions, products like meaningful beauty and Nerium AD, she recommended I try out this new Genesea Peeling Gel, as her and a couple of her close friends have been raving about it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommended this product line..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The gel felt really cool going on, was easy get off, and left my skin feeling tight and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days now and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I have to say this is the real deal, I feel like I&#x27;m seeing great results, so here i am a few days early leaving some feedback on a product that has caught my attention like no others previously.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it long enough to use it twice but love it!</li>
            <li>This leaves your skin feeling fresh, soft and looking terrific.</li>
            <li>Another big plus for me was how this cleaner delivers an extra smooth feel,</li>
            <li>Genesea Peeling is easy to use, it just takes a few seconds to use the product on your face, just rub it until the gel is absorbed and then small granules appear then clean your face with a moist cloth.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>I was nervous about trying this as I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>how old I am and I plan on keeping it that way!  </li>
            <li>Also, I have sensitive skin and psoriasis and has no negative reactions.</li>
            <li>So... I tried it on the back of one of my hands first.  </li>
            <li>I first tested this on the back of my hand.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so i am always weary trying new things, so far no issues yet.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on the skin unlike other peeling products that are very abrasive.</li>
            <li>This is another Genesea product that lives up to its name - my face feels so silky-baby smooth, tight and hydrated even more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I woke up today with my skin tight, baby soft, smooth, hydrated.</li>
            <li>and i can hardly wait for more.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve come to realize that at my age, if I want to keep being mistaken for my early 30s, I need to take care of my skin now.</li>
            <li>It truly exfoliate my skin and leaves my face soft and glowing, renewed.</li>
            <li>When I first received this Genesea Purifying Facial Exfoliator, I carefully read the directions, and decided to use it that first night.</li>
            <li>I also can be sensitive to some smells, and this gives me no problems at all.  </li>
            <li>and it was really soft</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my skin and my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>I like all the Genesea products that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>I want to keep a clear complexion naturally.</li>
            <li>When I first tested this peeling gel, it did the exact same thing as the other peeling gel.</li>
            <li>It has a very slight scent, but not annoying at all.</li>
            <li>I will definitely keep using this Genesea Purifying Facial Exfoliator, and highly recommend it, even for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical at first because I thought that a simple gel could not be a good peeling and it wouldn&#x27;t  do anything on my skin</li>
            <li>Not harsh like some facial peels.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft since starting the peeling gel followed by the night moisturizer.....</li>
            <li>My face feels really soft after I use this and then wash with my regular cleanser.</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised that it is different from what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>My pores had gotten smaller and my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Left it baby soft.</li>
            <li>My main problem is that I have a very dry chin and neckline....</li>
            <li>I have always been leary about trying new face products due to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This is way better than the peels I had in the past where I had to sit there for a long time, wait for it to dry, and then peel it off my face.  </li>
            <li>I love how it removes all the dead skin with very little effort.</li>
            <li>or so does the job for my 64 year old dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This product works wonders on my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have never used any type of exfoliate like this that DID NOT dry out my face and leave red blotches on my skin.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Bought this for me and suddenly my whole household is using it lol - very refreshing, works as intended; scoffs away dead cells and makes my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> Right after first use skin feels amazingly smoothed.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used so far!</li>
            <li> The ingredients are straightforward, nothing in there that scares me</li>
            <li> So I was excited to receive this at a discount for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I was going to give it a full week before reviewing it</li>
            <li> Am loving this product so far.  </li>
            <li> It was a mild fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few days and I am very impressed with how it really cleans my face and neck</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure this was going to do much since it is a gel and didn&#x27;t seem particularly exfoliating, but my skin really felt a lot smoother and more hydrated after using it.</li>
            <li> It is a very simple process but you get amazing quick results.</li>
            <li> Not only am i figuring out that this new face cleaner works better than any previous cleansers, it has an exceptional smell, which i appreciate because i cant stand the smell of most beauty products, as most make you feel</li>
            <li> I have combination dry and oily face and this does exactly what it says - exfoliates, hydrates, and makes my skin so silky smooth and more!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use a huge amount of the product, and it really makes my skin feel softer afterward.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The facial peeling gel exfoliates face nicely.</li>
            <li> Its amazing to see how many dead skin cells there really are!</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> face was priceless, my 14 year old was so amazed at how  much dead skin flaked off!</li>
            <li> My skin is noticeably softer, more smooth, with no breakouts or dry skin at all.</li>
            <li> skin is smoother, glowing, hydrated  and looking better and better everyday.</li>
            <li> It came super fast in the mail and was well packed to prevent damage of the container.</li>
            <li> It smells great and does th job, just hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> My pores are also smaller, and there is a more even tone to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , that was my first thought.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product!!</li>
            <li> I have finally found a product line that I absolutely love in the Genesea line.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The word &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; is scary ~ lol!  </li>
            <li> The difference between the two was very noticable!  </li>
            <li> Smaller pores, smooth and moisturized!  </li>
            <li> even after the 2nd use I love this product...</li>
            <li> The Genesea facial gel makes my skin feel so silky smooth!  </li>
            <li> and it helps to absorb the facial products better.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this product, it is a high quality one thanks to its powerful blend of  ingredients such as Aloe Vera and Chamomile along with Dead Sea  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, and simply can&#x27;t use most skin products.</li>
            <li> you didn&#x27;t even know you had leaving you feeling fresh and new underneath.</li>
            <li> I thought it could just be a normal reaction of the gel turning more solid.</li>
            <li> have super sensitive and oily skin</li>
            <li> I am always leary to try new things on my face since I have sensitive skin with dry AND oily places that breaks out easily, but the reviews on this were favorable if you have sensitive skin, and I am SO glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fortunate with my skin that even in the teenage years, I didn&#x27;t have a lot of breakouts</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Thanks developers.</li>
            <li> No burning or breakouts, and that was very encouraging.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see what all the fuss was about.</li>
            <li> I just discovered that this product is actually a gentle wound debrider.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to give this a try and see how it works.  </li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I also like the scent, very freshing, smells</li>
            <li> I really like the size of this jar</li>
            <li> After using this my skin felt much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> so it obviously wont last as long if you use it more often, but I still love to use it.</li>
            <li> It left my skin so soft and clean!</li>
            <li> Very unique quick beading action removing dead skin from your face and nape.  </li>
            <li> no oily face or dry stuff falling off your face is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It felt smooth going on, and right away I could feel dead skin cells coming off my skin.</li>
            <li> Well after years and years of my mother handing down face moisturizers and anti aging potions, products like meaningful beauty and Nerium AD, she recommended I try out this new Genesea Peeling Gel, as her and a couple of her close friends have been raving about it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommended this product line..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The gel felt really cool going on, was easy get off, and left my skin feeling tight and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days now and LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is the real deal, I feel like I&#x27;m seeing great results, so here i am a few days early leaving some feedback on a product that has caught my attention like no others previously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it long enough to use it twice but love it!</li>
            <li> This leaves your skin feeling fresh, soft and looking terrific.</li>
            <li> Another big plus for me was how this cleaner delivers an extra smooth feel,</li>
            <li> Genesea Peeling is easy to use, it just takes a few seconds to use the product on your face, just rub it until the gel is absorbed and then small granules appear then clean your face with a moist cloth.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about trying this as I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> how old I am and I plan on keeping it that way!  </li>
            <li> Also, I have sensitive skin and psoriasis and has no negative reactions.</li>
            <li> So... I tried it on the back of one of my hands first.  </li>
            <li> I first tested this on the back of my hand.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so i am always weary trying new things, so far no issues yet.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle on the skin unlike other peeling products that are very abrasive.</li>
            <li> This is another Genesea product that lives up to its name - my face feels so silky-baby smooth, tight and hydrated even more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I woke up today with my skin tight, baby soft, smooth, hydrated.</li>
            <li> and i can hardly wait for more.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve come to realize that at my age, if I want to keep being mistaken for my early 30s, I need to take care of my skin now.</li>
            <li> It truly exfoliate my skin and leaves my face soft and glowing, renewed.</li>
            <li> When I first received this Genesea Purifying Facial Exfoliator, I carefully read the directions, and decided to use it that first night.</li>
            <li> I also can be sensitive to some smells, and this gives me no problems at all.  </li>
            <li> and it was really soft</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my skin and my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I like all the Genesea products that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I want to keep a clear complexion naturally.</li>
            <li> When I first tested this peeling gel, it did the exact same thing as the other peeling gel.</li>
            <li> It has a very slight scent, but not annoying at all.</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep using this Genesea Purifying Facial Exfoliator, and highly recommend it, even for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because I thought that a simple gel could not be a good peeling and it wouldn&#x27;t  do anything on my skin</li>
            <li> Not harsh like some facial peels.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft since starting the peeling gel followed by the night moisturizer.....</li>
            <li> My face feels really soft after I use this and then wash with my regular cleanser.</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised that it is different from what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> My pores had gotten smaller and my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Left it baby soft.</li>
            <li> My main problem is that I have a very dry chin and neckline....</li>
            <li> I have always been leary about trying new face products due to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This is way better than the peels I had in the past where I had to sit there for a long time, wait for it to dry, and then peel it off my face.  </li>
            <li> I love how it removes all the dead skin with very little effort.</li>
            <li> or so does the job for my 64 year old dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This product works wonders on my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have never used any type of exfoliate like this that DID NOT dry out my face and leave red blotches on my skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin has always been sensitive and this has proven to be a product that I can use and not worry about dried out skin or red blotches.</li>
            <li> , it arrived larger then expected.</li>
            <li> I thought this was one of those peels that you leave on for 10 minutes and let it dry</li>
            <li> There were a lot fewer clumps on the second run, so this convinced me that it actually is removing dead skin</li>
            <li> Apparently, it is called a peel because as you are messaging this into your skin, chunks of dead skin cells come off.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so this will last a while.</li>
            <li> and theres still a little bit left.</li>
            <li> I only use it every couple of weeks (when I feel like I have time to pamper myself a little bit)</li>
            <li> This gets the gunk off my face but does cause it to be a little red thereafter.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different skin care lines and products....inexpensive to very expensive!  </li>
            <li> I trust it works on other skin areas for those that  may have skin issues in other areas of their body ...</li>
            <li> I hope this review was helpful to other males out there like myself who use anti aging, cleansing, and moisturizing products on their face.</li>
            <li> In fact, it took me longer time to wash off than my other exfoliating products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a bit skeptical after the first use, seeing all the supposed dead skin cells clump up.</li>
            <li> All of a sudden there was small bits of dead skin cells coming off of my hand.</li>
            <li> I have acne scars from my youth, and they seem to be less noticable.</li>
            <li> I applied about half a teaspoon and rubbed it into my skin in circular motion.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even take a lot of the gel to pick up the dead skin.</li>
            <li> An added plus, it can be used where dead skin needs to be removed.</li>
            <li> and then I dried my face.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much dead skin was peeling off.  </li>
            <li> The dead skin cells reminds me of when I have elmer&#x27;s glue stuck on my fingers then when I rub my fingers together the glue rolls up and falls off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason that I gave it 4 star is because it is not easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much dead skin it took off!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to see the difference after a month.</li>
            <li> - my skin is healthier, glowing and no longer dried out looking or feeling!</li>
            <li> I usually use ZO Skin Health products and tried Genesea</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to keep using this one instead of the ones I used in the past.</li>
            <li> No more blackheads</li>
            <li> However, I was wrong</li>
            <li> I will admit, I was skeptical.</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing! I couldn&#x27;t believe how much dead skin it took off! It made my face feel so smooth. I have never used a product that made my skin feel this smooth. It doesn&#x27;t even take a lot of the gel to pick up the dead skin. So the container will last for quite a while! Love it! You have a customer for life!</li>
            <li> As a male, I was leery about buying facial products. But I finally gave in and took the plunge. After a week of using the product, my skin seems tighter and more even. I have acne scars from my youth, and they seem to be less noticable. My pores are also smaller, and there is a more even tone to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptical after the first use, seeing all the supposed dead skin cells clump up. I thought it could just be a normal reaction of the gel turning more solid. So I tried another application immediately after. There were a lot fewer clumps on the second run, so this convinced me that it actually is removing dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love Genesea products!!! I have been using for about a week now and you can already see the difference in my skin. It smells so good, and isn&#x27;t over powering. I have very sensitive skin, so i am always weary trying new things, so far no issues yet. You only have to use it twice a week, and that works perfect for me. It is a easy product to use, no steps 1 2 and 3, just an easy application and wash off with a cloth. You can actually see this product working. I have become a Genesea product user for life.</li>
            <li> I have tried similar products but I think that I&#x27;ve found &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve been fortunate with my skin that even in the teenage years, I didn&#x27;t have a lot of breakouts but I&#x27;ve come to realize that at my age, if I want to keep being mistaken for my early 30s, I need to take care of my skin now. This leaves your skin feeling fresh, soft and looking terrific. I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is another Genesea product that lives up to its name - my face feels so silky-baby smooth, tight and hydrated even more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Genesea Purifying Facial Exfoliator for a couple of days now. This is the best facial exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used so far! I have combination dry and oily face and this does exactly what it says - exfoliates, hydrates, and makes my skin so silky smooth and more! I am now using this with the Genesea Night Cream and it&#x27;s even more effective. I woke up today with my skin tight, baby soft, smooth, hydrated. I can&#x27;t wait to see more effective results on my skin! I highly recommend this specially if you are looking for the best skin regimen. I finally found mine!</li>
            <li> Hey, gotta love this product.  Does exactly what it says it will, my skin feels great.  Very unique quick beading action removing dead skin from your face and nape.  I trust it works on other skin areas for those that  may have skin issues in other areas of their body ... try it, works great, smooth, creamy, fast acting and just warm towel away.  It appears Genesea has an entire product line, gonna try them all, nothing like having great skin, no one has a clue how old I am and I plan on keeping it that way!  Thanks developers.</li>
            <li> Edited to add: I&#x27;ve had this jar for almost 6 months now and theres still a little bit left. I only use it every couple of weeks (when I feel like I have time to pamper myself a little bit) so it obviously wont last as long if you use it more often, but I still love to use it. It still makes my skin feel great.   I wasn&#x27;t too sure this was going to do much since it is a gel and didn&#x27;t seem particularly exfoliating, but my skin really felt a lot smoother and more hydrated after using it. The gel felt really cool going on, was easy get off, and left my skin feeling tight and moisturized. I am always leary to try new things on my face since I have sensitive skin with dry AND oily places that breaks out easily, but the reviews on this were favorable if you have sensitive skin, and I am SO glad I tried it. This will be the second Genesea product that I&#x27;ve tried that I was very happy with both. Definitely worth the cost. A little goes a long way so this will last a while.</li>
            <li> Well after years and years of my mother handing down face moisturizers and anti aging potions, products like meaningful beauty and Nerium AD, she recommended I try out this new Genesea Peeling Gel, as her and a couple of her close friends have been raving about it. I was going to give it a full week before reviewing it but something told me to come share my results today, After only using it for 4 days. I have to say this is the real deal, I feel like I&#x27;m seeing great results, so here i am a few days early leaving some feedback on a product that has caught my attention like no others previously. Not only am i figuring out that this new face cleaner works better than any previous cleansers, it has an exceptional smell, which i appreciate because i cant stand the smell of most beauty products, as most make you feel that your in the processing plant where they make the stuff. Another big plus for me was how this cleaner delivers an extra smooth feel, no oily face or dry stuff falling off your face is a huge bonus. I&#x27;m anxious to see the difference after a month. I hope this review was helpful to other males out there like myself who use anti aging, cleansing, and moisturizing products on their face. Genesea for life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found once a week or so does the job for my 64 year old dry skin.  I use the Boto Anti Wrinkle Cream during the day and the Regenerating Cream at night and have noticed a difference in just one month - my skin is healthier, glowing and no longer dried out looking or feeling!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I was a little skeptical at first because I thought that a simple gel could not be a good peeling and it wouldn&#x27;t  do anything on my skin, that was my first thought. However, I was wrong this Dead Sea Facial Peeling Gel is the best, it is great product. This product works wonders on my dry sensitive skin. It truly exfoliate my skin and leaves my face soft and glowing, renewed. It is very gentle on the skin unlike other peeling products that are very abrasive. Genesea Peeling is easy to use, it just takes a few seconds to use the product on your face, just rub it until the gel is absorbed and then small granules appear then clean your face with a moist cloth. It is a very simple process but you get amazing quick results. I am very impressed with this product, it is a high quality one thanks to its powerful blend of  ingredients such as Aloe Vera and Chamomile along with Dead Sea  minerals.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is smoother, glowing, hydrated  and looking better and better everyday. This is one of my favorite products right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these at a discount in exchange for unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Good exfoliator without the chemical tightness of most products. Mine started beading almost immediately. Afterward, my skin felt smooth and refreshed. Want to try the rest of this line!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Right after first use skin feels amazingly smoothed. Not harsh like some facial peels. I know what I&#x27;ll be giving out for Christmas this year.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel AMAZING! It&#x27;s lightweight and simple to use. I would highly recommend this product as a great addition to anyone&#x27;s skin care regimen!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful...it gently rolls away dead skin you didn&#x27;t even know you had leaving you feeling fresh and new underneath. I absolutely love it</li>
            <li> I will admit, I was skeptical. I have super sensitive skin, and simply can&#x27;t use most skin products. When I first received this Genesea Purifying Facial Exfoliator, I carefully read the directions, and decided to use it that first night. It felt smooth going on, and right away I could feel dead skin cells coming off my skin. No burning or breakouts, and that was very encouraging. I&#x27;ve used this exfoliator twice a week for a couple of weeks now, and I&#x27;m very impressed with the results. My skin is noticeably softer, more smooth, with no breakouts or dry skin at all. It has a very slight scent, but not annoying at all. I will definitely keep using this Genesea Purifying Facial Exfoliator, and highly recommend it, even for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Am loving this product so far.  I don&#x27;t have to use a huge amount of the product, and it really makes my skin feel softer afterward.  I love how it removes all the dead skin with very little effort. I also can be sensitive to some smells, and this gives me no problems at all.  I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This product is okay. I really don&#x27;t see what all the fuss was about. It works okay but nothing to brag about. I usually use ZO Skin Health products and tried Genesea and when I run out I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days now and LOVE it. The 1st time I used it I applied it on generously and sat there chit chatting with my kids 14,12 and 4 and as the time was up and I started rubbing it off the look on my kids face was priceless, my 14 year old was so amazed at how  much dead skin flaked off! she asked to use it, of course I let her test it out on her hand and I am now hooked on this product! It left my skin so soft and clean! I was so amazed at the drastic difference from only one use.&lt;br /&gt;I have super sensitive and oily skin and it didn&#x27;t burn, break me out OR make my face produce more oil which seems to be the problems I always encounter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received this product at a reduced rate to review and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I love Genesea product. This is the third product i have ordered from Genesea and i can hardly wait for more. This purifying facial exfoliator is amazing!! 5 stars*****. It has made a difference in the week i have been using it and it feels great. Highly recommended product!!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different skin care lines and products....inexpensive to very expensive!  I have finally found a product line that I absolutely love in the Genesea line.  My skin feels so soft since starting the peeling gel followed by the night moisturizer.....I would highly recommended this product line..you will notice the difference almost immediately!</li>
            <li> I just discovered that this product is actually a gentle wound debrider. An added plus, it can be used where dead skin needs to be removed.</li>
            <li> My face feels really soft after I use this and then wash with my regular cleanser. I&#x27;ve only had it long enough to use it twice but love it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t exfoliated in quite a while because I ran out and just never bought any more peels or exfoliator. I really wanted to give this a try and see how it works.  It came super fast in the mail and was well packed to prevent damage of the container. The first thing I noticed when I opened the jar was that it smells really good, fresh, and clean. I thought this was one of those peels that you leave on for 10 minutes and let it dry but I was pleasantly surprised that it is different from what I was expecting.  Basically, you wash your face and then I dried my face.  I got a generous amount and messaged it into my face, neck and chest per the instructions. Apparently, it is called a peel because as you are messaging this into your skin, chunks of dead skin cells come off.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how much dead skin was peeling off.  After I finished, I rinsed my face well and it was really soft and then I moisturized and my face felt so nice. My pores had gotten smaller and my skin so soft. This is way better than the peels I had in the past where I had to sit there for a long time, wait for it to dry, and then peel it off my face.  I am really pleased with this peel and I&#x27;m going to keep using this one instead of the ones I used in the past. Also, I have sensitive skin and psoriasis and has no negative reactions. The ingredients are straightforward, nothing in there that scares me and like I said, it smells great. Good quality and an excellent product. I really like this and it would make a nice gift as well.</li>
            <li> Its amazing to see how many dead skin cells there really are! I just put this on and in a couple minutes my entire face sheds the dead cells leaving me feeling so much cleaner</li>
            <li> absolutely amazing! Makes my skin feel wonderful!</li>
            <li> Bought this for me and suddenly my whole household is using it lol - very refreshing, works as intended; scoffs away dead cells and makes my skin very smooth. Definitely worth the buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to exfoliate. Did not irritate skin at all. Left it baby soft. Shipped fast. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is another great product from Genesea.  I have only used it a couple of times but I can already see a difference in my skin. It moisturizes my skin and my skin feels so soft. I can&#x27;t wait to see my results after using it for longer.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Leaves my skin feeling very soft. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This gets the gunk off my face but does cause it to be a little red thereafter. I like all the Genesea products that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I have always been leary about trying new face products due to my sensitive skin.  I thought I would try this facial exfoliator to see if it would work on me.  Boy was I impressed!!  I have never used any type of exfoliate like this that DID NOT dry out my face and leave red blotches on my skin.  My skin has always been sensitive and this has proven to be a product that I can use and not worry about dried out skin or red blotches.</li>
            <li> This product did not have an overwhelming scent.  It was a mild fragrance.  It left my skin feeling soft and smooth.  I also used it on my hands and got the same result.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about trying this as I have very sensitive skin.  The word &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; is scary ~ lol!  So... I tried it on the back of one of my hands first.  The difference between the two was very noticable!  Smaller pores, smooth and moisturized!  So, I used it that evening before bed.  It was great!  I waited to review until I used twice... even after the 2nd use I love this product... and it smells great too!</li>
            <li> The Genesea facial gel makes my skin feel so silky smooth!  My main problem is that I have a very dry chin and neckline....this really keeps it nice and smooth!  After it dries for a minute, take the time to massage it in well, and your skin will love you for it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few days and I am very impressed with how it really cleans my face and neck area.&lt;br /&gt;I have never worn makeup, so a product like this is perfect ...I want to keep a clear complexion naturally. It goes on very smoothly and beads up softly.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is beautiful, too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It makes my face feel refreshing. It smells good an is great.</li>
            <li> The facial peeling gel exfoliates face nicely. I hav used it couple times (about a week) now. Each time, I can feel that my skin i very smooth after use. No more blackheads and it helps to absorb the facial products better. I also like the scent, very freshing, smells great.&lt;br /&gt;The reason that I gave it 4 star is because it is not easy to wash off. In fact, it took me longer time to wash off than my other exfoliating products.&lt;br /&gt;I got it at diacount in exchange for an honest review. It smells great and does th job, just hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> I really like the size of this jar, it arrived larger then expected. There was a kiosk at my local mall and they were selling something similar in a smaller jar for almost double the listing price of this gel. So I was excited to receive this at a discount for testing purposes. When I first tested this peeling gel, it did the exact same thing as the other peeling gel. This gel is very light and cool. I first tested this on the back of my hand. I applied about half a teaspoon and rubbed it into my skin in circular motion. All of a sudden there was small bits of dead skin cells coming off of my hand. I recommend doing this over a trash bin since it will be falling off. The dead skin cells reminds me of when I have elmer&#x27;s glue stuck on my fingers then when I rub my fingers together the glue rolls up and falls off. It looks exactly the same. This gel  also has a nice light scent to it, it smells really good. After using this my skin felt much softer and smoother. I recommend doing one area of your face at a time so you&#x27;re not rushing.</li>
