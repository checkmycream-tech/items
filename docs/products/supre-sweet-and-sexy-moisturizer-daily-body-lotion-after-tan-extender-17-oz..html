            <li>Also has a nice light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Love the tanning lotion and decided to try the after tanning lotion, really love it.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>Otherwise love it.</li>
            <li>Very sweet</li>
            <li>The Supre Sweet &amp; Sexy Line is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It also moisturizers my skin great and leaves it soft for a while.</li>
            <li>Sweet!</li>
            <li>I used Sweet and Sexy tanning lotion and loved the scent so much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent isn&#x27;t overly sweet - it&#x27;s a very light scent.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, I love this moisturizer sooo much.</li>
            <li>Would NOT recommend this product to anyone who loves the smell of sweet and sexy body wash or who likes a thicker type of lotion.</li>
            <li>This smells sweet like pink sugar and the pump is the best.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted :)</li>
            <li>a light but sweet scent.</li>
            <li>Not even close to being a full bottle.</li>
            <li>Also does good as facial moisturizer</li>
            <li>Loved it only not giving it 5 stars because I wish it was organic</li>
            <li>I use Sweet &amp; Sexy 20x Black Bronzer and the Sweet &amp; Sexy Leg bronzer as well.</li>
            <li>Love the sweet pink sugar smell, velvety smooth as silk feel and</li>
            <li>The pump on this did not work right</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft without becoming oily at all.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and leaves your skin feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li>and it did not have the same type of texture that most lotion tend to have.</li>
            <li>Regular drug store lotion is better</li>
            <li>The price is good but not for a half a bottle!</li>
            <li>Nice addition to my other tanning products collection.</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft and I have .</li>
            <li>For night time I use L&#x27;Occitane pure Shea butter (which has no scent), followed by this lotion.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t moisterize as much as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>; Plus it goes on very watery...</li>
            <li>The lotion didn&#x27;t smell as good as I had expected reading other reviews but other than that works well still need to apply more than one a day for tanning skin .</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend.</li>
            <li>Smells great, only negative I would say is that it doesn&#x27;t really leave your skin feeling all that soft afterwards, but it does moisturize, just doesn&#x27;t have the effect I would like.</li>
            <li>This smells so similar to Pink Sugar and they compliment each other beautifully.</li>
            <li>Not a very thick lotion.  </li>
            <li>Not oily but smooth going and helps to keep my tan a little longer after the beach.</li>
            <li>My 14 yr old daughter also likes it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product especially to those who tan.</li>
            <li>Not only is this super moisturizing and silky, it smells just like the Pink Sugar perfume.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure I got the genuine product.</li>
            <li>I have a very hard time  finding perfumes that last on me so for this lotion to do it alone is amazing.</li>
            <li>The bottle is large &amp; it&#x27;s not very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not the lotion I remember when it came out, this bottle I recd didn&#x27;t really smell like pink sugar like I remember and this bottle was watery, used it</li>
            <li>The bottle came broken in the top.</li>
            <li>A major bonus, especially for summer.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use it in the winter, only because it isn&#x27;t thick enough for Michigan winters.</li>
            <li> If you like Pink Sugar cologne don&#x27;t wait order this lotion today!</li>
            <li> I also got the shower gel and will be trying other items in this line!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and notice my tan lasts a lot longer than if I didn&#x27;t use a moisturizer at all.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand heavy lotions.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s not easy to please</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super thick, it&#x27;s not sticky, and it smells</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it the scent is for me.</li>
            <li> and I am not sure if it is or not.</li>
            <li> The smell is not over powering either and lasts at least 6-8 hours.</li>
            <li> * Smells just like the tanning lotion, which is subtle and sweet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this lotion is not too thick but not too thin.  </li>
            <li> Broken in package.</li>
            <li> I broke out in red bumps and a terribly itchy rash.</li>
            <li> BUT I am extremely disappointed that when I received it today the bottle was in a sealed bag</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed that I can&#x27;t use it unless I stick it in some plastic Tupperware.</li>
            <li> This product was very disappointing!</li>

            <li> Good buy.  Smoothes skin and keeps my tan healthy!!  Also smells great.</li>
            <li> The lotion didn&#x27;t smell as good as I had expected reading other reviews but other than that works well still need to apply more than one a day for tanning skin .</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, I love this moisturizer sooo much. The Supre Sweet &amp; Sexy Line is my favorite. Amazing.</li>
            <li> Any lotion is as good.</li>
            <li> The smell is awesome! This smell will last almost 10 hours and this lotion makes your skin feel like silk!</li>
            <li> Love the lotion. The fragrance is nice.  Not oily but smooth going and helps to keep my tan a little longer after the beach.</li>
            <li> The bottle came broken in the top. Lotion very strong I&#x27;m not sure it the scent is for me. I did take a risk buying this without trying it. The order was delivered in two days</li>
            <li> The pump on this did not work right and it did not have the same type of texture that most lotion tend to have.</li>
            <li> If you like Pink Sugar cologne don&#x27;t wait order this lotion today! This smells so similar to Pink Sugar and they compliment each other beautifully. I&#x27;ve been tanning outdoors this summer and trying many lotions to hydrate my skin. This lotion is hydrating, makes me a bit shiny and the smell lasts for hours. I have a very hard time  finding perfumes that last on me so for this lotion to do it alone is amazing. The best part is this lotion is paraben and gluten free, I&#x27;m allergic to both. I also got the shower gel and will be trying other items in this line!</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of this lotion, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t use it. I broke out in red bumps and a terribly itchy rash.</li>
            <li> The Sweet &amp; Sexy Moisturizer smells great. It&#x27;s long lasting and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I use it everyday and notice my tan lasts a lot longer than if I didn&#x27;t use a moisturizer at all. I&#x27;m sure most moisturizers would work but I like to use the same brand of products. I use Sweet &amp; Sexy 20x Black Bronzer and the Sweet &amp; Sexy Leg bronzer as well.</li>
            <li> Love the sweet pink sugar smell, velvety smooth as silk feel and it last all day!!!</li>
            <li> I really love the scent and consistency of this lotion.  Extends tan nicely. Will order again for sure.  Great product.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft without becoming oily at all. The smell is divine, I have received so many compliments on the lovely aroma. My skin even smells lovely throughout the day. Highly reccomend.</li>
            <li> These cream smells great. Feel nice and silky in the skin. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> You will love this lotion! I think another reviewer mentioned this. Not only is this super moisturizing and silky, it smells just like the Pink Sugar perfume. Sweet!</li>
            <li> I used Sweet and Sexy tanning lotion and loved the scent so much. Upon looking for the tanning lotion online I came across this lotion and had to have it.  The scent is amazing, just like candy almost exact to the perfume &amp;#34;Pink Sugar&amp;#34; it accompanies it wonderfully. It also moisturizers my skin great and leaves it soft for a while.</li>
            <li> Not the lotion I remember when it came out, this bottle I recd didn&#x27;t really smell like pink sugar like I remember and this bottle was watery, used it and it didn&#x27;t feel like a lotion, idk, it felt oily but watery at the same time. Like it went on the skin but made my skin feel like it had a slimmy film on it.</li>
            <li> Smells great, only negative I would say is that it doesn&#x27;t really leave your skin feeling all that soft afterwards, but it does moisturize, just doesn&#x27;t have the effect I would like.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell as good as I had hoped.  Not a very thick lotion.  Really didn&#x27;t moisterize as much as I had hoped.  Also didn&#x27;t come sealed so I&#x27;m not sure I got the genuine product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted :) just like what beach bum sells but way cheaper! I would deff buy again. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> This smells sweet like pink sugar and the pump is the best. This smells so good and leaves your skin smooth with no geasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Product smells nice and is a nice lotion, but I bought it with the intentions of it being a tan extender and nothing on the bottle says anything about it being a tan extender and I am not sure if it is or not.</li>
            <li> Very sweet but I like it!</li>
            <li> * Smells just like the tanning lotion, which is subtle and sweet.&lt;br /&gt;* NOT sticky! A major bonus, especially for summer. I can&#x27;t stand heavy lotions.</li>
            <li> Smells good but watery. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again. Regular drug store lotion is better</li>
            <li> This product was very disappointing! The body wash smells SOOO good and yummy but this lotion did not at all. It had a similar smell but nothing that made you say &amp;#34;wow this smells great!&amp;#34; Plus it goes on very watery... Would NOT recommend this product to anyone who loves the smell of sweet and sexy body wash or who likes a thicker type of lotion.</li>
            <li> I have used this a few weeks now and it is awesome, smells great leaves me moistrized but not slimy.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is super moisturizing. The texture of the lotion is good too, not too thick or too thin.</li>
            <li> this lotion is not too thick but not too thin.  It goes on smoothly and leaves your skin feeling very soft.  It smells like sugar.  a light but sweet scent.</li>
            <li> I love this product it&#x27;s my favorite BUT I am extremely disappointed that when I received it today the bottle was in a sealed bag but the top was busted and lotion was oozing everywhere. Not even close to being a full bottle. The price is good but not for a half a bottle!</li>
            <li> Great smell and really moisturizers. I highly recommend this product especially to those who tan. Also does good as facial moisturizer</li>
            <li> I went through two bottles of this lotion last summer. It&#x27;s a nice, light weight lotion that moisturizes quite well. It&#x27;s not super thick, it&#x27;s not sticky, and it smells incredible!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The scent isn&#x27;t overly sweet - it&#x27;s a very light scent. I get many compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;I tan during the summer, and use Babor after sun lotion after tanning. For night time I use L&#x27;Occitane pure Shea butter (which has no scent), followed by this lotion. And I use this lotion alone in the morning. My skin is super soft and I have . The bottle is large &amp; it&#x27;s not very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it in the winter, only because it isn&#x27;t thick enough for Michigan winters.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells so good and is so smooth!! This lotion is not greasy AT ALL. The smell is not over powering either and lasts at least 6-8 hours. Glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> Awesome. Smells like cotten candy</li>
            <li> Great smell, great feel! Not greasy! Would recommend to others.  Products does what is says it will do for users.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. It absorbs and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky. Also has a nice light fragrance.  My 14 yr old daughter also likes it and she&#x27;s not easy to please</li>
            <li> Love the tanning lotion and decided to try the after tanning lotion, really love it. Smells great and is light weight (not greasy feeling). Also like that it has skin firming/toning qualities.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion it smells good and it moisturises my skin quite well.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and lasts. I use it every day, not just after tanning. Love.</li>
            <li> Bought this product to go along with the tanning lotion. Nice addition to my other tanning products collection.</li>
            <li> Broken in package. Otherwise love it. Kinda disappointed that I can&#x27;t use it unless I stick it in some plastic Tupperware. Tacky.</li>
            <li> Loved it only not giving it 5 stars because I wish it was organic</li>
