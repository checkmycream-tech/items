            <li>Very nice box with all the items.</li>
            <li>I feel like I received a great product at a great price with very rapid service</li>
            <li>The men in my life loved the gift box and the young men loved the stand alone.</li>
            <li>Price is  sometimes better than in the stores.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite colognes.</li>
            <li>I have used Drakkar for years works with my body chemistry love it.</li>
            <li>Great overall</li>
            <li>However Amazon made it right with me!</li>
            <li>Was quick to get here and the price was right.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it has a distinct smell and one of the perfumes that got me started as a kid and still a fan.</li>
            <li>A traditional favorite.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect gift set and one of the fragrances you can never go wrong with.</li>
            <li>xa great way to get my favorite (albeit expensive) scent a little more economically</li>
            <li>then, you are in luck; stink to high heaven like a set of Z Cavaricci pants, discarded from the Eighties, My Man.</li>
            <li>Sometimes this is hard to find in the stores so it is  nice to know we have another alternative in Amazon.</li>
            <li>It was what I expected and arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>and you really have to use your imagination to believe it&#x27;s the same sent...</li>
            <li>The chicks dig the old school smell from the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
    </ol>
