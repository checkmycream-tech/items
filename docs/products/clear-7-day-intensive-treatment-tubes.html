    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with this product or</li>
            <li>and I was impressed, but</li>
            <li>and it may be best to break the treatment package up into two and maybe use them once a month.</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>It always makes me happy when I swish my hair</li>
            <li>My mom&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great temporary fix</li>
            <li>Great for traveling.</li>
            <li>This has worked out very nice.</li>
            <li>what did you use your hair looks amazing !</li>
            <li>Was it successful?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pleasantly scented but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The conditioner itself had a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have highlights/lowlights color treatment done to my hair every 2-3 months and thought this would be a good product to help minimize the damage that coloring does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel it did a good job.  </li>
            <li>I really loved this conditioning treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love this fragrance and its reminding me of a perfume I wore yrs ( decades!)</li>
            <li>It was nice and had no chemical smell.</li>
            <li>and I liked them</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The first 3 days my hair felt great</li>
            <li>My hair looked and felt better and healthier after just 1 tube.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>From not being able to comb my hair to so silky everyone at work was like</li>
            <li>if nothing else, that&#x27;s how much I love it.</li>
            <li>I can confidently say that guys like me can also benefit from this product.</li>
            <li>One thing though, I really really love the scent.</li>
            <li>so might help keep her hair healthy.  </li>
            <li>She used the box of tubes a month or so ago and her comment is the title of my review, \\&quot;ok, but</li>
            <li>My hair has felt better since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>This product really does work and it smells great , I started using the conditioner.</li>
            <li>what remains of my blond overprocessed hair does have a richer tone, it doesn&#x27;t feel like straw any more, and has stopped breaking off.</li>
            <li>when days 4, 5, 6 and 7 came I noticed my hair feeling more and more oily.</li>
            <li>and I need more then something for seven days.</li>
            <li>hair is subjected to dyes and heat and more dyes and more heat.</li>
            <li>She fell in love with the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because there are better options.</li>
            <li>While the vials are convenient for transport, I think supplying this in a full sized bottle would be more convenient and cost effective.</li>
            <li>I love products that have a strong smell that is pleasing to the nose.</li>
            <li>which is good because some similar products do.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the not so good.</li>
            <li>I have found this the easiest way to keep it from drying out and becoming frizzy.  </li>
            <li>One you get the cap of the vial off, it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a decent conditioner although I can&#x27;t say it is superior to others on the market.</li>
            <li>It smells good and she highly recommends it and uses it all the time now.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and is easy to overcondition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it was pretty effective in taming the frizz and making my hair silkier</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hands down, it&#x27;s THE best product out there for the price!!!!</li>
            <li>.. fine wavy curly hair&lt;</li>
            <li>and I get a huge whiff of the product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in shine.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say I saw a HUGE improvement in my hair over the 7 days.  </li>
            <li>I thought these would be great to try out for some extra treatment with summer and pools/sun coming up soon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but some women prefer not to havea strong scent in their hair.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to repair the damage of age and hair dye.</li>
            <li>Ok i tried this product exactly the way</li>
            <li>What was the original color again?</li>
            <li>Not the best deep conditioning treatment but better than regular conditioners that say &amp;</li>
            <li>It rinses cleanly.</li>
            <li>and I still love how well this brand works with my hair, how soft and touchable my hair feels and how healthy it looks.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use a special shampoo, just used this treatment instead of conditioner (with longer waiting time).  </li>
            <li>Maybe good for travel emergencies but not for regular use.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the end of be all of conditioners, but it&#x27;s good enough to merit giving it a shot.</li>
            <li>Because I wanted to test this product the way it was recommended, I changed up that routine and shampooed every day and then followed up with the treatment for the full 7 days.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is not a bad product</li>
            <li>This stuffs not bad.</li>
            <li>asked for more because 3 words typically doesn&#x27;t make a good review, she added.</li>
            <li>not bad though for a temporary quick fix.</li>
            <li>I love clear products !!</li>
            <li>I will have to say this conditions my hair better than normal conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have long bleached/colored hair and always looking for a good mask.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and an oily scalp, and my hair is rather sensitive.  </li>
            <li>It was soft, shiny, the ends were strong and smooth.</li>
            <li>naturally curly, mid-back length, color treated hair; so keeping it moisturized is very important.</li>
            <li>this product was i guess just too much for my fine</li>
            <li>It certainly works well for damage repair though, and if your hair is in need of such a treatment, this would be an excellent product to try, as it&#x27;s not overly expensive and seems to have a great combination of ingredients to promote healthier hair.</li>
            <li>I had started using the Clear shampoo and Clear conditioner and love the silky smooth feeling of my hair and the shine!</li>
            <li>There is no harsh chemical smells which I love.</li>
            <li>It also gave my hair a nice sheen that regular conditioner does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first fell in love with the Clear brand when I got two bottles in a subscription box that I get (oh how addicting are they!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is not the right product</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny but it looks greasy even right after washing it, while it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy</li>
            <li>/&gt;She saw this product on a few store shelves, but never tried it - sounded too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a huge difference between normal conditioner</li>
            <li>After using it the first day I didn&#x27;t really notice anything special.</li>
            <li>but it is a hassle to keep going and paying and finding the time for it - this stuff is just like that, only at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first tube of this conditioner she instantly felt a difference in her hair, and it looked great.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair smooth and shiny,  I use it every other day and love it.</li>
            <li>I think that a 7 day straight treatment would have been too much for my fine hair and caused too much build up of the paraffin wax that is contained in this product.</li>
            <li>This really improves the quality of your hair!</li>
            <li>Well, within the first use, my mother&#x27;s hair felt a lot softer and smoother to the touch.</li>
            <li>just left me wanting to do more for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The end result</li>
            <li>and it was my first.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s silky smooth and soft</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t pay more for this when I can get one big tube of something else.</li>
            <li>Obviously longer and/or thicker hair would require more conditioner than shorter hair.</li>
            <li>I did not feel that this \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; was any better for my hair than regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair has been fairly damaged over the years from chlorine as I like to swim a few times a week.</li>
            <li>To quote her: \\&quot;It was smooth and shiny and felt wonderful (even after going to sleep with wet hair - which I learned a long time ago just calls for wearing a hat next day).\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t love the single serving tubes which is never the right amount.</li>
            <li>quit this after day two, possibly due to my own errors</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t as intensive as I thought it would be in comparison to other special conditioning treatments, especially since there is a one a day tube, but it is still pretty good and creamy.</li>
            <li>You may definitely have more drastic results if you use a whole tube every day.  </li>
            <li>] I&#x27;ve liked and used several Clear hair products in my home.  </li>
            <li>She has very, very thick, wavy, medium-length beautiful hair.  </li>
            <li>So while it did make my hair feel soft and silky, I will opt for conditioner in full sized bottles.</li>
            <li>leave my hair super soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>It was easy to style, and the product left no residue.</li>
            <li>Not a big different than other intensive conditioners on my bleached, dyed, and permed hair, but it smelled nice and I liked it.</li>
            <li>The smell is certainly out there, but if you like it/don&#x27;t mind it</li>
            <li>Hair did come out smooth and soft but it does with normal conditioners as well which tend to be much cheaper per ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would probably be enough for my fine, thinning hair, though.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty decent for the price though, and the tubes are convenient to use.</li>
            <li>This is a nice quality conditioner contained in seven little tubes.</li>
            <li>But really might be just fine for others as this isn&#x27;t a slam on the product itself just an expression of personal preference.</li>
            <li>My hair felt clean and healthy but did not have the usual bounce.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the EXACT same product in tiny tubes.</li>
            <li>thing you really have to watch for is that this isn&#x27;t going to keep up with you very well if you have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>This product has worked very well.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really see it.</li>
            <li>So while I do like the product for the effect it had on my hair after 3 days, I think for some 7 days is too much</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really notice any effect it had on my color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;According to her, she has tried almost every deep conditioner available.</li>
            <li>If you have shorter hair that may not be an issue, but with sholder length or longer, thick hair I wish you good luck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have long, straight, easy to manage hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though they did kind of go just a touch overboard on the size and amount of packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mother has short hair, so she was able to obtain multiple uses out of one tube.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work better if I left my daily conditioner in to help the product spread</li>
            <li>Maybe if I felt that my hair felt particularly damaged for whatever reason.</li>
            <li>The first tube I felt some of the crunchy ends smooth down.</li>
            <li>it suggested.&lt;br /&gt;Had high hopes as I have frizzy hair that i feel is rather damaged&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Her hair is not damaged, but since it is color treated and exposed to high heat, she thought an intensive treatment every month or</li>
            <li>product comes in 7 little tubes with a snap off top.  </li>
            <li>I tried a couple other shampoos and liked them, but I will probably go back to the entire clear line, it works super well for my hair.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel so soft and really puts moisture in your hair.</li>
            <li>I use the Clear scalp and hair shampoo and conditioner and really like them</li>
            <li>I notice that the huge majority of reviews come from women which is to be expected.  </li>
            <li>I was actually surprised to see some results at the very end of this treatment.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mostly a big fan of the shampoo and conditioner, however the mask really made a noticeable difference after first applications can&#x27;t wait to finish the remander of days to see the finished effect</li>
            <li>/&gt;i even felt like washing it right back out by day 5</li>
            <li>My hair is wavy but med/thin and it weighs down easily.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a fairly nice little kit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did seem to leave it a little more shiny and soft by the end of the week.&lt;br /&gt;The product though i did not like the feel of it when using it on my hair</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a nice way to do a round of deep conditioning from time to time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is possible that I would have seen more improvement if I had used the product every day for the 7 days rather than only on my normal hair-washing schedule over several weeks.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty dry hair, which gets really staticky and sticks to my face and everything else in the winter.</li>
            <li>After day 7 I really did feel that overall my hair felt conditioned, and somewhat more manageable, even when I didn&#x27;t blow dry it properly.</li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t seem to be any better than any other deep conditioner that she&#x27;s tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you usually wash your hair every day, you might be ok with having to use the Treatment 7 days in a row.  </li>
            <li>Each tube has plenty of &#x60;cream&#x27; and I wonder if a person with short hair would be able to use half the tube at a time.  </li>
            <li>so thought I would try this Clear 7 Day intensive treatment tubes.  </li>
            <li>I choose the Clear.</li>
            <li>first thing to note is that the tubes, considering how long your hair is, offers a lot of the product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about damage to hair, my mom cuts her hair often enough to not have split ends, but her hair has never been this soft to the touch before.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Clear 7 day Intensive Treatment Tubes, Color and Damage repair, 7 count, for my daughter-in-law.  </li>
            <li>I forgot to mention that the Clear 7 Day Intensive Treatment Tubes, Color and Damage Repair, does have a noticeable fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Clear 7 Day Intensive Treatment Tubes]</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and needs tons of conditioner.</li>
            <li>My curls hold in place and my hair feels soft and looks healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So as far as the hair goes</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft, it makes it shine but not oily.</li>
            <li>After 7 days of use, you should notice marked improvement in the condition of your hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did leave my hair soft and well conditioned,</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s extremely soft which I like in theory</li>
            <li>My natural hair is a bit easier to style.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that the company provided so much, taking into consideration people who may have really thick and long</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much difference during the first 5 tubes, in fact, my hair felt heavy and with some residue.  </li>
            <li>My hair is not thick and only just barely shoulder length</li>
            <li>Every other day I would use it and after my hair dried, it felt like it had more moisture.</li>
            <li>Clear line has totally converted</li>
            <li>For daily use, the conditioner that makes my hair feel soft and look shiny is [[ASIN:B00A0IWRUI</li>
            <li>These Intensive Treatment Tubes are small (each tube is 0.5 oz), which is probably enough for most people, but I had to use 2 because my hair is really long.</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t have a lasting affect meaning after I used up the 7 tubes my hair went back to normal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It definitely goes above and beyond normal conditioning products and after the seven days</li>
            <li>hair is naturally curly and this product really weighed my hair down</li>
            <li>It is a nice product to use after a color treatment as hair can get damaged and dried out or for those who are swim as chlorine can be very harsh on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I have hair past my shoulders and found one tube was enough for more then a single application)</li>
            <li>The treatment is thick and feels rich.  </li>
            <li>conditioner feels thick and rich.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what is so special about having a separate tube of Treatment for each day - maybe if the Intensive treatment was packaged in a larger bottle or tube, one could regulate the amount of product</li>
            <li>I was really eager to try these treatment tubes because I can always use an extra douse of conditioning due to coloring my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using the less than recommended amount, and using it less frequently than recommended, I noticed my hair was slightly smoother and more manageable.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The conditioner itself had a pleasant fragrance.</li>

            <li> My hair has felt better since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> This product really does work and it smells great , I started using the conditioner.</li>
            <li> what remains of my blond overprocessed hair does have a richer tone, it doesn&#x27;t feel like straw any more, and has stopped breaking off.</li>
            <li> when days 4, 5, 6 and 7 came I noticed my hair feeling more and more oily.</li>
            <li> and I need more then something for seven days.</li>
            <li> hair is subjected to dyes and heat and more dyes and more heat.</li>
            <li> She fell in love with the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because there are better options.</li>
            <li> While the vials are convenient for transport, I think supplying this in a full sized bottle would be more convenient and cost effective.</li>
            <li> I love products that have a strong smell that is pleasing to the nose.</li>
            <li> which is good because some similar products do.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the not so good.</li>
            <li> I have found this the easiest way to keep it from drying out and becoming frizzy.  </li>
            <li> One you get the cap of the vial off, it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a decent conditioner although I can&#x27;t say it is superior to others on the market.</li>
            <li> It smells good and she highly recommends it and uses it all the time now.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and is easy to overcondition.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it was pretty effective in taming the frizz and making my hair silkier</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hands down, it&#x27;s THE best product out there for the price!!!!</li>
            <li> .. fine wavy curly hair&lt;</li>
            <li> and I get a huge whiff of the product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in shine.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say I saw a HUGE improvement in my hair over the 7 days.  </li>
            <li> I thought these would be great to try out for some extra treatment with summer and pools/sun coming up soon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but some women prefer not to havea strong scent in their hair.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to repair the damage of age and hair dye.</li>
            <li> Ok i tried this product exactly the way</li>
            <li> What was the original color again?</li>
            <li> Not the best deep conditioning treatment but better than regular conditioners that say &amp;</li>
            <li> It rinses cleanly.</li>
            <li> and I still love how well this brand works with my hair, how soft and touchable my hair feels and how healthy it looks.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use a special shampoo, just used this treatment instead of conditioner (with longer waiting time).  </li>
            <li> Maybe good for travel emergencies but not for regular use.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the end of be all of conditioners, but it&#x27;s good enough to merit giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> Because I wanted to test this product the way it was recommended, I changed up that routine and shampooed every day and then followed up with the treatment for the full 7 days.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is not a bad product</li>
            <li> This stuffs not bad.</li>
            <li> asked for more because 3 words typically doesn&#x27;t make a good review, she added.</li>
            <li> not bad though for a temporary quick fix.</li>
            <li> I love clear products !!</li>
            <li> I will have to say this conditions my hair better than normal conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have long bleached/colored hair and always looking for a good mask.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and an oily scalp, and my hair is rather sensitive.  </li>
            <li> It was soft, shiny, the ends were strong and smooth.</li>
            <li> naturally curly, mid-back length, color treated hair; so keeping it moisturized is very important.</li>
            <li> this product was i guess just too much for my fine</li>
            <li> It certainly works well for damage repair though, and if your hair is in need of such a treatment, this would be an excellent product to try, as it&#x27;s not overly expensive and seems to have a great combination of ingredients to promote healthier hair.</li>
            <li> I had started using the Clear shampoo and Clear conditioner and love the silky smooth feeling of my hair and the shine!</li>
            <li> There is no harsh chemical smells which I love.</li>
            <li> It also gave my hair a nice sheen that regular conditioner does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first fell in love with the Clear brand when I got two bottles in a subscription box that I get (oh how addicting are they!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is not the right product</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny but it looks greasy even right after washing it, while it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy</li>
            <li> /&gt;She saw this product on a few store shelves, but never tried it - sounded too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a huge difference between normal conditioner</li>
            <li> After using it the first day I didn&#x27;t really notice anything special.</li>
            <li> but it is a hassle to keep going and paying and finding the time for it - this stuff is just like that, only at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first tube of this conditioner she instantly felt a difference in her hair, and it looked great.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair smooth and shiny,  I use it every other day and love it.</li>
            <li> I think that a 7 day straight treatment would have been too much for my fine hair and caused too much build up of the paraffin wax that is contained in this product.</li>
            <li> This really improves the quality of your hair!</li>
            <li> Well, within the first use, my mother&#x27;s hair felt a lot softer and smoother to the touch.</li>
            <li> just left me wanting to do more for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The end result</li>
            <li> and it was my first.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s silky smooth and soft</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t pay more for this when I can get one big tube of something else.</li>
            <li> Obviously longer and/or thicker hair would require more conditioner than shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I did not feel that this \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; was any better for my hair than regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair has been fairly damaged over the years from chlorine as I like to swim a few times a week.</li>
            <li> To quote her: \\&quot;It was smooth and shiny and felt wonderful (even after going to sleep with wet hair - which I learned a long time ago just calls for wearing a hat next day).\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t love the single serving tubes which is never the right amount.</li>
            <li> quit this after day two, possibly due to my own errors</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t as intensive as I thought it would be in comparison to other special conditioning treatments, especially since there is a one a day tube, but it is still pretty good and creamy.</li>
            <li> You may definitely have more drastic results if you use a whole tube every day.  </li>
            <li> ] I&#x27;ve liked and used several Clear hair products in my home.  </li>
            <li> She has very, very thick, wavy, medium-length beautiful hair.  </li>
            <li> So while it did make my hair feel soft and silky, I will opt for conditioner in full sized bottles.</li>
            <li> leave my hair super soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> It was easy to style, and the product left no residue.</li>
            <li> Not a big different than other intensive conditioners on my bleached, dyed, and permed hair, but it smelled nice and I liked it.</li>
            <li> The smell is certainly out there, but if you like it/don&#x27;t mind it</li>
            <li> Hair did come out smooth and soft but it does with normal conditioners as well which tend to be much cheaper per ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would probably be enough for my fine, thinning hair, though.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty decent for the price though, and the tubes are convenient to use.</li>
            <li> This is a nice quality conditioner contained in seven little tubes.</li>
            <li> But really might be just fine for others as this isn&#x27;t a slam on the product itself just an expression of personal preference.</li>
            <li> My hair felt clean and healthy but did not have the usual bounce.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the EXACT same product in tiny tubes.</li>
            <li> thing you really have to watch for is that this isn&#x27;t going to keep up with you very well if you have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> This product has worked very well.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really see it.</li>
            <li> So while I do like the product for the effect it had on my hair after 3 days, I think for some 7 days is too much</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really notice any effect it had on my color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;According to her, she has tried almost every deep conditioner available.</li>
            <li> If you have shorter hair that may not be an issue, but with sholder length or longer, thick hair I wish you good luck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long, straight, easy to manage hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though they did kind of go just a touch overboard on the size and amount of packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mother has short hair, so she was able to obtain multiple uses out of one tube.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work better if I left my daily conditioner in to help the product spread</li>
            <li> Maybe if I felt that my hair felt particularly damaged for whatever reason.</li>
            <li> The first tube I felt some of the crunchy ends smooth down.</li>
            <li> it suggested.&lt;br /&gt;Had high hopes as I have frizzy hair that i feel is rather damaged&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Her hair is not damaged, but since it is color treated and exposed to high heat, she thought an intensive treatment every month or</li>
            <li> product comes in 7 little tubes with a snap off top.  </li>
            <li> I tried a couple other shampoos and liked them, but I will probably go back to the entire clear line, it works super well for my hair.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel so soft and really puts moisture in your hair.</li>
            <li> I use the Clear scalp and hair shampoo and conditioner and really like them</li>
            <li> I notice that the huge majority of reviews come from women which is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> I was actually surprised to see some results at the very end of this treatment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mostly a big fan of the shampoo and conditioner, however the mask really made a noticeable difference after first applications can&#x27;t wait to finish the remander of days to see the finished effect</li>
            <li> /&gt;i even felt like washing it right back out by day 5</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy but med/thin and it weighs down easily.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is a fairly nice little kit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did seem to leave it a little more shiny and soft by the end of the week.&lt;br /&gt;The product though i did not like the feel of it when using it on my hair</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a nice way to do a round of deep conditioning from time to time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is possible that I would have seen more improvement if I had used the product every day for the 7 days rather than only on my normal hair-washing schedule over several weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty dry hair, which gets really staticky and sticks to my face and everything else in the winter.</li>
            <li> After day 7 I really did feel that overall my hair felt conditioned, and somewhat more manageable, even when I didn&#x27;t blow dry it properly.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t seem to be any better than any other deep conditioner that she&#x27;s tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you usually wash your hair every day, you might be ok with having to use the Treatment 7 days in a row.  </li>
            <li> Each tube has plenty of &#x60;cream&#x27; and I wonder if a person with short hair would be able to use half the tube at a time.  </li>
            <li> so thought I would try this Clear 7 Day intensive treatment tubes.  </li>
            <li> I choose the Clear.</li>
            <li> first thing to note is that the tubes, considering how long your hair is, offers a lot of the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about damage to hair, my mom cuts her hair often enough to not have split ends, but her hair has never been this soft to the touch before.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Clear 7 day Intensive Treatment Tubes, Color and Damage repair, 7 count, for my daughter-in-law.  </li>
            <li> I forgot to mention that the Clear 7 Day Intensive Treatment Tubes, Color and Damage Repair, does have a noticeable fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Clear 7 Day Intensive Treatment Tubes]</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and needs tons of conditioner.</li>
            <li> My curls hold in place and my hair feels soft and looks healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So as far as the hair goes</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft, it makes it shine but not oily.</li>
            <li> After 7 days of use, you should notice marked improvement in the condition of your hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did leave my hair soft and well conditioned,</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s extremely soft which I like in theory</li>
            <li> My natural hair is a bit easier to style.  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that the company provided so much, taking into consideration people who may have really thick and long</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference during the first 5 tubes, in fact, my hair felt heavy and with some residue.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not thick and only just barely shoulder length</li>
            <li> Every other day I would use it and after my hair dried, it felt like it had more moisture.</li>
            <li> Clear line has totally converted</li>
            <li> For daily use, the conditioner that makes my hair feel soft and look shiny is [[ASIN:B00A0IWRUI</li>
            <li> These Intensive Treatment Tubes are small (each tube is 0.5 oz), which is probably enough for most people, but I had to use 2 because my hair is really long.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t have a lasting affect meaning after I used up the 7 tubes my hair went back to normal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It definitely goes above and beyond normal conditioning products and after the seven days</li>
            <li> hair is naturally curly and this product really weighed my hair down</li>
            <li> It is a nice product to use after a color treatment as hair can get damaged and dried out or for those who are swim as chlorine can be very harsh on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have hair past my shoulders and found one tube was enough for more then a single application)</li>
            <li> The treatment is thick and feels rich.  </li>
            <li> conditioner feels thick and rich.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is so special about having a separate tube of Treatment for each day - maybe if the Intensive treatment was packaged in a larger bottle or tube, one could regulate the amount of product</li>
            <li> I was really eager to try these treatment tubes because I can always use an extra douse of conditioning due to coloring my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using the less than recommended amount, and using it less frequently than recommended, I noticed my hair was slightly smoother and more manageable.</li>
            <li> She does not usually wet, dry and style her hair every day and</li>
            <li> Someone with long and/or thick hair will have more trouble.  </li>
            <li> A minor quibble - the instruction are only printed on the box, not on the individual tubes.</li>
            <li> My normal routine has me conditioning it everyday in the shower, but only shampooing it 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li> This product left my hair feeling soft however did not weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> I tried to use this on 7 consecutive washes as recommended, but found that the conditioning element just gave me flat hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, and there was enough</li>
            <li> However, I can get a Keratin treatment done on my hair cheaper (in the long run) that&#x27;ll last longer.</li>
            <li> My experience overall with this treatment is that it does work, but I didn&#x27;t feel the effects lasted for too long.</li>
            <li> made my hair really soft and tamed down my frizz.</li>
            <li> Once the tubes were done, my hair almost went back to being a bit dry</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a dramatic change, like super silky or shiny, but I did notice the almost no frizz - and we have had rainy days, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;The conditioner does function well as an above average deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> Depending on my mood and the weather, I either lop it off or grow it long.</li>
            <li> It is not clear whether you are supposed to use these seven days in a row or seven times in a row.</li>
            <li> , I found that the tubes didn&#x27;t have enough conditioner to actually get down to the scalp.</li>
            <li> I only used about a third of a tube (and I have mid back length hair) after shampoo every other day or so, and saw results within a few uses.</li>
            <li> At my age I can either bite the bullet and go gray, or put color on my hair, blow dry it, curling iron it, expose it the harsh sunlight at the beach, the chlorine in pools, and rely on Clear 7 day intensive treatment to restore it.</li>
            <li> but I have used other products which had the same effect, so</li>
            <li> Until she does the bathroom voodoo (straighten, or blow dry on a brush, chant over mystican incense)</li>
            <li> Indeed, it may be too much for those with short or thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do wear my hair long in my old age as a protest against excessive barber fees, and after using this product seven days in a row, I do notice a difference and one particular woman at my apartment complex has commented favorably on it, so</li>
            <li> I saw a difference when using this product, but I don&#x27;t wash my hair every single day to see results in 7 days.</li>
            <li> Even with the daily shampooing, this product seemed to be leaving residue in my hair that was weighing it down and making it look greasy.  </li>
            <li> She gets salon highlights every few months and does high heat blow-outs every few days.  </li>
            <li> After using them for the full 7 days (actually a few extra, others have complained the tubes are too small</li>
            <li> I also have hair that starts to get a little oily the day after a shower, so I can&#x27;t use conditioner near my scalp, but this treatment didn&#x27;t have that effect and didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t be sure because it doesn&#x27;t exactly tell you what to do, because my hair was disgusting and greasy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;which was less under control than with regular conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The standard of comparison for improvement is less breakage upon combing  after use of this product compared to a non-conditioning shampoo.</li>
            <li> The Intensive Treatment tubes left my hair softer, silkier and less frizz.</li>
            <li> Basically it doesn&#x27;t work as well as my usual less expensive deep conditioners and while it&#x27;s not awful</li>
            <li> The natural hair closer to my head is just a bit kinky and hard to style.  </li>
            <li> but still I did not really notice anything.  </li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> Not much of a shampoo person</li>
            <li> so I have been trying other products that last a little longer than the temporary 7 days.</li>
            <li> There are other intensive hair treatments on the market that I believe work as well as this one does and are easier to use.scent in their hair.  </li>
            <li> There are other intensive hair treatments on the market that I believe work as well as this one does and are easier to use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any other styling products either.  </li>
            <li> I used a tube every time I shampooed which is every other day, so they were used over a 15 day treatment.</li>
            <li> I had some little dry scaly places on my scalp when I started using it and still had them after using all 7 tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that is long so generally the drug store brands</li>
            <li> My preference is for items that seem less \\&quot;waxy\\&quot; than does this item.</li>
            <li> I used half a tube all over my heat.</li>
            <li> I was wary of this product because of the high aspirations that it promised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure exactly what it was supposed to \\&quot;repair\\&quot; in terms of color, the box and the description were a little vague.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, it seems pretty inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably get hit for saying this, but at the day&#x27;s start, my GF&#x27;s hair is usually a mess.</li>
            <li> Now if you have really thick or really long hair you may have to use two tubes just to cover your head.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day on a normal basis, the weather was still cold when I got the product, and I didn&#x27;t want to go off to work every day with wet hair in the winter.  </li>
            <li> These little tubes are miracle workers.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally a little frizzy.  </li>
            <li> The product is just spread a little too</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that is shoulder length, I tried using one tube a day for 3 days and did not notice anything so the next day I used 2 tubes in one application</li>
            <li> The conditioner is not as thick as I expected it to be, but it wasn&#x27;t runny.</li>
            <li> This treatment didn&#x27;t make the highlights dull or fade away (like other heavy treatments have done).  </li>
            <li> this product also does the trick, for about half the cost!</li>
            <li> It was very subtle overall, so the time frame is hard to nail down.</li>
            <li> Whenever my mom walked past me, I would get a whiff of it.</li>
            <li> i usually use.&lt;br /&gt;Did not use any styling product either during this testing period.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I had to use it daily which can get expensive.</li>
            <li> Confession: I am usually a snob when it comes to hair products.  </li>
            <li> but I had to work hard to make one tube spread throughout my scalp and the length of my hair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to describe the feeling...</li>
            <li> Maybe I could see a diffeence in 14 days at least.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair and need to untangle your knots, use these.</li>
            <li> I have really thick frizzy hair and the intensive treatment</li>
            <li> frizz was only halfway as bad as usual on humid days</li>
            <li> conditioners are too weak for my hair.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is very thick</li>
            <li> Again, my hair is very thick - a ponytail on me is about 4\\&quot; around -</li>
            <li> It gets annoying, so I was looking for a treatment that would hopefully hydrate my hair enough to stop that.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a great product either.</li>
            <li> The smell was not great</li>
            <li> The lower half is badly overprocessed, and some of it broke off.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was very subtle.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Once you take into consideration the fact that these were fairly unrealistic, the results are solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> but it will get expensive if you want a longer term fix.</li>
            <li> Also it is rather expensive for a 7 day \\&quot;fix\\&quot;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was inconvenient to have to use the Treatment every day for 7 days.  </li>
            <li> This is product that works well, but it&#x27;s inconvenient and not well packaged.  </li>
            <li> This is product that works well, but it&#x27;s inconvenient and not well packaged.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It did not do anything. I bought the conditioner of this same brand and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the EXACT same product in tiny tubes.</li>
            <li> This really improves the quality of your hair!</li>
            <li> These little tubes are miracle workers. If you have thick hair and need to untangle your knots, use these. It makes your hair feel so soft and really puts moisture in your hair. My hair looked and felt better and healthier after just 1 tube.</li>
            <li> My preference is for items that seem less \\&quot;waxy\\&quot; than does this item. But really might be just fine for others as this isn&#x27;t a slam on the product itself just an expression of personal preference.</li>
            <li> I use the Clear scalp and hair shampoo and conditioner and really like them so thought I would try this Clear 7 Day intensive treatment tubes.  I have to admit I was not impressed.  I have thin hair that is shoulder length, I tried using one tube a day for 3 days and did not notice anything so the next day I used 2 tubes in one application but still I did not really notice anything.  I still have 2 tubes and will try them to use them up but I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with this product or whatever it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li> leave my hair super soft and shinny. I love it.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference when using this product, but I don&#x27;t wash my hair every single day to see results in 7 days. Every other day I would use it and after my hair dried, it felt like it had more moisture. Once the tubes were done, my hair almost went back to being a bit dry so I have been trying other products that last a little longer than the temporary 7 days. not bad though for a temporary quick fix.</li>
            <li> I have long bleached/colored hair and always looking for a good mask. I used half a tube all over my heat. Let it soak in for 15 min. And rinced out and oh boy the difference. From not being able to comb my hair to so silky everyone at work was like what did you use your hair looks amazing ! Using this every couple days or once a week. I love clear products !!</li>
            <li> Does anyone know of a perfume that is very similar to this product? I abs love this fragrance and its reminding me of a perfume I wore yrs ( decades!) ago! Please help!!! I&#x27;ll buy this hair treatment  product just for the fragrance if nothing else, that&#x27;s how much I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom.  Compared to some of the more expensive brands (LivingProof, etc.) this product also does the trick, for about half the cost!</li>
            <li> I had started using the Clear shampoo and Clear conditioner and love the silky smooth feeling of my hair and the shine! I was excited to repair the damage of age and hair dye. The first tube I felt some of the crunchy ends smooth down. By day 7 my hair looked as if it never had an issue. It was soft, shiny, the ends were strong and smooth. At my age I can either bite the bullet and go gray, or put color on my hair, blow dry it, curling iron it, expose it the harsh sunlight at the beach, the chlorine in pools, and rely on Clear 7 day intensive treatment to restore it. I choose the Clear. My hair looks and feels great. I tried a couple other shampoos and liked them, but I will probably go back to the entire clear line, it works super well for my hair.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother, who colors her hair. This review is based off her opinions on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing to note is that the tubes, considering how long your hair is, offers a lot of the product. My mother has short hair, so she was able to obtain multiple uses out of one tube. I&#x27;m glad that the company provided so much, taking into consideration people who may have really thick and long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is divine. Whenever my mom walked past me, I would get a whiff of it. I love products that have a strong smell that is pleasing to the nose. It always makes me happy when I swish my hair and I get a huge whiff of the product. I hate it when the smell fades away, leaving your hair smelling like nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, does it work? Well, within the first use, my mother&#x27;s hair felt a lot softer and smoother to the touch. I don&#x27;t know much about damage to hair, my mom cuts her hair often enough to not have split ends, but her hair has never been this soft to the touch before. It was easy to style, and the product left no residue. Was it successful? My mom&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
            <li> I notice that the huge majority of reviews come from women which is to be expected.  We guys aren&#x27;t as fussy about the appearance of our hair.  I do wear my hair long in my old age as a protest against excessive barber fees, and after using this product seven days in a row, I do notice a difference and one particular woman at my apartment complex has commented favorably on it, so I can confidently say that guys like me can also benefit from this product.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight, easy to manage hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quit this after day two, possibly due to my own errors but I can&#x27;t be sure because it doesn&#x27;t exactly tell you what to do, because my hair was disgusting and greasy.  No thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mostly a big fan of the shampoo and conditioner, however the mask really made a noticeable difference after first applications can&#x27;t wait to finish the remander of days to see the finished effect</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally a little frizzy.  This product makes my hair smooth and shiny,  I use it every other day and love it.</li>
            <li> I have highlights/lowlights color treatment done to my hair every 2-3 months and thought this would be a good product to help minimize the damage that coloring does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the product insrtuctions are to use it every day for seven days.  I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day on a normal basis, the weather was still cold when I got the product, and I didn&#x27;t want to go off to work every day with wet hair in the winter.  So I used it once or twice a week for several weeks instead.  This may explain why I didn&#x27;t see any change in my scalp or hair after using the product.  I had some little dry scaly places on my scalp when I started using it and still had them after using all 7 tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in 7 little tubes with a snap off top.  The treatment is thick and feels rich.  My hair is not thick and only just barely shoulder length but I had to work hard to make one tube spread throughout my scalp and the length of my hair.  Someone with long and/or thick hair will have more trouble.  It seemed to work better if I left my daily conditioner in to help the product spread better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is possible that I would have seen more improvement if I had used the product every day for the 7 days rather than only on my normal hair-washing schedule over several weeks.  But the instructions are to leave the product on for 3-5 minutes and I&#x27;m not sure that is long enough for any of the vitamins in the product to be absorbed into the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably wouldn&#x27;t get this product again.  If I want a deep conditioner I&#x27;ll look for one that you leave in longer and don&#x27;t need to use daily.  For daily use, the conditioner that makes my hair feel soft and look shiny is [[ASIN:B00A0IWRUI Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Conditioner 28 oz]].</li>
            <li> I tried to use this on 7 consecutive washes as recommended, but found that the conditioning element just gave me flat hair. My hair felt clean and healthy but did not have the usual bounce. I have color treated, but oily hair so maybe this would work on drier texture. I also didn&#x27;t love the single serving tubes which is never the right amount. Maybe good for travel emergencies but not for regular use. One thing though, I really really love the scent. My hair smelled just yummy.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a fairly nice little kit. You get a separate tube for each day&#x27;s use of product, which is convenient. Though they did kind of go just a touch overboard on the size and amount of packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing you really have to watch for is that this isn&#x27;t going to keep up with you very well if you have a lot of hair. That might be why it didn&#x27;t work as well for me as it did for some people. The product is just spread a little too thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s convenient and it does seem to help, though, so it&#x27;s a nice way to do a round of deep conditioning from time to time.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and needs tons of conditioner. This product has worked very well. My curls hold in place and my hair feels soft and looks healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the pre-portioned containers. My hair is long, and there was enough product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner feels thick and rich. It&#x27;s pleasantly scented but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most conditioners are too weak for my hair. This has worked out very nice.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.  This product left my hair feeling soft however did not weigh it down.  So as far as the hair goes I feel it did a good job.  I did not however notice any affect on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title \\&quot;7 day\\&quot; leaves the impression it is used for 7 days -- however reading the box it implies that it is to be used as needed.</li>
            <li> Ok i tried this product exactly the way it suggested.&lt;br /&gt;Had high hopes as I have frizzy hair that i feel is rather damaged&lt;br /&gt;but wow this product was i guess just too much for my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my Pantene Curly Shampoo and then this instead of the conditioner i usually use.&lt;br /&gt;Did not use any styling product either during this testing period.&lt;br /&gt;This just left me wanting to do more for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The end result was just so so&lt;br /&gt;The frizz was only halfway as bad as usual on humid days&lt;br /&gt;which was less under control than with regular conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did seem to leave it a little more shiny and soft by the end of the week.&lt;br /&gt;The product though i did not like the feel of it when using it on my hair&lt;br /&gt;just felt almost slimy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my hair is naturally curly and this product really weighed my hair down&lt;br /&gt;so maybe for my type .. fine wavy curly hair&lt;br /&gt;this is not the right product&lt;br /&gt;i even felt like washing it right back out by day 5</li>
            <li> I ordered the Clear 7 day Intensive Treatment Tubes, Color and Damage repair, 7 count, for my daughter-in-law.  She has very, very thick, wavy, medium-length beautiful hair.  She gets salon highlights every few months and does high heat blow-outs every few days.  Her hair is not damaged, but since it is color treated and exposed to high heat, she thought an intensive treatment every month or so might help keep her hair healthy.  She used the box of tubes a month or so ago and her comment is the title of my review, \\&quot;ok, but nothing special.\\&quot;  Here are the specifics:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Each tube did not contain enough conditioner to coat all of her hair.  It would probably be enough for my fine, thinning hair, though.  This caused me to question the nature of the packaging. I&#x27;m not sure what is so special about having a separate tube of Treatment for each day - maybe if the Intensive treatment was packaged in a larger bottle or tube, one could regulate the amount of product needed.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It was inconvenient to have to use the Treatment every day for 7 days.  She does not usually wet, dry and style her hair every day and neither do I and neither do a lot of women I know.  I wonder if the Treatment would work as well, if one just used it 7 times in a row over the course of a week or two?&lt;br /&gt;3.  The Intensive Treatment worked well as a deep conditioner.  It just didn&#x27;t seem to be any better than any other deep conditioner that she&#x27;s tried.&lt;br /&gt;  So, the conclusion I&#x27;ve come to is that if you have a lot of hair, the amount of Teatment in each tube may not be sufficient for you.  If you usually wash your hair every day, you might be ok with having to use the Treatment 7 days in a row.  If you don&#x27;t, it seems pretty inconvenient.  In my opinion, the individual tube packaging is not needed.  I forgot to mention that the Clear 7 Day Intensive Treatment Tubes, Color and Damage Repair, does have a noticeable fragrance.  It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but some women prefer not to havea strong scent in their hair.  This is product that works well, but it&#x27;s inconvenient and not well packaged.  There are other intensive hair treatments on the market that I believe work as well as this one does and are easier to use.scent in their hair.

            <li> I was actually surprised to see some results at the very end of this treatment.  I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day so I used these tubes for 7 consecutive washes.  I didn&#x27;t notice much difference during the first 5 tubes, in fact, my hair felt heavy and with some residue.  My hair is wavy but med/thin and it weighs down easily.  By the 6th and 7th tubes, I notice my hair was a bit bouncier and the frizz control had improved.  I didn&#x27;t see a dramatic change, like super silky or shiny, but I did notice the almost no frizz - and we have had rainy days, so I know it helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is brown with some highlights.  This treatment didn&#x27;t make the highlights dull or fade away (like other heavy treatments have done).  I didn&#x27;t use a special shampoo, just used this treatment instead of conditioner (with longer waiting time).  I didn&#x27;t use any other styling products either.  Each tube has plenty of &#x60;cream&#x27; and I wonder if a person with short hair would be able to use half the tube at a time.  My hair is about 3\\&quot; below my shoulders now, and I could&#x27;ve used 2/3 of the tube and have plenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the 7 &#x27;day&#x27; treatment improved my hair but didn&#x27;t change it dramatically.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;m not an expert on \\&quot;intensive treatments\\&quot; like this and it was my first. I was expecting a huge difference between normal conditioner but I didn&#x27;t really see it. Hair did come out smooth and soft but it does with normal conditioners as well which tend to be much cheaper per ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I found that the tubes didn&#x27;t have enough conditioner to actually get down to the scalp. If you have shorter hair that may not be an issue, but with sholder length or longer, thick hair I wish you good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my money, I&#x27;ll look elsewhere next time.</li>
            <li> My hair has been fairly damaged over the years from chlorine as I like to swim a few times a week. I was wary of this product because of the high aspirations that it promised. Once you take into consideration the fact that these were fairly unrealistic, the results are solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner does function well as an above average deep conditioner. My hair has felt better since I started using this product. The smell is certainly out there, but if you like it/don&#x27;t mind it, you&#x27;ll find that this product can do you some good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The treatment tubes aren&#x27;t that pricy for what you&#x27;re getting. This isn&#x27;t the end of be all of conditioners, but it&#x27;s good enough to merit giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t as intensive as I thought it would be in comparison to other special conditioning treatments, especially since there is a one a day tube, but it is still pretty good and creamy. Overall, I like it and it&#x27;s silky smooth and soft but I wouldn&#x27;t pay more for this when I can get one big tube of something else.</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry hair, which gets really staticky and sticks to my face and everything else in the winter. It gets annoying, so I was looking for a treatment that would hopefully hydrate my hair enough to stop that. I only used about a third of a tube (and I have mid back length hair) after shampoo every other day or so, and saw results within a few uses. Using the less than recommended amount, and using it less frequently than recommended, I noticed my hair was slightly smoother and more manageable. I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in shine. You may definitely have more drastic results if you use a whole tube every day.  I also have hair that starts to get a little oily the day after a shower, so I can&#x27;t use conditioner near my scalp, but this treatment didn&#x27;t have that effect and didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all. I&#x27;ve gone through two boxes now, and use it maybe once a week for maintenance, with regular conditioner on days I don&#x27;t use this treatment.</li>
            <li> This product really does work and it smells great , I started using the conditioner. Not much of a shampoo person</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife to try and when I asked her for her feedback to write a review she said&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;This stuff works.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked for more because 3 words typically doesn&#x27;t make a good review, she added. It makes your hair soft, it makes it shine but not oily. It smells good and she highly recommends it and uses it all the time now.</li>
            <li> This is a nice quality conditioner contained in seven little tubes. Applied after shampooing the conditioner is to be left on for 3-5 minutes then rinsed. After 7 days of use, you should notice marked improvement in the condition of your hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are skimpy. It is not clear whether you are supposed to use these seven days in a row or seven times in a row. I opted for seven times in a row instead of daily application. My hair is fine and is easy to overcondition. The conditioner itself had a pleasant fragrance. One you get the cap of the vial off, it is easy to apply. It rinses cleanly. It did leave my hair soft and well conditioned, almost over conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a decent conditioner although I can&#x27;t say it is superior to others on the market. While the vials are convenient for transport, I think supplying this in a full sized bottle would be more convenient and cost effective. My hair length varies. Depending on my mood and the weather, I either lop it off or grow it long. Obviously longer and/or thicker hair would require more conditioner than shorter hair. Indeed, it may be too much for those with short or thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The standard of comparison for improvement is less breakage upon combing  after use of this product compared to a non-conditioning shampoo. A no brainer there. So while it did make my hair feel soft and silky, I will opt for conditioner in full sized bottles.</li>
            <li> These Intensive Treatment Tubes are small (each tube is 0.5 oz), which is probably enough for most people, but I had to use 2 because my hair is really long. The conditioner is not as thick as I expected it to be, but it wasn&#x27;t runny. The fragrance was very subtle. It was nice and had no chemical smell. I did not feel that this \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; was any better for my hair than regular conditioner. In fact, my regular conditioner leaves my hair feeling softer and silkier than this product did. I will finish out my box, but I won&#x27;t be using this product again.</li>
            <li> The Intensive Treatment tubes left my hair softer, silkier and less frizz. I used a tube every time I shampooed which is every other day, so they were used over a 15 day treatment. I think that a 7 day straight treatment would have been too much for my fine hair and caused too much build up of the paraffin wax that is contained in this product. It is a nice product to use after a color treatment as hair can get damaged and dried out or for those who are swim as chlorine can be very harsh on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it was pretty effective in taming the frizz and making my hair silkier but I have used other products which had the same effect, so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a revolutionary product. It&#x27;s pretty decent for the price though, and the tubes are convenient to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used shampoos and conditioners for color treated/damaged hair as I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for decades... I sometimes use a straightening iron and blowdryer as well. I thought these would be great to try out for some extra treatment with summer and pools/sun coming up soon. After using them for the full 7 days (actually a few extra, others have complained the tubes are too small but I have hair past my shoulders and found one tube was enough for more then a single application) I&#x27;m not impressed at all. My hair is shiny but it looks greasy even right after washing it, while it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy it&#x27;s hard to describe the feeling... it&#x27;s extremely soft which I like in theory but it keeps clinging to my face and driving me crazy. Basically it doesn&#x27;t work as well as my usual less expensive deep conditioners and while it&#x27;s not awful I dislike how it makes my hair look and feel and won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I will have to say this conditions my hair better than normal conditioner. I have really thick frizzy hair and the intensive treatment made my hair really soft and tamed down my frizz. The conditioner is very thick so it coats your hair well. There is no harsh chemical smells which I love. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy which is good because some similar products do.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the not so good. In order to see improvements in my hair I had to use it daily which can get expensive. The box comes with 7 tubes but the tubes are not very big (.5 oz). Now if you have really thick or really long hair you may have to use two tubes just to cover your head. The product doesn&#x27;t have a lasting affect meaning after I used up the 7 tubes my hair went back to normal. It&#x27;s a great temporary fix but it will get expensive if you want a longer term fix. Also it is rather expensive for a 7 day \\&quot;fix\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is not a bad product but it&#x27;s not a great product either. However, I can get a Keratin treatment done on my hair cheaper (in the long run) that&#x27;ll last longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 4 of the tubes now, and do actually see improvement in my hair.  The lower half is badly overprocessed, and some of it broke off. The natural hair closer to my head is just a bit kinky and hard to style.  I don&#x27;t color my hair anymore, but what remains of my blond overprocessed hair does have a richer tone, it doesn&#x27;t feel like straw any more, and has stopped breaking off. My natural hair is a bit easier to style.  I&#x27;d say the cost is standard for these types of repairing conditioners.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy, though you do have to wash it out thoroughly. A minor quibble - the instruction are only printed on the box, not on the individual tubes. I&#x27;m looking forward to completing the treatments.</li>
            <li> Prior to trying the [[ASIN:B00AE078YM Clear 7 Day Intensive Treatment Tubes]] I&#x27;ve liked and used several Clear hair products in my home.  I have naturally curly, mid-back length, color treated hair; so keeping it moisturized is very important. My normal routine has me conditioning it everyday in the shower, but only shampooing it 3 times a week.  I have found this the easiest way to keep it from drying out and becoming frizzy.  Because I wanted to test this product the way it was recommended, I changed up that routine and shampooed every day and then followed up with the treatment for the full 7 days.  The first 3 days my hair felt great and I was impressed, but when days 4, 5, 6 and 7 came I noticed my hair feeling more and more oily. Even with the daily shampooing, this product seemed to be leaving residue in my hair that was weighing it down and making it look greasy.  At the end of the week I had to wash my hair several times to remove it and get it back to an acceptable state.  So while I do like the product for the effect it had on my hair after 3 days, I think for some 7 days is too much and it may be best to break the treatment package up into two and maybe use them once a month.</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference in my hair. I followed the directions and still my hair looked the same. The smell was not great and I need more then something for seven days. Maybe I could see a diffeence in 14 days at least. I have to say that it dive give me a bit of body in my hair, but after the stuff is gone that went as well. # stars for the body.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and an oily scalp, and my hair is rather sensitive.  I really loved this conditioning treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely goes above and beyond normal conditioning products and after the seven days, I noticed my hair felt stronger and silkier, and I had fewer \\&quot;frizzies\\&quot; and \\&quot;fly-aways.\\&quot;  It also gave my hair a nice sheen that regular conditioner does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really notice any effect it had on my color-treated hair.  I&#x27;m not sure exactly what it was supposed to \\&quot;repair\\&quot; in terms of color, the box and the description were a little vague.  It certainly works well for damage repair though, and if your hair is in need of such a treatment, this would be an excellent product to try, as it&#x27;s not overly expensive and seems to have a great combination of ingredients to promote healthier hair.</li>
            <li> This is a seven day conditioner treatment. My experience overall with this treatment is that it does work, but I didn&#x27;t feel the effects lasted for too long. After using it the first day I didn&#x27;t really notice anything special. The second day, though, my hair felt softer and smoother. Then I didn&#x27;t feel any additional effects until day 7. After day 7 I really did feel that overall my hair felt conditioned, and somewhat more manageable, even when I didn&#x27;t blow dry it properly. It seemed to feel nicer for several days, maybe the effects were felt up to a week.  It was very subtle overall, so the time frame is hard to nail down. I don&#x27;t know if I would use it again... Maybe if I felt that my hair felt particularly damaged for whatever reason.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably get hit for saying this, but at the day&#x27;s start, my GF&#x27;s hair is usually a mess. Until she does the bathroom voodoo (straighten, or blow dry on a brush, chant over mystican incense) she tends to look like Animal from the \\&quot;Muppets.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her hair is subjected to dyes and heat and more dyes and more heat. What was the original color again? ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She saw this product on a few store shelves, but never tried it - sounded too good to be true.  One day she stuck it on her her shopping list (I&#x27;m the shopper - guess that&#x27;s why I have around 900 reviews as of today!) I had the chance to review it, so ordered some.  Wow. She fell in love with the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to her, she has tried almost every deep conditioner available. This is the only one that gives the same feel to hair as the conditioners that come with hair dyes (soft,silky and manageable). She loves the way deep conditioning treatments feel at the salon but it is a hassle to keep going and paying and finding the time for it - this stuff is just like that, only at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first tube of this conditioner she instantly felt a difference in her hair, and it looked great. To quote her: \\&quot;It was smooth and shiny and felt wonderful (even after going to sleep with wet hair - which I learned a long time ago just calls for wearing a hat next day).\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is something that will now have a permanent place in the bathroom. She plans to use it \\&quot;every two months or so.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands down, it&#x27;s THE best product out there for the price!!!!</li>
            <li> Great for traveling. Not a big different than other intensive conditioners on my bleached, dyed, and permed hair, but it smelled nice and I liked it.</li>
            <li> This stuffs not bad. Not the best deep conditioning treatment but better than regular conditioners that say &amp;#34;for damaged hair&amp;#34;...I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because there are better options.</li>
            <li> Confession: I am usually a snob when it comes to hair products.  I have very thick hair that is long so generally the drug store brands just don&#x27;t cut it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clear line has totally converted me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first fell in love with the Clear brand when I got two bottles in a subscription box that I get (oh how addicting are they!) and I have continued purchasing the line ever since.  6 months later and I still love how well this brand works with my hair, how soft and touchable my hair feels and how healthy it looks.  I was really eager to try these treatment tubes because I can always use an extra douse of conditioning due to coloring my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They definitely do work and I liked them but I can&#x27;t say I saw a HUGE improvement in my hair over the 7 days.  Again, my hair is very thick - a ponytail on me is about 4\\&quot; around - so take that into account as well.  I think for the thinner haired gals out there it may go further.</li>
