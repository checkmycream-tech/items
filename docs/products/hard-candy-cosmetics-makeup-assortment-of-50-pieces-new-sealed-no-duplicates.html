            <li>There was a good balance of normal colors, and some really different things.</li>
            <li>Very pleased, got my package 3 days before expected delivery date.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>When it arrived everything was in good condition and packaged well, except for one nail polish was broken (shame though it was my favorite out of the bunch /sad).</li>
            <li>It came quicker than expected and the products are top notch!</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much.</li>
            <li>I just saved a bunch of money on my daughter&#x27;s back to school makeup and even got a few treats for myself! :D</li>
            <li>I received exactly 50 items.</li>
            <li>some duplicates from the first set.</li>
            <li>Wife was pleased with this, not only because of the volume but because of the quality.</li>
            <li>Awesome make-up, but questionable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying much more when I get my next paycheck.</li>
            <li>All the make-up was sealed and in good condition except for one cream eye shadow that had dried out.</li>
            <li>i really like being able togive these out as multiple gifts.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any duplicates, I&#x27;m sure I have plenty of makeup for a long time</li>
            <li>Even got a few extras ordered the 50 piece and got about 55 pieces I was very pleased</li>
            <li>I really love Hard Candy makeup so this was fantastic.</li>
            <li>it thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I got so much for pennies on the dollar.</li>
            <li>I would have spent so much more at the store.</li>
            <li>I really like the diversity of items.</li>
            <li>full size black lengthening mascara 1 full size</li>
            <li>I received three of the same foundation in three different colors (light, porcelain, and ultra light), a similar selection of CC creams, and two different concealers (light and tan).</li>
            <li>Everything was sealed new and a multitude of varieties and colors!</li>
            <li>The majority of the rest of my order were lip products, mostly glosses, but enough unique or well pigmented items to round out my sparse lip collection.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous ordering these because several other buyers have reported issues, but I&#x27;m happy to say that I am pleased overall.</li>
            <li>Other than that, and that only god knows how old the makeup is, it&#x27;s pretty ok.</li>
            <li>All of the pieces were new and still in plastic....</li>
            <li>Everything was new sealed.</li>
            <li>I actually received 53 pieces though, so even without that eye shadow I got more that I expected!</li>
            <li>I was excited to see all the different products and different colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would be hesitant to order again unless I knew for certain that I would be getting a much bigger selection of eyeshadows and/or blushes.</li>
            <li>I love almost all Hard Candy products,  and at these prices you can&#x27;t beat it.  </li>
            <li>This is a must for anyone that love hard candy products.</li>
            <li>It really is an assortment and all of the products were different!</li>
            <li>Its so exciting to get what I expected.</li>
            <li>(example: normal brown shimmery cream eyeshadow, and a neon blue mascara)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be able to use the darker ones and that&#x27;s really my only complaint.</li>
            <li>This is a couple of hundred dollars worth of product for less than $50....</li>
            <li>Two were open (an ombre lipstick and a lip crayon), one was so old that it was unusable (a cream eyeshadow -- I got two of these, but one still works.</li>
            <li>I will admit I was a little hesitant at first</li>
            <li>2 lip balms 4 thick lip pencils 1 full size</li>

            <li> My only negative would be that I&#x27;ve ordered this bundle twice and have yet to receive concealer like shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> I had to give away like half of the package</li>
            <li> I order this every month and piece together little makeup kits out of it for others.</li>
            <li> I did have a cream shadow in this lot that was dried out, but the seller is sending a replacement for it.</li>
            <li> A few had been opened.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin</li>
            <li> There were also a five nail polishes, four of which were very odd glitter</li>
            <li> I even got a few extras!</li>
            <li> The package arrived in less than a week and all of the products were wrapped firmly so nothing was broken or melted...</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t revive the other), and one was simply not a great product (an eyeshadow that works like a lipstick and never dries).</li>
            <li> There were a lot of eye and lip products, only a few are crazy colors that I won&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> If you buy Hard Candy cosmetics, you know what a bargain this deal is.</li>
            <li> it is random</li>
            <li> Was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Of course, I was concerned that the makeup would be nasty or in poor condition, but this was not the case.</li>

            <li> It really is an assortment and all of the products were different!</li>
            <li> this is a nice product. i really like being able togive these out as multiple gifts.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the assortment of makeup I received and the excellent customer service, as well! I will definetley be shopping here again. You can&#x27;t beat the quality of makeup received at the affordable cost! I plan on ordering more.</li>
            <li> Love this product I got 58 items and over 100 dollars value.  I have a lot a girls in my family and this will make great stock stuffers, I will get this team aging.</li>
            <li> I order this every month and piece together little makeup kits out of it for others. they have a great product.  I love almost all Hard Candy products,  and at these prices you can&#x27;t beat it.  I say it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I received my shipment today and boy let me tell you it was like Christmas morning! Everything was sealed new and a multitude of varieties and colors! I absolutely loved loved loved it thank you so much. I told all my friends and they are going to order as well! Thank you</li>
            <li> This is the most awesome!! I didn&#x27;t get one duplicate, everything was sealed and everything was perfect. Also the package came way before it was scheduled to.  I ordered another one. A lot of the stuff that was sent priced alone is at $17.00 . You are getting way more than your money worth.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I&#x27;m not done going through my box yet and I&#x27;m already at a 5 star review. I didn&#x27;t have any duplicates, I&#x27;m sure I have plenty of makeup for a long time but I will order again soon!</li>
            <li> I just received this package in the mail today, and I am really pleased with the make-up! There were a lot of eye and lip products, only a few are crazy colors that I won&#x27;t use. There were several highlighting concealers, and cover-up sticks in a variety of shades. I won&#x27;t be able to use the darker ones and that&#x27;s really my only complaint. All the make-up was sealed and in good condition except for one cream eye shadow that had dried out. I actually received 53 pieces though, so even without that eye shadow I got more that I expected! Shipping was super fast. I&#x27;ll definitely order again!</li>
            <li> I was worried I would get some duplicates, but I didn&#x27;t! Not everything matched well with my skin tone, but that was to be expected. I really love Hard Candy makeup so this was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love everything that is in this assortment! I asked if they could send me fair skin colors and they accommodated that! I will definitely be ordering this again in about two weeks! So happy!</li>
            <li> got every thing I wanted and more!</li>
            <li> This was AMAZING!!!! All of the pieces were new and still in plastic.... And it was all really good stuff!.... I got lip gloss, eye shadows, eye liner, concealer, nail polish, glitter, and more! I actually ended up with 52 items ... I will admit I was a little hesitant at first but I figured I would take a risk and it was sooo worth it! The package arrived in less than a week and all of the products were wrapped firmly so nothing was broken or melted... This is a couple of hundred dollars worth of product for less than $50.... it is an AMAZING DEAL.. I just saved a bunch of money on my daughter&#x27;s back to school makeup and even got a few treats for myself! :D ... even if you can&#x27;t use everything it still beats paying drug store prices...</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous ordering these because several other buyers have reported issues, but I&#x27;m happy to say that I am pleased overall. I received exactly 50 items. Out of the 50 I threw four away. Two were open (an ombre lipstick and a lip crayon), one was so old that it was unusable (a cream eyeshadow -- I got two of these, but one still works. I couldn&#x27;t revive the other), and one was simply not a great product (an eyeshadow that works like a lipstick and never dries). I requested that the seller give me face items for light skin (though I mentioned that I was happy with any color of any other product), and they graciously complied. I received three of the same foundation in three different colors (light, porcelain, and ultra light), a similar selection of CC creams, and two different concealers (light and tan). The majority of the rest of my order were lip products, mostly glosses, but enough unique or well pigmented items to round out my sparse lip collection. I got a blush, several eyeliners, one baked shadow, and a highlight palette as well. There were also a five nail polishes, four of which were very odd glitter colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would be hesitant to order again unless I knew for certain that I would be getting a much bigger selection of eyeshadows and/or blushes. However, if that were guaranteed to me, I would be happy to order again today, even knowing that I might have two or three damaged items and some duplicates from the first set. I did kind of expect this order to be mostly lip products, and since that&#x27;s what I wanted, I&#x27;m mostly very pleased.</li>
            <li> Loveeeee it.  Super fast shipping everything brand new and secure and very great variety of products and colors will for sure order again very soon.</li>
            <li> I recently just bought this item and it is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G for the price!! When it arrived everything was in good condition and packaged well, except for one nail polish was broken (shame though it was my favorite out of the bunch /sad). I highly suggest this!!! ALSO there were no repeats of the same colors!!  Items in my Box included (mind you it is random so yours *could* be different):  2 quad cream palettes 2 duo cheek sticks (one blush, one bronzer) 1 box of eyeshadow tattoos 1 box of body art tattoos 1 fox in a box blush sets 4 tri shadow gift box sets with mini eye primers 3 tri shadow gift box set with mini eye liners 3 tubes of glossy shine lip glosses 2 tubes of eye glitter gels 2 podwer key eye shadows 7 nail polishes with little rings on the tops 2 tubes of sheer mouth off lip glosses 3 mini duo baked eye shadows 2 mini baked eye shadows 1 full size black lengthening mascara 1 full size glitter mascara 1 eye def shadow 3 full size eye/lip sticks 2 lip balms 4 thick lip pencils 1 full size volumizing lip gloss 1 duo lip tattoo gloss 1 tube of lip stick 1 glamazon glow gift set 1 split personality eye stick</li>
            <li> Not everything was sealed and I dont think it&#x27;s worth it.. I had to give away like half of the package</li>
            <li> Would defiantly recommend this</li>
            <li> I just received my box with my makeup today and I got an awesome assortment. I let them know I have pale skin and they did what they could to accomodate. I love the products I got, and cant wait to order again.</li>
            <li> Love love love. I got everything I needed</li>
            <li> Loved it all.. nice variety,  cool colors.</li>
            <li> Great bundle I loved it all lots lf different colors if you are a fan of hard candy I suggest this. Everything was new sealed. Even got a few extras ordered the 50 piece and got about 55 pieces I was very pleased</li>
            <li> I got 45 pieces of makeup and 9 of those pieces were used, but I got a good selection of makeup. Although, the product is advertised as getting 50 pieces of makeup that isn&#x27;t used.</li>
            <li> So happy with the items I got! I was really concerned that I might get a bunch of nail polish and weird colored lipsticks but it was a great variety of eye makeup and nice colors. Very pleased, got my package 3 days before expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> Verry happy with everything I got! Glad I ordered this. I even got a few extras! Even the face products were my skin tone. Love love love!</li>
            <li> If you buy Hard Candy cosmetics, you know what a bargain this deal is. Of course, I was concerned that the makeup would be nasty or in poor condition, but this was not the case. I did have a cream shadow in this lot that was dried out, but the seller is sending a replacement for it. A+ service, especially for an item that they are selling for less than a dollar. There was a good balance of normal colors, and some really different things. (example: normal brown shimmery cream eyeshadow, and a neon blue mascara)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re on the fence about this, go ahead and buy it! There&#x27;s a good mix of everything.</li>
            <li> I just got mine in the mail today, two days early, I&#x27;m amazed at all the different things you get, and I got a few extra. If you use Hard Candy makeup, definitely get this it&#x27;s well worth the money and more.</li>
            <li> It was 100% better. As soon as I saw it I knew it was all going to be intact. Thank you so very much. As the saying goes &amp;#34;slow down and smell the flowers&amp;#34; it always bring so out the best.</li>
            <li> great deal better than I expected , came early . very nice stuff would recommend this seller  five stars</li>
            <li> I got maybe 3 items that were repeats and like 8 or 10 items that werent my color which is fine by me! All of the pieces were in perfect condition and wrapped up just like they would be if I went to the store and bought them.</li>
            <li> i would recommend for people to buy this item, even though some of mine were a bit beat up on the boxes. but not severly&lt;br /&gt;it is worth the money for the brand</li>
            <li> I like everything! with that price it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I have Bought this before and loved the verity. This time I got lots of nail polish and tattoo stuff. Was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase! I was excited to see all the different products and different colors. Very happy with  everything.</li>
            <li> Wife was pleased with this, not only because of the volume but because of the quality. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> It came quicker than expected and the products are top notch! Very pleased! Will definitely order from them again!</li>
            <li> Awesome make-up, but questionable. A few had been opened. I don&#x27;t know if kids are around these items or what, but they need to stay away from the merch. I threw those pieces away. Other than that, and that only god knows how old the makeup is, it&#x27;s pretty ok.</li>
            <li> Was amazing going to buy again this weekend its sooooooo worth it but beware the &amp;#34;Tan&amp;#34; is not like a Hispanic tan lol and a lot of the foundation didn&#x27;t match  but other then that I love everything but I would love to know why the cc creme came out super clear and watery yuck but beside that everything was awesome</li>
            <li> This was an amazing buy! I got so much for pennies on the dollar. I would have spent so much more at the store. SO many products and my favorite brand and colors. This is a must for anyone that love hard candy products. Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> I got it as scheduled. I love everything I got! Its so exciting to get what I expected. Everything was sealed and I even got the correct tones of make up to match my skin. I&#x27;m buying much more when I get my next paycheck. So excited!!!!</li>
            <li> No duplicates but it can have several shades of 1 concealer, foundation,  etc.</li>
            <li> I really like the diversity of items. I would give five stars if there were more item for women of color. All in all the shadows look amazing and are pigmented and I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Really happy with my purchase. Everything brand new nothing broken. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this! Great colors and great value. A lot of mixed variety and no duplicates. My only negative would be that I&#x27;ve ordered this bundle twice and have yet to receive concealer like shown in the picture. I would have loved to have gotten that! Oh well, over all VERY pleased. Will continue to buy over and over again.</li>
            <li> My 2nd Hard candy order &amp; luv it Got so many beautiful pieces all dif from the last lot So impressedâ™&amp;iexcl;â™¥</li>
