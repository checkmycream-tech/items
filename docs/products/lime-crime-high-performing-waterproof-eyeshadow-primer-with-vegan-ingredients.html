            <li>It spreads easily, sticks like glue and lasts FOREVER!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok....</li>
            <li>thus you have to use more.</li>
            <li>everyone should try it out for your self because I love it :)</li>
            <li>Love Lime Crime-</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this primer and it works way too well (to the point where it doesn&#x27;t always come off in the shower).</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>This stuff works better than anything else I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>my eye liner doesn&#x27;t transfer to the top of my eye lid.</li>
            <li>Way better than I imagined.</li>
            <li>mid-day.&lt;br /&gt;Urban Decay shadow primer works better for me, but I&#x27;m still on the hunt for an all-day primer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li>I used to have to touch up eyeshadow many times a day, and now it stays on until I take it off.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve been using Lime Crime every day and still love the product.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and keeps my eyeshadow from creases very effectively esp.</li>
            <li>so I am very excited about that</li>
            <li>I even slept in my eye makeup one night and woke up to find it still looking pretty good.</li>
            <li>The new packaging is great because I prefer the tube so that I am not paranoid about my product drying out as I was with the pot</li>
            <li>First time trying this out and love it!</li>
            <li>It applies easily and shadows of any brand adheres to it well.  </li>
            <li>first time ever trying the line limecrime amazing every product I ordered</li>
            <li>As someone who loves dramatic makeup and bright pigments, this primer is perfect!</li>
            <li>Hands down the best eyeshadow primer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The primer works fantastic, and allows your eyeshadow to glide on smoothly.</li>
            <li>When the &amp;#34;ugly lights&amp;#34; come up in the bar at the end of the night, you&#x27;ll still have fabulous eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it</li>
            <li>I was super stoked to try this stuff out, after reading many rave reviews.&lt;br /&gt;While my eyeshadow looks great when I leave the house, it is heavily creased by</li>
            <li>I have very oily eyelids and most drug store primers</li>
            <li>so glad I did thank you so much</li>
            <li>In my previous review I wrote this was the best primer ever, not so much anymore.</li>
            <li>I really hesitated to try this as I&#x27;ve not been very impressed with previous eyeshadow primers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I got this primer because I was searching for other Lime crime items on Amazon and read all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>I have super oily lids and my eye shadow creases and wears off.</li>
            <li>you will get those bold colors you want</li>
            <li>I live in Florida which is super humid and on top of that I have oily skin and the lime crime primer</li>
            <li>It also intensifies the color, making colors more bold and vivid.</li>
            <li>Guess I moved on to bigger and better primers!</li>
            <li>Worth the investment.</li>
            <li>However, this product is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s also a fantastic product that definitely kept my shadow from creasing, Lime Crime Eyeshadow Helper is a better product.</li>
            <li>SO WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>This primer is worth every penny</li>
            <li>Very user friendly, will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li>I ordered my second tube of Lime Crime from Beauty Inside, and it when I went to use it for the first time, the tube was full of mostly air.</li>
            <li>Urban Decay is still my favorite</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mediocre at best.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was hoping for in terms of quality.</li>
            <li>I understand this is sold by weight and not volume, and it&#x27;s normal for some air to be in the tube, but this was not the full amount.</li>
            <li>, its even more product than the previous packaging and the tube is full to capacity.  </li>
            <li>It will work in my favor when I&#x27;m older, but right now it is a pain.</li>
            <li>Now that my teenage daughters have discovered it I&#x27;m back to order two more tubes!</li>
            <li>so it was hard finding a good one, but this one didn&#x27;t crease and shows the eyeshadow color</li>
            <li>Works too good hard to take off and I have very greasy eyelids.</li>
            <li>Being of Latin descent I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>Dries fast and doesn&#x27;t clump or leave a residue after an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>Really does what is said it would.</li>
            <li>and i ordered this wensday and came to me saturday which was fast</li>
            <li>I even used some really cheap eye shadow with it and it lasted all day and into the evening...would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>You have so much chemicals in the product.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different eye shadow primers (including: urban decay primer potion, too faced, Nyx, MAC paint pots, etc), and while some are better than others, most did crease some on me.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is that this is an absolute miracle</li>
            <li>I have really oily eyelids</li>
            <li>Item just as described fast shipping.</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny bit since it&#x27;s very strong and cakes over if you use too much).</li>
            <li>Better than any other primer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>but it stays in place, doesn&#x27;t crease and isn&#x27;t oily like so many other kinds.</li>
            <li>Finally once trying this I felt a little more comfortable, but it still wasn&#x27;t 100%.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it .</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for anyone who has oily lids like me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, a little goes a long way, it has good coverage</li>
            <li>You can use the cheapest eye shadow and your eyes will pop and last pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>Decided to give it a try because I was in need of a new shadow primer..</li>
            <li>swatched on my hand with an UD eye shadow using one of my new Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>This is long lasting and helps bring out the eyeshadows true color!  </li>
            <li>since I live in a hot country, have oily skin, and have to wear makeup for 12-14 hours daily.</li>
            <li>the product comes out through a small tube at the top which makes it easier to apply.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, kept my eyeshadow fresh all day--the only time it started to crease was under direct sunlight on a very hot day after several hours of being outside.</li>
            <li>I was going to give up on wearing shadow completely until I found this.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I dont even use eyeshadow, I just wear Lime Crime alone, because it evens out the tone of my eyelids and gives it a natural look.</li>
            <li>I have very oily lids and my eyeshadow would crease and look gross by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It will make you eyeshadow last the whole day without any touch ups.</li>
            <li>Soft and silky to apply.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and they water and sweat when I wear makeup</li>
            <li>I would completely recommend trying it out.</li>
            <li>I was unable to leave seller feedback for this company, so I wanted to note the good customer service here.</li>
            <li>You do have to work at blending your eyeshadow a little more than usual, but it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li>I will definitely still purchase product from Lime Crime, but not this particular item.</li>
            <li>I put on a light application of concealer first, to neutralize the color of my eyelids, then a thin coat of Lime Crime.</li>
            <li>It is little bit hard when I try to squeeze out, but it seems to work good as far as helping eye shadows to stay on.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with my eyeshadow creasing with all primers including both low end and high end.  </li>
            <li>all the eye shadow base is great to apply the shipment was fast  </li>
            <li>and I have it in my personal and professional kits!</li>
            <li>and I suspect it was only half full.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been blaming my very dark and super thin eyelids (compared to rest of my face) up until this magic tube.</li>
            <li>a little bit rubbed on my lids before applying my eyeshadow kept my makeup looking fresh even though I was in and out of the pool throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I really hate spending a lot on a single makeup product, safe to stay most of my makeup is from the drug store.</li>

            <li> so it was hard finding a good one, but this one didn&#x27;t crease and shows the eyeshadow color</li>
            <li> Works too good hard to take off and I have very greasy eyelids.</li>
            <li> Being of Latin descent I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> Dries fast and doesn&#x27;t clump or leave a residue after an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> Really does what is said it would.</li>
            <li> and i ordered this wensday and came to me saturday which was fast</li>
            <li> I even used some really cheap eye shadow with it and it lasted all day and into the evening...would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> You have so much chemicals in the product.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different eye shadow primers (including: urban decay primer potion, too faced, Nyx, MAC paint pots, etc), and while some are better than others, most did crease some on me.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is that this is an absolute miracle</li>
            <li> I have really oily eyelids</li>
            <li> Item just as described fast shipping.</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny bit since it&#x27;s very strong and cakes over if you use too much).</li>
            <li> Better than any other primer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> but it stays in place, doesn&#x27;t crease and isn&#x27;t oily like so many other kinds.</li>
            <li> Finally once trying this I felt a little more comfortable, but it still wasn&#x27;t 100%.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it .</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for anyone who has oily lids like me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, a little goes a long way, it has good coverage</li>
            <li> You can use the cheapest eye shadow and your eyes will pop and last pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> Decided to give it a try because I was in need of a new shadow primer..</li>
            <li> swatched on my hand with an UD eye shadow using one of my new Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> This is long lasting and helps bring out the eyeshadows true color!  </li>
            <li> since I live in a hot country, have oily skin, and have to wear makeup for 12-14 hours daily.</li>
            <li> the product comes out through a small tube at the top which makes it easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, kept my eyeshadow fresh all day--the only time it started to crease was under direct sunlight on a very hot day after several hours of being outside.</li>
            <li> I was going to give up on wearing shadow completely until I found this.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I dont even use eyeshadow, I just wear Lime Crime alone, because it evens out the tone of my eyelids and gives it a natural look.</li>
            <li> I have very oily lids and my eyeshadow would crease and look gross by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It will make you eyeshadow last the whole day without any touch ups.</li>
            <li> Soft and silky to apply.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and they water and sweat when I wear makeup</li>
            <li> I would completely recommend trying it out.</li>
            <li> I was unable to leave seller feedback for this company, so I wanted to note the good customer service here.</li>
            <li> You do have to work at blending your eyeshadow a little more than usual, but it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li> I will definitely still purchase product from Lime Crime, but not this particular item.</li>
            <li> I put on a light application of concealer first, to neutralize the color of my eyelids, then a thin coat of Lime Crime.</li>
            <li> It is little bit hard when I try to squeeze out, but it seems to work good as far as helping eye shadows to stay on.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with my eyeshadow creasing with all primers including both low end and high end.  </li>
            <li> all the eye shadow base is great to apply the shipment was fast  </li>
            <li> and I have it in my personal and professional kits!</li>
            <li> and I suspect it was only half full.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been blaming my very dark and super thin eyelids (compared to rest of my face) up until this magic tube.</li>
            <li> a little bit rubbed on my lids before applying my eyeshadow kept my makeup looking fresh even though I was in and out of the pool throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I really hate spending a lot on a single makeup product, safe to stay most of my makeup is from the drug store.</li>
            <li> Please buy this product if you want a solid, incredibly long lasting primer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anybody who has trouble keeping their eye makeup in place.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to search for long-lasting eyeshadows, because Lime Crime will make any shadow last all day long.</li>
            <li> Silky, reliable, tiny amount goes a long long way.</li>
            <li> It feels a little sticky at first but after letting it set a few minutes and applying shadow it goes away.</li>
            <li> I do love Lime Crime, but this was severely disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Eyeshadow lasts all day long, and doesn&#x27;t crease.</li>
            <li> They both keep eyeshadow in place for a long time but Lime Crime&#x27;s lasts longer and, as I said before, intensifies color.</li>
            <li> Definitely lasts longer than other primers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Trying to look cute in a hot, steamy kitchen is almost laughable, but after a brutal 9 hour shift my shadow looks as fresh as it did when I put it on in the morning.</li>
            <li> I got this product a few months ago when my eyelids would no longer handle Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no creasing over the length of time the makeup was worn and sometimes that was over 8 hours.  </li>
            <li> I always get a crease with eyeshadow after a few hours this product definitely helped.</li>
            <li> Ater I used a wet wipe to remove, I pressed wet wipe on the shadow, none transferred, until I started scrubbing away at it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> The tube is kinda small, but a tiny dab is all it takes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve Tried Every Other Primer.</li>
            <li> But other than that, it works.</li>
            <li> Its kinda pricey but a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t  squeeze it hard enough to get it out of the tube.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it might work too well because if you make a mistake while putting on your makeup its hard to correct.</li>
            <li> wondering if there&#x27;s eye makeup running down my face.</li>
            <li> I will never buy another eyeshawdow primer other than this one!</li>
            <li> With other primers my lids get slick and creased after two hours.</li>
            <li> always creased within a few hours of wearing it.</li>
            <li> Lime Crime came to me on time, but the cream seems to be dried up</li>
            <li> I let that hang out for a few minutes, then apply my eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try it due to brand loyalty, but found it to be the same consistency and disappointment that Lorac offered.  </li>
            <li> It is a little thick</li>
            <li> By the time I squeezed out all the air and got to the product, there was very little in the tube.</li>
            <li> I have small eyes and my eye shadow</li>
            <li> I Usually Order From There</li>
            <li> The only thing i dont like is that blending is difficult after using this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also hard to remove at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> However, it is thick like a clay mask, and hard to push out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they sell this at Sephora or not, but if they don&#x27;t they should!</li>
            <li> I was tired of spending $ on primers.  </li>
            <li> I bought this even though I was skeptical that it would help make my eye makeup waterproof.  </li>
            <li> I hate how small it is</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost impossible to get off unless you wash your face or use a makeup remover wipe</li>
            <li> There is also an insane amount of product</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this stuff is wonderful!! I have small eyes and my eye shadow always creased within a few hours of wearing it. I was going to give up on wearing shadow completely until I found this. I can wear shadow all day! 12 hours or more and not a crease!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone threw almost 3 tubes of this primer and I can&#x27;t get enough. You can use the cheapest eye shadow and your eyes will pop and last pretty much all day. Never using another primer for my eyes ever. If only limecrime would make a face primer and foundations!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Eyeshadow lasts all day long, and doesn&#x27;t crease. Very user friendly, will be ordering again soon. Is also vegan which I love!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I&#x27;ve been using their line for years now and I can never go back to anything else. Recommend this for every girl who loves to use eyeshadow!</li>
            <li> I used to use Urban Decays eye shadow primer and still got creasing but after switching to lime crime primer I don&#x27;t ever have that issue. I live in Florida which is super humid and on top of that I have oily skin and the lime crime primer keeps my eye shadow in place all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok....way over priced. Won&#x27;t purchase again.  Urban Decay is still my favorite</li>
            <li> I have never tried this product before now.  Lime Crime came to me on time, but the cream seems to be dried up and I can&#x27;t  squeeze it hard enough to get it out of the tube. When I do get something out of the tube it does not spread evenly.  I will never buy makeup again online.</li>
            <li> First time trying this out and love it! It&#x27;s not greasy and not cakey and my eyeshadow lasts all day. Only downfall is if your mascara gets on your eyelid it&#x27;s almost impossible to get off unless you wash your face or use a makeup remover wipe but it takes off the product and eyeshadow thus you have to use more. You only need a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best eyeshadow primer I have ever used. Being of Latin descent I have very oily skin. It will work in my favor when I&#x27;m older, but right now it is a pain. My type of skin requires waterproof everything. With other primers my lids get slick and creased after two hours. I am also a chef and work in the restaurant industry. Trying to look cute in a hot, steamy kitchen is almost laughable, but after a brutal 9 hour shift my shadow looks as fresh as it did when I put it on in the morning. The tube is kinda small, but a tiny dab is all it takes. If this product ever gets discontinued I&#x27;ll cry. Please buy this product if you want a solid, incredibly long lasting primer. You won&#x27;t regret it. The best part is it is vegan and cruelty free! You have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> This is the only Eye primer that I have found that actually works and does not irritate my eyes. A little goes a long way.  Very nice mat finish.</li>
            <li> Best eyeshadow primer ever! I highly recommend it . I have oily skin and my eyeshadow stays put and will not crease. I will definitely buy this primer again.</li>
            <li> Better than any other primer I have ever used. I have tried everything for my oily lids, but nothing has worked. Finally once trying this I felt a little more comfortable, but it still wasn&#x27;t 100%. That was until I started doing my foundation,highlight,and concealer routine. When i do that I set my eyelids with Ben Nye Banana Powder and then I am good for the day.</li>
            <li> Works too good hard to take off and I have very greasy eyelids.</li>
            <li> I initially heard of this primer via the makeup artist Wayne Goss. I&#x27;m not sure if they sell this at Sephora or not, but if they don&#x27;t they should! The primer works fantastic, and allows your eyeshadow to glide on smoothly. Dries fast and doesn&#x27;t clump or leave a residue after an extended period of time. I also love how it&#x27;s Vegan-friendly! Great Product! Great Price!</li>
            <li> Best primer! A little goes a long way. Now that my teenage daughters have discovered it I&#x27;m back to order two more tubes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mediocre at best.  I do love Lime Crime, but this was severely disappointing.  I wanted to try it due to brand loyalty, but found it to be the same consistency and disappointment that Lorac offered.  The only eye primer I trust to perform long-term is Too Faced.  I will definitely still purchase product from Lime Crime, but not this particular item.</li>
            <li> Definitely lasts longer than other primers I&#x27;ve used. However, it is thick like a clay mask, and hard to push out of the tube. It&#x27;s also hard to remove at the end of the day.  Otherwise, kept my eyeshadow fresh all day--the only time it started to crease was under direct sunlight on a very hot day after several hours of being outside.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Really does what is said it would. Silky, reliable, tiny amount goes a long long way. Even a cheap eyeshadow applies eazy and evenly and brings a great look. Sometimes I dont even use eyeshadow, I just wear Lime Crime alone, because it evens out the tone of my eyelids and gives it a natural look.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Love this! I have very oily lids and my eyeshadow would crease and look gross by the end of the day. This is long lasting and helps bring out the eyeshadows true color!  I hate how small it is but I&#x27;m just going to use it sparingly. A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> the product comes out through a small tube at the top which makes it easier to apply. It dries fast and keeps my eyeshadow from creases very effectively esp. since I live in a hot country, have oily skin, and have to wear makeup for 12-14 hours daily. its a good investment.</li>
            <li> I Bought this lime crime eyeshadow helper because i have oily eye lids and i ordered this wensday and came to me saturday which was fast i tryed it all day today and it lasted me all day and after i wanted to see if it worked in water so i went swiming and my eyeshadow was perfect :) i would say this is real and it works for anyone whos scared to buy it it does work.</li>
            <li> I got this primer because I was searching for other Lime crime items on Amazon and read all the great reviews.  Decided to give it a try because I was in need of a new shadow primer..Ive tried em all on my oily lids and I&#x27;m loving this one the best! I like its thicker consistency and that&#x27;s its in a tube to squeeze out all the product when its almost done.</li>
            <li> By far this  is the best primer I&#x27;ve bought.  Worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews but this product is great.....I even used some really cheap eye shadow with it and it lasted all day and into the evening...would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I like it all the eye shadow base is great to apply the shipment was fast  everything was wonderful and this also&lt;br /&gt;is recommended to using the Lime Crime everyone should try it out for your self because I love it :)</li>
            <li> Love Lime Crime- it held my shadow even while swimming so they dont lie and they are vegan -- follow their instagram for insta wows errday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve Tried Every Other Primer. Nars, Urban Decay, Too Faced, Nyx Everything And Nothing Beats This. I Usually Order From There Website But I JUst Wanted To Primer And Nothing Else. So I Didn&#x27;t Wanna Pay 6 Bucks For ShippinG So I Went Here. Thank goodness</li>
            <li> I have struggled with my eyeshadow creasing with all primers including both low end and high end.  Everyone told me urban decay was the holy grail and I must try it which I did and guess what?  I had creasing too.  This was truly my last resort and last attempt to find something that worked. I was tired of spending $ on primers.  Well I am here to say that I FINALLY found something that keeps my shadow intact.  In fact it looks great at 10pm when I am removing my makeup and my makeup goes on at 7am.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> You have so much chemicals in the product.</li>
            <li> In my previous review I wrote this was the best primer ever, not so much anymore. Guess I moved on to bigger and better primers! This had a cakey feeling after my eyeshadow set over it, and it would still crease.</li>
            <li> I really hate spending a lot on a single makeup product, safe to stay most of my makeup is from the drug store. However, this product is well worth the price. It works so incredibly well. Not only does it keep your eyeshadow in place but it makes it rub proof, water proof and sweat proof. I have very oily eyelids and most drug store primers don&#x27;t work all that well for me. This stuff works so well in fact that I&#x27;ve even had dollar store eyeshadow stay in place all day. It also intensifies the color, making colors more bold and vivid. Before trying this product I had been using Urban Decay&#x27;s Eyeshadow Primer Potion. Though it&#x27;s also a fantastic product that definitely kept my shadow from creasing, Lime Crime Eyeshadow Helper is a better product. They both keep eyeshadow in place for a long time but Lime Crime&#x27;s lasts longer and, as I said before, intensifies color. I am sold on this product forever.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s the best eye shadow primer I have used.  I have super oily lids and my eye shadow creases and wears off. Not anymore. I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Love love it! It will make you eyeshadow last the whole day without any touch ups. Best part for us oily skin eyelids, it doesn&#x27;t crease!!!!</li>
            <li> Finally!!! I was always wondering how eye shadows stay intact on some women&#x27;s eyes.  I&#x27;ve been blaming my very dark and super thin eyelids (compared to rest of my face) up until this magic tube. It spreads easily, sticks like glue and lasts FOREVER! You can probably sleep with it and wake up still having your eyeshadows on! 😜😜</li>
            <li> I have tried several different eye shadow primers (including: urban decay primer potion, too faced, Nyx, MAC paint pots, etc), and while some are better than others, most did crease some on me.  To improve creasing, I dusted face powder prior to applying any primer, and it seemed to help some, but still some creasing occurred.  Then I heard of Lime Crime Eyeshadow Helper, and I must say, this does not crease on me!  Finally found one product that works on me...</li>
            <li> It is not summer yet, so I would not know if it would be waterproof until I sweat.  It is little bit hard when I try to squeeze out, but it seems to work good as far as helping eye shadows to stay on.</li>
            <li> SO WORTH IT. I absolutely love this primer and it works way too well (to the point where it doesn&#x27;t always come off in the shower). I used to have the Urban Decay one and some drugstore ones but they all ended up causing irritation and made my skin red. I got this product a few months ago when my eyelids would no longer handle Urban Decay. All I can say is that this is an absolute miracle and I recommend this to any makeup lover. 10/10 will continue buying. (Also I&#x27;ve been using it every day for about 2 months and it&#x27;s not even close to being finished. You only need a tiny bit since it&#x27;s very strong and cakes over if you use too much).</li>
            <li> The best primer I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Love this! I have tried Lancôme,Urban Decay, Dior and my eyeshadow would always crease. I have oily skin so it was hard finding a good one, but this one didn&#x27;t crease and shows the eyeshadow color well. Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Soft and silky to apply. Works really good and does keep eyeshadow on all day. The only thing i dont like is that blending is difficult after using this product. But other than that, it works.</li>
            <li> The lime crime primer is the best I have ever used.  It applies easily and shadows of any brand adheres to it well.  I had absolutely no creasing over the length of time the makeup was worn and sometimes that was over 8 hours.  The colour of the eye shadow did not fade either.  The new packaging is great because I prefer the tube so that I am not paranoid about my product drying out as I was with the pot and I can still get to all of the product.  There is also an insane amount of product so I am very excited about that, its even more product than the previous packaging and the tube is full to capacity.  This primer is worth every penny and I have it in my personal and professional kits!</li>
            <li> first time ever trying the line limecrime amazing every product I ordered and I think there were 6, so glad I did thank you so much</li>
            <li> I always get a crease with eyeshadow after a few hours this product definitely helped. I still got a crease but it was after 8 hours. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> As someone who loves dramatic makeup and bright pigments, this primer is perfect! I have sensitive eyes and they water and sweat when I wear makeup but with this primer it doesn&#x27;t budge all day, all night. Its kinda pricey but a little bit goes a long way! I will never buy another eyeshawdow primer other than this one! Love it</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than anything else I have ever tried. It is a little thick but it stays in place, doesn&#x27;t crease and isn&#x27;t oily like so many other kinds. I would completely recommend trying it out.</li>
            <li> Product more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product beyond description&lt;br /&gt;I advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it personally&lt;br /&gt;I am very wonderful wonderful performance&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.</li>
            <li> Love the product. I have hooded eyes and oily lids. my eye liner doesn&#x27;t transfer to the top of my eye lid. Last about 8 hours</li>
            <li> Way better than I imagined. swatched on my hand with an UD eye shadow using one of my new Sigma brushes. Ater I used a wet wipe to remove, I pressed wet wipe on the shadow, none transferred, until I started scrubbing away at it. Exactly what I was hoping for in terms of quality. Highly impressed.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! the best for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have really oily eyelids and I have tried every eyeshadow primer out there. This is the only thing that has worked for me. Now I can wear eyeliner and eyeshadow without creasing and smudging. It lasts all day and I don&#x27;t have to check my eyes throughout the day wondering if there&#x27;s eye makeup running down my face. Even if I&#x27;m not wearing eyeshadow, I still use this primer to keep my eyelids from getting oily. I highly recommend this product for anybody who has trouble keeping their eye makeup in place. The only drawback is that it might work too well because if you make a mistake while putting on your makeup its hard to correct.</li>
            <li> I love this primer! it does an amazing job when applying shadows! you will get those bold colors you want</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I really hesitated to try this as I&#x27;ve not been very impressed with previous eyeshadow primers I&#x27;ve used. I highly recommend this, a little goes a long way, it has good coverage an it definitely makes my shadow pop and last throughout the day. It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that truly defeats creasing. Really wonderful. It feels a little sticky at first but after letting it set a few minutes and applying shadow it goes away.</li>
            <li> This is goooooooooood stuff. Limecrime products are perfection 99% of the time</li>
            <li> Product did not look like this and I suspect it was only half full.</li>
            <li> Finally! A primer that WORKS! I got this product in last week. I put on my make-up at 7AM and don&#x27;t take it off until 830-9pm. Eye shadow &amp; liner still looks great. I got home one evening to mow &amp; weed eat my. yard (90 degrees out and humid), sweaty when I went in to take a shower. I knew this was going to be the test...eye makeup looked great! No oily eye lids! Now just to let you know, I don&#x27;t put a lot of make-up on. Just enough to highlight my eyes. Very satisfied customer. Done searching for that perfect primer...I FOUND IT!</li>
            <li> Item just as described fast shipping. Will shop again.</li>
            <li> I was super stoked to try this stuff out, after reading many rave reviews.&lt;br /&gt;While my eyeshadow looks great when I leave the house, it is heavily creased by mid-day.&lt;br /&gt;Urban Decay shadow primer works better for me, but I&#x27;m still on the hunt for an all-day primer.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely not waterproof.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought this even though I was skeptical that it would help make my eye makeup waterproof.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a little bit rubbed on my lids before applying my eyeshadow kept my makeup looking fresh even though I was in and out of the pool throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I no longer have to search for long-lasting eyeshadows, because Lime Crime will make any shadow last all day long. I put on a light application of concealer first, to neutralize the color of my eyelids, then a thin coat of Lime Crime. A tiny dab is all that&#x27;s needed. I let that hang out for a few minutes, then apply my eyeshadow. You do have to work at blending your eyeshadow a little more than usual, but it&#x27;s completely worth it. I used to have to touch up eyeshadow many times a day, and now it stays on until I take it off. I even slept in my eye makeup one night and woke up to find it still looking pretty good. That has NEVER happened before. I would highly recommend this for anyone who has oily lids like me. When the &amp;#34;ugly lights&amp;#34; come up in the bar at the end of the night, you&#x27;ll still have fabulous eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/2/16: I ordered my second tube of Lime Crime from Beauty Inside, and it when I went to use it for the first time, the tube was full of mostly air. By the time I squeezed out all the air and got to the product, there was very little in the tube. I understand this is sold by weight and not volume, and it&#x27;s normal for some air to be in the tube, but this was not the full amount. I contacted Beauty Inside, and they apologized and immediately shipped me a replacement. I was unable to leave seller feedback for this company, so I wanted to note the good customer service here. Also, I&#x27;ve been using Lime Crime every day and still love the product. I wouldn&#x27;t use any other eyeshadow primer.</li>
