            <li>These are the two best scents of Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s hand soap, and I&#x27;ve never been able to find them in stores.</li>
            <li>Smells so good you&#x27;ll want to eat your hands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Meyer&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>It feels good to use it to know you are not wrecking nature.</li>
            <li>Meyers is great product but the vendor made the product look very cheap and unattractive.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Rhubarb scented soap!</li>
            <li>Love this hand soap!  </li>
            <li>I love these hand soaps!</li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>Have loved most of Mrs. Meyers products, but this hand soap has a \\&quot;gooey\\&quot; kind of consistency that I am not fond of.</li>
            <li>The Rhubarb is nice</li>
            <li>I like it cleans and smells nice</li>
            <li>So appreciative of no animal testing with this company.</li>
            <li>They are a tad sticky but the smells, particularly the parsley, are wonderful.</li>
            <li>Both of these items lather nicely and have a good clean scent</li>
            <li>Very good cleaning power, but still gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>However, the natural and not over-whelming scents are delightful.</li>
            <li>Lovely mild yet effective soaps, with light and pleasant fragrances.</li>
            <li>I just love the fragrances of this soap maker.  </li>
            <li>I do love it.  </li>
            <li>I love these products.</li>
            <li>Parsley is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>These soaps come out to more than $7 per bottle...and after purchasing I saw that Bed, Bath and Beyond had them for $3.99.  </li>
            <li>I still love the lemon and Lavender scents the most.</li>
            <li>Just OK.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE Mrs Meyer&#x27;s products and have used their soaps before.  </li>
            <li>Sticks to your hands and fingers like filth, only it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>Love the scent of most Mrs. Meyers products, but the parsley and rhubarb are my favorites.  </li>
            <li>These were just lovely.</li>
            <li>but I love the product.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that they have olive oil added.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the smell of both</li>
            <li>I love Mrs. Meyers, but the stores don&#x27;t carry all of the scents I like.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>Rhubarb smells a bit sweeter, but still nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>My wife is pregnant and these all natural products are awesome.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing, clean and has scents that beat on the shelf soap.</li>
            <li>Fine cleansing for every day hand soap.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like these as much as the geranium, but still nice.  </li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!!!</li>
            <li>Really very nice lasting scent.  </li>
            <li>I should have been more careful when buying and not assume Amazon offers the best price.  </li>
            <li>I always use Mrs Meyer&#x27;s products and once again, these are fun scented additions to my kitchen!</li>
            <li>Mrs Meyers would&#x27;ve been the prime choice to keep those hands so fresh and so clean clean.</li>
            <li>They are clean and fresh and not perfumey.</li>
            <li>These hand soaps smell so fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like Rhubarb and is very fresh and crisp!</li>
            <li>Made the switch to more natural cleaners.</li>
            <li>The parsley scent is fresh and clean (doesn&#x27;t really smell like parsley, though).  </li>
            <li>The scents are awesome and it doesn&#x27;t dry your hands out like a lot of other soaps do</li>
            <li>Big bright orange stickers placed directly on the product  </li>
            <li>I like trying different scents &amp; found them both interesting.</li>
            <li>I love Mrs. Meyers household products and use them religiously for laundry and spraying my counter-tops.</li>
            <li>Overall, if I was wealthy or need a fancy soap I would purchase these.</li>
            <li>I love these hand soaps, but I gave it one star because I only got one bottle of soap instead of two.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I was shorted a product by Amazon</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t afford to spend this much money for hand soap every month.</li>
            <li>dispenser bottles work very well, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t been able to find it other places than Amazon.</li>
            <li>Parsley had a crisp, clean scent; Rhubarb a harder one to describe - can a scent be &#x27;tart&#x27;?</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I received a note back right away with a refund, and to keep or give away the product I got by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I liked the scent &amp; feel of the soaps but the &#x27;squirt&#x27; kept coming out at the wrong angle &amp; making a mess on my counter top.</li>
            <li>#34;This is a set DO NOT SEPARATE.&amp;#34; I was unable to remove the bright stickers off of the soap and was embarrassed to put in our guest bath.</li>
            <li>But they are way too expensive for the amount of soap you receive and for the fantastic smell to just ware off quickly.</li>
            <li>Their refreshing and herby scents make doing chores a little less onerous.</li>
            <li>No horrible over-the-top phony fragrance...very natural and works well.</li>

            <li> No horrible over-the-top phony fragrance...very natural and works well.</li>
            <li> All of the Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s products can be purchased directly from the manufacturer for 3.99 (hand soaps) and between 4.99 and 7.99 for almost all the other products.  </li>
            <li> Received earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> If you hate heavily perfumed soap, these are a great alternative.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is because it is winter or this particular fragrance but both of these dry my hands out severely and the fragrance seems stronger than the others I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount of the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But as with the dish soap, I have found that the hand soap does not lather well at all, whether I use hot or cold water, so I will not be repurchasing these.</li>
            <li> These soaps arrived a little leaky, a theme for ordering liquid soap online.</li>
            <li> like that after using them, the scent seems to stick around for a little while on your hands</li>
            <li> hands tend to be on the dry side &amp; I usually have to apply a hand lotion after washing, but no more.</li>
            <li> I wasted my time buying this soap.  </li>
            <li> We usually get lemon verbena</li>
            <li> Even my local grocery store, which tends to be insanely expensive had them for $4.50 per bottle.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the soap is rather thin and doesn&#x27;t last long, making it a very poor value for the money.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, if Outkast had a soap sponsor for their Stankonia album</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that one of the soap containers arrive open and leaked all over the box - very poor packaging</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong!</li>
            <li> and I was a bit shocked.</li>
            <li> I got 2 parsley and to say I was disappointed is an understatement.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Great hand soap and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m all about the rhubarb</li>
            <li> Very good cleaning power, but still gentle on the skin. Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I just love the fragrances of this soap maker.  Unfortunately, the soap is rather thin and doesn&#x27;t last long, making it a very poor value for the money.  I will buy this brand when I have some extra money and want to treat myself.  I do love it.  I just can&#x27;t afford to spend this much money for hand soap every month.</li>
            <li> Both are fresh/clean scents.  We usually get lemon verbena but it&#x27;s a nice change - and the parsley is awesome!</li>
            <li> Smells so good you&#x27;ll want to eat your hands.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Rhubarb scented soap! It smells exactly like Rhubarb and is very fresh and crisp!</li>
            <li> I love these products. Parsley is my favorite.  I ordered 2 each of parsley and rhubarb, but got lemon verbena and lavender. I received a note back right away with a refund, and to keep or give away the product I got by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;I have started to order everything I can find from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this hand soap!  Found it staying overnight at a B&amp;B inn and had to have it!</li>
            <li> I should have been more careful when buying and not assume Amazon offers the best price.  These soaps come out to more than $7 per bottle...and after purchasing I saw that Bed, Bath and Beyond had them for $3.99.

            <li> I still love the lemon and Lavender scents the most.</li>
            <li> Made the switch to more natural cleaners. Scents are wonderful. Planning on reusing the bottles and buy the refill option.</li>

            <li> I always use Mrs Meyer&#x27;s products and once again, these are fun scented additions to my kitchen! You cannot go wrong!</li>
            <li> Just OK.  Won&#x27;t purchase again.  Switched to Puracy.</li>
            <li> I use these at the kitchen sink.  The parsley scent is fresh and clean (doesn&#x27;t really smell like parsley, though).  Rhubarb smells a bit sweeter, but still nice and clean.  Both are great hand soaps for the kitchen.</li>
            <li> Big bright orange stickers placed directly on the product  that say &amp;#34;This is a set DO NOT SEPARATE.&amp;#34; I was unable to remove the bright stickers off of the soap and was embarrassed to put in our guest bath. Meyers is great product but the vendor made the product look very cheap and unattractive.</li>
            <li> Great scent.  Really very nice lasting scent.  Doesn&#x27;t LATHER the best though. Fine cleansing for every day hand soap.</li>
            <li> I love these hand soaps! They smell great. I read somewhere that the fragrance may be synthetic, but I have no fragrance allergies so that&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Mrs Meyer&#x27;s products and have used their soaps before.  I am not sure if it is because it is winter or this particular fragrance but both of these dry my hands out severely and the fragrance seems stronger than the others I have used in the past.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t get my rhubarb!!!!!  I got 2 parsley and to say I was disappointed is an understatement.  Boooo</li>
            <li> Great product, great deal! This will be on my radar to purchase again. My wife is pregnant and these all natural products are awesome.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that one of the soap containers arrive open and leaked all over the box - very poor packaging but I love the product.</li>
            <li> I liked the scent &amp; feel of the soaps but the &#x27;squirt&#x27; kept coming out at the wrong angle &amp; making a mess on my counter top. I&#x27;ve used liquid hand soaps for years &amp; positioned the bottles in the same place for years so its definitely the design of this products dispenser that&#x27;s the problem. I ended up discarding them. I like trying different scents &amp; found them both interesting. Parsley had a crisp, clean scent; Rhubarb a harder one to describe - can a scent be &#x27;tart&#x27;?</li>
            <li> These soaps arrived a little leaky, a theme for ordering liquid soap online. They are a tad sticky but the smells, particularly the parsley, are wonderful. I put parsley in the kitchen and rhubarb in the bathroom. Would consider ordering again</li>
            <li> I love Mrs. Meyers household products and use them religiously for laundry and spraying my counter-tops. Their refreshing and herby scents make doing chores a little less onerous. I purchased a Rhubarb and a Bluebell soap at Target for $3.99 each, cheaper than what is listed here. But as with the dish soap, I have found that the hand soap does not lather well at all, whether I use hot or cold water, so I will not be repurchasing these.</li>
            <li> These hand soaps smell so fresh &amp; clean. I love the fact that they have olive oil added.&lt;br /&gt;My hands tend to be on the dry side &amp; I usually have to apply a hand lotion after washing, but no more. You only need a small amount of the product.&lt;br /&gt;I like that after using them, the scent seems to stick around for a little while on your hands, The bathroom even smells nice too, which is a bonus!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing, clean and has scents that beat on the shelf soap. It feels good to use it to know you are not wrecking nature.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of both</li>
            <li> These soaps smell so delicious!! But they are way too expensive for the amount of soap you receive and for the fantastic smell to just ware off quickly. Overall, if I was wealthy or need a fancy soap I would purchase these.</li>
            <li> I love these hand soaps, but I gave it one star because I only got one bottle of soap instead of two. This is the first time I was shorted a product by Amazon and I was a bit shocked.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast Shipping!!!</li>
            <li> I love Mrs. Meyers, but the stores don&#x27;t carry all of the scents I like.  The rhubarb and parsley scents are great!</li>
            <li> I like it cleans and smells nice</li>
            <li> Received earlier than expected. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like these as much as the geranium, but still nice.  Not overly fragrant, as with all the Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried.  So appreciative of no animal testing with this company.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. The scents are awesome and it doesn&#x27;t dry your hands out like a lot of other soaps do</li>
            <li> These are the two best scents of Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s hand soap, and I&#x27;ve never been able to find them in stores.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Beware the enormous markup on this site.  All of the Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s products can be purchased directly from the manufacturer for 3.99 (hand soaps) and between 4.99 and 7.99 for almost all the other products.  Just saying.</li>
