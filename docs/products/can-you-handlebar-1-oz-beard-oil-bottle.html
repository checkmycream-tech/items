            <li>I&#x27;ve been using CanYouHandlebar for about three years, and everything I&#x27;ve tried has been of great quality.</li>

            <li>Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and he enjoyed it!</li>
            <li>So here&#x27;s my honest opinion of Handlebar&#x27;s oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>All views and opinions are 100% my own and have neither been paid for nor sponsored.</li>
            <li>I received this beard oil through a promotion for an honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I did this to two fingers: rub them together to warm up the oil and then rub it into the beard.</li>
            <li>This review is my honest opinion .</li>
            <li>Thanks you for the wonderful oil!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall its a good product, but it seems bit too strongly scented to use it all the time for my man-mane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not like a perfume at all... more like ripe citrus orchard or something.</li>
            <li>It was just overwhelming in strength.  </li>
            <li>It had a refreshing  citrus lavender scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell was overwhelming on my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and he has really enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it feels ..</li>
            <li>I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>handsome.</li>
            <li>best beard oil I have found in 2 years and 14 different oils I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to order more.</li>
            <li>and I love the aroma.</li>
            <li>LOVE the smell of the oil</li>
            <li>Of the oils I&#x27;ve tried, this is my favorite.    </li>
            <li>container has no dropper or drip top.</li>
            <li>find that the thicker oils tend to comb/brush through the beard more evenly and get more penetration which helps them do a better job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The two stars awarded in my review score reflect my opinion that I think this company can do better and is</li>
            <li>but then again I did like this one better than he did.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.  </li>
            <li>] Enjoy a short review of this excellent beard</li>
            <li>Smells great, keeps beard soft.</li>
            <li>but I think the primary scent I get from this is more of a sweet/fruity scent.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and makes my beard really soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave any strong odors or smells after an hour of application.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You can&#x27;t just expect to grow the perfect &amp;#34; man-mane&amp;#34; without a little coaching.</li>
            <li>The oil has a strong smell, not bad, just strong.</li>
            <li>He said it was easy to apply, wasn&#x27;t greasy at all, and made all his &amp;#34;fly always&amp;#34; lay flat lol.</li>
            <li>I  received this product for free to test and try out, to give feedback on the quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have gotten this for him because it not only helps in the appearance of how the beard looks, making it look softer and shinier because of the amazing ingredients in it, but he even said it doesn&#x27;t itch like it did before, and most importantly to me</li>
            <li>My beard blows i the wind around in the wind because this oil is so light.</li>
            <li>In order to keep my beard conditioned and comfortable, I use a beard oil every morning.  </li>
            <li>that happens, I would be happy to give them a try again in the future.</li>
            <li>My he-hair is important and needs to receive special attention.</li>
            <li>The Initiative fragrance was not his favorite by far as it had an extremely strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>He tested all 3 fragrances and gave me his thorough opinion which was super</li>
            <li>oil itself seems adequate.</li>
            <li>It is not unpleasant, but it is not in any way what it is advertised as.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My beard felt great and soft, not heavy but not as light with too much oil.  </li>
            <li>I personally use oils--like rose hip and jojoba--for my hair and nails</li>
            <li>And knowing what kind of quality ingredients were used to create this oil, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying from CanYouHanlebar again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this particular oil for months now and am about ready to buy some more.  </li>
            <li>I applied the beard oil on the right side of his face and it made his beard shine.</li>
            <li>The smell is good too, but doesn&#x27;t last long (which is fine by me).  </li>
            <li>pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mine reminded more of a haystack than a quality beard, and it&#x27;s unruly behavior finally got to me.</li>
            <li>My daughter described the smell as &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add to it, the product packaging is first rate in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Smells great and even holds for a long time when brushed in!</li>
            <li>I had no idea how to apply the oil and applied a bit too much the first time around.</li>
            <li>Extremely fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I REALLY like it as does my wife.</li>
            <li>it leaves my beard feeling so soft and fresh..</li>
            <li>My hubby really needed something for his beard.  </li>
            <li>With proper beards coming back in style, I decided I&#x27;d jump in and see what kind of quality beard</li>
            <li>The product itself does a nice job keeping the unruly beard under control, without feeling greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li>After the first application--and a little online research--he is in love with these beard oils.</li>
            <li>A dropper cap is really important to get the same amount out each day, particularly if it&#x27;s early and you are just interested in getting out the door to work.  </li>
            <li>You do not need to use  a lot of the oil on your beard because a small amount works effectively.</li>
            <li>A little goes along ways and he&#x27;s super excited to have his manly beard</li>
            <li>This is my first time ordering from CanYouHandlebar.&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself, while it contains quality ingredients and does an adequate job, has some major flaws especially for the price</li>
            <li>He is excited to use this on his eyebrows as well, since they are really dry.</li>
            <li>the smell doesn&#x27;t last too long, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to deal with that.</li>
            <li>After watching a few of them I got a better understanding of how to use their products.</li>
            <li>This makes dispensing a small amount of oil accurately and in the amount desired, near impossible and makes for a lot of waste.&lt;br /&gt;Using the more standard drip top insert in the bottle would completely alleviate this issue and add almost nothing to the overall cost but would greatly improve customer</li>
            <li>It does moisturize the skin and gives a nice sheen to the beard hair (I have a thick red beard, noted for more coarse nature of red hair)&lt;br /&gt;It relieves the usual &amp;#34;beard itch&amp;#34; that those with a full beard are familiar with and I suppose that would be a point of major importance for some.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>He said that after the first application it felt instantly softer to him.</li>
            <li>Other beard oils have a more medicinal approach with droppers and such.</li>
            <li>Now I won&#x27;t complain so much about his facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Brings out the shine in my whiskers and makes em soft to the touch as well.  </li>
            <li>It keeps it clean and moisturized since we all know that facial hair tends to be rough and it also helps to keep that pesky dandruff away.</li>
            <li>BUT the fragrance isn&#x27;t exactly what I had expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used my beard oil daily for a few weeks now and will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>over all impression is that while it seems that the intent is in place to make a quality beard oil, the end user experience left much to be desired, especially for the premium price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once I told him I ordered these he seemed very intrigued by the idea because he was always stating how his beard was so rough and course.</li>
            <li>Personally, I like to apply this oil almost directly after a shower, while my beard is somewhat damp.</li>
            <li>It completely dissipated within a couple hours of application, so definitely not an all day thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>am sure they did not send out something so poor on purpose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>sincerely hope that CanYouHandlebar will step up their game and try to implement some measure of the things I noted in my review, as I feel they are important.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, and I&#x27;ve seen my beard change from unruly, scratchy and wild, to tame, shaped and dare I say...</li>
            <li>Sure enough, over the past few days, his beard has started to relax and get softer from the moisturizing effects of the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a very tough time finding a beard oil that I liked smelling all day long until I found this!  </li>

            <li> It does moisturize the skin and gives a nice sheen to the beard hair (I have a thick red beard, noted for more coarse nature of red hair)&lt;br /&gt;It relieves the usual &amp;#34;beard itch&amp;#34; that those with a full beard are familiar with and I suppose that would be a point of major importance for some.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> He said that after the first application it felt instantly softer to him.</li>
            <li> Other beard oils have a more medicinal approach with droppers and such.</li>
            <li> Now I won&#x27;t complain so much about his facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Brings out the shine in my whiskers and makes em soft to the touch as well.  </li>
            <li> It keeps it clean and moisturized since we all know that facial hair tends to be rough and it also helps to keep that pesky dandruff away.</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used my beard oil daily for a few weeks now and will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> over all impression is that while it seems that the intent is in place to make a quality beard oil, the end user experience left much to be desired, especially for the premium price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once I told him I ordered these he seemed very intrigued by the idea because he was always stating how his beard was so rough and course.</li>
            <li> Personally, I like to apply this oil almost directly after a shower, while my beard is somewhat damp.</li>
            <li> It completely dissipated within a couple hours of application, so definitely not an all day thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> am sure they did not send out something so poor on purpose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> sincerely hope that CanYouHandlebar will step up their game and try to implement some measure of the things I noted in my review, as I feel they are important.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much, and I&#x27;ve seen my beard change from unruly, scratchy and wild, to tame, shaped and dare I say...</li>
            <li> Sure enough, over the past few days, his beard has started to relax and get softer from the moisturizing effects of the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> only complaint with the oil is that it seems not as thick as others on the market that have the same ingredients, so I guess it comes down to blend and ratios</li>
            <li> /&gt;He said the oil had the consistency of a slightly thickened baby oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also seems that whatever they use for their scents is not very potent as it has no staying power.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The three stars deducted are as noted for the incorrect scent from what was advertised, the poor packaging considering the nature of the product, lack of any lasting power for the scent that was there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Smells great, keeps beard soft. Extremely fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I could be wrong but I think the primary scent I get from this is more of a sweet/fruity scent. Not like a perfume at all... more like ripe citrus orchard or something. I REALLY like it as does my wife. It&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> I got this oil for the mister to try. He tested all 3 fragrances and gave me his thorough opinion which was super entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t just expect to grow the perfect &amp;#34; man-mane&amp;#34; without a little coaching. So I tried Handlebar Beard oil. There were 3 different scents: initiative, wisdom, and temperance. My he-hair is important and needs to receive special attention. So here&#x27;s my honest opinion of Handlebar&#x27;s oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He said the oil had the consistency of a slightly thickened baby oil. The Initiative fragrance was not his favorite by far as it had an extremely strong fragrance. It was a pleasant smell. It was just overwhelming in strength.  It had a refreshing  citrus lavender scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: It moisturized my beard and stache pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: The smell was overwhelming on my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a good product, but it seems bit too strongly scented to use it all the time for my man-mane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion. All views and opinions are 100% my own and have neither been paid for nor sponsored.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of beard oil and I have to say that this stuff is awesome. A little goes a long way. Also, the citrus scent is refreshing and perfect for summer.</li>
            <li> Great beard oil for just before bed</li>
            <li> Came in on time. Conditions great BUT the fragrance isn&#x27;t exactly what I had expected. Reminds me of a citrus bathroom spray instead of a natural-smelling citrusy lavender -in my opinion. Good thing the smell doesn&#x27;t last too long, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to deal with that.</li>
            <li> Recently I was asked to give to try out this product and I knew I had the perfect model, my husband. I applied the beard oil on the right side of his face and it made his beard shine. I had to brush through his beard to evenly apply the oil. The oil has a strong smell, not bad, just strong. You do not need to use  a lot of the oil on your beard because a small amount works effectively.</li>
            <li> I received this beard oil through a promotion for an honest opinion. I got this for my daughters father since he&#x27;s a newbie at growing out his beard and he enjoyed it! He said it was easy to apply, wasn&#x27;t greasy at all, and made all his &amp;#34;fly always&amp;#34; lay flat lol. The smell was awesome and he said it lasted all day. A little goes along ways and he&#x27;s super excited to have his manly beard lol</li>
            <li> *I received this item at a discount for my unbiased review*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband decided to begin growing his beard a few weeks back and when I saw these bad boys I decided to grab them for him. I personally use oils--like rose hip and jojoba--for my hair and nails and I know how moisturizing it can be, so I knew he would appreciate some help. Once I told him I ordered these he seemed very intrigued by the idea because he was always stating how his beard was so rough and course. Once they arrived, he immediately asked me to help him apply it since he had never done it before. After the first application--and a little online research--he is in love with these beard oils. He said that after the first application it felt instantly softer to him. Sure enough, over the past few days, his beard has started to relax and get softer from the moisturizing effects of the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To apply: There is no dropper with these bottles so that can make it a bit difficult to get the proper amount. When I initially helped him apply it, I put my finger over the opening and tipped it over, to just cover my finger tip with some oil. I did this to two fingers: rub them together to warm up the oil and then rub it into the beard. Finish by combing through to help distribute the oils amongst the entire beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He does this daily and he has really enjoyed using it. He also has a woodsy scented one and an unscented one (which is great for days when his sinuses are feeling agitated).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, amazing oil, and with the citrus scent, this is perfect for days out and about when you want something light. He also hasn&#x27;t had any adverse effects when using this. He is excited to use this on his eyebrows as well, since they are really dry.</li>
            <li> Where was this stuff all my life? I tried it out as soon as I got out of the shower to put it on my beared after I had finished fixing it and I love the way it feels .. it leaves my beard feeling so soft and fresh.. It keeps it clean and moisturized since we all know that facial hair tends to be rough and it also helps to keep that pesky dandruff away. The smells of citrus is invigorating and calming.  I  received this product for free to test and try out, to give feedback on the quality. This review is my honest opinion .</li>
            <li> My hubby really needed something for his beard.  Presently, he was using conditioner for his beard.  I&#x27;m so glad to have gotten this for him because it not only helps in the appearance of how the beard looks, making it look softer and shinier because of the amazing ingredients in it, but he even said it doesn&#x27;t itch like it did before, and most importantly to me, it smells so good.  Now when I hug and kiss him, he has a nice pleasant citrus scent to his face.  Now I won&#x27;t complain so much about his facial hair.  We are both happy with this product.  I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by stating that I&#x27;m a novice &amp;#34;Beard Caretaker&amp;#34;. With proper beards coming back in style, I decided I&#x27;d jump in and see what kind of quality beard I could actually have. Mine reminded more of a haystack than a quality beard, and it&#x27;s unruly behavior finally got to me. This beard oil was recommended to me so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package came promptly and as described. I had no idea how to apply the oil and applied a bit too much the first time around. After the initial excitement was over, I took the time to research and find out how to use the product correctly. CanYouHandlebar has taken the time to put together some great informational and how-to videos. After watching a few of them I got a better understanding of how to use their products. Personally, I like to apply this oil almost directly after a shower, while my beard is somewhat damp. It doesn&#x27;t take much, and I&#x27;ve seen my beard change from unruly, scratchy and wild, to tame, shaped and dare I say...handsome. I should also mention that it smells great. My daughter described the smell as &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add to it, the product packaging is first rate in my opinion. It gives you the feel of belonging to a part of history almost forgotten. It speaks to the art of being a proper gentleman and quality. Other beard oils have a more medicinal approach with droppers and such. For me, as small as it is, that just takes away from the experience some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used my beard oil daily for a few weeks now and will definitely buy more when I run out. And knowing what kind of quality ingredients were used to create this oil, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying from CanYouHanlebar again. Go quality, or go home!</li>
            <li> best beard oil I have found in 2 years and 14 different oils I have tried.  Doesn&#x27;t leave any strong odors or smells after an hour of application.  Accidentally poured to much in my palm, but used it anyway to see if it would leave my beard feeling heavy.  My beard felt great and soft, not heavy but not as light with too much oil.  My beard blows i the wind around in the wind because this oil is so light.</li>
            <li> This works wonderfully! Keeps my unkempt beard together. Smells great and even holds for a long time when brushed in! I love it. Can&#x27;t wait to order more. However I just wish it were a bit cheaper. But for some reason all beard oil is expensive.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and makes my beard really soft.  I also put it on my earlobes for putting my wood plugs in which also keeps the plugs smelling very nice. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> A wonderful product. I have been using it Dailey for about three weeks now and I love the aroma. Check it out and order you some!</li>
            <li> Quality stuff. I&#x27;ve been using CanYouHandlebar for about three years, and everything I&#x27;ve tried has been of great quality. Including both dry and wet beard oils.</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell of the oil and it works great too! Brings out the shine in my whiskers and makes em soft to the touch as well.  I had a very tough time finding a beard oil that I liked smelling all day long until I found this!  Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This oil smells so good! Everyone keeps complimenting the scent my beard gives off. Also it feels soon good! Thanks you for the wonderful oil!</li>
            <li> I wash my thick, red beard daily (thanks Viking ancestors!), which can dry it out and cause it to itch.  In order to keep my beard conditioned and comfortable, I use a beard oil every morning.  I&#x27;ve used this particular oil for months now and am about ready to buy some more.  Of the oils I&#x27;ve tried, this is my favorite.    The product itself does a nice job keeping the unruly beard under control, without feeling greasy or heavy.  The smell is good too, but doesn&#x27;t last long (which is fine by me).  My only critique is about the packaging.  A dropper cap is really important to get the same amount out each day, particularly if it&#x27;s early and you are just interested in getting out the door to work.  Otherwise, this would get a solid 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering from CanYouHandlebar.&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself, while it contains quality ingredients and does an adequate job, has some major flaws especially for the price commanded.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;The container has no dropper or drip top. This makes dispensing a small amount of oil accurately and in the amount desired, near impossible and makes for a lot of waste.&lt;br /&gt;Using the more standard drip top insert in the bottle would completely alleviate this issue and add almost nothing to the overall cost but would greatly improve customer experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent:&lt;br /&gt;It is supposed to be Lavender, Bergamot and &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The only scent that is in any way discernible is lemon. It is not unpleasant, but it is not in any way what it is advertised as.&lt;br /&gt;It also seems that whatever they use for their scents is not very potent as it has no staying power. It completely dissipated within a couple hours of application, so definitely not an all day thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oil:&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself seems adequate. It does moisturize the skin and gives a nice sheen to the beard hair (I have a thick red beard, noted for more coarse nature of red hair)&lt;br /&gt;It relieves the usual &amp;#34;beard itch&amp;#34; that those with a full beard are familiar with and I suppose that would be a point of major importance for some.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint with the oil is that it seems not as thick as others on the market that have the same ingredients, so I guess it comes down to blend and ratios here.&lt;br /&gt;I find that the thicker oils tend to comb/brush through the beard more evenly and get more penetration which helps them do a better job. Something to think about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My over all impression is that while it seems that the intent is in place to make a quality beard oil, the end user experience left much to be desired, especially for the premium price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two stars awarded in my review score reflect my opinion that I think this company can do better and is well-intentioned.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure they did not send out something so poor on purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three stars deducted are as noted for the incorrect scent from what was advertised, the poor packaging considering the nature of the product, lack of any lasting power for the scent that was there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sincerely hope that CanYouHandlebar will step up their game and try to implement some measure of the things I noted in my review, as I feel they are important.&lt;br /&gt;If that happens, I would be happy to give them a try again in the future.</li>
            <li> I received 2 beard oils to review and test out to help you decided which is best. Of the 2 oils, this is not the one my husband reaches for. I think the smell has something to do with it but then again I did like this one better than he did. It will be on HIS face tho, so he says go for the Wisdom bottle. If you want to please your lady tho, this is it!</li>
