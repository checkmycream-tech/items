            <li>Smells great, too.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this shampoo!!</li>
            <li>Best shampoo in the world for oily fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>Exceptionally good for the price.</li>
            <li>I used to scoff at the thought that you had to spend more to have great hair - no longer.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo does what it says and the lather is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Still if you use this product a nice place to get it.</li>
            <li>This was fine, smelled appropriate, worked great.  </li>
            <li>I tend to get oily hair very easily</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best shampoos I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It can be tricky to find, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have very fine oily blond/gray hair.  </li>
            <li>Conditioner made me break out terribly, no idea what was in that bottle.</li>
            <li>I love these products.</li>
            <li>After trying SO MANY shampoos for my daughters&#x27; flaky scalps, we discovered this.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite shampoo</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of use, my hair was noticeably lighter and showing more body.</li>
            <li>Love this, was a great price, not so much now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I tried it and more importantly that it works!</li>
            <li>I guess the marketers think that sounds better</li>
            <li>Pleased with this product (nice light scent, decadent bubbles), as well as Subscribe and Save price.  </li>
            <li>This is very clean rinsing and does not build up even after years of use.  </li>
            <li>smells good and keep your hair and scalp squeaky clean, I have very oily hair and scalp</li>
            <li>I combine it with using a light, spray-on leave in detangler</li>
            <li>This is a great daily shampoo, rinses clean and no build up or residue.</li>
            <li>The shampoo felt great and produced a great lather in the beginning, but a week or two later, my hair probably got used to the shampoo and would get really oily on the latter part of the day, you could easily feel the residue from your scalp.</li>
            <li>I hope Matrix isn&#x27;t planning to replace the normalizing shampoo with the clean reset.</li>
            <li>This works great and doesn&#x27;t dry out her hair.  </li>
            <li>we got this in the large to try to save time from buying more often.</li>
            <li>I think price is comparable for the same volume but given my daily desire to shampoo as my hair gets too oily and then start to break, this shampoo has been excellent.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>my scalp feels clean and fresh and very enduring cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li>product is very good for thin oily hair.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback was the bottle that did not put a good protective seal on the top and had spilled a little.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it instantly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this bottle will last me 6 months as opposed to the bottle I used to use monthly of the inexpensive brands.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>It actually feels clean, light and super soft.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to be oily and some shampoos dry too much, some don&#x27;t clean good enough, and some shampoos leave residue.  </li>
            <li>And it cleans good enough so that I never feel oily even if I only shampoo once</li>
            <li>/&gt;Threw away my large bottle, and won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li>Gets it clean without stripping it bare.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s concentrated so you don&#x27;t need to use much, either.  </li>
            <li>and I have more time to devote to the other areas of my life, ie my kids!</li>
            <li>Similar but not the same exact product as the original Normalizing shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have a lot of problems with static electricity or having my hair feel coated and heavy.  </li>
            <li>Can wash my hair every other day and it is just fine.  </li>
            <li>I was told my whole life that I should only wash it every other day, but I just hadn&#x27;t been able to given the excess grease.  </li>
            <li>We wash every third day and we are clean, but ready for a wash by the next third day.</li>
            <li>Anyway, my daughter&#x27;s hair is really oily and she was never able to get it truly clean.  </li>
            <li>Matrix has another shampoo like this called Matrix Biolage Clean Reset (a white bottle with green lettering) - it doesn&#x27;t work as well as this Normalizing shampoo, it left are hair not as clean and dry after the first use.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels soft, is manageable</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair, however I have a lot of hair, so it&#x27;s super thick.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t go without washing my hair everyday, because my scalp would get super greasy if I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I never expected this product would do that!</li>
            <li>She has to use it everyday to keep her hair clean and only puts conditioner on the ends of her hair, not the scalp.  </li>
            <li>A bottle of this lasts much longer than other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I sometimes like to shampoo twice a day in the summer and this product will not dry me out when I use it twice a day.  </li>

            <li> I have a somewhat naturally greasy scalp which weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> so I had to do without it for a long time.  </li>

            <li> No lingering anti-grease benefits that I&#x27;ve noticed, which makes it notably not something I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
            <li> You may think this an expensive shampoo, but you use much less than you do with your typical Suave, Pantene etc (</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and have not liked anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s confusing.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for 15 years and when I ran out I was heart broken.</li>
            <li> It cleans my hair without leaving a residue behind and without drying it out or leaving it oily.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product a month ago, and i&#x27;m sorry to say that i am completely disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is by far one of the best shampoos I have ever used.  I used to scoff at the thought that you had to spend more to have great hair - no longer.  Despite the fact that I am in my 30&#x27;s, I have oily hair like a teenager, or should I say I did.  My sister in law bought me a bottle for Christmas and I fell in love with it instantly.  I no longer have to wash my hair on a daily basis and I no longer have issues with dandruff.  My hair feels soft, is manageable and I have more time to devote to the other areas of my life, ie my kids! You may think this an expensive shampoo, but you use much less than you do with your typical Suave, Pantene etc (a dollop truly does it&#x27;s duty) and you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair on a daily basis.  I&#x27;m sure this bottle will last me 6 months as opposed to the bottle I used to use monthly of the inexpensive brands.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> But dont buy the conditioner.  This was fine, smelled appropriate, worked great.  Conditioner made me break out terribly, no idea what was in that bottle.</li>
            <li> Smell is great. Hair is great. No color came off onto my towel after washing my hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this shampoo!! You can&#x27;t find it just everywhere. I have used it for 15 years and when I ran out I was heart broken. I am very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> The shampoo felt great and produced a great lather in the beginning, but a week or two later, my hair probably got used to the shampoo and would get really oily on the latter part of the day, you could easily feel the residue from your scalp. Not sure if it really had a cleansing effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Threw away my large bottle, and won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I love these products. Used them for years and my hair doesn&#x27;t get oily!</li>
            <li> Good, leaves my hair dried out a bit. Exceptionally good for the price. No lingering anti-grease benefits that I&#x27;ve noticed, which makes it notably not something I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
            <li> After trying SO MANY shampoos for my daughters&#x27; flaky scalps, we discovered this. BINGO! It has been the answer them. It can be tricky to find, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite shampoo and I have been using it for years. I tend to get oily hair very easily and this shampoo helps control the issue. You can&#x27;t beat the price. I will continue to buy it time and time again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I have used Biolage before. It wasn&#x27;t called normalizing shampoo they changed it. I used the product 2-3 times and my scalp broke out with pimples. I was very shocked that this product would cause that. I immediatly stopped using it and it took about a week for my scalp to heal! Well I had my doubts that this product would cause that so I decided to try it again and after using it twice I had a massive breakout of pimples on my scalp! It was very painful and this time the healing process took over a month! I never expected this product would do that! I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else had an experience like this!</li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse hair and have never found in 40 years a shampoo that really works for me. Until now. This cleans my hair with no buildup. I use a leave in conditioner after and my hair has never been healthier.</li>
            <li> smells good and keep your hair and scalp squeaky clean, I have very oily hair and scalp and this really helps allot for everyday use.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have oily hair and this shampoo is both cleansing and non-drying.  We wash every third day and we are clean, but ready for a wash by the next third day. Matrix has another shampoo like this called Matrix Biolage Clean Reset (a white bottle with green lettering) - it doesn&#x27;t work as well as this Normalizing shampoo, it left are hair not as clean and dry after the first use.  We switched back to this one (even though the ingredients are almost identical...). I hope Matrix isn&#x27;t planning to replace the normalizing shampoo with the clean reset.</li>
            <li> My daughters hair was having an oil problem, this has taken care of it, she loves this shampoo</li>
            <li> I have very fine oily blond/gray hair.  This is the best shampoo I have found - recommended by my hair stylist when it was carried in her salon.  I combine it with using a light, spray-on leave in detangler and I don&#x27;t have a lot of problems with static electricity or having my hair feel coated and heavy.  I have been using it for years and have not liked anything else I have tried.  My stylist has a different  supplier now and doesn&#x27;t carry this, so I order it on line.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo that I&#x27;ve ever used.  I used this for years and my local source stopped selling it so I had to do without it for a long time.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  So why is it so great?  It cleans my hair without leaving a residue behind and without drying it out or leaving it oily.  My hair tends to be oily and some shampoos dry too much, some don&#x27;t clean good enough, and some shampoos leave residue.  I sometimes like to shampoo twice a day in the summer and this product will not dry me out when I use it twice a day.  And it cleans good enough so that I never feel oily even if I only shampoo once a day.&lt;br /&gt;One of the posters said that it left residue after a few weeks of use.  My guess is that person used other products that caused build up.  I would use a clarifying shampoo for that problem then use this every day.  This is very clean rinsing and does not build up even after years of use.  It&#x27;s concentrated so you don&#x27;t need to use much, either.  A bottle of this lasts much longer than other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has been altered. I&#x27;m comparing it to the same shampoo bought at the store and it is totally watery.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is awesome. I have a somewhat naturally greasy scalp which weighs my hair down. After 2 weeks of use, my hair was noticeably lighter and showing more body. My only complaint is the price- it bounces around a lot!</li>
            <li> The best shampoo ever for every hair type.  Smells great, too.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a month ago, and i&#x27;m sorry to say that i am completely disappointed. Not only my hair is still very oily, after one day i had to shower my hair again, but it caused my hair dandruff, and also my ends very dried. I don&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> Love this, was a great price, not so much now.  Still if you use this product a nice place to get it.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair, however I have a lot of hair, so it&#x27;s super thick. I couldn&#x27;t go without washing my hair everyday, because my scalp would get super greasy if I didn&#x27;t. I was told my whole life that I should only wash it every other day, but I just hadn&#x27;t been able to given the excess grease.  I searched for a shampoo which would help me and I found it!  This shampoo does what it says and the lather is amazing.  I noticed a difference the very first time I used it. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy at all anymore. It actually feels clean, light and super soft. I&#x27;m so glad that I tried it and more importantly that it works!</li>
            <li> my scalp feels clean and fresh and very enduring cleaning my hair. The only drawback was the bottle that did not put a good protective seal on the top and had spilled a little.</li>
            <li> This is a great daily shampoo, rinses clean and no build up or residue.</li>
            <li> I always wondered what happened to shampoo for oily hair until my hairdresser told me it&#x27;s now called \\&quot;normalizing\\&quot; shampoo.  I guess the marketers think that sounds better but it&#x27;s confusing.  Anyway, my daughter&#x27;s hair is really oily and she was never able to get it truly clean.  This works great and doesn&#x27;t dry out her hair.  She has to use it everyday to keep her hair clean and only puts conditioner on the ends of her hair, not the scalp.  This is now a regular purchase for us.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 25 years on my curly hair.  Can wash my hair every other day and it is just fine.  Gets it clean without stripping it bare.  I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos but none work like this one so I keep coming back.</li>
            <li> product is very good for thin oily hair.  only drawback is price.  we got this in the large to try to save time from buying more often.</li>
            <li> Pleased with this product (nice light scent, decadent bubbles), as well as Subscribe and Save price.  Use as daily shampoo.</li>
            <li> Similar but not the same exact product as the original Normalizing shampoo. It&#x27;s not working as well it used to to get rid of oiliness. Smells the same.</li>
            <li> I now have another option. My hair could only take selsun blue before but now this product has stepped in. I think price is comparable for the same volume but given my daily desire to shampoo as my hair gets too oily and then start to break, this shampoo has been excellent.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo in the world for oily fine hair.  Please never stop making it ~ there is not much out there for our hair type!!!</li>
