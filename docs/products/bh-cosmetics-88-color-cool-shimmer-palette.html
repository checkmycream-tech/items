            <li>I am in love with this eye shadow!</li>
            <li>The quality of the shadow really is amazing for the price.</li>
            <li>The color scheme is AMAZING, the pics does the colors no justice.</li>
            <li>there are just too many shades in this one that are too bright and unwearable.</li>
            <li>AND THE COLORS ARE AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I own tons of palettes coastal scents,bhcosmetics,sedonalace</li>
            <li>With some eyeshadow primer beneath, you get good results from most of the colors.</li>
            <li>But still liked it though.</li>
            <li>The case is very nice and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t order more from your company!</li>
            <li>This comes with 2 sponge applicators which are pretty good quality and a mirror!</li>
            <li>THEY&#x27;RE VERY PIGMENTED AND BEAUTIFUL.</li>
            <li>But I absolutely love this palette.</li>
            <li>No where on the lightly padded envelope did it say to be handled with care!</li>
            <li>I love the shimmer in it too.</li>
            <li>Idk I want to love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just okay with it.</li>
            <li>I love make up.</li>
            <li>I hope to buy more product s froma BH cosmetics.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay</li>
            <li>It has so many colors I have yet to use them all.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the colors and the shimmer they have.</li>
            <li>Each color shimmers, some with more intensity than others.</li>
            <li>I really love that aspect of the product.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say these compare, but if you are looking to experiment or you just need a touch of a specific color, these are perfect.</li>
            <li>Come out great, Color really stands out.</li>
            <li>but this was just ok.</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re not the most pigmented colors</li>
            <li>i love this palette</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the product and will continue being a customer I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good quality of eyeshadow</li>
            <li>I Honestly think  you&#x27;re better off getting the higher quality shadows at the drug store .</li>
            <li>Some colors weren&#x27;t as vibrant, but for the most part I was very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I have many of their Palettes and this one is so fun!</li>
            <li>The colors wasn&#x27;t that strong</li>
            <li>It was my first time ordering makeup &#x27;eyeshadow&#x27; The colors are nice and vibrant some shimmer more than others, thats ok for me.</li>
            <li>palette is great for the price however looking back</li>
            <li>Like it didn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li>but they \\&quot;made it\\&quot; fit.</li>
            <li>It offers I good variety of shades in every color.</li>
            <li>The thing I love about BH is their shadows are very pigmented &amp; just overall great quality.</li>
            <li>i did have to clean it up.</li>
            <li>The pots are all dime sized , which is good enough.</li>
            <li>I really have enjoyed using my eye products.</li>
            <li>So I definitely suggest using a high quality primer, and you&#x27;ll be good to go!    </li>
            <li>overall i love this pallete!</li>
            <li>so when I learned about the BH cosmetics line I was shocked to see these huge palettes with so many colors for an awesome price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price...</li>
            <li>Eye shadow is so much fun to me</li>
            <li>Worth the money.  </li>
            <li>this product is so the rage right now.  </li>
            <li>This is my first palette that I have ever purchased and have tried everything as far as eye shadow from loreal, revlon, covergirl, and this is such a good deal for the variety and from what you buy at the store.</li>
            <li>Got it fast and un-destroyed!</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows are pretty and pigmented as the others</li>
            <li>Eh,  I use mostly Lorac, urban decay, too faced, mac etc.</li>
            <li>The shimmer is really pretty</li>
            <li>i used it every day the colors are so pretty.</li>
            <li>GREAT COLORS LONG LASTING</li>
            <li>but hey overall its OK.</li>
            <li>I first think when opened the package.</li>
            <li>and I love that it lasts long!  </li>
            <li>it really sets the color into the skin instead of making it look powdery and cakey.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented, I was unsatisfied with</li>
            <li>and I really like the shades.</li>
            <li>VERY WELL ALSO.</li>
            <li>I really do</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented -- what you see in the picture is what you get.</li>
            <li>Use with a primer to REALLY kick these colors into high gear!</li>
            <li>I do recommend using a primer to enhance the color, the colors blend very well.</li>
            <li>This palette is pretty cool especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this palette to anyone that wants a large selection.  </li>
            <li>I have other BH cosmetics palettes and I love them as well.</li>
            <li>Overall not a bad buy.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this palette to any eyeshadow junkie.</li>
            <li>much better quality than I expected!!!</li>
            <li>BH cosmetics is my new brand of makeup to buy.</li>
            <li>but some colors I love have been really hard to come by</li>
            <li>The amounts are smaller on the Shimmer Palette but they are still vibrant.</li>
            <li>you dont need much a bit goes a long way</li>
            <li>Overall I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants the variety and doesn&#x27;t want to break the piggy bank.</li>
            <li>All of the colors have major shimmer.</li>
            <li>However if you got a young teen</li>
            <li>This palette is rlly light, i thought it would be a little heavy</li>

            <li> The amounts are smaller on the Shimmer Palette but they are still vibrant.</li>

            <li> This palette is rlly light, i thought it would be a little heavy</li>
            <li> The only negative thing i have to say is be aware of the shipping I did receive it in a timely manner, but it came in a yellow bubble wrap enevelope.</li>
            <li> The only reason I rated it four stars is that the eye shadows don&#x27;t last very long without fading.</li>
            <li> I use a shadow for a base color, then apply the colors I wish to really pop and show on top.</li>
            <li> Colors are bright and when you use a base called &amp;#34;Insurance&amp;#34; colors stay on all day and don&#x27;t blow away.  </li>
            <li> AS LONG.</li>
            <li> &amp; if I did stumble across them it would be like one color for $20 or something.</li>
            <li> I do not experience any creasing or smearing, and I wear the shadow all day long with no re-apply.</li>
            <li> THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT 4 STARS IS BECAUSE THE ACTUAL COLORS ARE REALLY SMALL</li>
            <li> Wish it had a black in this palette but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> just as expected &amp; just as described</li>
            <li> The brushes that are included are crap use your own brushes and mirror, the shadows are dime size, dont have to use alot to get fab results.</li>
            <li> My package was tightly wrapped and came in a big box like my other BH palettes.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> BUT OTHER THAN THAT, NO COMPLAINTS AND MY MOTHER</li>
            <li> none of my other palettes have done this.</li>
            <li> It was wrapped and shipped very carefully</li>
            <li> I opened it up to find a mess 3 pans</li>
            <li> , it was a shimmery mess</li>
            <li> I use these everyday.</li>
            <li> was it had small palettes and</li>
            <li> half way gone they were broken and 5 pans popped out of the palette.</li>
            <li> Hardly any protection when i opened it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay to receive half broken product!</li>
            <li> My eyeshadows were intact when I received my order, there were none broken.</li>
            <li> some of the circles had came out and broken</li>
            <li> But 2ndly because the company that makes the product, BH cosmetics has some very bad reviews.</li>
            <li> but it looks so bad compared to my others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extreamly disappointed with this  </li>
            <li> I hate that</li>
            <li> From customers not receiving there products and then never getting a refund, and customer service being terrible and impossible to work with.</li>

            <li> I ordered this product from amazon, 1st because they&#x27;re the best. But 2ndly because the company that makes the product, BH cosmetics has some very bad reviews. From customers not receiving there products and then never getting a refund, and customer service being terrible and impossible to work with. So I would recommend ordering through amazon or another site. But I absolutely love this palette. It offers I good variety of shades in every color. The quality of the shadow really is amazing for the price. I think I paid around 24. It&#x27;s fairly creamy but I recommend putting an eye primer on before applying to reduce creasing. The case is very nice and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. This is my first palette that I have ever purchased and have tried everything as far as eye shadow from loreal, revlon, covergirl, and this is such a good deal for the variety and from what you buy at the store. The palette does come with 2 eye shadow felt tip brush applicators, But I would also recommend getting a good blending brush it really sets the color into the skin instead of making it look powdery and cakey. Overall I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants the variety and doesn&#x27;t want to break the piggy bank. It&#x27;s really worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This palette is pretty cool especially for the price. All of the colors have major shimmer. However, you must apply a really good primer before using the shadow. Aside from that, I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
            <li> When I received my order I already knew by looking at the way it was packaged that it would be damaged in the inside! No where on the lightly padded envelope did it say to be handled with care! I opened it up to find a mess 3 pans half way gone they were broken and 5 pans popped out of the palette. I&#x27;m extreamly disappointed with this  and I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t order more from your company! I would appreciate it if this could be resolved I didn&#x27;t pay to receive half broken product!</li>
            <li> The color scheme is AMAZING, the pics does the colors no justice. My eyeshadows were intact when I received my order, there were none broken. I can&#x27;t wait to use these colors, I know the colors will be beautiful. I have other BH cosmetics palettes and I love them as well. BH cosmetics is my new brand of makeup to buy. This palette was cheaper here than from BH themselves. My package was tightly wrapped and came in a big box like my other BH palettes.</li>
            <li> great product and a even better value.  this has it all and more!  this product is so the rage right now.  i thought i had issues figuring out what outfit to wear.</li>
            <li> palette is great for the price however looking back I would&#x27;ve gone for the metal mania palette instead. there are just too many shades in this one that are too bright and unwearable.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented, I was unsatisfied with the packaging-- two of my pots were out of their space. Although the size of this palette is very nice. It&#x27;s compact, so you can travel with it, and has all the basic shades and then some. I&#x27;ve tried some on already and I really like the shades. The pots are all dime sized , which is good enough. Overall not a bad buy.</li>
            <li> Awesome deliver for a person who has 3 items on order all together. Got it fast and un-destroyed! Plus I got the palette perfectly, nothing ruin at all like some of the reviews I read. The pigments are great to work with. Definitely a good product for those who consider buying palettes.</li>
            <li> I LOVE BH!!! I have many of their Palettes and this one is so fun! Theres bright shimmery colors that you can match with anything!</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY MOM AND THE COLORS ARE AMAZING. THEY&#x27;RE VERY PIGMENTED AND BEAUTIFUL. THEY STAY ON VERY WELL ALSO. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT 4 STARS IS BECAUSE THE ACTUAL COLORS ARE REALLY SMALL SO THEY WON&#x27;T LAST AS LONG. BUT OTHER THAN THAT, NO COMPLAINTS AND MY MOTHER AND I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> just as expected &amp; just as described</li>
            <li> I am really happy that i made this purchase. I love the colors, they are so beautiful. I get a lot of compliments on my eye shadow. I love the shimmer in it too. I will definitely recommend this eye shadow palette.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price... Absolutely love the product and will continue being a customer I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good quality of eyeshadow</li>
            <li> I own tons of palettes coastal scents,bhcosmetics,sedonalace I thought they were all the same but this one seems off to me. The plastic part that the shadows are in sticks up and has dents all over it. I just got it today none of my other palettes have done this. It&#x27;s like it was squeezed inside it. Like it didn&#x27;t fit but they \\&quot;made it\\&quot; fit. Idk I want to love it I really do but it looks so bad compared to my others. The eyeshadows are pretty and pigmented as the others it&#x27;s just the palette itself that is bothering me. I&#x27;m just okay with it.</li>
            <li> I love make up. Eye shadow is so much fun to me so when I learned about the BH cosmetics line I was shocked to see these huge palettes with so many colors for an awesome price. The thing I love about BH is their shadows are very pigmented &amp; just overall great quality. I honestly have been so happy since I got my palette. I purchased another palette from BH as well &amp; I have always had alot of shadows but some colors I love have been really hard to come by &amp; if I did stumble across them it would be like one color for $20 or something. Anyway I love that the palettes have reds, oranges &amp; yellows to play with! All I can say is I have hit the Jackpot with the BH brand and I feel anyone who loves eye shadow would be very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I use these everyday. I like all the palets from bh. They are affordable, give you a lot of options, and work well. They will break if dropped. I use them with a primer so they last all day. I wish they would come out with a travel case to put ur fav colors in.</li>
            <li> I really have enjoyed using my eye products. I am very happy and satisfied with all the beautiful colors. I hope to buy more product s froma BH cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Eh,  I use mostly Lorac, urban decay, too faced, mac etc. these shadows are good for kids to experiment but the quality of the shadows are not so great. It&#x27;s just okay I ended up giving to niece</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this palette! It was wrapped and shipped very carefully and none of the eye shadows were cracked.    I had read reviews on the Coastal Scents palettes, saying that they&#x27;re too chalky. These eye shadows are perfect! The colors are very pigmented -- what you see in the picture is what you get. They are also very easy to blend!    The only reason I rated it four stars is that the eye shadows don&#x27;t last very long without fading. So I definitely suggest using a high quality primer, and you&#x27;ll be good to go!    I&#x27;ll definitely be buying another palette from BH Cosmetics!</li>
            <li> Color are beautiful. I use it daily. I travel with it. Some of the colors are glittery. It has so many colors I have yet to use them all. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> The colors are AWESOME, blend well, and stay on. I HIGHLY recommend this palette to anyone that wants a large selection.  I never even heard of this brand, but I found it through a myhabit.com deal.  The shimmer is really pretty and I love that it lasts long!  What a steal for the price. I went back to Amazon to find this brand again, and bought a 2nd palette for work!</li>
            <li> much better quality than I expected!!!</li>
            <li> Colors are bright and when you use a base called &amp;#34;Insurance&amp;#34; colors stay on all day and don&#x27;t blow away.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> The colors are AWESOME, blend well, and stay on. I HIGHLY recommend this palette to any eyeshadow junkie. Use with a primer to REALLY kick these colors into high gear!</li>
            <li> I wear this eye shadow over my foundation on my eye lids. I do not experience any creasing or smearing, and I wear the shadow all day long with no re-apply. I absolutely love the colors and the shimmer they have. Each color shimmers, some with more intensity than others. If you are not a shimmer shadow person, then this isn&#x27;t the shadow for you. I use a shadow for a base color, then apply the colors I wish to really pop and show on top. I am in love with this eye shadow! Also, a little goes a long way. I really love that aspect of the product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after using the BH 1st edition color palette. The amounts are smaller on the Shimmer Palette but they are still vibrant. I am a MAC girl and I can&#x27;t say these compare, but if you are looking to experiment or you just need a touch of a specific color, these are perfect.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.  Some colors weren&#x27;t as vibrant, but for the most part I was very satisfied.  With some eyeshadow primer beneath, you get good results from most of the colors.</li>
            <li> It was my first time ordering makeup &#x27;eyeshadow&#x27; The colors are nice and vibrant some shimmer more than others, thats ok for me. I do recommend using a primer to enhance the color, the colors blend very well. I have tried different color combinations. Come out great, Color really stands out. The only negative thing i have to say is be aware of the shipping I did receive it in a timely manner, but it came in a yellow bubble wrap enevelope. Hardly any protection when i opened it, it was a shimmery mess some of the circles had came out and broken i did have to clean it up. threw away 3 shadows, put circles back into slots. The brushes that are included are crap use your own brushes and mirror, the shadows are dime size, dont have to use alot to get fab results. overall works for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette because of the great reviews. I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;m just spoiled but this was just ok. Some of the colors were pigmented, some weren&#x27;t. It was like hit or miss. Some were chalky . Urban decay these are not . I Honestly think  you&#x27;re better off getting the higher quality shadows at the drug store . However if you got a young teen In your life that&#x27;s just beginning to experiment with make up , its perfect. It has lots of beautiful colors  &amp; at a great price.</li>
            <li> Let me start of by saying i&#x27;m a makeup artist! So these eyeshadow palette is amazing! i ordered it from amazon! &lt;3 I got it in 2 days which is rlly fast!!! And i would say tht the colors are medium pigmented, they&#x27;re not the most pigmented colors but they work really great! This palette is rlly light, i thought it would be a little heavy but it wasn&#x27;t! the eyeshadows dont crease throughout the day which is awesome! This comes with 2 sponge applicators which are pretty good quality and a mirror! the mirror is perfect to see ur eye makeup! overall i love this pallete! Especially the blues and corally colors! i defiantly recommend it!</li>
            <li> i love this palette i used it every day the colors are so pretty. you dont need much a bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am soo buying another palette it works so cool and its just the best and I love the colors there awesome!!! :D</li>
            <li> GREAT COLORS LONG LASTING</li>
            <li> I bought this site unseen, I wish I could have seen it in reality but tbecause I just wanted a pallete I bought this the things I didn&#x27;t like about it was it had small palettes and the colors were glitter I hate that but that was my fault I wanted the matte but hey overall its OK.</li>
            <li> Great palette. Good shimmer for darker skin tones. Wish it had a black in this palette but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> The colors wasn&#x27;t that strong I first think when opened the package. But still liked it though.</li>
