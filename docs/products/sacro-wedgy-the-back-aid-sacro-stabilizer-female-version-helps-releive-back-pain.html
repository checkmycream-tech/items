            <li>I am a male--I cannot attest as to whether or not this works great for females.</li>
            <li>This is a great item.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so happy that I purchased the Sacrowedgy.</li>
            <li>Instead, it caused my great discomfort.  </li>
            <li>My condition had progressed so greatly because doctors kept dismissing my car accident pain as &amp;#34;woman pain.&amp;#34;  (insert eye roll here)</li>
            <li>I have great respect for Osteopathic medicine.</li>
            <li>Great releif for sciatiaca pain.  </li>

            <li>Good luck and good health.  </li>
            <li>But if you relax you will find that was a good thing too.  </li>
            <li>and when I found the perfect fit it was life changing.</li>
            <li>i decided how great it was working and ordered my own.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I feel a (good) release</li>
            <li>Te company is fabulous and takes pride in excellent customer service and helping customers.</li>
            <li>I used it, loved itâ€¦ then</li>
            <li>Voila, good to go.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product and I&#x27;m very glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>Between my excellent physical therapist and my sacro-wedgy I feel great!</li>
            <li>I just sat on it &amp; I felt so much better!</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Sacro Wedgy!  </li>
            <li>Still kind of figuring out exactly where to position it for best results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This device provides an amazing isolation of the sacrum.</li>
            <li>Just truly amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This Sacrowedgy is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing gadget.</li>
            <li>Works amazingly.</li>
            <li>it was well made and did feel nice.</li>
            <li>now own 3 of these stabilizers-</li>
            <li>Sharon, a thrilled customer</li>
            <li>At home I keep it handy (in my nightstand)</li>
            <li>I have now purchased my own sacrowedgy</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s honestly miraculous how I feel NOTHING.</li>
            <li>AS GOOD AS ADVERTISED, MAYBE BETTER.</li>
            <li>So grateful to have something so non-time-consuming, non-invasive, and so effective.  </li>
            <li>But Yes, I  liked the neck roll.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and works great.  </li>
            <li>Good price for such a wonderful amount of releif.</li>
            <li>Recommended by my chiropractor, good choice, easy to use.</li>
            <li>The staff is most kind and helpful too.    </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s kind of a baby about pain, so he didn&#x27;t give it more than about 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since been diagnosed as having a bulging lumbar vertebra, so anything that helps my spine regain the right curve is great.</li>
            <li>No amount of special exercises, stretches or anti-inflammatory has done any good in all that time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I learned that having the neck supported is very important</li>
            <li>I saw this on \\&quot;The Doctors\\&quot; and so glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li>I am here to tell you that after hobbling around for two years and being so out of whack, the more you use it the better you get.</li>
            <li>the name :)</li>
            <li>I was able to move the affected muscles during the day, not just during the session.</li>
            <li>using a tennis shoe with a sock stuffed in it works much better for me.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to use this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did I love it</li>
            <li>I have fell asleep on it more than once.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s helpful.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t sleep for more than one hour in any position (cadaver), so</li>
            <li>Need more tome with this to decide</li>
            <li>My husband and I have used the sacro wedgy for over a year now because of leg/sciatica pain and have been able to stabilize chronic conditions and strengthen our bodies.  </li>
            <li>Have told many people how well this inexpensive device can help.  </li>
            <li>I feel better than I have in 6 years.</li>
            <li>I might need more elevation to make the wedgy work better, and maybe better neck support as well.</li>
            <li>but I when I used it, I ended up in more pain than before use.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to see much better results.</li>
            <li>Would love to know what the wedgy people think about my experience.</li>
            <li>Doing it daily works best.</li>
            <li>I love this for myself.  </li>
            <li>I have recommened it to several friends (even bought one for my best friend) and they have all have had simliar results.  </li>
            <li>Love it,  and I am so glad I found this product</li>
            <li>quite a bit of time on their website looking for more info.</li>
            <li>This works better for me than anything else.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Needs more directions on how to position.</li>
            <li>A lifesaver:)</li>
            <li>and now I can go all day with no pain) and my SI joint is getting better as well.  </li>
            <li>so it may be better for someone with more padding in the butt.  </li>
            <li>Still helps enough I am happy I bought it!</li>
            <li>I make sure to do the rocking side to side and pelvic</li>
            <li>Try it - you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>Ok, feeling neutral.</li>
            <li>I was using a walker most of the time and in a lot of pain.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure I was positioning it correctly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not at all sure how I hurt my pirifomis, but I know just how I&#x27;ve gotten on the road to fixing it.  </li>
            <li>I figured it would be better than nothing.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t healed -- I was better.  </li>
            <li>And better was what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Once in a while now, I go a handful of weeks without using it, yet my spine continues to hold in a healthy position.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>In theory, it looks like it will work but for me, it just makes my back/hip hurt more.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this I loved it.</li>
            <li>Now, I get up in the morning without pain and drive and get out of the car without feeling like a cripple and taking 5 minutes to be able to walk more comfortably.  </li>
            <li>As a result, my diagnosis took an incredible amount of time and left me with a lot of pain and anxiety.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I lay on it for 10 to 15 mins while I read and am so relaxed, I can easily fall asleep.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to travel with as well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This is easy to use and easy to be comfortable with.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to sit on and easy to place also stays where you put it.  </li>
            <li>It might hurt a bit at first, I&#x27;m still adjusting to mine, but you do get more &amp; more used to it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell for sure if I have it positioned right since it feels kind of funny</li>
            <li>so it is amazing to me to finally find out the cause and be able to have relief after all these years!  </li>
            <li>hugely with self care between visits to my Rolfer</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference in my sciatica pain</li>
            <li>But after I had been upright for a minute or two, I noticed a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li>Two people I know have gotten great relief from using this regularly.</li>
            <li>The pads are cheap, so order one or two of them and try em out.  </li>
            <li>It has done more for me than 30 years worth of chiropractic adjustments and muscle relaxers ever did.  </li>
            <li>Not all back pain is SI pain, but this works great for SI joint dysfunction.</li>
            <li>i have used this several times and works great along with the neck support.  </li>
            <li>After using the Sacrowedgy just a few times, my hips feel the best they have since 1991!  </li>
            <li>Now,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m free of pain.</li>
            <li>There is also great information, especially pertinent for me because I have piriformis.</li>
            <li>Also, patience in being comfortable and placing this on my sacrum.</li>
            <li>but it feels as if they intentionally avoid to put that important info.</li>
            <li>The narrowness on this one fit</li>
            <li>So for me, neither size really fit.  </li>
            <li>I am female, 66, 5ft 4in, and own my own painting business.</li>
            <li>It sounded too good to be true, but it arrived quickly and I used it that very evening.</li>
            <li>So simple but very effective.</li>
            <li>My hips and lower back have amazingly  improved!  </li>
            <li>This is a flimsy piece of junk that is in no way worth $30!  </li>
            <li>Also has quite a unique appearance</li>
            <li>When I contacted the company, the owner (Cindy) was extremely friendly, helpful and accommodating.  </li>
            <li>It helps the hips drop and provides a unique stretch.</li>
            <li>I have had significant improvement with my piriformis since I started using this</li>
            <li>They need to include more info and more clear directions about how to place this thing</li>
            <li>The shortness fit great but was too wide.  </li>
            <li>I really tried to love this</li>
            <li>Feels so good and works when you use it often or daily.</li>
            <li>and I think I&#x27;m safe in saying it really does work.</li>
            <li>so I let it go to her full time..</li>
            <li>Really, folks, you need better illustrations than a spinal cord to show how to place it.</li>
            <li>The instructions &amp; papers inside are a bit overwhelming &amp; maybe too much, but watch the online video or any online video about getting it lined up on your sacrum.</li>
            <li>cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>I watched the videos and thought I had it right, but I didn&#x27;t, and it never was comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I ended up having to swap for the blue/male model because this one didn&#x27;t fit me quite right.</li>
            <li>I tried that and just couldn&#x27;t get the fit right.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t remember the exact name of it and tried for hours on the computer to fine out.  </li>
            <li>It works well for me if I am not flared up or mildly so.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 23 weeks pregnant and can&#x27;t take pain meds</li>
            <li>I use it on my entire back and neck every day and it makes my life a lot more manageable!!!!</li>
            <li>It would&#x27;ve been perfect if they had an in-between with the narrowness of the male version and the shortness of the female version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li>It is a shame more medical professionals don&#x27;t know about this wonderful little gadget.  </li>
            <li>&quot; it seemed to cradle my pelvis ( even though it was higher than I thought it should be)  and then became comfortable.</li>
            <li>Also it is not complex to use, I did better using the foam pad under it</li>
            <li>I bought this with great expectations; fooled by the previous reviews.</li>
            <li>It is starting to feel pretty good.</li>
            <li>See a PT instead, first!</li>
            <li>Really relieves pain while driving in the car!!</li>
            <li>i suggest you first try the towel and then buy any stuff you are proposed!</li>
            <li>I went through a lot emotionally and physically and found that the people who were the most successful were those who continued to hold on and work through it.  </li>
            <li>- I was willing to try anything!  </li>
            <li>and I was pretty sure I was messing my back up more by using it.</li>
            <li>Over time and with physical therapy I am feeling so much better!</li>
            <li>I used it the first time for 20 minutes and voila!  </li>
            <li>After a car accident in 2006 I have experienced a lot of trouble with my SI joint popping out of place.</li>
            <li>it seems to help me a great deal with the few times I have used it.</li>
            <li>This just didn&#x27;t feel comfortable, and the physical therapy exercises I was given to do by my PT helped me more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews I thought it would be worth a try.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how simple and effective and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a shot and is based on the knowledge of an Osteopath.</li>
            <li>It seems like I just couldn&#x27;t get the right spot.</li>
            <li>The results proved it was in the right place.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>, so I gave it a shot, knowing it was not quite the right product for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to have found it again, it DOES help when very little else does.  </li>
            <li>But after watching the video again and looking at the info that came in the box, I was able to correctly place the Wedgy and have had tremendous relief in only a week!  </li>
            <li>At first i was hesitant to order and try, but it was worth the gamble.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really imagine why the people who scored this product low would do that, unless they, like my dad, didn&#x27;t really give the thing a fair shot.  </li>
            <li>I will say that it came in so handy on a long airplane ride.</li>
            <li>It might take some adjustments to get it right the first time, just take your time getting it in the right spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, doesn &#x27;t push into my bones, and can be easily adjusted for comfort.</li>
            <li>A great help to my current back problems.  </li>
            <li>Very, very well.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid yogi</li>
            <li>I decieded to try a homemade version first, just to see if it helped at all.</li>
            <li>but I really have no complaints on this product!</li>
            <li>The first time in A LONGGGG TIME  no pain along my sacrum when I try to sleep.</li>
            <li>At first it felt like I was lying in a brick.</li>
            <li>I have since been treated for the Morton&#x27;s foot by using metatarsal pads under the first metatarsal and using the sacro wedgy.  </li>
            <li>At first attempt, ten words required, every time a try to submit it ask for more words.  </li>
            <li>It hurts like hell, but then your body adjusts and after 20 min or so, I am able to walk (without dragging my leg) and usually go back to bed for a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I can watch a movie comfortably now</li>
            <li>This gadget caused me to have more back pain.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use it properly and get a doctors help the first time.</li>
            <li>My herniated disks are the opposite way of most.</li>
            <li>Mine project toward the back and not toward the body like most people&#x27;s do.</li>
            <li>Shared it with my physical therapist and he was glad to see it and said to go ahead.  </li>
            <li>My PT first lent me her Sacro Wedgy for a week.  </li>
            <li>I have back problems and over the years have tried almost everything, most of which did not help.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many pads, lotions and therapy to help alleviate the constant pain from Piriformis syndrome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First thing ever to relive my SI pain!&lt;br</li>
            <li>tilts when I first lay on it like</li>
            <li>my back felt better.  </li>
            <li>Works as advertised on the first use.</li>
            <li>I am 2 days into trying it, and already starting to feel better.</li>
            <li>Who knew something so small could actually work so great!</li>
            <li>you first start, yes</li>
            <li>I was willing to it a try though.</li>
            <li>After the first couple of minutes of thinking it was super-uncomfortable, suddenly it got much better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so simple and elegant.  </li>
            <li>I sit on it, I stretch on it and heaven knows what other kind of treatments I&#x27;d have to endure if I didn&#x27;t have it.  </li>
            <li>I bought both the male and female versions since I am fairly tall, 5&#x27;9&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read the directions carefully, use the neck support as they advised (I just rolled up a towel until it was the right thickness for my neck).</li>
            <li>I will continue with this device for as long as it taked to feel better 100%</li>
            <li>I did have some intense discomfort throughout night after my first use.  </li>
            <li>above really gives a good stretch to your back.  </li>
            <li>She said this worked and was easy to follow proper placement.</li>
            <li>They say you can easily return it for the male one if needed.</li>
            <li>At times, the pain was almost debilitating and certainly made sitting and certain activities unbearable</li>
            <li>recommend the Sacro Wedgy to those who will use it consistently and properly - the benefits may not be immediately noticeable, but after only a short while, I have had great results.</li>
            <li>I bought the female sacrowedgy for my 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; daughter who experienced lumbar and tight hip pain and uncomfortableness for two years.</li>
            <li>It may work for some, but I really wanted this to work for me, but just couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It seems to free it up whenever I have pain and stiffness in my lower back.</li>
            <li>It is an intense feeling</li>
            <li>This really does relax me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>not so much....</li>
            <li>Really too scared to.</li>
            <li>The directions weren&#x27;t very helpful either.</li>
            <li>It really is helping my pain alot.</li>
            <li>Men will not like so much.  </li>
            <li>she was very upset.  </li>
            <li>No spine specialists could figure out why I Was in so much pain..</li>
            <li>But, she has an unusual condition, so don&#x27;t rule this out.  </li>
            <li>I have not used it much yet , but it seems to help with hip alignment.  </li>
            <li>Very empowering.</li>
            <li>Watching the Sacro Wdgy video on You Tube was very helpful also.</li>
            <li>however I was in so much pain</li>
            <li>When my sciatica was flared up, this helped relieve the intense pain.  </li>
            <li>This actually is very helpful.</li>
            <li>Really does work when used as directed.  </li>
            <li>Product hasn&#x27;t really helped or hurt in any substantial way?</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing to help my sciatica.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much Sacro Wedgy.  </li>
            <li>It was not the miracle cure I was hoping for, but the pain is much reduced.</li>
            <li>It really does help.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:0979303605 Steps Pain Free Back Solutions Shoulder]] and one of the tips we learned was the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you have back pain of any kind, specifically in your lower back though, this thing is for you.  </li>
            <li>I use it in my work as Craniosacral Therapist in Berkeley CA &amp; to relax my own low back and pelvis when the day is done.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>and i also experience relief but due to age and cumilative injuries I must use the wedgy more often.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually really simple and worth it!</li>
            <li>I personally checked with the physical therapists and chiropractors before using to make sure it fit my body well, and would recommend that potentially for others as well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt; - start by laying down on the rolled mat with your spine directly on top (vertically) and your head on the pillow&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really do feel like I can live again</li>
            <li>It depends mainly on how often I use it.</li>
            <li>and it probably took about a month of using it every am and pm or whenever I felt pain, for most of my low back pain to be gone.  </li>
            <li>The information included with the product isn&#x27;t particularly helpful either.</li>
            <li>Just a basic back stretcher seems help more.</li>
            <li>so it is parallel to your spine and put a pillow above (not on top) of the mat&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think that since my issues involve my pelvis not being quite shaped right, I should have had a physical therapist help me out, but after two times, I really do feel a lot of relief.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for SI joint problems.</li>
            <li>I highly recommemd this product.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the sacro wedgy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and my suggestion is to follow directions.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend the sacro wedgy.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers indicated, I followed the exercises on the sacrowedgy but did not do the additional ones without since I already had my own personal set of exercises to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Degenerative disks got a little better with exercise so never used it.</li>
            <li>I have told everyone about this magic little tool.  </li>
            <li>It is in color and very well illustrated with clear instructions.</li>
            <li>I am completely amazed at how much it has helped my S.I. joint pain.  </li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;9\\&quot; and a girl with a normal sized pelvis</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the cost &amp; was recommended to me by my medical massage therapist.</li>
            <li>I have used it myself and think it is beneficial to assist with normal sacral positioning.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t see how anyone with normal anatomy couldn&#x27;t benefit.</li>
            <li>/&gt; - take a yoga mat and roll it up as you normally would when you store it</li>
            <li>I crawl into open floor space and get right on this.  </li>
            <li>Like some other reviewers, I just couldn&#x27;t get this to be comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>I will use this whenever I need it to keep pain free and recommend it to anyone who complains of chronic low back pain.</li>
            <li>I woke up the next morning for the first time in 13 months with no pain in my hip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gently rocking my hips in an &amp;#34;Indian style&amp;#34; (feet flat against one another) really stretches &amp; relaxes the muscles in my hips &amp; around my sacrum.</li>
            <li>or if I just got better since I was also taking other measures to help my back.</li>
            <li>Not only did I get better, I was also able to save my money and stop going to the expensive specialists or Chiropractors who didn&#x27;t know a darn thing about how I could be fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it causes more pain than usual.  </li>
            <li>I use the Sacrowedgy for 20 minutes before doing the DVD because it truly gets the area TOTALLY relaxed before proceeding with strengthening and stretching, which Annette Fletcher says is an imperative first step.  </li>
            <li>She thought it was interesting that several of the same exercises in the booklet were some of the same ones recommended by her chiropractor.</li>
            <li>but I have not spent too much time on it.</li>
            <li>use it pretty religiously--almost daily.</li>
            <li>I tried the female version first.  </li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t know exactly where to place it, and the illustration doesn&#x27;t show where the wide and where the narrow ends go.  </li>
            <li>I have to confess I didn&#x27;t intially follow directions which are clearly indicated on packaging and also DVD&#x27;s on company&#x27;s web site.</li>
            <li>and I had to consciously tell myself to relax.</li>
            <li>It really helps my back and psyatic nerve pain.  </li>
            <li>I really want my $ back!</li>
            <li>and it comes with gentle stretches and exercises to help strengthen and align the back.    </li>
            <li>So far it seems to help my hips alot.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and would recommend&lt;br /&gt;it for those who have lower back pain or hip pain.</li>
            <li>I can sit on this on a soft couch for a couple of hours, stand up and feel like I haven&#x27;t been sitting.</li>
            <li>this has been a complete life saver for me until  </li>
            <li>I went to see specialists and Chiropractors for 6 months and nothing could solve the issues I had developed.</li>
            <li>I really feel like my life is back on track</li>
            <li>I know it doesn&#x27;t seem like much and is so simple but</li>
            <li>and i have set up a mat near my tv and use the wedgy every am .  </li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised with this.</li>
            <li>this really  works to stretch your back and ease the pain.  </li>
            <li>I had trouble getting comfortable on this.</li>
            <li>It has really helped with my back!</li>
            <li>and wow, nothing hurts at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You absolutely need to try this if you suffer from any of the same pains I described.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Kept trying to like it, but it was not comfortable, no matter how many different times I tried or moved it around.</li>
            <li>I believe in the product, but it is kind of uncomfortable if you do not have much cushion in the glute area.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday for only about 5-10 minutes and it makes a world of difference, I have even been able to take</li>
            <li>I sometimes wonder if that&#x27;s why the positioning never feels quite right, I&#x27;m too tall for the standard female one.</li>
            <li>I also use it when I will be lying flat for a long period of time without adequate support (during accupuncture).  </li>
            <li>On the bed, I do not get enough pressure provided to ease my particular pelvic issues.</li>
            <li>logic behind it is pretty straightforward as far as sitting on it:</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for lower back pain.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended by her and also her brothers... who have the male version.</li>
            <li>I was desperate and this was highly reviewed and not horribly expensive, and I am glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Since I can&#x27;t return it, it&#x27;s hard to know if the male version would have been better.</li>
            <li>This really aligns my spine, relaxes my muscles and really helps with chronic pain issues along with other exercises and physical therapy.</li>
            <li>But for me, my sensitive back side was far to tender to appreciate this tool.</li>
            <li>I add extra height to get an even more aggressive stretch with a thick book.</li>
            <li>but once you get used to it and get your positioning down right</li>
            <li>Putting a rolled towel under my neck often made my head numb, and I was never quite sure I was putting the wedge in the right place.</li>
            <li>I have not had this long enough to really rate it.</li>
            <li>I would only recommend this if you have clear direction from your doctor on how to use it.</li>
            <li>After 3 months of 24/7 pain in which physically therapy really didn&#x27;t help - this was the only thing that provided relief to my ever shifting hip bones/lower back.  </li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;ve had instant results, I would not recommend giving up chiropractor care completely.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I&#x27;ve went through doctors, medications, PT, chiropractic, and massage, but never has the relief been as complete or lasting like this.  </li>
            <li>My sacrum centered pain, hips and back pain are almost all fixed when using this.</li>
            <li>I have spent so much money going to an LMT to have work done.  </li>
            <li>Someone who didn&#x27;t have tender sensitive lower back area.</li>
            <li>Lesson learned - see a professional to find out the proper treatments (ice vs. heat, appropriate exercises/movements, etc.) to avoid making things worse.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had full release as yet on left SI joint, but not expecting something that has been stuck for years to release in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I do stretch, I am active, but I get a certain spasm in lower back that flares up frequently.  </li>
            <li>It would be much better if it simply came in black as this would make it less noticeable in the workplace.</li>
            <li>i really don&#x27;t know how else one could achieve such a specific stretch to get relief in all the areas that affect the hip, low back, sacrum &amp; SI joints.</li>
            <li>From my understanding, there&#x27;s a hollow area in the small of your lower back that rests on top of this wedgy.  </li>
            <li>When I use it properly for my condition, I get moderate to complete relief for my pain.</li>
            <li>I had been having rather severe lower back pain, sciatica and hip pain for the past 8-9 months without any significant lasting relief with drugs, chiropractic treatment or even spinal decompression therapy.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say, other than I haven&#x27;t used it much and a pain to get out and where do you lay down and use it?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not comfortable at first</li>
            <li>It made my back feel worse, it gave me more back pain, and that is all it did.  </li>
            <li>Not comfortable at first but stay with it.</li>
            <li>I got up in the morning, started moving around and felt some major realignment happening in my low back!  </li>
            <li>My only suggestion is to start slow if you have pain while laying on it and even put a pillow under your legs to begin with if you can not lay flat comfortably.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I am placing this in the right place, but I suffer from sciatica symptoms and piriformis symptoms.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure if I bought the right size even.</li>
            <li>My sister loves hersâ€¦  worthy of consideration at the least.</li>
            <li>This funny little thing worked quite well when my Sacro Illiac (low back) went out&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a bit difficult trying to get it in the right position at first.</li>
            <li>And using it regularly does seem to help me from becoming stiff and sore from even a few minutes of sitting.</li>
            <li>This little tool really works.  </li>
            <li>Give it a try, it takes a little getting used to, but for me it does offer real relief.</li>
            <li>Since she does not live that near me and we are both busy she failed to tell me she had found her original one.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a couple of weeks (as well as a neck roll) due to pain down my right leg that I think is piriformus related.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a great item.  </li>

            <li> Between my excellent physical therapist and my sacro-wedgy I feel great!</li>
            <li> I just sat on it &amp; I felt so much better!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Sacro Wedgy!  </li>
            <li> Still kind of figuring out exactly where to position it for best results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This device provides an amazing isolation of the sacrum.</li>
            <li> Just truly amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This Sacrowedgy is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing gadget.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly.</li>
            <li> it was well made and did feel nice.</li>
            <li> now own 3 of these stabilizers-</li>
            <li> Sharon, a thrilled customer</li>
            <li> At home I keep it handy (in my nightstand)</li>
            <li> I have now purchased my own sacrowedgy</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s honestly miraculous how I feel NOTHING.</li>
            <li> AS GOOD AS ADVERTISED, MAYBE BETTER.</li>
            <li> So grateful to have something so non-time-consuming, non-invasive, and so effective.  </li>
            <li> But Yes, I  liked the neck roll.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and works great.  </li>
            <li> Good price for such a wonderful amount of releif.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my chiropractor, good choice, easy to use.</li>
            <li> The staff is most kind and helpful too.    </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s kind of a baby about pain, so he didn&#x27;t give it more than about 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since been diagnosed as having a bulging lumbar vertebra, so anything that helps my spine regain the right curve is great.</li>
            <li> No amount of special exercises, stretches or anti-inflammatory has done any good in all that time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I learned that having the neck supported is very important</li>
            <li> I saw this on \\&quot;The Doctors\\&quot; and so glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I am here to tell you that after hobbling around for two years and being so out of whack, the more you use it the better you get.</li>
            <li> the name :)</li>
            <li> I was able to move the affected muscles during the day, not just during the session.</li>
            <li> using a tennis shoe with a sock stuffed in it works much better for me.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did I love it</li>
            <li> I have fell asleep on it more than once.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s helpful.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t sleep for more than one hour in any position (cadaver), so</li>
            <li> Need more tome with this to decide</li>
            <li> My husband and I have used the sacro wedgy for over a year now because of leg/sciatica pain and have been able to stabilize chronic conditions and strengthen our bodies.  </li>
            <li> Have told many people how well this inexpensive device can help.  </li>
            <li> I feel better than I have in 6 years.</li>
            <li> I might need more elevation to make the wedgy work better, and maybe better neck support as well.</li>
            <li> but I when I used it, I ended up in more pain than before use.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to see much better results.</li>
            <li> Would love to know what the wedgy people think about my experience.</li>
            <li> Doing it daily works best.</li>
            <li> I love this for myself.  </li>
            <li> I have recommened it to several friends (even bought one for my best friend) and they have all have had simliar results.  </li>
            <li> Love it,  and I am so glad I found this product</li>
            <li> quite a bit of time on their website looking for more info.</li>
            <li> This works better for me than anything else.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Needs more directions on how to position.</li>
            <li> A lifesaver:)</li>
            <li> and now I can go all day with no pain) and my SI joint is getting better as well.  </li>
            <li> so it may be better for someone with more padding in the butt.  </li>
            <li> Still helps enough I am happy I bought it!</li>
            <li> I make sure to do the rocking side to side and pelvic</li>
            <li> Try it - you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Ok, feeling neutral.</li>
            <li> I was using a walker most of the time and in a lot of pain.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure I was positioning it correctly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not at all sure how I hurt my pirifomis, but I know just how I&#x27;ve gotten on the road to fixing it.  </li>
            <li> I figured it would be better than nothing.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t healed -- I was better.  </li>
            <li> And better was what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Once in a while now, I go a handful of weeks without using it, yet my spine continues to hold in a healthy position.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> In theory, it looks like it will work but for me, it just makes my back/hip hurt more.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this I loved it.</li>
            <li> Now, I get up in the morning without pain and drive and get out of the car without feeling like a cripple and taking 5 minutes to be able to walk more comfortably.  </li>
            <li> As a result, my diagnosis took an incredible amount of time and left me with a lot of pain and anxiety.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I lay on it for 10 to 15 mins while I read and am so relaxed, I can easily fall asleep.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to travel with as well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This is easy to use and easy to be comfortable with.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to sit on and easy to place also stays where you put it.  </li>
            <li> It might hurt a bit at first, I&#x27;m still adjusting to mine, but you do get more &amp; more used to it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell for sure if I have it positioned right since it feels kind of funny</li>
            <li> so it is amazing to me to finally find out the cause and be able to have relief after all these years!  </li>
            <li> hugely with self care between visits to my Rolfer</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference in my sciatica pain</li>
            <li> But after I had been upright for a minute or two, I noticed a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li> Two people I know have gotten great relief from using this regularly.</li>
            <li> The pads are cheap, so order one or two of them and try em out.  </li>
            <li> It has done more for me than 30 years worth of chiropractic adjustments and muscle relaxers ever did.  </li>
            <li> Not all back pain is SI pain, but this works great for SI joint dysfunction.</li>
            <li> i have used this several times and works great along with the neck support.  </li>
            <li> After using the Sacrowedgy just a few times, my hips feel the best they have since 1991!  </li>
            <li> Now,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m free of pain.</li>
            <li> There is also great information, especially pertinent for me because I have piriformis.</li>
            <li> Also, patience in being comfortable and placing this on my sacrum.</li>
            <li> but it feels as if they intentionally avoid to put that important info.</li>
            <li> The narrowness on this one fit</li>
            <li> So for me, neither size really fit.  </li>
            <li> I am female, 66, 5ft 4in, and own my own painting business.</li>
            <li> It sounded too good to be true, but it arrived quickly and I used it that very evening.</li>
            <li> So simple but very effective.</li>
            <li> My hips and lower back have amazingly  improved!  </li>
            <li> This is a flimsy piece of junk that is in no way worth $30!  </li>
            <li> Also has quite a unique appearance</li>
            <li> When I contacted the company, the owner (Cindy) was extremely friendly, helpful and accommodating.  </li>
            <li> It helps the hips drop and provides a unique stretch.</li>
            <li> I have had significant improvement with my piriformis since I started using this</li>
            <li> They need to include more info and more clear directions about how to place this thing</li>
            <li> The shortness fit great but was too wide.  </li>
            <li> I really tried to love this</li>
            <li> Feels so good and works when you use it often or daily.</li>
            <li> and I think I&#x27;m safe in saying it really does work.</li>
            <li> so I let it go to her full time..</li>
            <li> Really, folks, you need better illustrations than a spinal cord to show how to place it.</li>
            <li> The instructions &amp; papers inside are a bit overwhelming &amp; maybe too much, but watch the online video or any online video about getting it lined up on your sacrum.</li>
            <li> cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> I watched the videos and thought I had it right, but I didn&#x27;t, and it never was comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I ended up having to swap for the blue/male model because this one didn&#x27;t fit me quite right.</li>
            <li> I tried that and just couldn&#x27;t get the fit right.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t remember the exact name of it and tried for hours on the computer to fine out.  </li>
            <li> It works well for me if I am not flared up or mildly so.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 23 weeks pregnant and can&#x27;t take pain meds</li>
            <li> I use it on my entire back and neck every day and it makes my life a lot more manageable!!!!</li>
            <li> It would&#x27;ve been perfect if they had an in-between with the narrowness of the male version and the shortness of the female version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li> It is a shame more medical professionals don&#x27;t know about this wonderful little gadget.  </li>
            <li> &quot; it seemed to cradle my pelvis ( even though it was higher than I thought it should be)  and then became comfortable.</li>
            <li> Also it is not complex to use, I did better using the foam pad under it</li>
            <li> I bought this with great expectations; fooled by the previous reviews.</li>
            <li> It is starting to feel pretty good.</li>
            <li> See a PT instead, first!</li>
            <li> Really relieves pain while driving in the car!!</li>
            <li> i suggest you first try the towel and then buy any stuff you are proposed!</li>
            <li> I went through a lot emotionally and physically and found that the people who were the most successful were those who continued to hold on and work through it.  </li>
            <li> - I was willing to try anything!  </li>
            <li> and I was pretty sure I was messing my back up more by using it.</li>
            <li> Over time and with physical therapy I am feeling so much better!</li>
            <li> I used it the first time for 20 minutes and voila!  </li>
            <li> After a car accident in 2006 I have experienced a lot of trouble with my SI joint popping out of place.</li>
            <li> it seems to help me a great deal with the few times I have used it.</li>
            <li> This just didn&#x27;t feel comfortable, and the physical therapy exercises I was given to do by my PT helped me more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I thought it would be worth a try.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how simple and effective and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a shot and is based on the knowledge of an Osteopath.</li>
            <li> It seems like I just couldn&#x27;t get the right spot.</li>
            <li> The results proved it was in the right place.  </li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> , so I gave it a shot, knowing it was not quite the right product for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found it again, it DOES help when very little else does.  </li>
            <li> But after watching the video again and looking at the info that came in the box, I was able to correctly place the Wedgy and have had tremendous relief in only a week!  </li>
            <li> At first i was hesitant to order and try, but it was worth the gamble.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really imagine why the people who scored this product low would do that, unless they, like my dad, didn&#x27;t really give the thing a fair shot.  </li>
            <li> I will say that it came in so handy on a long airplane ride.</li>
            <li> It might take some adjustments to get it right the first time, just take your time getting it in the right spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, doesn &#x27;t push into my bones, and can be easily adjusted for comfort.</li>
            <li> A great help to my current back problems.  </li>
            <li> Very, very well.  </li>
            <li> I am an avid yogi</li>
            <li> I decieded to try a homemade version first, just to see if it helped at all.</li>
            <li> but I really have no complaints on this product!</li>
            <li> The first time in A LONGGGG TIME  no pain along my sacrum when I try to sleep.</li>
            <li> At first it felt like I was lying in a brick.</li>
            <li> I have since been treated for the Morton&#x27;s foot by using metatarsal pads under the first metatarsal and using the sacro wedgy.  </li>
            <li> At first attempt, ten words required, every time a try to submit it ask for more words.  </li>
            <li> It hurts like hell, but then your body adjusts and after 20 min or so, I am able to walk (without dragging my leg) and usually go back to bed for a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I can watch a movie comfortably now</li>
            <li> This gadget caused me to have more back pain.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use it properly and get a doctors help the first time.</li>
            <li> My herniated disks are the opposite way of most.</li>
            <li> Mine project toward the back and not toward the body like most people&#x27;s do.</li>
            <li> Shared it with my physical therapist and he was glad to see it and said to go ahead.  </li>
            <li> My PT first lent me her Sacro Wedgy for a week.  </li>
            <li> I have back problems and over the years have tried almost everything, most of which did not help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many pads, lotions and therapy to help alleviate the constant pain from Piriformis syndrome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First thing ever to relive my SI pain!&lt;br</li>
            <li> tilts when I first lay on it like</li>
            <li> my back felt better.  </li>
            <li> Works as advertised on the first use.</li>
            <li> I am 2 days into trying it, and already starting to feel better.</li>
            <li> Who knew something so small could actually work so great!</li>
            <li> you first start, yes</li>
            <li> I was willing to it a try though.</li>
            <li> After the first couple of minutes of thinking it was super-uncomfortable, suddenly it got much better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so simple and elegant.  </li>
            <li> I sit on it, I stretch on it and heaven knows what other kind of treatments I&#x27;d have to endure if I didn&#x27;t have it.  </li>
            <li> I bought both the male and female versions since I am fairly tall, 5&#x27;9&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Make sure you read the directions carefully, use the neck support as they advised (I just rolled up a towel until it was the right thickness for my neck).</li>
            <li> I will continue with this device for as long as it taked to feel better 100%</li>
            <li> I did have some intense discomfort throughout night after my first use.  </li>
            <li> above really gives a good stretch to your back.  </li>
            <li> She said this worked and was easy to follow proper placement.</li>
            <li> They say you can easily return it for the male one if needed.</li>
            <li> At times, the pain was almost debilitating and certainly made sitting and certain activities unbearable</li>
            <li> recommend the Sacro Wedgy to those who will use it consistently and properly - the benefits may not be immediately noticeable, but after only a short while, I have had great results.</li>
            <li> I bought the female sacrowedgy for my 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; daughter who experienced lumbar and tight hip pain and uncomfortableness for two years.</li>
            <li> It may work for some, but I really wanted this to work for me, but just couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It seems to free it up whenever I have pain and stiffness in my lower back.</li>
            <li> It is an intense feeling</li>
            <li> This really does relax me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> not so much....</li>
            <li> Really too scared to.</li>
            <li> The directions weren&#x27;t very helpful either.</li>
            <li> It really is helping my pain alot.</li>
            <li> Men will not like so much.  </li>
            <li> she was very upset.  </li>
            <li> No spine specialists could figure out why I Was in so much pain..</li>
            <li> But, she has an unusual condition, so don&#x27;t rule this out.  </li>
            <li> I have not used it much yet , but it seems to help with hip alignment.  </li>
            <li> Very empowering.</li>
            <li> Watching the Sacro Wdgy video on You Tube was very helpful also.</li>
            <li> however I was in so much pain</li>
            <li> When my sciatica was flared up, this helped relieve the intense pain.  </li>
            <li> This actually is very helpful.</li>
            <li> Really does work when used as directed.  </li>
            <li> Product hasn&#x27;t really helped or hurt in any substantial way?</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing to help my sciatica.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much Sacro Wedgy.  </li>
            <li> It was not the miracle cure I was hoping for, but the pain is much reduced.</li>
            <li> It really does help.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:0979303605 Steps Pain Free Back Solutions Shoulder]] and one of the tips we learned was the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you have back pain of any kind, specifically in your lower back though, this thing is for you.  </li>
            <li> I use it in my work as Craniosacral Therapist in Berkeley CA &amp; to relax my own low back and pelvis when the day is done.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> and i also experience relief but due to age and cumilative injuries I must use the wedgy more often.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually really simple and worth it!</li>
            <li> I personally checked with the physical therapists and chiropractors before using to make sure it fit my body well, and would recommend that potentially for others as well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; - start by laying down on the rolled mat with your spine directly on top (vertically) and your head on the pillow&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really do feel like I can live again</li>
            <li> It depends mainly on how often I use it.</li>
            <li> and it probably took about a month of using it every am and pm or whenever I felt pain, for most of my low back pain to be gone.  </li>
            <li> The information included with the product isn&#x27;t particularly helpful either.</li>
            <li> Just a basic back stretcher seems help more.</li>
            <li> so it is parallel to your spine and put a pillow above (not on top) of the mat&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think that since my issues involve my pelvis not being quite shaped right, I should have had a physical therapist help me out, but after two times, I really do feel a lot of relief.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for SI joint problems.</li>
            <li> I highly recommemd this product.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the sacro wedgy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this and my suggestion is to follow directions.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend the sacro wedgy.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers indicated, I followed the exercises on the sacrowedgy but did not do the additional ones without since I already had my own personal set of exercises to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Degenerative disks got a little better with exercise so never used it.</li>
            <li> I have told everyone about this magic little tool.  </li>
            <li> It is in color and very well illustrated with clear instructions.</li>
            <li> I am completely amazed at how much it has helped my S.I. joint pain.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;9\\&quot; and a girl with a normal sized pelvis</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth the cost &amp; was recommended to me by my medical massage therapist.</li>
            <li> I have used it myself and think it is beneficial to assist with normal sacral positioning.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t see how anyone with normal anatomy couldn&#x27;t benefit.</li>
            <li> /&gt; - take a yoga mat and roll it up as you normally would when you store it</li>
            <li> I crawl into open floor space and get right on this.  </li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers, I just couldn&#x27;t get this to be comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> I will use this whenever I need it to keep pain free and recommend it to anyone who complains of chronic low back pain.</li>
            <li> I woke up the next morning for the first time in 13 months with no pain in my hip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gently rocking my hips in an &amp;#34;Indian style&amp;#34; (feet flat against one another) really stretches &amp; relaxes the muscles in my hips &amp; around my sacrum.</li>
            <li> or if I just got better since I was also taking other measures to help my back.</li>
            <li> Not only did I get better, I was also able to save my money and stop going to the expensive specialists or Chiropractors who didn&#x27;t know a darn thing about how I could be fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it causes more pain than usual.  </li>
            <li> I use the Sacrowedgy for 20 minutes before doing the DVD because it truly gets the area TOTALLY relaxed before proceeding with strengthening and stretching, which Annette Fletcher says is an imperative first step.  </li>
            <li> She thought it was interesting that several of the same exercises in the booklet were some of the same ones recommended by her chiropractor.</li>
            <li> but I have not spent too much time on it.</li>
            <li> use it pretty religiously--almost daily.</li>
            <li> I tried the female version first.  </li>
            <li> Most people don&#x27;t know exactly where to place it, and the illustration doesn&#x27;t show where the wide and where the narrow ends go.  </li>
            <li> I have to confess I didn&#x27;t intially follow directions which are clearly indicated on packaging and also DVD&#x27;s on company&#x27;s web site.</li>
            <li> and I had to consciously tell myself to relax.</li>
            <li> It really helps my back and psyatic nerve pain.  </li>
            <li> I really want my $ back!</li>
            <li> and it comes with gentle stretches and exercises to help strengthen and align the back.    </li>
            <li> So far it seems to help my hips alot.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and would recommend&lt;br /&gt;it for those who have lower back pain or hip pain.</li>
            <li> I can sit on this on a soft couch for a couple of hours, stand up and feel like I haven&#x27;t been sitting.</li>
            <li> this has been a complete life saver for me until  </li>
            <li> I went to see specialists and Chiropractors for 6 months and nothing could solve the issues I had developed.</li>
            <li> I really feel like my life is back on track</li>
            <li> I know it doesn&#x27;t seem like much and is so simple but</li>
            <li> and i have set up a mat near my tv and use the wedgy every am .  </li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised with this.</li>
            <li> this really  works to stretch your back and ease the pain.  </li>
            <li> I had trouble getting comfortable on this.</li>
            <li> It has really helped with my back!</li>
            <li> and wow, nothing hurts at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You absolutely need to try this if you suffer from any of the same pains I described.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> Kept trying to like it, but it was not comfortable, no matter how many different times I tried or moved it around.</li>
            <li> I believe in the product, but it is kind of uncomfortable if you do not have much cushion in the glute area.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday for only about 5-10 minutes and it makes a world of difference, I have even been able to take</li>
            <li> I sometimes wonder if that&#x27;s why the positioning never feels quite right, I&#x27;m too tall for the standard female one.</li>
            <li> I also use it when I will be lying flat for a long period of time without adequate support (during accupuncture).  </li>
            <li> On the bed, I do not get enough pressure provided to ease my particular pelvic issues.</li>
            <li> logic behind it is pretty straightforward as far as sitting on it:</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for lower back pain.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended by her and also her brothers... who have the male version.</li>
            <li> I was desperate and this was highly reviewed and not horribly expensive, and I am glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Since I can&#x27;t return it, it&#x27;s hard to know if the male version would have been better.</li>
            <li> This really aligns my spine, relaxes my muscles and really helps with chronic pain issues along with other exercises and physical therapy.</li>
            <li> But for me, my sensitive back side was far to tender to appreciate this tool.</li>
            <li> I add extra height to get an even more aggressive stretch with a thick book.</li>
            <li> but once you get used to it and get your positioning down right</li>
            <li> Putting a rolled towel under my neck often made my head numb, and I was never quite sure I was putting the wedge in the right place.</li>
            <li> I have not had this long enough to really rate it.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this if you have clear direction from your doctor on how to use it.</li>
            <li> After 3 months of 24/7 pain in which physically therapy really didn&#x27;t help - this was the only thing that provided relief to my ever shifting hip bones/lower back.  </li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;ve had instant results, I would not recommend giving up chiropractor care completely.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;ve went through doctors, medications, PT, chiropractic, and massage, but never has the relief been as complete or lasting like this.  </li>
            <li> My sacrum centered pain, hips and back pain are almost all fixed when using this.</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money going to an LMT to have work done.  </li>
            <li> Someone who didn&#x27;t have tender sensitive lower back area.</li>
            <li> Lesson learned - see a professional to find out the proper treatments (ice vs. heat, appropriate exercises/movements, etc.) to avoid making things worse.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had full release as yet on left SI joint, but not expecting something that has been stuck for years to release in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I do stretch, I am active, but I get a certain spasm in lower back that flares up frequently.  </li>
            <li> It would be much better if it simply came in black as this would make it less noticeable in the workplace.</li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t know how else one could achieve such a specific stretch to get relief in all the areas that affect the hip, low back, sacrum &amp; SI joints.</li>
            <li> From my understanding, there&#x27;s a hollow area in the small of your lower back that rests on top of this wedgy.  </li>
            <li> When I use it properly for my condition, I get moderate to complete relief for my pain.</li>
            <li> I had been having rather severe lower back pain, sciatica and hip pain for the past 8-9 months without any significant lasting relief with drugs, chiropractic treatment or even spinal decompression therapy.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say, other than I haven&#x27;t used it much and a pain to get out and where do you lay down and use it?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not comfortable at first</li>
            <li> It made my back feel worse, it gave me more back pain, and that is all it did.  </li>
            <li> Not comfortable at first but stay with it.</li>
            <li> I got up in the morning, started moving around and felt some major realignment happening in my low back!  </li>
            <li> My only suggestion is to start slow if you have pain while laying on it and even put a pillow under your legs to begin with if you can not lay flat comfortably.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I am placing this in the right place, but I suffer from sciatica symptoms and piriformis symptoms.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I bought the right size even.</li>
            <li> My sister loves hersâ€¦  worthy of consideration at the least.</li>
            <li> This funny little thing worked quite well when my Sacro Illiac (low back) went out&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a bit difficult trying to get it in the right position at first.</li>
            <li> And using it regularly does seem to help me from becoming stiff and sore from even a few minutes of sitting.</li>
            <li> This little tool really works.  </li>
            <li> Give it a try, it takes a little getting used to, but for me it does offer real relief.</li>
            <li> Since she does not live that near me and we are both busy she failed to tell me she had found her original one.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks (as well as a neck roll) due to pain down my right leg that I think is piriformus related.</li>
            <li> I highly advise doing the exercises that come with the product in a little pamphlet.</li>
            <li> Have tried it for several days and not sure it is really all that beneficial yet.</li>
            <li> There are male (blue) and female (pink) versions as our hip areas are shaped differently.</li>
            <li> I have major back problems, I have had a discectomy and a spinal fusion due to a herniated disc at L5/S1.</li>
            <li> It hurt laying on the hard plastic for maybe the first 10 minutes, but then it began to fade away.</li>
            <li> Not sure how much it is helping.  </li>
            <li> Does seem to help some then if you can stay on it long enough.</li>
            <li> This simple device has relieved a lot of my low back pain and is bringing balance to my center.</li>
            <li> My chiropractor could not keep my SI joints in place long enough to get relief.</li>
            <li> The 3 stars are because the instructions about where to place it are not clear enough.</li>
            <li> I place it directly between the fullest part of my hips, so they fall down on either side of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that this little device actually works.</li>
            <li> Had had back pain due to an old injury and didn&#x27;t find relief with other methods such as weight loss and exercise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a week (4 times total) and I can say that I have had less back and leg pain since starting it than I have in recent memory.</li>
            <li> I use it in bed on top of a firm thin book with my Neck Ease to cradle my neck.</li>
            <li> It helped me relieve my tight back after hours in the car and general stress..</li>
            <li> Cheap and Useless.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered with lower back/hip/leg pain for so long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now spent two visits per week for the last three weeks at the chiropractor to fix what this device did to me.  </li>
            <li> Waited for a Long time for the price tag to come below $30 but never did .</li>
            <li> she is a hairdresser and long hours on her feet</li>
            <li> It comes with a firm foam pad about 3/4&amp;#34; to use if lying on a soft bed.</li>
            <li> The physical therapy center now has it on their recommended items list for pelvic pain that is muscle related.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes twice a day if on my feet long hours.</li>
            <li> am not near my chiropractor</li>
            <li> when I need her, I use this product after a long day on the motorcycle or in the car.</li>
            <li> I admit I stopped using this, so I can&#x27;t speak to the long term effects.</li>
            <li> My chiropractor later explained that the wedge was too wide for my frame</li>
            <li> but it was too long, so</li>
            <li> The directions are not clear about how to place it.</li>
            <li> I suffered for a long time with low back, hip pain radiating down my legs &amp; aggravated piriformis muscles that then fires up my sciatic nerves.</li>
            <li> I was in a terrible car accident, T-boned by someone running a red light at high speed, and I developed SI Joint Dysfunction as well as chronic back tension.</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t think it would help much with my particular back issues (he recommended the Sacral Blocks like this one: [[ASIN:B000HSUV86 Core Products 930 Adult Pelvic]]</li>
            <li> (Incidentally, he still suffers from sciatica; he would rather muddle through than try this amazing little doohickey.)  </li>
            <li> I took a White Rain (pump type) hair spray bottle and wrapped a wash cloth (fastened it with a safety pin) around it,to make it a little bigger and add some cushioning.</li>
            <li> I have sacroiliac joint dysfunction, iliotibial band syndrome, and had frozen left glutes partly because one leg is shorter than the other.  </li>
            <li> I bought a lumbar pillow, a gel seat, &amp; various other cushions for sitting or sleeping.  </li>
            <li> I must have been twisted all up and this device straightened me out ( smile) !</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical that a small rubber wedge could do anything to relieve my sciatica and lower back pain, but after 15 minutes on the wedgy I was able to &amp;#34;rise and walk&amp;#34; without pain.</li>
            <li> the other day I did something very mysterious to my piriformis</li>
            <li> I have suffered from Sciatica Pain for so very long...</li>
            <li> I personally would give it a try; with Amazon Prime you can get all your money back should it not fit you or solve your problem.</li>
            <li> My massage therapist told me about the Sacro Wedgy because I&#x27;ve had low back and SI pain for a few months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry that I wasted my money, but I had been curious for a long time and now my curiosity is satisfied.</li>
            <li> and I do stretches every single day</li>
            <li> The directions were limited</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was frustrating to use at first because I didn&#x27;t know how to position it.</li>
            <li> I use it when I lay down at night and it does seem to help with lower back pain.  </li>
            <li> by providing some lift to the spinal column, the weight of the upper body no longer presses down where it connects to the pelvis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had lower back pain for ages, then my tailbone started hurting, then I had shooting pain down my legs, then I had pain in my heels -</li>
            <li> Imagine you have had lower back, hip, leg, heel pain for years, you lay down for 20 minutes and you get up</li>
            <li> Since I have been through years of chiropractic, massage, rolfing and physical therapy without any lasting relief, this little thing is like a miracle to me!  </li>
            <li> Not certain if it helped in the long run</li>
            <li> Got right back on it the second day, still a little uncomfortable to lay</li>
            <li> /&gt;I noticed that when I used it often, my low back/tailbone pain was a lot less and even gone.</li>
            <li> Not only that my sacrum seems to go out less.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this definitely relieves sacral pain.</li>
            <li> No quick fixes when it comes to back pain.</li>
            <li> My physical therapist recommends it, I have tight hip flexors &amp; it helps.</li>
            <li> Then, I started using the Sacro Wedgy (which was very painful when getting off of it at first) and within a couple days my pain was much better, and a couple weeks later, I hardly have any pain anymore at all.</li>
            <li> This sacro wedgy is helping to stabilize my lower back and helps relieve a little of the pain.</li>
            <li> Then eventually a little pinch begins to remind me ... get back to the Sacro Wedgy.  </li>
            <li> The wedgy thereby lifts your lower back a little off the ground so that the muscles/joints/whatever around it sink away from your body with the force of gravity.  </li>
            <li> Years of chiro, yoga, etc, in attempt to clear up low-back issues I&#x27;ve had for at least 6 years, and this terrific little gizmo that</li>
            <li> Ended up being more painful then</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also small enough to throw in the car for long road trips, I can place it under my tailbone and get some relief while driving.</li>
            <li> and they say to use the male one if you&#x27;re over 5&#x27;7\\&quot; with a narrow pelvis.  </li>
            <li> I never really felt the release of tension.</li>
            <li> It is not constructed as well as I expected.  </li>
            <li> After research I found my trouble spot was my sacroiliac joints, I did exercises specific to treating the area</li>
            <li> I have never really figured out how to use it.</li>
            <li> By elevating the sacrum, the low back is forced into the correct position and as the pelvic muscles/tendons/ligaments are allowed to stretch.  </li>
            <li> It started by relaxing one side of my glutes that had been stiff for years even after physical therapy.  </li>
            <li> I think my back was so tight there was no curve!</li>
            <li> It was actually stretching this otherwise-difficult-to-access little muscle!  </li>
            <li> Less painful to get into position and had even more of a release.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from sciatica for over a year and was hospitalized due to problems connected with it.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but it worked the first time and everytime.  </li>
            <li> It is uncomfortable to use at first</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I ordered another one after my first use to give my daughter (nurse) who must lean over patients all day</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it to sit on it and that helps extremely, as well.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone and although it may seem a little difficult to use at first, it works!</li>
            <li> in my case,it works wonders when my lower back acts up which usually occurs when there are radical weather changes.</li>
            <li> I am suffering from pain in my legs due to sciatica.</li>
            <li> I used it the first time on the floor as suggested, but it is difficult for me to get up from the floor.  </li>
            <li> He couldn&#x27;t stand it, because it is rather uncomfortable when you first lie on it.  </li>
            <li> Note that your head will no longer be resting on the pillow.&lt;br /&gt; - continue to move downward until you get the stretch you want in the small of your back.  </li>
            <li> Sound completely impossible?</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it is pink.</li>
            <li> Second time I used it, it brought on a much worse back pain than I had begun with</li>
            <li> first day, I wasn&#x27;t placing the Wedgy in the correct spot (too low), so it was very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It is not real comfortable yet</li>
            <li> It was hard for me to believe that such a small product could help me with my back pain.</li>
            <li> It  is hard until you get it placed properly</li>
            <li> My only complaint ...</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure i have only used it a few time.</li>
            <li> I am 5&amp;#34;11&amp;#34;, average body type.  </li>
            <li> Cannot find a position that is not painful, very uncomfortable to lay on.  </li>
            <li> I even spent (wasted?)</li>
            <li> My only recommendation is to add black or purple as a female color fo those of us who hate pink, because if it is used in public the color is obvious, but if one needs to use it for comfort who cares.  </li>
            <li> Then I started with the device at my belt line and moved it down 1 inch at a time and \\&quot;finally\\</li>
            <li> it is unbelievable!DON&#x27;T GIVE UP IF IT IS NOT WORKING KEEP MOVING IT UP OR DOWN</li>
            <li> The hardest part is identifying 20 minutes in your day to just lie down on this thing...</li>
            <li> basically everything from the waist down was in agony.</li>
            <li> Even with a towel down.)</li>
            <li> /&gt; - slowly inch your way downward until just a little bit of your lower back is off the mat.</li>
            <li> and I even tried myself after I thought I might need the male one because the female one was uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> How to booklet is not very easy to read.</li>
            <li> Nothing has been able to take away the terrible pain in my S.I. joint on the left side.  </li>
            <li> less pain medicine becuase</li>
            <li> Returned it, less shipping.</li>
            <li> I am very active and on my feet, lifting and climbing all day.</li>
            <li> It very hard for a person with back problems to get up &amp; down off the floor.</li>
            <li> #34;reset&amp;#34; tight areas that cause pain or discomfort.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little bit to relax into the stablizer for it to work</li>
            <li> This little thing works.  </li>
            <li> This is a little gift from heaven.  </li>
            <li> This takes a little practice to use.  </li>
            <li> Nothing will ease my pain but this little device.  </li>
            <li> Recommended by my massage therapist, this little device provided me with immediate relief from sciatica pain.  </li>
            <li> I am so greatful for this little device</li>
            <li> it will hurt a little.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that is it a bit silly of a color and looks weird, but hey, when you&#x27;ve been through this type of chronic pain your regard for what other people think goes right out the window!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also recommended-yoga per your situation and swimming specifically breast stroke.  </li>
            <li> The secret seems to be regular use for about 20 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; with narrow hip bones.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the Sacro Wedgy.  </li>
            <li> After using it for several days, I feel like this device made it worse, so I had to return this item.</li>
            <li> Instructions did not make sense until I used it a few times.</li>
            <li> A total game changer for me!!&lt;br /&gt;Reduced</li>
            <li> Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Ordering instructions state if tall and thin order the male version.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I told him it might take a few minutes for his body to settle onto it, but he put it away and never thought about it again.  </li>
            <li> If you have sciatic or piriformis trouble and don&#x27;t give this a try, you&#x27;re short-changing yourself.  </li>
            <li> Wasted my money on another gimmick.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, this thing is a total rip-off.  </li>
            <li> my p.t. recommended cleared it up after just a few weeks of use per directions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering the one for males for my husband as he&#x27;s beginning to feel low-back trouble after each round of golf, or practice at the driving range.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this &amp; was shocked to realize that all the muscles involved were just tight preventing each other from relaxing enough to keep an adjust from going back out..</li>
            <li> The first time I used this device, it was so painful I almost returned it immediately</li>
            <li> The next time I used it on a thin hard bound book in bed and that worked well.  </li>
            <li> You do have to lie still for a little while!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small though.</li>
            <li> It provides this lift in a cupping fashion so you don&#x27;t end up hurting your tailbone which might happen if the pressure was in too small of an area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually have a 20 to 40 min drive home, so I am going to experiment with a homemade version for that.</li>
            <li> Been getting small adjustments here and there and that has been helping with the pain.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product at 3am after several nights of pain, I was a bit skeptical</li>
            <li> Since it is so small, I take it with me on vacations just in case</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had recurring SI joint/hip flare-ups for over 20 years, usually getting a couple of episodes a year.  </li>
            <li> not sure if it is working</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a small woman, 5&amp;#34;0 and about 107 lbs</li>
            <li> If you are skeptical (like I was), there are several YouTube videos you can watch on how to use it correctly and how it works to relieve pain.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I am using this correctly, the directions include pictures of exercises</li>
            <li> Not sure what the benefits are yet.</li>
            <li> And pay especially careful attention to where your tailbone rests!</li>
            <li> The box came with a lot of advertisement of the product which is not helpful and even annoying since I already bought the product, right?</li>
            <li> When chiropractor and acupuncture are not around, when you feel too tired to do exercise actively like yoga or pilates, this tool helps without any effort.</li>
            <li> Not sure if making any difference- hard to place under you while you sit.  </li>
            <li> It might feel uncomfortable, and sometimes even downright hurt sitting on it too long.  </li>
            <li> I will say that the first time it felt quite painful on my sacrum and a little weird</li>
            <li> At bedtime, my midback and abdoman are rock hard and trying to get them to relax was my issue.</li>
            <li> Hard to believe this piece of plastic/rubber can help my sciatica.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A stabilizing pad that goes on the hard surface and the shaped piece that fits under your pelvis.</li>
            <li> I got the wedgy in late July</li>
            <li> I guess you do not want a negative review submitted.</li>
            <li> My pirformis syndrome I have battled with for about 4 months is gone-at least since using Sacro Wedgy.  </li>
            <li> Not knowing how this was supposed to feel, I used it several times as instructed (for at least 20 minutes), and every time, I would get up feeling numb in the area that was against the wedgy.  </li>
            <li> I am now going to a chiropractor and have slowly seen some improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly working my way up to twenty minutes.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am disappointed that I wasted money on it.</li>
            <li> I have a bad back and was looking for an easy to use aid, but it is worthless!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very firm and actually quite painful to lie on as well.  </li>
            <li> Silly little thing but works great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find the correct placement and the online videos are of little help.</li>
            <li> About a year ago, my mom mailed my dad&#x27;s S-W to us just in case we might ever need it, as my husband and I both had bad backs for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The second time was still painful.  </li>
            <li> Does not work as expected, awkward to use, every time you get up you have to reposition yourself and the &amp;#34;two&amp;#34; pieces again.  </li>
            <li> won&#x27;t lie; after 20 minutes of S-W therapy, it was painful to get back up.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this little product works, but it does!!!  </li>
            <li> Sciatica is awful, and the sacro wedgie can really help ease the pain!</li>
            <li> (I sat down for a moment to write something, then got back up and was in terrible pain), and have been rather impaired ever since.  </li>
            <li> and it was the worse.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; and thin.</li>
            <li> Was hopeful, but alas.....</li>
            <li> Made my SI joint pain worse than it was.  </li>
            <li> I am worried that I might be making my sacral joint issue worse maybe by misusing it or experimenting it..</li>
            <li> It was too uncomfortable to use and the burning sciatic pain was made worse each time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li> It was so uncomfortable it woke me up at night.</li>
            <li> Someone had told me to lie on a tennis ball, but tennis balls move and are uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> This looks weird, but it makes sense if you think about it.</li>
            <li> I wake up around 4am every morning unable to think from the pain...</li>
            <li> ro give it a try &amp; not be shy about adding a book under the wedgy as your body adjusts to it for a deeper stretch..</li>
            <li> too difficult to use</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this product when I saw it online, but I thought what have I got to lose, let&#x27;s give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the product did not work for my situation and have returned the product</li>
            <li> started skeptical</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the review I put for the neck roll is the one I wanted for this sacro wedgy.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because of the reviews and desperate to try anything.</li>
            <li> I was really desperate when I stumbled upon the website.     </li>
            <li> I have sciatica pain and was desperate for some relief, so I thought I would try this product based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li> and I was afraid I was going to need surgery....  </li>
            <li> but now I am afraid to let her use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so desperate I&#x27;ll try anything.\\</li>
            <li> When I did use it, I found it awkward to the point that I couldn&#x27;t get my body to relax and &amp;#34;let go,&amp;#34; as you need to in order for this to work.</li>
            <li> This was very uncomfortable for me.  </li>
            <li> Also, it seems very uncomfortable to me</li>
            <li> but once that ended I found it almost impossible to adjust it myself.</li>
            <li> The instructions say that it shouldn&#x27;t be painful, but it may take time to find your &amp;#34;comfort zone&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Painful to lay on and didn&#x27;t help the misalignment in my hips</li>
            <li> Every position is just painful.</li>
            <li> Worthless junk.  </li>
            <li> It was painful!</li>
            <li> condition has been very bad of late.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have suffered with lower back/hip/leg pain for so long.  I am an avid yogi and I do stretches every single day but nothing has given me the relief like this product.  It&#x27;s not comfortable at first but once you get used to it and get your positioning down right you will see that it works wonders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now spent two visits per week for the last three weeks at the chiropractor to fix what this device did to me.  The instructions say that it shouldn&#x27;t be painful, but it may take time to find your &amp;#34;comfort zone&amp;#34;.  I followed all instructions, with and without a neck support and never found the &amp;#34;comfort zone&amp;#34; and am still paying for the added discomfort it gave me.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this device, it was so painful I almost returned it immediately but instead I persevered.  The second time was still painful.  However, afterwards, my hips felt looser than they have in years.  Third time was the charm. Less painful to get into position and had even more of a release.  Chronic knee twinges are GONE!  Will be using this daily for three 20 minute sessions a day then eventually may cut back to once a day.</li>
            <li> Kept trying to like it, but it was not comfortable, no matter how many different times I tried or moved it around. It seems like I just couldn&#x27;t get the right spot. Ended up being more painful then help so I returned it. I bought the male one for my husband, and he didn&#x27;t like it and I even tried myself after I thought I might need the male one because the female one was uncomfortable. Neither did. It may work for some, but I really wanted this to work for me, but just couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Worthless junk.  Save your money and buy some Advil, etc.  This did nothing for me or anyone else I had try it.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the female version to treat pirformis syndrome. It works well for me if I am not flared up or mildly so.  Not if I have severe pain.  Comfortable to sit on and easy to place also stays where you put it.  My only recommendation is to add black or purple as a female color fo those of us who hate pink, because if it is used in public the color is obvious, but if one needs to use it for comfort who cares.  Just a suggestion though.</li>
            <li> I had a herniated disc at l5-s1 so it wasn&#x27;t helping, but it was well made and did feel nice. It&#x27;s small though.</li>
            <li> Two people I know have gotten great relief from using this regularly. It was approved by the Physical Therapist. The secret seems to be regular use for about 20 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> I saw this on \\&quot;The Doctors\\&quot; and so glad I ordered it. This sacro wedgy is helping to stabilize my lower back and helps relieve a little of the pain.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after reading about it on a back pain website. It sounded too good to be true, but it arrived quickly and I used it that very evening. I am here to tell you that after hobbling around for two years and being so out of whack, the more you use it the better you get. I was amazed that something so simple could have made all the difference, the exercises that came with it are ones my doctor recommended but he never knew nothing about the Sacrowedgy until now. An added benefit, if you ever have any questions, the staff will talk to you like you are one of the family and put your mind at ease.</li>
            <li> I saw this on Dr. Oz and thought I would give it a try.  I use it when I lay down at night and it does seem to help with lower back pain.  But as my Dad always said, \\&quot;I&#x27;m not 16 anymore\\&quot;, so it only seems to help when I use it and for a short time thereafter.  Wish it was a total cure, but overall, I like the stretch it gives to the tailbone.  It seems to free it up whenever I have pain and stiffness in my lower back.</li>
            <li> Using the Sacro Wedgey is definitely a helpful part of my back care routine.  My only complaint ... the name :)</li>
            <li> Silly little thing but works great!&lt;br /&gt;I now own 3 of these stabilizers- keep one in my car, one in my office and carry one with me.&lt;br /&gt;You can instantly feel the lower back pain release. I have shared this with my pain and orthopedic doctors as a must have for chronic pain sufferers.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had sciatica symptoms since I started sitting on this thing at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The logic behind it is pretty straightforward as far as sitting on it: by providing some lift to the spinal column, the weight of the upper body no longer presses down where it connects to the pelvis. It provides this lift in a cupping fashion so you don&#x27;t end up hurting your tailbone which might happen if the pressure was in too small of an area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it is pink. It would be much better if it simply came in black as this would make it less noticeable in the workplace.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that this little device actually works. I had been having rather severe lower back pain, sciatica and hip pain for the past 8-9 months without any significant lasting relief with drugs, chiropractic treatment or even spinal decompression therapy. Then, I started using the Sacro Wedgy (which was very painful when getting off of it at first) and within a couple days my pain was much better, and a couple weeks later, I hardly have any pain anymore at all. I sit on it in the car and at work and then I lie on it for about 20 minutes before I go to bed at night. Highly recommended for lower back pain.</li>
            <li> This just didn&#x27;t feel comfortable, and the physical therapy exercises I was given to do by my PT helped me more. See a PT instead, first!</li>
            <li> Got this foe DIL....she said it works great! Had had back pain due to an old injury and didn&#x27;t find relief with other methods such as weight loss and exercise. She said this worked and was easy to follow proper placement.</li>
            <li> I experienced pain in my outer hip for over a year. It was so uncomfortable it woke me up at night. I started walking and stretching. It got worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started limping because of the pain, I saw my doctor. She ordered an X-ray which showed no arthritis and she diagnosed me with bursitis. Rest, ice, steroids. No relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of desperation I tried the Sacro Wedgy along with the neck support for 20 minutes. I just followed the directions in the pamphlet that came with the Wedgy. It is in color and very well illustrated with clear instructions. I woke up the next morning for the first time in 13 months with no pain in my hip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device provides an amazing isolation of the sacrum. Placement is a bit tricky. I am 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; with narrow hip bones. I should have purchased the male version. Just place it following the directions, and use a roll and relax for 20 minutes. You will feel muscles all through your back and pelvis stretch and finally relax or loosen. It is an intense feeling and I had to consciously tell myself to relax. Just truly amazing. Follow the directions and get up carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I decieded to try a homemade version first, just to see if it helped at all. I am female, 66, 5ft 4in, and own my own painting business. I am very active and on my feet, lifting and climbing all day. At bedtime, my midback and abdoman are rock hard and trying to get them to relax was my issue. I took a White Rain (pump type) hair spray bottle and wrapped a wash cloth (fastened it with a safety pin) around it,to make it a little bigger and add some cushioning. I place it directly between the fullest part of my hips, so they fall down on either side of the bottle. I can feel my body start to relax immediately! What a great way to end my day! I lay on it for 10 to 15 mins while I read and am so relaxed, I can easily fall asleep. And it was FREE!&lt;br /&gt;I am intrigued with the idea of sitting on the sacrowedgy while driving. I usually have a 20 to 40 min drive home, so I am going to experiment with a homemade version for that.</li>
            <li> Really relieves pain while driving in the car!! My physical therapist showed me how to sit on it properly to get the maximum benefit. Plan to get one for my office chair as well.</li>
            <li> I have sacroiliac joint dysfunction, iliotibial band syndrome, and had frozen left glutes partly because one leg is shorter than the other.  This really does relax me. Someone had told me to lie on a tennis ball, but tennis balls move and are uncomfortable.  The shape of the sacro wedgy cradles you and provides balance. I relaxed in a way I haven&#x27;t in years, after only 15 minutes. It started by relaxing one side of my glutes that had been stiff for years even after physical therapy.  I was able to move the affected muscles during the day, not just during the session. The wedgy ended up relieving neck pain because the relaxation traveled all the way up.  It has a balancing effect and I learned how to recognize imbalances. I  sit straighter on my bottom. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This little tool really works.  Now, I don&#x27;t need it anymore.  It is all about alignment.</li>
            <li> I really tried to love this but ...ugh...not so much....using a tennis shoe with a sock stuffed in it works much better for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! After a car accident in 2006 I have experienced a lot of trouble with my SI joint popping out of place. I initially was going to a physical therapist who would adjust it for me but once that ended I found it almost impossible to adjust it myself. This product is the only thing that has worked for me. It takes a little bit to relax into the stablizer for it to work but I really have no complaints on this product!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I thought it would be worth a try. I was desperate and this was highly reviewed and not horribly expensive, and I am glad I purchased it. I think that since my issues involve my pelvis not being quite shaped right, I should have had a physical therapist help me out, but after two times, I really do feel a lot of relief. And using it regularly does seem to help me from becoming stiff and sore from even a few minutes of sitting.</li>
            <li> Degenerative disks got a little better with exercise so never used it. Really too scared to. I was going to bring to my PT guy. Couldn&#x27;t figure out instructions.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from sciatica for over a year and was hospitalized due to problems connected with it.  I was diagnosed with scolliosis, herniated disc, and spinal stenosis.  I had two epidurals, lots of physical therapy, seven accupuncture treatments and was trying to learn to listen to my body and manage the pain.  I bought a lumbar pillow, a gel seat, &amp; various other cushions for sitting or sleeping.  The sacro wedgy used twice a day for twenty minutes is providing relief from the pain and I shall make it a big part of my daily program.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use this product. It was too uncomfortable to use and the burning sciatic pain was made worse each time I tried to use it. The directions weren&#x27;t very helpful either. Overall, I am disappointed that I wasted money on it.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing! Feels so good and works when you use it often or daily. My sister tried it and loved it also! She kept stealing it from me :-)&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that when I used it often, my low back/tailbone pain was a lot less and even gone. It depends mainly on how often I use it.</li>
            <li> loe to use this while watching TV, keeps my spine in check</li>
            <li> Waited for a Long time for the price tag to come below $30 but never did . I bit the bullet. I&#x27;m so glad I did I love it</li>
            <li> Not sure how much it is helping.  Still having low back pain eventhough I\\&quot;ve used it regularly.  Can&#x27;t tell for sure if I have it positioned right since it feels kind of funny no matter how I lay on it.  Also, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;9\\&quot; and a girl with a normal sized pelvis and they say to use the male one if you&#x27;re over 5&#x27;7\\&quot; with a narrow pelvis.  I think I could use a longer wedgy that still accommodated a female pelvis.  I sometimes wonder if that&#x27;s why the positioning never feels quite right, I&#x27;m too tall for the standard female one.</li>
            <li> Did not help my back/hip for osteoarthritis.</li>
            <li> This product has changed my life.  I have suffered from sciatic pain for 15 years.  Blah, blah, blah.  If you are reading this review, chances are that you have or will read the others.  Look - if you have back pain of any kind, specifically in your lower back though, this thing is for you.  It might feel uncomfortable, and sometimes even downright hurt sitting on it too long.  You know what, though?  This little thing works.  Very, very well.  There is plenty of literature that tells you how it works.  Bottom line is, it&#x27;s like $25 to change your life if you have sciatic pain.  Do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Anthony&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I wish I knew why it stuck this review in the female version of this.  I am a male--I cannot attest as to whether or not this works great for females.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It really is helping my pain alot. The first time in A LONGGGG TIME  no pain along my sacrum when I try to sleep. At first it felt like I was lying in a brick. Then I started with the device at my belt line and moved it down 1 inch at a time and \\&quot;finally\\&quot; it seemed to cradle my pelvis ( even though it was higher than I thought it should be)  and then became comfortable. I think my back was so tight there was no curve! It is also helping with the pain between my shoulder blades. I must have been twisted all up and this device straightened me out ( smile) ! I use it in bed on top of a firm thin book with my Neck Ease to cradle my neck. I have fell asleep on it more than once. Also take it driving and it helps- it is unbelievable!DON&#x27;T GIVE UP IF IT IS NOT WORKING KEEP MOVING IT UP OR DOWN UNTIL YOU FEEL IT CRADLE YOUR SACRUM.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had sciatica (sp?)pain and RLS for years. I&#x27;ve been to doctors and chiropractors and have not found relief. I bought this because of the reviews and desperate to try anything. I&#x27;ve used it for a week (4 times total) and I can say that I have had less back and leg pain since starting it than I have in recent memory. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase&lt;br /&gt;Any chance they can make one for my neck &amp; shoulders?</li>
            <li> I have 6 herniated discs and I&#x27;m 23 weeks pregnant and can&#x27;t take pain meds and this has been a life savor!!! I use it on my entire back and neck every day and it makes my life a lot more manageable!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the Sacro Wedgy.  It is difficult to find the correct placement and the online videos are of little help.</li>
            <li> I had no idea my low back and hip pain was being caused by Morton&#x27;s foot syndrome resulting in a rotated pelvis and sacrum until I went to an occupational therapist.  I have since been treated for the Morton&#x27;s foot by using metatarsal pads under the first metatarsal and using the sacro wedgy.  I got the wedgy in late July and it probably took about a month of using it every am and pm or whenever I felt pain, for most of my low back pain to be gone.  Since I have been through years of chiropractic, massage, rolfing and physical therapy without any lasting relief, this little thing is like a miracle to me!  Now, I get up in the morning without pain and drive and get out of the car without feeling like a cripple and taking 5 minutes to be able to walk more comfortably.  I have been treated for back problems since my 20&#x27;s and am now in my 60&#x27;s so it is amazing to me to finally find out the cause and be able to have relief after all these years!  I will use this whenever I need it to keep pain free and recommend it to anyone who complains of chronic low back pain.</li>
            <li> My hip and sacrum seem to go out often.  I either had to use anti-inflammatories or go to the chiropractor or both.  My cranial sacral therapist told me about this product.  I was skeptical, but it worked the first time and everytime.  Not only that my sacrum seems to go out less.  Simple to use, and you can take it anywhere you go.</li>
            <li> It really helps my back and psyatic nerve pain.  You can use the pad by itself too, and I ordered the one inch also.  The pads are cheap, so order one or two of them and try em out.  Men will not like so much.  It hits their stuff, and my son doesn&#x27;t like his.</li>
            <li> This is a little gift from heaven.  It has done more for me than 30 years worth of chiropractic adjustments and muscle relaxers ever did.  The wedgy does all that it claims to and then some.  I have SI joint problems with arthritic conditions and a herniated disc in the lower lumbar.  I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does.  I&#x27;ve been taking a \\&quot;wedgy rest\\&quot; for around 2 weeks now and I think I&#x27;m safe in saying it really does work. It is a must for anyone who sits in an office all day.  Prevent occupational injury by using this thing daily!    I was really desperate when I stumbled upon the website.     The staff is most kind and helpful too.    [[ASIN:B000RZWKOC Sacro Wedgy Female Version]].</li>
            <li> I believe in the product, but it is kind of uncomfortable if you do not have much cushion in the glute area.</li>
            <li> This is a flimsy piece of junk that is in no way worth $30!  I wish I had information as to how to return it!  I have a bad back and was looking for an easy to use aid, but it is worthless!  I really want my $ back!</li>
            <li> I have sciatica pain and was desperate for some relief, so I thought I would try this product based on the reviews.  After using it for several days, I feel like this device made it worse, so I had to return this item. I am now going to a chiropractor and have slowly seen some improvement. Lesson learned - see a professional to find out the proper treatments (ice vs. heat, appropriate exercises/movements, etc.) to avoid making things worse.</li>
            <li> This has saved my back - and sanity.  I tore ligaments in my SI region back in 2013 (ouch!) and it was the worse.  It cause my lower back to misalign and I was afraid I was going to need surgery....  After 3 months of 24/7 pain in which physically therapy really didn&#x27;t help - this was the only thing that provided relief to my ever shifting hip bones/lower back.  Easy to use and it comes with gentle stretches and exercises to help strengthen and align the back.    Thank you for making such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This was very uncomfortable for me.  Didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure i have only used it a few time. but it seems to help.</li>
            <li> Cannot find a position that is not painful, very uncomfortable to lay on.  At first attempt, ten words required, every time a try to submit it ask for more words.  I guess you do not want a negative review submitted. Is this enough words?</li>
            <li> I purchased this on the advice of my massage therapist.I use it daily and have found it relieves my lower back discomfort.I also have a pinched sciatic nerve,which can cause discomfort in my leg. The sacro wedgy has helped with this also. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This funny little thing worked quite well when my Sacro Illiac (low back) went out&lt;br /&gt;helped hugely with self care between visits to my Rolfer</li>
            <li> it hasnt helped me at all. maybe it&#x27;s too low for me. i &#x27;ll put some extra stuff underneath and i&#x27;ll try it again. but, before that i used a rolled bath towel and it worked amazingly great! i suggest you first try the towel and then buy any stuff you are proposed!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had full release as yet on left SI joint, but not expecting something that has been stuck for years to release in a few weeks. Been getting small adjustments here and there and that has been helping with the pain.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter when she lost the one she had..then found it and I returned this one...she has used this item for years, in fact we both did,..she is a hairdresser and long hours on her feet take a toll. I found about about the Wedgy years ago and purchased one.  She uses it every-night to de-stress her lower back.  When she thought she left it in a rental car (she had taken it to show a back doctor) she was very upset.  I couldn&#x27;t remember the exact name of it and tried for hours on the computer to fine out.  My chiropractor remember. When I realized I could get it through Amazon I was ecstatic.  I ordered one for her immediately.  Since she does not live that near me and we are both busy she failed to tell me she had found her original one.  I had also used it when she lived with me but after an accident compromised my lower back I have to be overly cautious  so I let it go to her full time..It helped me relieve my tight back after hours in the car and general stress..</li>
            <li> This was no cure, but it increased the comfort when sitting on it. It is used at home and in the car when riding.</li>
            <li> I borrowed one from my sister-in-law and it helped the back spasms a lot. I bought one from myself and another for my husband. Isn&#x27;t a cure, but it helps.</li>
            <li> This looks weird, but it makes sense if you think about it. I suffer from chronic back pain, and I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I&#x27;ve since been diagnosed as having a bulging lumbar vertebra, so anything that helps my spine regain the right curve is great. This takes some practice, and having someone help you get lined up makes it a lot easier. Also, neck support is crucial. My friend, who builds houses despite chronic back pain, keeps his in the freezer. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I am placing this in the right place, but I suffer from sciatica symptoms and piriformis symptoms.  I&#x27;m not seeing any relief from sitting on this unless I&#x27;m not using it properly.</li>
            <li> It is uncomfortable to use at first but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s helpful.  The hardest part is identifying 20 minutes in your day to just lie down on this thing...</li>
            <li> I bought this on the advise of my doctor.So far it seems to help my hips alot.I really like this product and would recommend&lt;br /&gt;it for those who have lower back pain or hip pain.</li>
            <li> I go to chiropractor 3x a week...L5 is out, S1 is angry, and more.  I can&#x27;t sleep for more than one hour in any position (cadaver), so I wake up around 4am every morning unable to think from the pain...I crawl into open floor space and get right on this.  It hurts like hell, but then your body adjusts and after 20 min or so, I am able to walk (without dragging my leg) and usually go back to bed for a couple of hours.  I does give relief.</li>
            <li> I have not had this long enough to really rate it. The 3 stars are because the instructions about where to place it are not clear enough. Also, it seems very uncomfortable to me so I only use when I already have pain. Does seem to help some then if you can stay on it long enough.</li>
            <li> Really, folks, you need better illustrations than a spinal cord to show how to place it. Most people don&#x27;t know exactly where to place it, and the illustration doesn&#x27;t show where the wide and where the narrow ends go.  I watched the videos and thought I had it right, but I didn&#x27;t, and it never was comfortable.  I now place one of those chiropractic dog bone pillows vertically under my sacroiliac , and let my muscles relax on either side. It&#x27;s soft, doesn &#x27;t push into my bones, and can be easily adjusted for comfort.</li>
            <li> Finding the sacrum is like searching for a needle in a haystack, but once you get this aligned you&#x27;ll start noticing the difference. Especially if you do yoga or stretching too. It might hurt a bit at first, I&#x27;m still adjusting to mine, but you do get more &amp; more used to it. I will say that it came in so handy on a long airplane ride. I just sat on it &amp; I felt so much better! The instructions &amp; papers inside are a bit overwhelming &amp; maybe too much, but watch the online video or any online video about getting it lined up on your sacrum. I bought the female one even though I&#x27;ve had no kids. I think it works well. They say you can easily return it for the male one if needed. I think it&#x27;s worth the cost &amp; was recommended to me by my medical massage therapist. Sciatica is awful, and the sacro wedgie can really help ease the pain!</li>
            <li> This takes a little practice to use.  Youtube videos help.  It does help provide relief when my low back is screaming.</li>
            <li> This simple device has relieved a lot of my low back pain and is bringing balance to my center. I can sit on this on a soft couch for a couple of hours, stand up and feel like I haven&#x27;t been sitting. No pain or stiffness. Wow, I can watch a movie comfortably now</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Highly recommend.  It has made a huge difference in my sciatica pain but you have to use it.</li>
            <li> Quality was as company noted and delivery was timely. Using the product did not work for me, however it seems to be a viable solution for others.</li>
            <li> Used it for a week, it is working and helping, it gets this one spot in my lower back that the foam roller does not. Also it is not complex to use, I did better using the foam pad under it so thank goodness I did not throw it out it looked like it might be packing. Instructions did not make sense until I used it a few times. Also has quite a unique appearance</li>
            <li> I learned about the Sacro Wedgy years ago at a Massage Therapy convention. They were giving demonstrations of the product. The reason it is still around is that it WORKS!</li>
            <li> Not sure if making any difference- hard to place under you while you sit.  Need more tome with this to decide</li>
            <li> My husband and I have used the sacro wedgy for over a year now because of leg/sciatica pain and have been able to stabilize chronic conditions and strengthen our bodies.  Our daughter also plays w/it and it helps her.  Have told many people how well this inexpensive device can help.  My only suggestion is to start slow if you have pain while laying on it and even put a pillow under your legs to begin with if you can not lay flat comfortably.  Good luck and good health.  Sharon, a thrilled customer</li>
            <li> I bought both the male and female versions since I am fairly tall, 5&#x27;9&amp;#34;. I had my physical therapist show me which one to use (the female) and how to lie on it. It comes with a firm foam pad about 3/4&amp;#34; to use if lying on a soft bed. I started using it at night, I lie on it for 15 - 30 minutes when I go to bed. I feel better than I have in 6 years. Between my excellent physical therapist and my sacro-wedgy I feel great! I highly recommend it for SI joint problems. Not all back pain is SI pain, but this works great for SI joint dysfunction.</li>
            <li> I have used this once and it seems like it might work.  I was using a rolled up towel before I got this, and I can tell you the towel DOES work.  I might need more elevation to make the wedgy work better, and maybe better neck support as well.</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers, I just couldn&#x27;t get this to be comfortable.  I didn&#x27;t expect comfy but I when I used it, I ended up in more pain than before use.  It might be me, but it doesn&#x27;t matter since the end result is the same.</li>
            <li> My physical therapist recommends it, I have tight hip flexors &amp; it helps.</li>
            <li> This gadget caused me to have more back pain. It hurts to use this thing! But I kept using it every day for almost two weeks, thinking that it would somehow heal my back. It made my back feel worse, it gave me more back pain, and that is all it did.  No, I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> AWESOME! I have been a firefighter for 26 years. The job has taken a toll on me physically.... especially my low back. I suffered for a long time with low back, hip pain radiating down my legs &amp; aggravated piriformis muscles that then fires up my sciatic nerves. My culprit is a cartilage tear in my hip joint. The tear will aggravate all the muscles that attach from the hip to my low back. No spine specialists could figure out why I Was in so much pain.. My issues were all muscular.. Muscles spasming that were connected. My chiropractor could not keep my SI joints in place long enough to get relief. An adjustment would provide immediate but temporary relief. I thought I would try this &amp; was shocked to realize that all the muscles involved were just tight preventing each other from relaxing enough to keep an adjust from going back out.. which took my low back out with it. 20 minutes 2 times a day while in a &amp;#34;flare up&amp;#34; from exercising or whatever my job threw at me has changed my life. I add extra height to get an even more aggressive stretch with a thick book. Gently rocking my hips in an &amp;#34;Indian style&amp;#34; (feet flat against one another) really stretches &amp; relaxes the muscles in my hips &amp; around my sacrum. i really don&#x27;t know how else one could achieve such a specific stretch to get relief in all the areas that affect the hip, low back, sacrum &amp; SI joints. this has been a complete life saver for me until  I can have the surgery to repair my torn hip labrum. I hope this helps others ro give it a try &amp; not be shy about adding a book under the wedgy as your body adjusts to it for a deeper stretch..</li>
            <li> We tried this for my wife&#x27;s perplexing spinal problems and it did not work.  But, she has an unusual condition, so don&#x27;t rule this out.  It may work for some people.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this definitely relieves sacral pain. It probably helps with sciatica as well although I haven&#x27;t had the chance to test that yet.</li>
            <li> How to booklet is not very easy to read. I wanted to see much better results.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I loved it. It seemed to take away my lower back issue. I waited a couple days before using again. Second time I used it, it brought on a much worse back pain than I had begun with and I have struggled with it in the 3 days since. Unfortunately I ordered another one after my first use to give my daughter (nurse) who must lean over patients all day but now I am afraid to let her use it. Would love to know what the wedgy people think about my experience.</li>
            <li> Painful to lay on and didn&#x27;t help the misalignment in my hips</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Sacro Wedgy!  I would be in constant neck and hip pain without it.  My chiropractor recommended it and now I don&#x27;t go anywhere without it.  I even have one in the car. I sit on it, I stretch on it and heaven knows what other kind of treatments I&#x27;d have to endure if I didn&#x27;t have it.  It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> This is a great item.  It was recommended by a colleague that does myafascial release and I find it helpful.</li>
            <li> Not certain if it helped in the long run or if I just got better since I was also taking other measures to help my back.</li>
            <li> I have not used it much yet , but it seems to help with hip alignment.  My sister loves hersâ€¦  worthy of consideration at the least. You do have to lie still for a little while!  But if you relax you will find that was a good thing too.  Not comfortable at first but stay with it.</li>
            <li> Use it on my massage therapy clients and it has been wonderful for pain relief.  It has been the greatest tool in my profession</li>
            <li> It was hard for me to believe that such a small product could help me with my back pain. I was in a terrible car accident, T-boned by someone running a red light at high speed, and I developed SI Joint Dysfunction as well as chronic back tension. I went to see specialists and Chiropractors for 6 months and nothing could solve the issues I had developed. Even my legs/ankles were in pain because my nerves were all messed up. I was depressed for months. Then, I saw this item on a health blog and decided, \\&quot;Why not? I&#x27;m so desperate I&#x27;ll try anything.\\&quot; And... BAM. This product is AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was frustrating to use at first because I didn&#x27;t know how to position it. But, I continued exploring with it and when I found the perfect fit it was life changing. The product has given me the ability to sit without pain, run for miles, lift weights, and sleep soundly (very important!!). Not only did I get better, I was also able to save my money and stop going to the expensive specialists or Chiropractors who didn&#x27;t know a darn thing about how I could be fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy that I purchased the Sacrowedgy. I really feel like my life is back on track and I can take ownership of my body&#x27;s health. Very empowering.</li>
            <li> I was so looking forward to this--had hoped it would be he answer to my low back problems.  Instead, it caused my great discomfort.  I hope to return it.</li>
            <li> too difficult to use and it causes more pain than usual.  it did not help me like i thought it would.</li>
            <li> i have used this several times and works great along with the neck support.  At first i was hesitant to order and try, but it was worth the gamble.</li>
            <li> Absolutely remarkable.  Even though I&#x27;ve had instant results, I would not recommend giving up chiropractor care completely.  It has lessened the amount of treatments I&#x27;ve required.  Doing it daily works best. Watching the Sacro Wdgy video on You Tube was very helpful also.</li>
            <li> Cheap and Useless.  I&#x27;m sorry that I wasted my money, but I had been curious for a long time and now my curiosity is satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist and am always looking for tips for my clients.  I love this for myself.  It saves me trips to the chiropractor.</li>
            <li> I bought this after months of going to a chiropractor and being in two types of physical therapy for pelvic and lower back pain.  My condition had progressed so greatly because doctors kept dismissing my car accident pain as &amp;#34;woman pain.&amp;#34;  (insert eye roll here) As a result, my diagnosis took an incredible amount of time and left me with a lot of pain and anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a number of different times that my body just didn&#x27;t seem to want to continue healing, and I would have to keep changing it up.  This product was literally a *miracle worker*  I personally checked with the physical therapists and chiropractors before using to make sure it fit my body well, and would recommend that potentially for others as well.  The physical therapy center now has it on their recommended items list for pelvic pain that is muscle related.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally did not use the elevator and used a towel for neck support.  Additionally, I found that I needed about 23-25 minutes each time, and would sometimes need to use it for up to an hour!  As other reviewers indicated, I followed the exercises on the sacrowedgy but did not do the additional ones without since I already had my own personal set of exercises to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it to sit on it and that helps extremely, as well.  My only complaint is that is it a bit silly of a color and looks weird, but hey, when you&#x27;ve been through this type of chronic pain your regard for what other people think goes right out the window!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also recommended-yoga per your situation and swimming specifically breast stroke.  If you are having chronic pain, hang in there! !!!  I went through a lot emotionally and physically and found that the people who were the most successful were those who continued to hold on and work through it.  Just keep trying and do your best to relax-meditate and find the beauty in the moment!  Getting and using a sacrowedgy will give you automatic meditation time!!!  Good luck!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from Sciatica Pain for so very long...Im a runner and I lift weights on a daily basis...I tried massage, tennis balls, pain pills...  I had this product for three days now, have used it three times and my pain is just about gone!  I don&#x27;t know how this little product works, but it does!!!  Great results!!</li>
            <li> Have used several times.  Seems to be making a difference in my pain level.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product at 3am after several nights of pain, I was a bit skeptical however I was in so much pain I ordered several different products - I was willing to try anything!  I know others may have different results, but just after using it for 20 mins I got relief.  I used it for a week and the pain went away.  Since it is so small, I take it with me on vacations just in case I get a re-occurance.  I have recommened it to several friends (even bought one for my best friend) and they have all have had simliar results.  Love it,  and I am so glad I found this product otherwise I would be going to the doctors for an adjustment every week!</li>
            <li> This Sacrowedgy is amazing. I&#x27;ve had recurring SI joint/hip flare-ups for over 20 years, usually getting a couple of episodes a year.  After using the Sacrowedgy just a few times, my hips feel the best they have since 1991!  It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re not even mine!  Yes, I&#x27;ve went through doctors, medications, PT, chiropractic, and massage, but never has the relief been as complete or lasting like this.  I can&#x27;t believe how simple and effective and inexpensive.  I ended up having to swap for the blue/male model because this one didn&#x27;t fit me quite right. When I contacted the company, the owner (Cindy) was extremely friendly, helpful and accommodating.  I&#x27;m also trying Annette Fletcher&#x27;s DVD \\&quot;Save Your Lower Back\\&quot;.  I use the Sacrowedgy for 20 minutes before doing the DVD because it truly gets the area TOTALLY relaxed before proceeding with strengthening and stretching, which Annette Fletcher says is an imperative first step.  It is a shame more medical professionals don&#x27;t know about this wonderful little gadget.  So wish I had found Sacrowedgy years ago. I hope others can benefit, too.</li>
            <li> A total game changer for me!!&lt;br /&gt;Reduced pain in 20 min!!&lt;br /&gt;Every osteopath or orthopedic doc should recommend these!!!&lt;br /&gt;Eventually had the SI Joint Fusion Surgery, but this helped me make it for the last year.&lt;br /&gt;ANYONE WITH TAILBONE PAIN-- MUST TRY!!</li>
            <li> helps relieve muscle tension and aches for all those areas that support the sacroilliac joint.  Is quite a relief and will help reposition sacrum if it has rotated.</li>
            <li> The directions were limited and I was pretty sure I was messing my back up more by using it. It was painful! Returned it! I would only recommend this if you have clear direction from your doctor on how to use it.</li>
            <li> Great product for relief of sciatica and stabilization of the pelvis!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Nothing will ease my pain but this little device.  It takes all the pressure off the sciatic nerve and releases the muscle pain. Amazing gadget. I would recommend this to everyone and although it may seem a little difficult to use at first, it works! I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
            <li> I cannot figure out how to place this or what it does. The information included with the product isn&#x27;t particularly helpful either. I even spent (wasted?) quite a bit of time on their website looking for more info. I wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> Bought this on suggestion of my doctor for back and hip pain. Works amazingly. It does everything he was doing for me in office. Make sure you use it properly and get a doctors help the first time. My sacrum centered pain, hips and back pain are almost all fixed when using this. I need to start using it when I&#x27;m not in pain to build up the benefits.</li>
            <li> It helped with the pain but didn&#x27;t cure it. It might work for someone with a different hip back problem. My herniated disks are the opposite way of most. Mine project toward the back and not toward the body like most people&#x27;s do. It helps the hips drop and provides a unique stretch.</li>
            <li> I have a permanent injury to my lower back. This works better for me than anything else. I think I have tried almost everything including including a inversion unit. I know it doesn&#x27;t seem like much and is so simple but in my case,it works wonders when my lower back acts up which usually occurs when there are radical weather changes. I permanently glued the foam elevation part to it with shoe goo. I personally would give it a try; with Amazon Prime you can get all your money back should it not fit you or solve your problem.It&#x27;s worth a shot and is based on the knowledge of an Osteopath. I have great respect for Osteopathic medicine.</li>
            <li> I have major back problems, I have had a discectomy and a spinal fusion due to a herniated disc at L5/S1. Nothing has been able to take away the terrible pain in my S.I. joint on the left side.  I was a bit skeptical about this product when I saw it online, but I thought what have I got to lose, let&#x27;s give it a try.  I am completely amazed at how much it has helped my S.I. joint pain.  I use it everyday for only about 5-10 minutes and it makes a world of difference, I have even been able to take less pain medicine becuase it&#x27;s been working so well.</li>
            <li> Shared it with my physical therapist and he was glad to see it and said to go ahead.  When my sciatica was flared up, this helped relieve the intense pain.  Over time and with physical therapy I am feeling so much better!</li>
            <li> My PT first lent me her Sacro Wedgy for a week.  3 days into using the Wedgy i decided how great it was working and ordered my own.  I have now had the wedgy for 2plus weeks and i have set up a mat near my tv and use the wedgy every am .  What a great way to start your day!  My hips and lower back have amazingly  improved!  I will continue with this device for as long as it taked to feel better 100%</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for the longest time, to re-align my out-of-place hips.  It arrived quickly and works great.  I&#x27;m going to buy another one to keep at work.</li>
            <li> This really aligns my spine, relaxes my muscles and really helps with chronic pain issues along with other exercises and physical therapy. I would not have known about this if my P.T. had not had me use it in a session. Love it and it&#x27;s easy to travel with as well.</li>
            <li> Have tried it for several days and not sure it is really all that beneficial yet.</li>
            <li> I am suffering from pain in my legs due to sciatica. I feel that this product relieves the pain. it seems to help me a great deal with the few times I have used it. I would recommend this product for sciatic conditions. You should see your physician before using any product online!</li>
            <li> This actually is very helpful. I have back problems and over the years have tried almost everything, most of which did not help.Pleasantly surprised with this.</li>
            <li> Great releif for sciatiaca pain.  Easy to use.  Lightweight for travel.  Really does work when used as directed.  Good price for such a wonderful amount of releif.</li>
            <li> Never could figure out how to use this properly. Every position is just painful. Needs more directions on how to position.</li>
            <li> Just a basic back stretcher seems help more.</li>
            <li> When I remember to use it, it relaxes a lot of key places in my body that get punished by my profession.</li>
            <li> not sure if it is working</li>
            <li> I probably should have gotten the men&#x27;s (longer) version. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; and thin. I wish there was a video that showed how to position it and use it.</li>
            <li> this really  works to stretch your back and ease the pain.  Even if you don&#x27;t have the recommended 20 minutes, it works</li>
            <li> I like this product for use in my myofascial clinic.  I have used it myself and think it is beneficial to assist with normal sacral positioning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many pads, lotions and therapy to help alleviate the constant pain from Piriformis syndrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The wedgy helps me sit in a chair for hours.  I also use it at night laying on the floor.  It releases the tightness in my hips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a bit difficult trying to get it in the right position at first. Now I can&#x27;t live without it.  I use it along with daily stretching.</li>
            <li> amazing--it actually works-I was quite skeptical that a small rubber wedge could do anything to relieve my sciatica and lower back pain, but after 15 minutes on the wedgy I was able to &amp;#34;rise and walk&amp;#34; without pain. It&#x27;s also small enough to throw in the car for long road trips, I can place it under my tailbone and get some relief while driving.</li>
            <li> First thing ever to relive my SI pain!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a pain from my left SI joint that radiated across my left buttock for YEARS. This literally removed the pain in minutes. Now I lay on it a couple of minutes a day for maintenance. This was recommended to me by a Physical Therapist (and yoga teacher) at a local yoga teacher training (I&#x27;m a registered yoga teacher too). At times, the pain was almost debilitating and certainly made sitting and certain activities unbearable Now,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m free of pain. It is a Godsend!</li>
            <li> I had trouble getting comfortable on this. I never really felt the release of tension. I will keep trying it occasionally.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Returned it, less shipping.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my massage therapist, this little device provided me with immediate relief from sciatica pain.  There are instructions for use provided.  I now use it when I feel pain and once or twice a week for maintenance.  I also use it when I will be lying flat for a long period of time without adequate support (during accupuncture).  For me, this was a life-changing purchase.  At home I keep it handy (in my nightstand) and I always travel with it!</li>
            <li> Whenever my sacro illiac joint acts up i just lay back on this and do some pelvic tilts. I can feel my joints pop back into place. A lifesaver:)</li>
            <li> I bought the female sacrowedgy for my 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; daughter who experienced lumbar and tight hip pain and uncomfortableness for two years. In one session she felt immediate and lasting relief. She uses the wedgy once or twice a week depending on her sports activities. I have now purchased my own sacrowedgy and i also experience relief but due to age and cumilative injuries I must use the wedgy more often. Sometimes twice a day if on my feet long hours. I am so greatful for this little device and I thank the inventor.</li>
            <li> My massage therapist told me about the Sacro Wedgy because I&#x27;ve had low back and SI pain for a few months.  I went to the manufacturer&#x27;s web site and watched a video that was helpful in explaining how to use the Wedgy and why it was invented.  By elevating the sacrum, the low back is forced into the correct position and as the pelvic muscles/tendons/ligaments are allowed to stretch.  Using the Wedgy for 20 minutes gives your body time to &amp;#34;reset&amp;#34; tight areas that cause pain or discomfort.  I learned that having the neck supported is very important so I also ordered the neck roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first day, I wasn&#x27;t placing the Wedgy in the correct spot (too low), so it was very uncomfortable.  But after watching the video again and looking at the info that came in the box, I was able to correctly place the Wedgy and have had tremendous relief in only a week!  My low back pain is gone (I used to have to bend over several times a day to stretch my low back and now I can go all day with no pain) and my SI joint is getting better as well.  I can feel stretching going on when I&#x27;m using the Wedgy so I know it&#x27;s doing my body good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the Sacro Wedgy to those who will use it consistently and properly - the benefits may not be immediately noticeable, but after only a short while, I have had great results.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and I&#x27;m very glad I purchased it.  I can throw it in my purse and slid it under my seat when out.&lt;br /&gt;Thing is, after a while it starts to hurt regardless.  I have piramis syndrom and it takes the pressure off for a while but then puts pressure elsewhere.  I&#x27;m also a small woman, 5&amp;#34;0 and about 107 lbs so it may be better for someone with more padding in the butt.  Still helps enough I am happy I bought it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have suffered with chronic low back pain for over 10 years.  The Sacro Wedgy in two days has kept away the pain for almost a week now.  I did have some intense discomfort throughout night after my first use.  I got up in the morning, started moving around and felt some major realignment happening in my low back!  Got right back on it the second day, still a little uncomfortable to lay on.&lt;br /&gt;  I make sure to do the rocking side to side and pelvic tilts when I first lay on it like the instructional video recommends.  Pelic tilts again before removing it.  Also, there is a recommended stretch for the end.&lt;br /&gt;  Sometimes I feel a (good) release while on it, sometimes after,  while I am just walking around the house.&lt;br /&gt;  My pirformis syndrome I have battled with for about 4 months is gone-at least since using Sacro Wedgy.  No amount of special exercises, stretches or anti-inflammatory has done any good in all that time.&lt;br /&gt;  I highly recommemd this product.  Besides pain, what do you have to lose!</li>
            <li> After 2 sessions my back felt better.  Used it for a month and all back problems went away. Would recommend</li>
            <li> When chiropractor and acupuncture are not around, when you feel too tired to do exercise actively like yoga or pilates, this tool helps without any effort. I found not just lying on it helped, but sitting on it gives great relief too.</li>
            <li> A great help to my current back problems.  Recommended by my chiropractor, good choice, easy to use. very good directions in booklet inclosed.</li>
            <li> It has really helped with my back!</li>
            <li> My wife uses the product on a daily basis for 20 to 30 minutes. Works as advertised on the first use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has back issues occasionally. She thought it was interesting that several of the same exercises in the booklet were some of the same ones recommended by her chiropractor. She uses it often to keep her back supple. Highly recommended by her and also her brothers... who have the male version.</li>
            <li> I am 2 days into trying it, and already starting to feel better. I would highly recommend the sacro wedgy. If you are skeptical (like I was), there are several YouTube videos you can watch on how to use it correctly and how it works to relieve pain. Try it - you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Sacro wedgy is a great product and is working for me. I have to confess I didn&#x27;t intially follow directions which are clearly indicated on packaging and also DVD&#x27;s on company&#x27;s web site. There is also great information, especially pertinent for me because I have piriformis. I am experiencing relief in the week I&#x27;ve had my sacro wedgy. Since I am 70, I have had Lordosis for decades and suffered from my current piriformis since Feb., I am expecting slower progress. I highly recommend this and my suggestion is to follow directions. It took me awhile to remember to use a folded towel under my neck. Also, patience in being comfortable and placing this on my sacrum. Te company is fabulous and takes pride in excellent customer service and helping customers. When in doubt, I contact them and get great advice. I have had significant improvement with my piriformis since I started using this and I highly recommend the sacro wedgy. So simple but very effective.</li>
            <li> Great piece of practical equipment promptly delivered.&lt;br /&gt;Sacro wedgy is the &#x27;3rd hand&#x27; my clients have been wishing I had! I use it in my work as Craniosacral Therapist in Berkeley CA &amp; to relax my own low back and pelvis when the day is done.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Sacro wedgy.</li>
            <li> It  is hard until you get it placed properly but it helps with the pain.</li>
            <li> Helps to ease low back pain. This is easy to use and easy to be comfortable with. I use it a couple of times a week!</li>
            <li> Who knew something so small could actually work so great! I have spent so much money going to an LMT to have work done.  This saco wedgy works!</li>
            <li> My ex-boyfriend had one of these and I tried it and instantly could tell this would help with my lower back pain and stiffness.  I used it, loved itâ€¦ then moved away from the ex and lost it!  I didn&#x27;t know the name and searched and searched, and THIS is it!  I&#x27;m so happy to have found it again, it DOES help when very little else does.  I do stretch, I am active, but I get a certain spasm in lower back that flares up frequently.  This device helps with that.  Give it a try, it takes a little getting used to, but for me it does offer real relief.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say, other than I haven&#x27;t used it much and a pain to get out and where do you lay down and use it?</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I am using this correctly, the directions include pictures of exercises but I have not spent too much time on it. Not sure what the benefits are yet.</li>
            <li> Basically a piece of junk.  Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> It is not constructed as well as I expected.  I have been using it for a few weeks, and I am still deciding if it is really doing what it claims.  It is not real comfortable yet, I can&#x27;t imagine lying on it for 30 min.  I ordered the female version per the instructions.  I am 5&amp;#34;11&amp;#34;, average body type.  Ordering instructions state if tall and thin order the male version.  Since I can&#x27;t return it, it&#x27;s hard to know if the male version would have been better.</li>
            <li> Ok, feeling neutral. Product hasn&#x27;t really helped or hurt in any substantial way?</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe how well this worked.  I keep it in the car all the time.</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing to help my sciatica.  It&#x27;s very firm and actually quite painful to lie on as well.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to get used to this thing. It is starting to feel pretty good. I&#x27;m slowly working my way up to twenty minutes. I will say that i have no sciatica painbsinceni&#x27;ve used it</li>
            <li> After six years of chiropractors, massage therapists, and physical therapists, I had just about given up.  I was using a walker most of the time and in a lot of pain.  I read the reviews for this product and figured &amp;#34;why not&amp;#34;.  I used it the first time for 20 minutes and voila!  I got up and had NO PAIN.  It is a miracle and has given me my life back.  Thank you so much Sacro Wedgy.  I have told everyone about this magic little tool.  I used it three days in a row for 20 minutes and have not had to use it again, though the manufacturer suggests using it regularly.  I will say that the first time it felt quite painful on my sacrum and a little weird so I wasn&#x27;t sure I was positioning it correctly.  The results proved it was in the right place.  I used it the first time on the floor as suggested, but it is difficult for me to get up from the floor.  The next time I used it on a thin hard bound book in bed and that worked well.  I just wish I had purchased this six years ago and saved myself thousands of dollars.  I really do feel like I can live again and I am so grateful.</li>
            <li> I found out that I had a different problem so this wasn&#x27;t the answer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had lower back pain for ages, then my tailbone started hurting, then I had shooting pain down my legs, then I had pain in my heels - basically everything from the waist down was in agony. After research I found my trouble spot was my sacroiliac joints, I did exercises specific to treating the area and I found some relief. But I wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; - not until I got this thing! Imagine you have had lower back, hip, leg, heel pain for years, you lay down for 20 minutes and you get up and wow, nothing hurts at all. Sound completely impossible? It isn&#x27;t. This product relieved every ounce of pain I had been burdened with, I am not exaggerating at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You absolutely need to try this if you suffer from any of the same pains I described. Make sure you read the directions carefully, use the neck support as they advised (I just rolled up a towel until it was the right thickness for my neck). And pay especially careful attention to where your tailbone rests! It *has to* lay in the cradle of the &amp;#34;wedgy&amp;#34;. It might take some adjustments to get it right the first time, just take your time getting it in the right spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first start, yes it will hurt a little. It hurt laying on the hard plastic for maybe the first 10 minutes, but then it began to fade away. I highly advise doing the exercises that come with the product in a little pamphlet. I feel like it helps set my hips right and I stand up and it&#x27;s honestly miraculous how I feel NOTHING. I haven&#x27;t not had pain in my lower body in.. I don&#x27;t even know how long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say enough good things about this product. Please please try it if you are in pain. Read the instructions, use the neck support, put on some soothing music and let yourself relax. It&#x27;s actually really simple and worth it!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the product did not work for my situation and have returned the product</li>
            <li> Does not work as expected, awkward to use, every time you get up you have to reposition yourself and the &amp;#34;two&amp;#34; pieces again.  Waste of money.  Read reviews from various sources and was &amp;#34;iffy&amp;#34; wether to spend the money to get some &#x27;back&#x27; relief.  Was hopeful, but alas..... Nothing.</li>
            <li> Great relief for my degenerative discs</li>
            <li> Hard to believe this piece of plastic/rubber can help my sciatica.&lt;br /&gt;My condition has been very bad of late.&lt;br /&gt;But it truly has helped. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 months now.&lt;br /&gt;I use it pretty religiously--almost daily. For about 20-30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I read while laying on it.&lt;br /&gt;I started skeptical but it does work--at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;It was worth the investment to try it.</li>
            <li> Someone who didn&#x27;t have tender sensitive lower back area. But for me, my sensitive back side was far to tender to appreciate this tool. I was willing to it a try though.</li>
            <li> I have never really figured out how to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not at all sure how I hurt my pirifomis, but I know just how I&#x27;ve gotten on the road to fixing it.  My dad has sciatica, and I bought him a male Sacro-Wedgy several years ago.  He couldn&#x27;t stand it, because it is rather uncomfortable when you first lie on it.  He&#x27;s kind of a baby about pain, so he didn&#x27;t give it more than about 30 seconds.  I told him it might take a few minutes for his body to settle onto it, but he put it away and never thought about it again.  (Incidentally, he still suffers from sciatica; he would rather muddle through than try this amazing little doohickey.)  About a year ago, my mom mailed my dad&#x27;s S-W to us just in case we might ever need it, as my husband and I both had bad backs for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the other day I did something very mysterious to my piriformis (I sat down for a moment to write something, then got back up and was in terrible pain), and have been rather impaired ever since.  My husband remembered we had my dad&#x27;s S-W, so I gave it a shot, knowing it was not quite the right product for me.  I figured it would be better than nothing.  After the first couple of minutes of thinking it was super-uncomfortable, suddenly it got much better.  Then, just as suddenly, I felt something in my body, like a stretch.  It was actually stretching this otherwise-difficult-to-access little muscle!  My husband then had to listen to me go on and on about what a miracle it seemed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t lie; after 20 minutes of S-W therapy, it was painful to get back up.  But after I had been upright for a minute or two, I noticed a huge improvement.  I wasn&#x27;t healed -- I was better.  And better was what I was looking for.  That night the hubs ordered me a female S-W, and it arrived 2 days later.  This thing is wonderful.  It&#x27;s so simple and elegant.  If you have sciatic or piriformis trouble and don&#x27;t give this a try, you&#x27;re short-changing yourself.  I can&#x27;t really imagine why the people who scored this product low would do that, unless they, like my dad, didn&#x27;t really give the thing a fair shot.  Also, remember that it&#x27;s recommended that you use it with a physical therapist&#x27;s assistance.  Maybe take it to a PT and see what they can do to help.  I just don&#x27;t see how anyone with normal anatomy couldn&#x27;t benefit.</li>
            <li> Made my SI joint pain worse than it was.  Wasted my money on another gimmick.  No quick fixes when it comes to back pain.</li>
            <li> WHAT the - ????  In my opinion, this thing is a total rip-off.  Wish it had worked but I think it&#x27;s garbage and returned it.  A hunk of foam for this price - ???</li>
            <li> One word-GIMMICK. A lot of pamphlets that made no sense. It very hard for a person with back problems to get up &amp; down off the floor.</li>
            <li> I have had lower back pain since my child was born 10 months ago, and sometimes I lay on this device, but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s helping or not.</li>
            <li> Still kind of figuring out exactly where to position it for best results.</li>
            <li> As my pelvis dislocates periodically and I travel a lot so am not near my chiropractor when I need her, I use this product after a long day on the motorcycle or in the car. I would give it FIVE STARS if I didn&#x27;t have to use it on the floor for proper support under my pelvis. (Hotel room floors are......well, you know. Even with a towel down.) On the bed, I do not get enough pressure provided to ease my particular pelvic issues. That said~~I don&#x27;t leave home without it! When I use it properly for my condition, I get moderate to complete relief for my pain. (I do NOT claim this will work for everyone or everyone&#x27;s pelvic issues though! Ask your own doctor before using it!) It comes in two pieces. A stabilizing pad that goes on the hard surface and the shaped piece that fits under your pelvis. There are male (blue) and female (pink) versions as our hip areas are shaped differently.</li>
            <li> AS GOOD AS ADVERTISED, MAYBE BETTER.</li>
            <li> Wow.  Years of chiro, yoga, etc, in attempt to clear up low-back issues I&#x27;ve had for at least 6 years, and this terrific little gizmo that my p.t. recommended cleared it up after just a few weeks of use per directions.  Once in a while now, I go a handful of weeks without using it, yet my spine continues to hold in a healthy position.  Then eventually a little pinch begins to remind me ... get back to the Sacro Wedgy.  Voila, good to go.  So grateful to have something so non-time-consuming, non-invasive, and so effective.  I&#x27;m ordering the one for males for my husband as he&#x27;s beginning to feel low-back trouble after each round of golf, or practice at the driving range.</li>
            <li> I bought this with great expectations; fooled by the previous reviews. I have been experimenting since I bought but I still do not get this. How it is supposed to work, am I placing it correctly, what is this supposed to do? I am worried that I might be making my sacral joint issue worse maybe by misusing it or experimenting it.. The directions are not clear about how to place it. I am not sure if I bought the right size even. But there is nothing in the manual explaining such things. The box came with a lot of advertisement of the product which is not helpful and even annoying since I already bought the product, right? They need to include more info and more clear directions about how to place this thing but it feels as if they intentionally avoid to put that important info. I do not get this at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks (as well as a neck roll) due to pain down my right leg that I think is piriformus related. It was not the miracle cure I was hoping for, but the pain is much reduced. Went from a couple of doctor ordered Alleve pills a day to no meds. It really does help.</li>
            <li> I admit I stopped using this, so I can&#x27;t speak to the long term effects. When I did use it, I found it awkward to the point that I couldn&#x27;t get my body to relax and &amp;#34;let go,&amp;#34; as you need to in order for this to work. Putting a rolled towel under my neck often made my head numb, and I was never quite sure I was putting the wedge in the right place.</li>
            <li> Actually this review is for the neck roll support.  I love it.  Unfortunately, the review I put for the neck roll is the one I wanted for this sacro wedgy.  I don&#x27;t like this at all..  But Yes, I  liked the neck roll.</li>
            <li> In theory, it looks like it will work but for me, it just makes my back/hip hurt more.  I keep trying, I so want to release this chronic pain I have every day.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this product. From my understanding, there&#x27;s a hollow area in the small of your lower back that rests on top of this wedgy.  The wedgy thereby lifts your lower back a little off the ground so that the muscles/joints/whatever around it sink away from your body with the force of gravity.  This essentially stretches, releases, and relaxes your back.  I think this is similar to what an inversion table does. It uses gravity to stretch you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I showed it to my chiropractor and he said he had never seen the product before but after reading the insert, he understood how it was supposed to work.  He didn&#x27;t think it would help much with my particular back issues (he recommended the Sacral Blocks like this one: [[ASIN:B000HSUV86 Core Products 930 Adult Pelvic]] but I decided to give it a try anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 5&#x27;1\\&quot;, 107 lbs. I tried the female version first.  It&#x27;s shorter and wider than the male version.  The shortness fit great but was too wide.  Not knowing how this was supposed to feel, I used it several times as instructed (for at least 20 minutes), and every time, I would get up feeling numb in the area that was against the wedgy.  My chiropractor later explained that the wedge was too wide for my frame so it was hitting my joints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I returned it for the male version.  The narrowness on this one fit but it was too long, so I had a similar problem.  So for me, neither size really fit.  It would&#x27;ve been perfect if they had an in-between with the narrowness of the male version and the shortness of the female version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer said he used a rolled up towel to achieve essentially the same thing as the wedgy is supposed to produce.  I tried that and just couldn&#x27;t get the fit right.  Fast forward a few months, I took a posture class (Gokhale Method: [[ASIN:0979303605 Steps Pain Free Back Solutions Shoulder]] and one of the tips we learned was the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - take a yoga mat and roll it up as you normally would when you store it&lt;br /&gt; - lay it vertically so it is parallel to your spine and put a pillow above (not on top) of the mat&lt;br /&gt; - start by laying down on the rolled mat with your spine directly on top (vertically) and your head on the pillow&lt;br /&gt; - slowly inch your way downward until just a little bit of your lower back is off the mat. You&#x27;ll start to feel a stretch there. Note that your head will no longer be resting on the pillow.&lt;br /&gt; - continue to move downward until you get the stretch you want in the small of your back.  Lay there for 3 minutes twice a day. After a week or so, try increasing it to 5 minutes a day.  You can move the pillow under your head once you find your perfect position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above really gives a good stretch to your back.  I&#x27;m not sure if the effect is exactly the same as what the sacro wedgy would do, but I think it&#x27;s close.</li>
