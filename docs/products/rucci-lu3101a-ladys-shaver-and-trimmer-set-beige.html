            <li>Planning to buy some more :-)</li>
            <li>Thank you, for making a product that works for me:)</li>
            <li>This item is accessible for spontaneous, camping, pool excursions, and bikini bearing SUNBATHING opportunities as they arise.</li>
            <li>Honestly this is great for on the go or lasting minute \\&quot;fix ups\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>razor shaves my legs very quickly with no need for any hassle.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product for ladies who are looking for a cheap and good quality shavers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But the main razor works surprisingly well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are beautifully looking shaver and trimmer, especially trimmer.</li>
            <li>They will look fine though.</li>
            <li>- it is fine with me</li>
            <li>The little shaver is wonderful for eyebrows, sideburns or neck hair in between haircut.</li>
            <li>It is cheap and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>These shavers fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>They get the job done, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I have already more than got my money worth out of this shaver.</li>
            <li>Best, I mean it THE BEST $5.00 I have ever spent!</li>
            <li>I love it soooo much!  </li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re getting rid of a small bit of hair this works great!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this item for quick shaving.</li>
            <li>Good enough when you&#x27;ll be seen and not touched haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Certainly more hair than I&#x27;ve ever seen removed before by shavers that cost 10x as much.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be as good of quality as it actually is.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how good these shavers are for these low price...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and works really well, a lot better than I thought it would</li>
            <li>I want to wear and quickly shave the exposed areas.</li>
            <li>the person that supplied this delivered it quick within 3 days.</li>
            <li>First off, it doesn&#x27;t hurt, scrape or tug on my skin - so I get to shave pain free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty package all around!  Cindy.</li>
            <li>Fit very well into my hands.</li>
            <li>Surprised to see a cheap hair remover... since its cheap took a rist but its worth and works as mentioned.</li>
            <li>also i liked that they gave you a smaller shaver to touch up eyebrows and bikini line.</li>
            <li>You certainly get your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>this cheapo little shaver is amazing!</li>
            <li>Not something I would say could be used for any large task (aha!)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just starting to think I could change the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great little thing to have around for those quick moments when you just don&#x27;t have time to jump in the shower or tub!</li>
            <li>We ladies always appreciate shavers that are petite, pretty, and do the job.  </li>
            <li>So for the most part, electric shavers were a PITA that I had to occasionally endure.&lt;br</li>
            <li>just ordered one for my mother last week and will purchase more of them with additional orders</li>
            <li>just ordered one for my mother last week and will purchase more of them with additional orders</li>
            <li>When I was just using a $10.00 razor, where you have to constantly pay lots more for replacing the heads of, would literally cut and irritate very painfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works more quickly and with less irritation than any electric</li>
            <li>Works very well for the price.</li>
            <li>Now, your legs won&#x27;t be smooth to the touch, it will feel like the day after you shaved the traditional way.</li>
            <li>These are the times I turn to an electric, to shear off the overgrown hair before jumping into the shower for a real shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used an electric shaver before, please note that it won&#x27;t get you really smooth legs like a regular razor and shaving cream will.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li>small and cute!</li>
            <li>If you try a large patch of hair I highly doubt it will work though.</li>
            <li>The facial trimmer is actually better quality than one I bought separately several years ago from a drug store.</li>
            <li>Both the wet/dry shaver and the thin trimmer are a good weight.  </li>
            <li>I tried new batteries and I tried flipping the cap</li>
            <li>However, there are times when I get lazy (mostly in the winter)</li>
            <li>Secondly, it gets the majority of the hair on the first pass.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re lazy like me and don&#x27;t shave every day, an electric razor is good for taking off the long hairs before shaving with a traditional razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a close, smooth shave that only takes a few minutes, as opposed to the old fashioned way.</li>
            <li>A few quick zips over</li>
            <li>The outside of yellow razor is made high quality plastic(at least it looks like high quality ...)</li>

            <li> The outside of yellow razor is made high quality plastic(at least it looks like high quality ...)</li>
            <li> But after putting brand new batteries in for the first time, the shaver lasted approximately (but not even)</li>
            <li> They both are not as noisy as I expected,I saw other reviewers mentioned the shavers are loud, but I think it is acceptable, even my electric toothbrush is louder than it.</li>
            <li> The large razor, small razor, brushes, guard and case!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The outside pink facial trimmer I believe is made of iron...</li>
            <li> and long (about 1/2\\&quot;?).  </li>
            <li> The pink trimmer has a trimming attachment for short or long trimming.</li>
            <li> It worked for about a week, I didn&#x27;t even use it every day, the power was weak despite putting NEW batteries in it,  it fell apart and couldn&#x27;t get it back together</li>
            <li> Well, I was beyond skeptical for $5, but I needed to add something to get my super saver shipping</li>
            <li> The quality is not as bad as I thought, and even much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Now I didn&#x27;t go into this expecting a close shave, I expected to get razor stubble length hair.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, but luckily it was only $5!</li>
            <li> The small pink trimmer takes 1 AAA batteries.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t use the little mini razor, so I can&#x27;t comment on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> No more shaving each leg 5 times to get it down to stubble.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first product I have used in all the years I have been trying to find one, less painful, less irritating, and affordable...</li>
            <li> You get a LOT for such a SMALL price!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought lady remingtons, conair, and panasonic in the past.</li>
            <li> This is actually unbelievable.</li>
            <li> And on the odd chance it does an even worse job than I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li> I opened and tried it yesterday, will update if notice anything negative.  </li>
            <li> And seriously, $5?  </li>
            <li> But then I figured, why should I continue to pay 30-50 bucks for a shaver that does a lousy job anyway?</li>
            <li> Might as well spend 5 bucks for a lousy shave.</li>
            <li> (I lost the charger, so it&#x27;s useless &#x27;</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they are quite noisy</li>
            <li> Additionally, the lousy razors would never cut on one pass!</li>

            <li> Works very well for the price.</li>
            <li> It is not a horrible shaver.  It is cheap and gets the job done.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for everyday use.  Good for touch up or a trim here or there.</li>
            <li> We ladies always appreciate shavers that are petite, pretty, and do the job.  These shavers fit the bill.  I even love the colors.  I&#x27;m going to buy another for my mother for Christmas.</li>
            <li> great value for the money. I would recommend this item. It&#x27;s only 5 bucks and can be used when traveling</li>
            <li> This is the perfect travel razor set. The yellow razor take 2 AA batteries. The small pink trimmer takes 1 AAA batteries. They both come with their own cleaning brush. The pink trimmer has a trimming attachment for short or long trimming. Also the travel sack that it comes with will hold ALL of the parts. You get a LOT for such a SMALL price!!!</li>
            <li> Well, I was beyond skeptical for $5, but I needed to add something to get my super saver shipping and I&#x27;d been wanting something to shave my legs and armpits with when I&#x27;m in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t use the little mini razor, so I can&#x27;t comment on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the main razor works surprisingly well.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, let&#x27;s step back and look at what you get for $5 here! The large razor, small razor, brushes, guard and case!&lt;br /&gt;The razor shaves my legs very quickly with no need for any hassle. I can throw on whatever skirt or shorts I want to wear and quickly shave the exposed areas. Now, your legs won&#x27;t be smooth to the touch, it will feel like the day after you shaved the traditional way. They will look fine though. Good enough when you&#x27;ll be seen and not touched haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for arm pits, it&#x27;s perfect. A few quick zips over and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even used it on my eh... downstairs business. And I&#x27;ll say it does a surprisingly good job there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a set of regular energizer batteries in it and I&#x27;ve shaved my legs with it about a dozen times and I&#x27;m just starting to think I could change the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great little thing to have around for those quick moments when you just don&#x27;t have time to jump in the shower or tub!</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use electric shavers often, I mostly shave with a razor in the shower. I have never gotten a close shave with an electric on my coarse Italian hair. However, there are times when I get lazy (mostly in the winter) and I let things get out of hand. These are the times I turn to an electric, to shear off the overgrown hair before jumping into the shower for a real shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a lot of electric razors, both plug in and cordless. I&#x27;ve bought lady remingtons, conair, and panasonic in the past. They all hurt. Those trimmers on the sides of the blade would just tear up my skin. Additionally, the lousy razors would never cut on one pass! I would have to go over and over the same area 3-4 times to get all the hairs, and by that time my skin was scraped to hell. So for the most part, electric shavers were a PITA that I had to occasionally endure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One fateful day the cat knocked the conair shaver off the sink and the dog got a hold of it. End of story. So I hopped on Amazon looking for a replacement. I&#x27;ll admit I was hesitant on this one based on the price. But then I figured, why should I continue to pay 30-50 bucks for a shaver that does a lousy job anyway? Might as well spend 5 bucks for a lousy shave. And on the odd chance it does an even worse job than I&#x27;m used to, I&#x27;ve only blown 5 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well this cheapo little shaver is amazing! First off, it doesn&#x27;t hurt, scrape or tug on my skin - so I get to shave pain free. Secondly, it gets the majority of the hair on the first pass. Certainly more hair than I&#x27;ve ever seen removed before by shavers that cost 10x as much. And if I do need to go back over an area a second time, that one does the trick. No more shaving each leg 5 times to get it down to stubble. Now I didn&#x27;t go into this expecting a close shave, I expected to get razor stubble length hair. And this shaver does this job perfectly. It works more quickly and with less irritation than any electric I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered one for my mother last week and will purchase more of them with additional orders so I have a back up supply.an any electric I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered one for my mother last week and will purchase more of them with additional orders so I have a back up supply.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe what an excellent deal I got on this set!  I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be as good of quality as it actually is.  Both the wet/dry shaver and the thin trimmer are a good weight.  The facial trimmer is actually better quality than one I bought separately several years ago from a drug store. The shaver works just as well as one that I paid $30 for several years ago (I lost the charger, so it&#x27;s useless &#x27;til I find it).  If you&#x27;ve never used an electric shaver before, please note that it won&#x27;t get you really smooth legs like a regular razor and shaving cream will.  If you&#x27;re lazy like me and don&#x27;t shave every day, an electric razor is good for taking off the long hairs before shaving with a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> I love it soooo much!  Both shaver and trimmer are perfect! Nice design, easy and safe  to use. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. I couldn&#x27;t believe how good these shavers are for these low price...The quality is not as bad as I thought, and even much better than I expected.The outside of yellow razor is made high quality plastic(at least it looks like high quality ...) The outside pink facial trimmer I believe is made of iron...They both are not as noisy as I expected,I saw other reviewers mentioned the shavers are loud, but I think it is acceptable, even my electric toothbrush is louder than it. I would absolutely recommend this product for ladies who are looking for a cheap and good quality shavers.</li>
            <li> I opened and tried it yesterday, will update if notice anything negative.  These are beautifully looking shaver and trimmer, especially trimmer. Fit very well into my hands. Cost under $5. They get the job done, easy to clean. Trimmer has two options: short (about 1/4\\&quot;?) and long (about 1/2\\&quot;?).  Unfortunately they are quite noisy - it is fine with me but they can not be used discreetly.</li>
            <li> the trimmer works amazing- it keeps my legs smooth with no irritated skin, the trimmer is good too (it takes 1 AAA battery not a AA battery as the manual says). i love the price and the person that supplied this delivered it quick within 3 days.</li>
            <li> For the price, everyone should have one of these I personally think. Two AA batteries are needed for the big shaver and the trimmer uses one AA but I think everyone has batteries. Honestly this is great for on the go or lasting minute \\&quot;fix ups\\&quot;. It&#x27;s quick and works really well, a lot better than I thought it would and it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li> The shaver works great, and lots of accessories in the package.  Excellent product, even better deal!  You certainly get your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used an electric shaver, but when it gave out (after 18 yrs!!) I haven&#x27;t been able to find one that even comes close to doing the job.  This shaver/trimmer set is a perfect replacement.  It&#x27;s a close, smooth shave that only takes a few minutes, as opposed to the old fashioned way. The razor, of course, is the closer shave, but sometimes you just don&#x27;t have the time.  And seriously, $5?  It&#x27;s a pretty package all around!  Cindy.</li>
            <li> It is okay would not purchase another.Does not seem to work reall well all the time.If I had paid more for it would have returned it ,</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this item for quick shaving. Not something I would say could be used for any large task (aha!) but if you&#x27;re getting rid of a small bit of hair this works great! If you try a large patch of hair I highly doubt it will work though. But try it out maybe it&#x27;ll work (idk).&lt;br /&gt;Very small and cute!</li>
            <li> I bought the shaver and trimmer because it was so cheap and got great reviews. But after putting brand new batteries in for the first time, the shaver lasted approximately (but not even) three seconds before it shut off. I tried new batteries and I tried flipping the cap and I tried flipping the batteries and I tried shaking the item, but nothing got it to work. Disappointed, but luckily it was only $5! Save yourself money and get something better.</li>
            <li> Surprised to see a cheap hair remover... since its cheap took a rist but its worth and works as mentioned. Planning to buy some more :-)</li>
            <li> This is actually unbelievable. The price I paid and what I got is great. I have had it for quite some time and it works great. The shaver works great for my legs and has a trimmer for the longer hair. The little shaver is wonderful for eyebrows, sideburns or neck hair in between haircut. It has a bag for easy carry and has been a wonderful set for me. I have already more than got my money worth out of this shaver. I could not be happier and still to this day cannot believe what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I gave these sets as Christmas gifts, and you get a lot of items for your money.  They are packaged nicely for gifts, and they are affordable.</li>
            <li> It worked for about a week, I didn&#x27;t even use it every day, the power was weak despite putting NEW batteries in it,  it fell apart and couldn&#x27;t get it back together</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis patches on my skin, on my legs. When I was just using a $10.00 razor, where you have to constantly pay lots more for replacing the heads of, would literally cut and irritate very painfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first product I have used in all the years I have been trying to find one, less painful, less irritating, and affordable...&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME! IT does everything I have needed and it doesn&#x27;t give me bumps, or hurt my skin disorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this Lady&#x27;s Shaver. Best, I mean it THE BEST $5.00 I have ever spent! It works, and its portable, fits in my purse perfectly. I have four kids, and on the go lots... This item is accessible for spontaneous, camping, pool excursions, and bikini bearing SUNBATHING opportunities as they arise. Thank you, for making a product that works for me:)</li>
            <li> it scratches when you do your under arms, but it&#x27;s good for a good cleanup job when yourin a hurry. also i liked that they gave you a smaller shaver to touch up eyebrows and bikini line. all in all a good product</li>
