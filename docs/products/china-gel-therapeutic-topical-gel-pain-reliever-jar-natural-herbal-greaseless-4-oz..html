            <li>Must massage the gel in well to get the best benefit.  </li>
            <li>It is a very great product.</li>
            <li>The best there is for muscle aches and pain.</li>

            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>I have tried many gels and this gel is the best ever..</li>
            <li>When I put some on my body, people ask me what is it that I use and that smells so good ?....</li>
            <li>If you can get it someone to give you a massage using China Gel as the \\&quot;massage oil\\&quot; that works even better!  </li>
            <li>This product heats up nicely, and appears to work well.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>BUT, A MOIST HEATING PAD DOES A BETTER JOB..</li>
            <li>Be sure to WASH your hands after using this product because it will sting if it gets in your eyes.  </li>
            <li>I hope this product helps sooth your aches and pains. :)</li>
            <li>I love the menthol-camphor smell, and so does my husband.  </li>
            <li>This is such a great product!!  </li>
            <li>I HAVE TO SAY THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME.. HELPS MY HIPS AND BACK AND REMOVES THE PAIN IN NO TIME...</li>
            <li>I like it because it is natural and helps greatly in relieving arthritic pain.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the menthol smell, but I do admit that it is quite strong.</li>
            <li>Purchased China gel for my shoulder, as I have some light pain.  </li>
            <li>It leaves an icy feeling (not the menthol smell) that lingers longer than you&#x27;d expect, which is great for prolonged relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cool sensation eases my pain.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>It has a smell, but the cool relief is worth it.</li>
            <li>I discovered this gel in my Yoga class and it is very soothing without a strong &amp;#34;medicinal&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>Rubbing it on right</li>
            <li>This is my favorite topical pain reliever!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stick like many other gels , penetrates into  the skin very quickly creating a mild cold analgesic effect and it smells so good !</li>
            <li>I HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THIS CHINA-GEL AND, WITH ALL MY ACHES AND PAINS</li>
            <li>It helps a lot and is gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>Works fast on all kinds of aches and pains.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>They almost all contain the same basic ingredients (specially menthol) but this China Gel was recommended to me by a chiropractor.</li>
            <li>I have severe injury to my ribs and back this helps so much.</li>
            <li>goes deep and give real relief to sore muscles.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, leaving no stains, and the menthol smell doesn&#x27;t last too long.  </li>
            <li>After a few minutes, I have a cool sensation across my shoulders.</li>
            <li>BUT, THE SMELL IS A LITTLE POWERFUL</li>
            <li>I must admit that, even though it&#x27;s expensive, it is an amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>Item was as described and arrived quickly but when applied to my sons back for pain it did little to nothing.</li>

            <li> Purchased China gel for my shoulder, as I have some light pain.  This product heats up nicely, and appears to work well.  It has the menthol smell, and tingles when applied.  it works okay.</li>
            <li> I HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THIS CHINA-GEL AND, WITH ALL MY ACHES AND PAINS THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE IT A TRY..WELL, IT WORKS FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND FEELS GREAT (YOU NEED TO PUT A TOWEL ON IT)..BUT, A MOIST HEATING PAD DOES A BETTER JOB..IF YOU NEED SOMETHING WHEN YOUR OUT AND ABOUT, THIS WILL LAST AS MENTIONED FOR A SHORT TERM EFFECT BUT, THE SMELL IS A LITTLE POWERFUL SO I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM WHEN GOING OUT UNLESS YOU WANT TO SMELL A LITTLE FUNKY..</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!  It relieves pain like nothing I have ever used before.  I like it because it is natural and helps greatly in relieving arthritic pain.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite topical pain reliever!  I enjoy the menthol smell, but I do admit that it is quite strong. Be sure to WASH your hands after using this product because it will sting if it gets in your eyes.  I find it works best if you thoroughly massage it into the skin. If you can get it someone to give you a massage using China Gel as the \\&quot;massage oil\\&quot; that works even better!  I hope this product helps sooth your aches and pains. :)</li>

            <li> Amazing! it helps with injuries and pain. It is a very great product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s truly a &amp;#34;top&amp;#34; product ! I suffer from a lot of back/neck/muscle pain  issues and tried several pain reliever creams/gels. They almost all contain the same basic ingredients (specially menthol) but this China Gel was recommended to me by a chiropractor. I must admit that, even though it&#x27;s expensive, it is an amazing stuff. It doesn&#x27;t stick like many other gels , penetrates into  the skin very quickly creating a mild cold analgesic effect and it smells so good ! When I put some on my body, people ask me what is it that I use and that smells so good ?....I would prefer not to have to use it but at least there are some positive things about it....</li>
            <li> I have tried many gels and this gel is the best ever.. I have severe injury to my ribs and back this helps so much.</li>
            <li> A friend I worked with turned me onto this stuff.  It absorbs quickly, leaving no stains, and the menthol smell doesn&#x27;t last too long.  I don&#x27;t mind it, and in fact I tend to only pick up on the lavender in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for sore muscles and chronic pain.  It leaves an icy feeling (not the menthol smell) that lingers longer than you&#x27;d expect, which is great for prolonged relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this to family and friends.</li>
            <li> this stuff works. goes deep and give real relief to sore muscles.</li>
            <li> I like this China Gel Therapeutic Topical Pain Reliever because it helps to ease my shoulder pain. I apply it and rub it in for a couple of minutes. After a few minutes, I have a cool sensation across my shoulders. This cool sensation eases my pain. It helps my spouse&#x27;s knee pain. Next time I am going to order a larger container.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Great product.</li>
            <li> Very effective in relieving pain or soothing symptoms!</li>
            <li> I love the menthol-camphor smell, and so does my husband.  Rubbing it on right before I go to bed helps soothe stressed muscles.</li>
            <li> Item was as described and arrived quickly but when applied to my sons back for pain it did little to nothing. Was disappointed but looking forward to the NOXICARE that I also ordered. Suppose to be a miracle lotion and that&#x27;s a quote by my sister who couldn&#x27;t even touch her ankles due to the inflammation and now can take her dogs on walks and it doesn&#x27;t hurt and lasts all day!!</li>
            <li> Family favorite for sore muscles!!  Nothing compares!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use Icy-Hot because it irritates my skin. This stuff is a miracle. It helps a lot and is gentle on skin. Don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product!!  Works fast on all kinds of aches and pains. Jar lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I HAVE TO SAY THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME.. HELPS MY HIPS AND BACK AND REMOVES THE PAIN IN NO TIME...</li>
            <li> The best there is for muscle aches and pain. Awesomeness in a jar.</li>
