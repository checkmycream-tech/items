            <li>I love the smell of this oil.</li>
            <li>This keeps the ends of my hair moisturized and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Love the ingredients.</li>

            <li>Smells good and leaves a great shine when using flat iron!</li>
            <li>My grand daughter use this on her 2 year old daughters hair, it smells great and has help the growth of her hair.</li>
            <li>I normally do not like oils/serums that have scents to them but the Tamanu serum has a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the light texture of the product.  </li>
            <li>So far everything I have purchased from this brand has been great: lotion, body wash and shampoo.</li>
            <li>Great for natural hair.</li>
            <li>Look fabulous strong &amp; growing.</li>
            <li>I have 3c/4a hair and am a HUGE fan of Nubian Heritage and Shea Moisture products and this product is no exception.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed  a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Great product keeps hair moisturized and nourished with essential oils.</li>
            <li>I wish the sister product Hemp, Tamanu &amp; Garlic extract cream were still available.</li>
            <li>Nice product, keeps my hair very moist.  </li>
            <li>The smell of this product is fantastic, as well.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Your hair is a  great improve from not being dry after color service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the results will be positive .</li>
            <li>Not bad, reminds me of almond oil.</li>
            <li>Good to use when using flat iron as a heat protection</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really too soon to tell but so far so good.</li>
            <li>This is a great oil, I use it everyday.</li>
            <li>and I love show soft and shiny it makes my hair.</li>
            <li>However I love it-makes my thick,wavy AA hair feel so soft and moisterized.</li>
            <li>However, it did leave my hair feeling soft and more tamed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Take your vitamins, eat right, drink water, investigate your hair</li>
            <li>For now i love this company we will see if they destroy that love.</li>
            <li>My hair was pretty damaged, I googled and googled came across this little gem and have been using it for a few months, just a few drops  and leaves your hair feeling great, a nice shine and smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Seems to have an instant effect on hair ,as it is softer and more manageable now.</li>
            <li>I also use the oil as a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>I &#x27;m definitely going to purchase more.</li>
            <li>I love Carol&#x27;s Daughter products usually, but this works even better: my hair is healing and growing.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really say anything about hair growth yet!</li>
            <li>actually, I&#x27;ve been using it as a skin moisturizer more than anything.</li>
            <li>My hair remains soft, non-frizzy (thanks to the garlic), and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>I am Black Creek Native American, and I have looked high and low for a perfect product for my hair - and this is a true God Send!  </li>
            <li>It makes her hair less frizzy and gives it a nice shine.</li>
            <li>product arrived on time, however, being someone who likes to conserve and not leave a print on the planet, this tiny product arrived in a huge box.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Really like it.  </li>
            <li>very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does smell kinda unusual,  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair very greasy.</li>
            <li>I love this oil...not too fond of the scent, but it kept my hair moisturized and extra soft.</li>
            <li>I hope they do not sell out to main street and change their formulas to chemicals and cheap oils to make the bigger bucks.</li>
            <li>It is really good for dry hair and dry ends !</li>
            <li>Smells really good and you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li>Nice hair serum, have used it a few times so far</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>Love it, my hair is so soft and growing slowly, will buy more In the future.</li>
            <li>i like the texture, not too heavy; i like the smell and the healthy shine that it leaves my hair with.</li>
            <li>Smells good and you only need a small amount.  </li>
            <li>The product line is a new fave.  </li>
            <li>Makes hair very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my thick hair and surprisingly it only takes a little</li>
            <li>I can read and recognize the entire ingredients list, all of which is all great for my mixed (white and black)</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>but my hair has never been so silky soft and not a touch of frizz.</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>It is really to early to tell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural to.</li>
            <li>It very light and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>My 21 year old has very long, and very curly, hair.</li>
            <li>It really held the moisture in for a long time.</li>
            <li>After I wash my hair it turn back to normal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, yet heavy enough to feel</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to be careful not to use too much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not for daily use without frequent washing.  </li>
            <li>I like that since I have better control of where my oil goes (and none on the floor like my other shea moisture oil spray [[ASIN:B0038TVH34 Shea Moisture Raw Shea Elixir-4 oz]])!&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is though fairly small for its price, but i guess its quality makes it worth it.</li>
            <li>The bottle may seem small and the price a little high but trust me it will last a long time and is worth it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product keeps hair moisturized and nourished with essential oils.</li>
            <li> My 21 year old has very long, and very curly, hair. She also colors her hair. She loves this product! It makes her hair less frizzy and gives it a nice shine. It controls the flyaways that can happen in humid weather.</li>
            <li> Worked great in my daughters hair. It really held the moisture in for a long time. I&#x27;ll be buying another soon.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Smells great, light weight, and it works well with water and a leave in or just water alone.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My hair was pretty damaged, I googled and googled came across this little gem and have been using it for a few months, just a few drops  and leaves your hair feeling great, a nice shine and smells AMAZING! The bottle may seem small and the price a little high but trust me it will last a long time and is worth it!</li>
            <li> Instantly repaired my over processed Caucasian hair! I don&#x27;t know yet about the growth aspect but my hair has never been so silky soft and not a touch of frizz. I recommend using only the dime sized amount or the hair looks a bit oily .</li>
            <li> Reduces hair loss marginally. Nothing else.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Arrived on time. Not sure how well it works. Will update review in a month or so</li>
            <li> Packaging was very good.  Delivery on time.  Product smells great, I put it on my hair every other day to give it shine and softness.  Does it help with hair growth, don&#x27;t know, I just received the product.  I like it so far. Expiration date was good for 9/2016</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the light texture of the product.  The product line is a new fave.  I&#x27;m also currently using the black soap with oatmeal, aloe, and vitamin e.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really too soon to tell but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Not bad, reminds me of almond oil.</li>
            <li> Nice texture great product!</li>
            <li> Love it, my hair is so soft and growing slowly, will buy more In the future. thanks</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t complain at all, it smells good and does its job. My hair feel so much better and i think i can see them growing a little bit faster haha.</li>
            <li> I love every product i have tried by Nubian Heritage. I have tried their lotions, hand creams, shampoo, body butters, and now the Serum. This product grew my hair 2 inches in 6 weeks. I hope Nubian Heritage stick to the formulas that have made me fall in love with them. I hope they do not sell out to main street and change their formulas to chemicals and cheap oils to make the bigger bucks. Principle before profit. For now i love this company we will see if they destroy that love.</li>
            <li> I normally do not like oils/serums that have scents to them but the Tamanu serum has a wonderful scent. I just love it. It very light and a little goes a long way. I  received the serum faster than expected. I am pleased with the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> very good product,my hair grow up like crazy,thank you</li>
            <li> My grand daughter use this on her 2 year old daughters hair, it smells great and has help the growth of her hair.</li>
            <li> Greasy for no reason. I would not recommend to anyone. Sorry but its the truth.</li>
            <li> Stop hair loss slowly, but it works</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair &amp; have used this product minimally. I&#x27;m not sure how well it works, because it makes my hair look so greasy. I&#x27;ve tried to be careful not to use too much but it still looks greasy.</li>
            <li> very very very bad i cant believe that when read the review teel to my mind this is prefect but i put it in garbage like the food&#x27;s oil :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 3 years. I went from a&lt;br /&gt;Classic cap of teeny curls to hair that reaches the bottom of my&lt;br /&gt;shoulder blades. Take your vitamins, eat right, drink water, investigate your hair&lt;br /&gt;products. I can not reccommend this serum enough. It feels so soothing when I spray it&lt;br /&gt;on to my scalp after braiding my hair. Prevents dandruff. I also use it as an end sealant&lt;br /&gt;and spritz a lil bit on when I blow dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product. I wish the sister product Hemp, Tamanu &amp; Garlic extract cream were still available.</li>
            <li> Works amazing. I use with the Nubian taffy which I apply the night before then this after and my curls are perfect; silky, defined, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> one of the very few products that actually work for my natural hair. i like the texture, not too heavy; i like the smell and the healthy shine that it leaves my hair with. my curls are better defined and my hair has indeed become stronger and healthier. it is though fairly small for its price, but i guess its quality makes it worth it. i recommend it hundred percent.</li>
            <li> Packaging needs to be better.There was some leakage when I received it.Seems to have an instant effect on hair ,as it is softer and more manageable now.</li>
            <li> Nice product, keeps my hair very moist.  Product was shipped in a timely manner.  I also use the oil as a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  You only need a tiny amount.  Makes hair look shiny.  So far everything I have purchased from this brand has been great: lotion, body wash and shampoo.</li>
            <li> Good product.  It has helped me grow some back on my receding edges but its too heave for all over use.</li>
            <li> When I received product, most had spilled in box. I was quite upset and sent them an email. They responded to my email in less than 24 hrs and shipped me another one. It is one of the best smelling product I put in my hair. I love the consistency. It&#x27;s perfect for my thick hair and surprisingly it only takes a little and I have a lot of hair. I highly recommend and will purchase again. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Really like it.  Smells good and you only need a small amount.  It&#x27;s not for daily use without frequent washing.  I use it after washing my hair and before styling.  Makes hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Perfect light oil and great smell.</li>
            <li> I like this oil very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;works wonder on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once it is done I will buy another one</li>
            <li> Firstly, this smells amazing! I think it is a unisex smell. I can read and recognize the entire ingredients list, all of which is all great for my mixed (white and black) curly, frizzy, hair. I thought this was a spray, but the cap is like those on shampoos... it pours out. I like that since I have better control of where my oil goes (and none on the floor like my other shea moisture oil spray [[ASIN:B0038TVH34 Shea Moisture Raw Shea Elixir-4 oz]])!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t found a place that is convenient for me that sells this, so I was happy to see this product for sell on amazon. I am a product minimalist, and love that if I wanted to I can use this as an after shower oil as well! This is definitely going to stay as a staple for me and my house!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but won&#x27;t purchase again...</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this oil. It&#x27;s light, yet heavy enough to feel like it&#x27;s moisturizing my dreadlocks. I also use it on my scalp a couple of times per week without buildup or greasiness. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> While not necessarily touted as such, my son uses this as a daily moisturizer for his hair. He loves the smell and his hair looks great</li>
            <li> smells great, don&#x27;t know if it grows my hair yet but I am hopeful.</li>
            <li> Great for natural hair. I initially used it once a month. My hair follicles would feel puffy. After 2 months of usage, I started using it every 2 weeks. Wow! My hair is thicker but not longer. I have recommended this product to several people.</li>
            <li> Havent used it long enough to determine if it works</li>
            <li> This is a great oil, I use it everyday. It does smell kinda unusual,  but my hair loves this. I &#x27;m definitely going to purchase more.</li>
            <li> Nice hair serum, have used it a few times so far</li>
            <li> It is really to early to tell. However, using the product makes my hair healthier.  I have a little less shedding. Yes, I would purchase this product again</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very greasy.</li>
            <li> Great oil for my hair just started to use it don&#x27;t know if it will make my hair grow but it gives my hair a great shine</li>
            <li> Pros - lightweight oil that smells divine&lt;br /&gt;Cons - made me breakout on my neck and I didn&#x27;t find it to be the best sealant/moisturizer for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would repurchase based on the cons however lots of other people didn&#x27;t get bad reactions to this product like I did.</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse and thick and damaged. It&#x27;s short because I abused it, and I want it long again. I love Carol&#x27;s Daughter products usually, but this works even better: my hair is healing and growing. The smell of this product is fantastic, as well. Five stars.</li>
            <li> Smells really good and you only need a little bit. Not sure if it&#x27;s making my hair grow yet because it&#x27;s only been a few days but if all of the ingredients are in it like it says they are then I&#x27;m sure the results will be positive . I am looking to check back in a few months with growth updates .... It is really good for dry hair and dry ends !</li>
            <li> I have 3c/4a hair and am a HUGE fan of Nubian Heritage and Shea Moisture products and this product is no exception.  This keeps the ends of my hair moisturized and healthy.  It&#x27;s also great for providing slip when I am opening my twists for a twist-out.</li>
            <li> this is a nice combo is oils. But I would not order again.Just because I can make my own. Its still ok to buy if you not into making your own hair products. Just wanted to try because I like this brand.Good to use when using flat iron as a heat protection</li>
            <li> I just bought it and started using it. I like it.</li>
            <li> This is doing wonders for my hair...</li>
            <li> It smells really good! I recommend to use a small amount because too much makes your hair look greasy! I just started using this so I can&#x27;t really say anything about hair growth yet!</li>
            <li> Time will tell if it helps with hair growth...we will see...</li>
            <li> The reason why I give this product two stars is because I had a bad reaction from using it. My face and neck had broke out with little bumps And on top of that my hair itch very badly. After I wash my hair it turn back to normal. I can&#x27;t say that the product isn&#x27;t good. But it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I will be reordering this.  I add a bit to my Nubian Keritan protect spray to make it perfect for styling.  If I am going natural, then I just rub a few drops on my palms and through my hair. I have used it for a month now and noticed a lot less hair in the shower drain and less hair on the floor. I had a lot of hair shedding (probably stress). I have noticed  a huge difference.  I have also used it on my dry cuticles, hands, and on the scaly dry patches on my knees. It softens everything. Love the ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and I love show soft and shiny it makes my hair. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Was using some African root grow. Compare to this, less oily not heavy gumming my hair together. Very smooth as apply it to my hair not my scalp. I have mark the date on my Indian hemp bottle,  so I can judge how rapidly my hair is growing. My stylist told me today what ever your using @ home keep using it.  Your hair is a  great improve from not being dry after color service. I have permanent color &amp; highlights too for over  50yrs Hair is . Look fabulous strong &amp; growing. I&#x27;m natural to.</li>
            <li> Product received in good condition. Well packaged.  Product is a great item.  Used it before.  Would recommend to others to try.</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves a great shine when using flat iron! It does have a bit of greasy consistency. However I love it-makes my thick,wavy AA hair feel so soft and moisterized. Really great product for my hair!</li>
            <li> The product  beats all African American products that I have used on my hair that truly do not work (which are all of them).  I am Black Creek Native American, and I have looked high and low for a perfect product for my hair - and this is a true God Send!  Indian Hemp products are all that I use on my hair for now on!  My hair remains soft, non-frizzy (thanks to the garlic), and easy to manage.  Even removes tangles...and there is no longer any need to use \\&quot;Mixed-Chics leave in conditioner after my shampoo (which I only use conditioner, as shampoo strips your hair!).  This beats Mixed Chics!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived on time, however, being someone who likes to conserve and not leave a print on the planet, this tiny product arrived in a huge box.  Not Kewel! (cool..with emphasis).</li>
            <li> I love this oil...not too fond of the scent, but it kept my hair moisturized and extra soft.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair growth. However, it did leave my hair feeling soft and more tamed.&lt;br /&gt;I focused on my roots, massaging it in. After, I brushed my hair with a paddle brush. The oil tamed my rather frizzy hair and left it soft.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is like that of Nair. It does lightens a bit after a few hours but this could be off putting for some.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It smells heavenly...actually, I&#x27;ve been using it as a skin moisturizer more than anything. Because I have oily/thin hair to begin with, I try not to add more oil. I do massage this into my scalp the night before I plan on washing my hair, that way I get an overnight hair mask. I have to say that my hair (and skin!) seems softer, though I can&#x27;t speak for the thickening/growth yet.</li>
