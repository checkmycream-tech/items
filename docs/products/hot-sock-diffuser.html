            <li>Ihad to put a rubber band around this, otherwise it just flies off my blow dryer, otherwise it works great</li>

            <li>As the title of this review states, it&#x27;s good for travel</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes we think everything good has to be  high-tech.</li>
            <li>This is a good quality low-tech device.</li>
            <li>(Yes, I do have those others, and from time-to-time I do give them a try, but they just aren&#x27;t as good as this one)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just delighted with this product.  </li>
            <li>Its good for travel as it is weightless.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>I got this to try out to see if it would be good to travel with.</li>
            <li>fit on it perfectly.  </li>
            <li>For the price..its all good.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>, that is kind of in between a great wave and a true curl, but this diffuser worked awesome on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Super portable, lasts for ages, and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a reason this has so many great reviews.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love the price and how well it works!</li>

            <li>Easy to use and great for traveling.</li>
            <li>Easy to store and great for travel.  </li>
            <li>Fits any hair dryer, easy to store or travel with, and works great.  </li>
            <li>This diffuser works great and is so easy to pack for travel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;(This is a good place to note that the shipping was quick and my product came in great</li>
            <li>And it fits nicely on travel-sized hair dryers, like the ones attached to the wall at chain hotels.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own diffuser.</li>
            <li>Works like it said it would and handy when traveling.</li>
            <li>Liked it because it worked as well as her own drier.</li>
            <li>Had to return it, it kept catching my hair.  </li>
            <li>I liked that this didn&#x27;t require any cupping or anything.</li>
            <li>I am a curly hair girl that always has to travel with her own hairdryer and diffuser.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for traveling because it takes up virtually no space in my bag--unlike my normal diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Super happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It works really good &amp; easy to travel with</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have a slightly more elastic opening.</li>
            <li>I actually liked my hair during my latest trip.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit all blow dryers and sometimes I hold it on while drying, but someone used a rubber band which sounds like a good idea.</li>
            <li>Great price and wonderful little gadget.  </li>
            <li>So worth the money and a cheap good product that does the job!</li>
            <li>Unlike most curl hair my hair strands are very fine even though I have TONS of hair.</li>
            <li>I love that I can easily travel with it!</li>
            <li>Good quality - heavier foam than other brands so diffuses heat better; perfect for travel; depending on hair dryer may or may not stay on nozzle without holding on to it.</li>
            <li>Comes in handy when traveling - easy to pack.</li>
            <li>This hot sock was the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made, it slips right on to any hair dryer and works like magic.</li>
            <li>Not only does this one work the best</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I like this so much better than the plastic diffusers.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this product for so cheap!</li>
            <li>Who knew that a hair dryer diffuser could be so light and portable and still so effective?  </li>
            <li>It finally ripped but I ordered a replacement as is the best \\&quot;soft\\&quot; diffuser that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I use a diffuser to help create more curl, and was looking for something lightweight to take when I travel.  </li>
            <li>Ordered to replace the one I&#x27;ve already had for many years.</li>
            <li>Love that it is so portable and storable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also crushable, so I can pack it in my suitcase along with my hair blower without using up more space.  </li>
            <li>Sure, Fashion Ave. says straight is in, but I like my curls and this diffuser keeps them plump and happy.  </li>
            <li>By orally smooth hair!</li>
            <li>works much better for curly hair than the &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; diffuser.</li>
            <li>Love that it works with any size hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I think this might work better than my diffuser.</li>
            <li>Works better that by bell diffuser and travels well also.</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>this is the simplest yet best tool I use on a daily basis in the salon!</li>
            <li>And I make sure every curly haired client that leaves has one.</li>
            <li>I have had a perm since 1991 and have tried many diffuser&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I love this one, it</li>
            <li>There are better diffusers on the market which you don&#x27;t have to be touching your hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad if this works for you, but it doesn&#x27;t help my curls at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for many years now and</li>
            <li>Its very portable too which is great since I bring it with me on vacations.</li>
            <li>So glad Amazon carries these, and hope they will always do so.  </li>
            <li>What more could you ask for:)</li>
            <li>I get better curls from this product.</li>
            <li>This diffuser is simple and excellent.</li>
            <li>Love mine.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be amazed :)</li>
            <li>Works great and is very compact and portable.</li>
            <li>Great..dryer is better then ever now..</li>
            <li>Best used for traveling and not wanting to bring a big diffuser.</li>
            <li>Even though most places where you stay already have a hairdryer, I&#x27;d still need to bring my own since not all hair dryers are designed to fit a diffuser attachment.</li>
            <li>Kudos to whoever came up with this idea!! :-)</li>
            <li>I would love to rate the item on it&#x27;s quality</li>
            <li>and It works OK.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, it works and fits any blow dryer!</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>works better than some plastic ones i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments on my hair -</li>
            <li>Tried it out twice before I went on vacation and the foam material stuck to my hair and pulled out most of the curls while drying.  </li>
            <li>Works really well and great for travel.</li>
            <li>Better than those bulky diffusers</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>It does give a more concentrated diffuse if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>So much better than plastic bulky diffusers</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>It works okay.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it diffuses the heat/air better than the plastic ones.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful soft waves that weren&#x27;t crunchy!</li>
            <li>I was super pleased with the result!  </li>
            <li>It is easy to travel with and works better than the plastic attachments that cost so much more.  </li>
            <li>Used it on vacation and was pleased that it could be used on all the hotel hair dryers, and so easy to pack.</li>
            <li>Very good for diffusing different size dryers.</li>
            <li>So I ordered this one, and was super pleased with the price and quick shipment!!  </li>
            <li>I can see it being easy to travel with (my original intent) and now I use it almost every day!</li>
            <li>It works great for drying your hair &amp; keeping you natural curls.</li>
            <li>, I get better results, and it dries my hair more quickly.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of warm air to allow curls to curl and no weight added at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and lightweight to pack for trips.</li>
            <li>Shipped very quickly too.</li>
            <li>I go to the gym every day, and was looking for an easy to carry diffuser.</li>
            <li>Stores easily in my bathroom and is not bulky.  </li>
            <li>Easy to slide on and off hairdryer.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair that frizzes easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also so easy to pack and take on trips - it takes up virtually almost no space at all.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use on all dryers</li>
            <li>Product shipped quickly and seems to work just fine!  </li>
            <li>The Hot Sock Diffuser is an effective low-cost styling aid to pack in carry-on luggage.</li>
            <li>It works beautifully and when I travel I can pop it into my luggage and use it with the drier in the hotel room because it&#x27;s universal.</li>
            <li>Works well and gives body to my fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>Work fine on my hairdryer, which didn&#x27;t come with</li>
            <li>and it still works just fine when you need it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>Light weight, easy to store and pack.</li>
            <li>The Hot Sock works perfectly and I will never go back to plastic again!  </li>
            <li>I love my hot sock!  </li>
            <li>This little hair-sock is so awesome.</li>
            <li>Perfect little diffuser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve have naturally curly hair for over 15 years and this diffuser works the best to keep my curls natural and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>A huge help and way easier than packing a bulky diffuser.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would work well so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to pack my huge plastic diffuser when traveling</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s great for travel as it weighs next to nothing.</li>
            <li>It packs well, and it fit on every dryer I used.</li>
            <li>Because it is a sock, it will fit any dryer.</li>
            <li>Have never used another diffuser, but because of the oval shape of my hair dryer, nothing else fit.  </li>
            <li>I bought a second one and am just as happy with this one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cheap though...</li>
            <li>It is so light that it flies off the hair dryer even at the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li>well, it doesn&#x27;t fit every dryer...</li>
            <li>so it would fit.</li>
            <li>Wish there was a way to secure it on to any size nozzle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely cheap</li>
            <li>and it was cheap.</li>
            <li>It will fit over any hairdryer nozzle.</li>
            <li>seems cheap and will not stay on the hairdryer</li>
            <li>It not only works great</li>
            <li>This product made my hair have lots of volume and really enhanced the waves nicely that lasted all day.</li>
            <li>This is a great idea as traditional diffusers are so bulky.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t find one to fit.</li>
            <li>So I wouldn&#x27;t use this on a daily basis, but it&#x27;s great when you need to rely on borrowed/hotel hair dryers and need a diffuser.</li>
            <li>I use this occasionally and it works great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap and light weight.</li>
            <li>This fun sock fits on most of the hotel hairdryers</li>
            <li>Light.</li>
            <li>Being able to travel with it is just an added bonus and would be worth the money all in itself.  </li>
            <li>I thought this might be a good choice for my naturally curly hair; plus I did not want to shell out the $$ for the Deva diffuser.</li>
            <li>The Hot Sock works like a charm and is easy to travel with!</li>
            <li>because they&#x27;re easy to use, they fit on any blow dryer, and they leave my hair looking wavy and full.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very economical option as well.</li>
            <li>This works much better than the large plastic diffuser attachments!</li>
            <li>well worth the (inexpensive) price!  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li>The original one lasted me 4 years.  </li>
            <li>It is easier to use than a diffuser because you can kind of stick it anywhere in your hair, and the air is at the same time more targeted and diffused.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as nice as the large plastic diffusers that have the little &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; on them, so I wouldn&#x27;t use this at home, but it&#x27;s great for gym bags or space-limited</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very portable and it&#x27;s better than nothing, but that&#x27;s it...</li>
            <li>and she used the sock and loved it, no extra frizz!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t, IMO, as good as a regular diffuser</li>
            <li>That is the only good thing I can say.</li>
            <li>had one before and needed a new one great for home or travel to keep curly hair away from direct heat.</li>
            <li>She can dry her own hair now :)</li>
            <li>The Hot Sock diffuser has a strong chemical smell that didn&#x27;t go away after washing it.  </li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job of allowing heat without significant air pressure to gently dry curly or fine hair without burning or flattening it.  </li>
            <li>It works great, just as good as an expensive diffuser.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair quickly and keeps it from frizzing.  </li>
            <li>I have wavy hair and to make it super curly</li>
            <li>product arrived quickly and met my expectations.</li>
            <li>The Hot Sock fit the bill, I was told by one of the stylists at the salon,\\&quot;You will never keep your curl out in Palm Springs\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I like normal diffusers better.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight, fits on all blow dryers, and does exactly what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>And using it with very hot air made me question what sort of plastic chemicals I was heating up and inhaling.</li>
            <li>The only (very slight) issue is that the sock easily comes off of the dryer; I just put a hair elastic around it to secure it and it stays in place perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love mine and can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>This saved me from buying a new blow dryer and it works better than a plastic defuser.</li>
            <li>Ready to slip onto end of blow dryerslips on easily.</li>
            <li>I own an old Revlon hair dryer and the hot sock</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s priced well, I can use it easily on any drier when I travel and don&#x27;t need to bring my whole hair drier with me</li>
            <li>It does tear easily so treat it gently.</li>
            <li>This hot sock  is Inexpensive, portable, light-weight, fits all hairdryers and still does the job!</li>
            <li>I wish I would of thought of this bogus product first!</li>
            <li>I tried it last night and am in LOVE!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t change my process, just got the hot sock!</li>
            <li>This makes my hair less curly and more frizzy!!</li>
            <li>Great little item.  </li>
            <li>This is great little diffuser that works well.  </li>
            <li>The clunky plastic diffuser that came with my dryer seemed to blow more air than it should, making my hair extra frizzy and not giving me the curls I wanted, so I thought I&#x27;d try this cheap alternative.  </li>
            <li>it was worth a try...</li>
            <li>I chose this because after reading reviews it seemed the most likely to fit any hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It was not a snug fit on my blow dryer even though my blow dryer just has a standard barrel like most blow dryers do.  </li>
            <li>She is thrilled to have finally found one,</li>
            <li>I purchased this because most &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; diffusers aren&#x27;t since my dryer is not round.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite diffuser.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work better, but it works on any dryer, is super easy to store and travels really well.</li>
            <li>It leaves my fine curly hair soft and full.  </li>
            <li>Because of the elastic opening on the Hot Sock, I&#x27;m sure it would fit on any blower--now THAT IS universal!  </li>
            <li>Not only does the &#x27;hot sock&#x27; not stay on my dryer but most importantly it makes my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li>&quot; That&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li>Flew right off my hairdryer</li>
            <li>Lets just the right amount of air through.  </li>
            <li>The Hot Sock has elastic at the end and really does seem like it would fit any hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This item is exactly what I need for travel, it is very compact and light in weight and functions well with all hair dryers.</li>
            <li>What a great little invention!  </li>
            <li>This squishes down to nothing in my toiletry bag and works wonderfully on the standard dryers there.  </li>
            <li>It might not be as good as my large plastic one, but it&#x27;s cheap and won&#x27;t take up half my suitcase!</li>
            <li>I came upon the Hot Sock, read the reviews and thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>I got it for a recent trip, &amp; fortunately, my hotel had a good hair dryer with a regular diffuser.</li>
            <li>You can purchase other name brands but nothing works as good as this Hot Sock.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much I stopped using my old diffuser and use this instead.</li>
            <li>Instead of the big round plastic diffuser, this is awesome.</li>
            <li>After a recent hole in my old Hot Sock, I am so happy to see I can purchase a new one.</li>
            <li>Simple to use, easy to store and drys the hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>I like the Hot Sock very much.  </li>
            <li>This hot sock did not do what I wanted it to.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go!</li>
            <li>With this hot sock thing, you can&#x27;t rest your hair on it, because there&#x27;s no saucer-like surface with grips to hold your hair on it.  </li>
            <li>The Hot Sock does the trick.  </li>
            <li>My first \\&quot;Hot Sock\\&quot; lasted 2 years using it every day.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much, it has replaced the old one completely.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for continuing to make/offer this product!</li>
            <li>the &#x27;hot sock&#x27; kept falling off of the dryer</li>
            <li>Wish more actual air would come out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used my Hot Sock now for over 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had one of these for more than 15 years and finally tore a hole in it.</li>
            <li>I also think it may affect the ionic tourmaline settings for my hairdryer, because my hair is frizzy after using the hot sock.</li>
            <li>I have tried to use this several times and the smell is more than I can handle.</li>
            <li>I put it on my blow dryer and the first thing it did when I turned my dryer on was blow off.  </li>
            <li>I used this as specified on the package and the Hot Sock</li>
            <li>May hair was very frizzy!</li>
            <li>I was able to recreate my curls with this sock just as I would with a regular diffuser.</li>
            <li>At first, I was concerned that this could be a fire hazard.</li>
            <li>first,</li>
            <li>I bought the Hot Sock  to use when I travel.  </li>
            <li>In the past, I would always have to pack my own hairdryer with my huge diffuser attachment.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and buy a REAL diffuser!</li>
            <li>This diffuser did not help do that; my big (hard-to-travel-with) plastic one works much better.</li>
            <li>Ideal for travel as it fit at least 4 different style hairdryers I encountered.  </li>
            <li>the Hot Sock DID succeed in MELTING MY HAIRDRYER.</li>
            <li>(Thankfully I tried it on my ancient dryer first.)</li>
            <li>Been using hot sock for years</li>
            <li>Hot Sock Diffuser does not stay on hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Just at first glance, this product is sketchy, how could a piece of foam do anything for my hair?</li>
            <li>The hot sock diffuse does exactly what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li>Works so much better than any regular defuser .</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells the first week or two that you use it.  </li>
            <li>I like these sock type diffusers much better than big clunky plastic diffusers,</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it gave off a plastic smell, after that it works but nothing like a diffuser.. takes a lot</li>
            <li>it does fit any hair dryer I&#x27;ve encountered so far.</li>
            <li>I would think if you have lots and lots of hair and you use this hot sock, it might take a while.</li>
            <li>it just turns into frizz) and the hot sock always helps keep in the curl and keep out the frizz.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say that it worked exactly the same, but it was a much better alternative than no diffuser at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hot sock will not even stay on my hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this hot sock for about a year now.  </li>
            <li>so I just leave it in my suitcase and it makes my life sooo much easier!  </li>
            <li>It gives off a funny smell when I use it.</li>
            <li>So I got a safety pin and gathered it up and that made it a little snugger and was able to fit and stay on my barrel.  </li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
            <li>I love that it is very light, especially since it can take up to 20 minutes to dry my hair!</li>
            <li>Works perfect with my small hair dryer and long, curly &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li>My favorite diffuser by far for my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Less frizz, more curl, lightweight, inexpensive -- no complaints!  </li>
            <li>This gives me really nice curls all over without the frizzy hot mess it could be.</li>
            <li>This could use a tighter elastic or something less &#x27;smooth&#x27; on the end because it slips off my hair dryer too easily ... but it works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very decent diffuser</li>
            <li>Takes more time to dry hair at the gym.</li>
            <li>With curly hair the diffuser is supposed to dry it without a lot of touching which breaks the curl.  </li>
            <li>Overall will be fine for lighter packing and that was what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li>I bought the Hot Sock Diffuser to use with an older dryer and realized I could use it on all of my dryers.  </li>
            <li>When I turned my drier on high, the sock got so hot</li>
            <li>I have VERY THICK AND CURLY hair and this diffuser does a great job.</li>
            <li>I had purchased a universal (ha!) &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; collapsible diffuser for traveling, but found it didn&#x27;t fit onto either of my 2 blow-dryers.</li>
            <li>I have very \\&quot;wavy\\&quot; hair</li>
            <li>Others either don&#x27;t fit the dryer well or tend to fall apart in a short period of time.  </li>
            <li>I will absolutely travel with it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to pay as much attention</li>
            <li>Used it on a client and didn&#x27;t seem to do a whole lot, or stay on the dryer very well.</li>
            <li>Thought this product would really help with frizziness after drying hair, but I didn&#x27;t see a difference at all.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t feel much air movement coming out of it.</li>
            <li>I have a giant pronged plastic diffuser for my regular hair dryer, and I think I actually like this one better... :)</li>
            <li>Save up for a real diffuser.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>It delivers a gentle flow of air so as not to frizz my curls.</li>
            <li>This diffuser is what I was looking for but doesn&#x27;t stay on very well.  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for curly hair!  </li>
            <li>really?</li>
            <li>Plus, it is SO much easier to pack on the go without the bulky diffuser.</li>
            <li>Made my hair very frizzy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much to eliminate frizz in my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t worsen it either like a couple of people have mentioned.  </li>
            <li>OK, not a very practical item.</li>
            <li>Convenient too ,but if you will need a diffuser every day I suggest getting a real one.</li>
            <li>works really well.</li>
            <li>and it seems to work as well on my curly hair as the bigger traditional kind.</li>
            <li>I carry enough with me to the gym that I can&#x27;t take my own blow dryer and diffuser, especially since they have dyers at the gym.  </li>
            <li>And when the plastic attachment breaks or gets lost, you&#x27;re pretty much looking at buying an entirely new hair dryer just to get the attachment.</li>
            <li>I thought it was the new Hot Sock fabric.</li>
            <li>This one star review is for the total misrepresentation in the original product description that says \\&quot;PACK OF 2.\\</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this for traveling, as I didn&#x27;t want to use the luggage space to pack my giant plastic diffuser.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s top small of a surface area to hold enough hair on top of the dryer to curl it.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it for travel because it is small and easy to cram into my suitcase.</li>
            <li>it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great concept - the &amp;#34;sock&amp;#34; portion is a thick kind of mesh-like substance and it keeps the heat and lets only a little of the air through, so I scrunch my curls while using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The diffuser itself is feather light, and I was somewhat skeptical of it staying on my hair dryer, but I was impressed with not only the quality of the elastic seal but that it actually works in dispersing the air.</li>
            <li>so I figured I would purchase this as a universal diffuser that would fit my new hair blow dryer.</li>
            <li>The hot sock arrived very quickly and has helped make my hair less frizzy.</li>
            <li>However, since hotels don&#x27;t have diffusers available,  if you need to dry your hair in a hurry it will do.</li>
            <li>It fit perfectly on my old Conair Quiet Tone dryer and</li>
            <li>Was looking for a diffuser light enough for my 10 yr old to hold up with her hair dryer...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Although it slips off the barrel  if used on high.</li>
            <li>works great and is not bulky and heavy like other diffusers.</li>
            <li>Helped transform my waves into soft curls without the frizz!!  </li>
            <li>That hasn&#x27;t affected its performance (yet), and for the price I paid, I really shouldn&#x27;t be surprised...</li>
            <li>I have intense naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the heavy plastic diffusers but this one works just as well, maybe better.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it though, especially for travel.</li>
            <li>Pretty much no noticeable different in air flow with or without this on my blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>Tried it on 2 different hair dryers and once they turn on, it blows right off.</li>
            <li>I bought this for travel purposes b/c it weights virtually nothing and can be flattened with no problem - pops right back into shape.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it would hold up under that kind of regular use, but for what I needed, I was really surprised at how such a simple design @</li>
            <li>The reason I purchased this item was because I bought a new hair dryer that didn&#x27;t come with an attachment for a diffuser</li>
            <li>Once my blow dryer needs repair, I will purchase a new one with a diffuser attachment and use this one for travel.</li>
            <li>With a short barrel dryer you may have to hold the diffuser on with a finger, but it wasn&#x27;t too hard to do this, and the air flow was good.</li>
            <li>This product is cheap and sucks and not even worth $1.</li>
            <li>It came in pretty quick but was not worth it!</li>
            <li>My hair dryer is small with a short, oval-shaped barrel, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could find a diffuser to fit it.(In reviews of other diffusers that claimed to fit any dryer, people often complained that they didn&#x27;t fit their dryers.)</li>
            <li>Be advised, only one Hot Sock comes in the order.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Hot Sock diffuser for my recent trip to the UK and Ireland.</li>
            <li>I use my hair blow dryer on Low with the &#x27;hot sock&#x27; to diffuse my curly hair but</li>
            <li>Do not expect to get the same performance out of this hot sock as you would a diffuser.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it at first, then I gave it a second chance...</li>
            <li>My hair is past my shoulders and now I am going to have to cut about an inch or more to get rid of the damage.</li>
            <li>This is the second one I have used, the first lasted for around 8 years.</li>
            <li>Years and years ago, my Mom found a Hot Sock Diffuser at a local store and I&#x27;ve used them ever since.  </li>
            <li>It gives the exact same effect on my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I gave this hot sock 5 stars for several reasons.  </li>
            <li>so I also have a perm which has left my hair pretty curly.  </li>
            <li>Actually does work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this as my last diffuser (which I bought at Wal-Mart for 1.99 several years ago), finally developed a hole in it and had to be replaced.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many Hot Socks but this one seemed to be poorly constructed.  </li>
            <li>It does leave my hair a little straighter and flatter than I&#x27;d prefer, but it&#x27;s better than using a hair dryer without a diffuser at all, for someone like me with coarse and wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>If you use a difuser, this is so much better than the bulky hard plastic ones.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the same nice airflow that my hard plastic one has so it takes longer.</li>
            <li>(I hadn&#x27;t noticed how much effort I was taking to keep the big one from falling off while drying my hair!)</li>
            <li>I really prefer the regular diffuser where you hair lays into it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>(well, I CAN, but my hair ends up all frizzy instead of having soft curls if i don&#x27;t use</li>
            <li>but my hair drier is old</li>
            <li>My daughter has been looking for a diffuser that would fit on her blow dryer for a few years.</li>
            <li>Works well but does slip off frequently.  </li>
            <li>I have natural curl</li>
            <li>So much easier than regular diffuser.</li>
            <li>This thing works OK as a diffuser my thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Now, I only need to scrunch up my little sock in my garment bag! :-)  </li>
            <li>Works really well for stretching out natural hair while blow drying when using the tension method which is what I mainly use it for and it  can works well diffusing wash and go hair styles, it does not scatter your curly do all over, but this is not a method I use much but for women who wear wash and go frequently I would quicker suggest the plastic diffuser that usually comes with some dryers</li>
            <li>I appreciate how much it lightens up the weight of my hairdryer, too, as I have a bit of arthritis in my arms and hands and it helps not to have to strain so much to hold it, as I did with the old plastic one that weighed down the end of the dryer.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted about 4 years and multiple vacations before it finally died.  </li>
            <li>These last about 2 years with daily use before they start to get funny</li>
            <li>I am travelling in September and wanted to just bring a small, light diffuser for my naturally curly hair to use on the dryer at the hotel.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier to maneuver than the old one, especially when drying the back of my hair.  </li>
            <li>so cheap, small, convenient.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is the mouth was so tight it would hardly fit over the hotel hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>, it fits any dryer (I do secure it with a tight hair band on dryers with smaller and/or stubby nozzles), and packs in a bag without taking up any space.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>However, this diffuser does allow me to dry my hair on a faster speed without producing too much fuzzing.  </li>
            <li>so much it wouldn&#x27;t dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>Helps dry my curly hair fast without a lot of fizz.</li>
            <li>It dries my curls too fast it makes my hair feel dry.</li>
            <li>Small, easy to navigate, unlike the big plastic orb with nozzles sticking out of the air holes.</li>
            <li>Because it is a soft diffuser, you can roll it, scrunch it up, flatten it, and cram it in just about any tiny spot in your luggage</li>
            <li>Went back to my old diffuser.</li>
            <li>This little \\&quot;Sock\\&quot; fits right over my blow dryer and sends out all the heat</li>
            <li>(Most of you with long curly hair should know what I mean.)  </li>
            <li>When I use the dryer without the diffuser, my hair becomes straight in spots and fuzzy in other places.  </li>
            <li>only fault is that it doesn&#x27;t have the prongs on a conventional diffuser, but with a little more effort and scrunching the hair with your fingers you can achieve the same result</li>
            <li>When I use my hair dryer without the diffuser, it gets tangled because I just blast it and run the dryer back and forth to get it dry as fast as possible.  </li>
            <li>Truthfully, this is sort of a useless product, on a professional level.</li>
            <li>I have thick coarse hair that, if I don&#x27;t use a diffuser, looks like I stuck my finger in a light socket.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generally blow dry my hair until it is halfway dry, just a few minutes to add body to my fine wavy/curly  weather dependent hair.</li>
            <li>This little item is a quick way to dry hair without the bulk of a plastic diffuser.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair that I wear about 6-8 inches long all over--and just let it curl naturally.  </li>
            <li>Dry&#x27;s quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Great if you want natural curls</li>
            <li>The last thing is I have very long, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if its the fabric of the &#x27;hot sock&#x27; or the texture of it that does it, but this item was a real let down in comparison to all of its &#x27;rave-reviews&#x27;.</li>

            <li> It really is a wonderful product and</li>

            <li> Also great for adding volume to your hair.</li>

            <li> As the title of this review states, it&#x27;s good for travel</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes we think everything good has to be  high-tech.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality low-tech device.</li>
            <li> (Yes, I do have those others, and from time-to-time I do give them a try, but they just aren&#x27;t as good as this one)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just delighted with this product.  </li>
            <li> Its good for travel as it is weightless.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> I got this to try out to see if it would be good to travel with.</li>
            <li> fit on it perfectly.  </li>
            <li> For the price..its all good.</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> , that is kind of in between a great wave and a true curl, but this diffuser worked awesome on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Super portable, lasts for ages, and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason this has so many great reviews.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love the price and how well it works!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed each of these products!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and great for traveling.</li>
            <li> Easy to store and great for travel.  </li>
            <li> Fits any hair dryer, easy to store or travel with, and works great.  </li>
            <li> This diffuser works great and is so easy to pack for travel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(This is a good place to note that the shipping was quick and my product came in great</li>
            <li> And it fits nicely on travel-sized hair dryers, like the ones attached to the wall at chain hotels.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own diffuser.</li>
            <li> Works like it said it would and handy when traveling.</li>
            <li> Liked it because it worked as well as her own drier.</li>
            <li> Had to return it, it kept catching my hair.  </li>
            <li> I liked that this didn&#x27;t require any cupping or anything.</li>
            <li> I am a curly hair girl that always has to travel with her own hairdryer and diffuser.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for traveling because it takes up virtually no space in my bag--unlike my normal diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Super happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It works really good &amp; easy to travel with</li>
            <li> It would be nice to have a slightly more elastic opening.</li>
            <li> I actually liked my hair during my latest trip.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit all blow dryers and sometimes I hold it on while drying, but someone used a rubber band which sounds like a good idea.</li>
            <li> Great price and wonderful little gadget.  </li>
            <li> So worth the money and a cheap good product that does the job!</li>
            <li> Unlike most curl hair my hair strands are very fine even though I have TONS of hair.</li>
            <li> I love that I can easily travel with it!</li>
            <li> Good quality - heavier foam than other brands so diffuses heat better; perfect for travel; depending on hair dryer may or may not stay on nozzle without holding on to it.</li>
            <li> Comes in handy when traveling - easy to pack.</li>
            <li> This hot sock was the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made, it slips right on to any hair dryer and works like magic.</li>
            <li> Not only does this one work the best</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I like this so much better than the plastic diffusers.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this product for so cheap!</li>
            <li> Who knew that a hair dryer diffuser could be so light and portable and still so effective?  </li>
            <li> It finally ripped but I ordered a replacement as is the best \\&quot;soft\\&quot; diffuser that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I use a diffuser to help create more curl, and was looking for something lightweight to take when I travel.  </li>
            <li> Ordered to replace the one I&#x27;ve already had for many years.</li>
            <li> Love that it is so portable and storable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also crushable, so I can pack it in my suitcase along with my hair blower without using up more space.  </li>
            <li> Sure, Fashion Ave. says straight is in, but I like my curls and this diffuser keeps them plump and happy.  </li>
            <li> By orally smooth hair!</li>
            <li> works much better for curly hair than the &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; diffuser.</li>
            <li> Love that it works with any size hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I think this might work better than my diffuser.</li>
            <li> Works better that by bell diffuser and travels well also.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.</li>
            <li> this is the simplest yet best tool I use on a daily basis in the salon!</li>
            <li> And I make sure every curly haired client that leaves has one.</li>
            <li> I have had a perm since 1991 and have tried many diffuser&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I love this one, it</li>
            <li> There are better diffusers on the market which you don&#x27;t have to be touching your hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad if this works for you, but it doesn&#x27;t help my curls at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for many years now and</li>
            <li> Its very portable too which is great since I bring it with me on vacations.</li>
            <li> So glad Amazon carries these, and hope they will always do so.  </li>
            <li> What more could you ask for:)</li>
            <li> I get better curls from this product.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is simple and excellent.</li>
            <li> Love mine.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be amazed :)</li>
            <li> Works great and is very compact and portable.</li>
            <li> Great..dryer is better then ever now..</li>
            <li> Best used for traveling and not wanting to bring a big diffuser.</li>
            <li> Even though most places where you stay already have a hairdryer, I&#x27;d still need to bring my own since not all hair dryers are designed to fit a diffuser attachment.</li>
            <li> Kudos to whoever came up with this idea!! :-)</li>
            <li> I would love to rate the item on it&#x27;s quality</li>
            <li> and It works OK.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, it works and fits any blow dryer!</li>
            <li> Love love love.</li>
            <li> works better than some plastic ones i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I got so many compliments on my hair -</li>
            <li> Tried it out twice before I went on vacation and the foam material stuck to my hair and pulled out most of the curls while drying.  </li>
            <li> Works really well and great for travel.</li>
            <li> Better than those bulky diffusers</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> It does give a more concentrated diffuse if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> So much better than plastic bulky diffusers</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> It works okay.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it diffuses the heat/air better than the plastic ones.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful soft waves that weren&#x27;t crunchy!</li>
            <li> I was super pleased with the result!  </li>
            <li> It is easy to travel with and works better than the plastic attachments that cost so much more.  </li>
            <li> Used it on vacation and was pleased that it could be used on all the hotel hair dryers, and so easy to pack.</li>
            <li> Very good for diffusing different size dryers.</li>
            <li> So I ordered this one, and was super pleased with the price and quick shipment!!  </li>
            <li> I can see it being easy to travel with (my original intent) and now I use it almost every day!</li>
            <li> It works great for drying your hair &amp; keeping you natural curls.</li>
            <li> , I get better results, and it dries my hair more quickly.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of warm air to allow curls to curl and no weight added at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and lightweight to pack for trips.</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly too.</li>
            <li> I go to the gym every day, and was looking for an easy to carry diffuser.</li>
            <li> Stores easily in my bathroom and is not bulky.  </li>
            <li> Easy to slide on and off hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that frizzes easily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also so easy to pack and take on trips - it takes up virtually almost no space at all.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use on all dryers</li>
            <li> Product shipped quickly and seems to work just fine!  </li>
            <li> The Hot Sock Diffuser is an effective low-cost styling aid to pack in carry-on luggage.</li>
            <li> It works beautifully and when I travel I can pop it into my luggage and use it with the drier in the hotel room because it&#x27;s universal.</li>
            <li> Works well and gives body to my fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Work fine on my hairdryer, which didn&#x27;t come with</li>
            <li> and it still works just fine when you need it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> Light weight, easy to store and pack.</li>
            <li> The Hot Sock works perfectly and I will never go back to plastic again!  </li>
            <li> I love my hot sock!  </li>
            <li> This little hair-sock is so awesome.</li>
            <li> Perfect little diffuser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have naturally curly hair for over 15 years and this diffuser works the best to keep my curls natural and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> A huge help and way easier than packing a bulky diffuser.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would work well so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to pack my huge plastic diffuser when traveling</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s great for travel as it weighs next to nothing.</li>
            <li> It packs well, and it fit on every dryer I used.</li>
            <li> Because it is a sock, it will fit any dryer.</li>
            <li> Have never used another diffuser, but because of the oval shape of my hair dryer, nothing else fit.  </li>
            <li> I bought a second one and am just as happy with this one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cheap though...</li>
            <li> It is so light that it flies off the hair dryer even at the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li> well, it doesn&#x27;t fit every dryer...</li>
            <li> so it would fit.</li>
            <li> Wish there was a way to secure it on to any size nozzle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely cheap</li>
            <li> and it was cheap.</li>
            <li> It will fit over any hairdryer nozzle.</li>
            <li> seems cheap and will not stay on the hairdryer</li>
            <li> It not only works great</li>
            <li> This product made my hair have lots of volume and really enhanced the waves nicely that lasted all day.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea as traditional diffusers are so bulky.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t find one to fit.</li>
            <li> So I wouldn&#x27;t use this on a daily basis, but it&#x27;s great when you need to rely on borrowed/hotel hair dryers and need a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I use this occasionally and it works great.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap and light weight.</li>
            <li> This fun sock fits on most of the hotel hairdryers</li>
            <li> Light.</li>
            <li> Being able to travel with it is just an added bonus and would be worth the money all in itself.  </li>
            <li> I thought this might be a good choice for my naturally curly hair; plus I did not want to shell out the $$ for the Deva diffuser.</li>
            <li> The Hot Sock works like a charm and is easy to travel with!</li>
            <li> because they&#x27;re easy to use, they fit on any blow dryer, and they leave my hair looking wavy and full.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very economical option as well.</li>
            <li> This works much better than the large plastic diffuser attachments!</li>
            <li> well worth the (inexpensive) price!  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li> The original one lasted me 4 years.  </li>
            <li> It is easier to use than a diffuser because you can kind of stick it anywhere in your hair, and the air is at the same time more targeted and diffused.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as nice as the large plastic diffusers that have the little &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; on them, so I wouldn&#x27;t use this at home, but it&#x27;s great for gym bags or space-limited</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very portable and it&#x27;s better than nothing, but that&#x27;s it...</li>
            <li> and she used the sock and loved it, no extra frizz!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t, IMO, as good as a regular diffuser</li>
            <li> That is the only good thing I can say.</li>
            <li> had one before and needed a new one great for home or travel to keep curly hair away from direct heat.</li>
            <li> She can dry her own hair now :)</li>
            <li> The Hot Sock diffuser has a strong chemical smell that didn&#x27;t go away after washing it.  </li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job of allowing heat without significant air pressure to gently dry curly or fine hair without burning or flattening it.  </li>
            <li> It works great, just as good as an expensive diffuser.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair quickly and keeps it from frizzing.  </li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and to make it super curly</li>
            <li> product arrived quickly and met my expectations.</li>
            <li> The Hot Sock fit the bill, I was told by one of the stylists at the salon,\\&quot;You will never keep your curl out in Palm Springs\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I like normal diffusers better.  </li>
            <li> It is light weight, fits on all blow dryers, and does exactly what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> And using it with very hot air made me question what sort of plastic chemicals I was heating up and inhaling.</li>
            <li> The only (very slight) issue is that the sock easily comes off of the dryer; I just put a hair elastic around it to secure it and it stays in place perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love mine and can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> This saved me from buying a new blow dryer and it works better than a plastic defuser.</li>
            <li> Ready to slip onto end of blow dryerslips on easily.</li>
            <li> I own an old Revlon hair dryer and the hot sock</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s priced well, I can use it easily on any drier when I travel and don&#x27;t need to bring my whole hair drier with me</li>
            <li> It does tear easily so treat it gently.</li>
            <li> This hot sock  is Inexpensive, portable, light-weight, fits all hairdryers and still does the job!</li>
            <li> I wish I would of thought of this bogus product first!</li>
            <li> I tried it last night and am in LOVE!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t change my process, just got the hot sock!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair less curly and more frizzy!!</li>
            <li> Great little item.  </li>
            <li> This is great little diffuser that works well.  </li>
            <li> The clunky plastic diffuser that came with my dryer seemed to blow more air than it should, making my hair extra frizzy and not giving me the curls I wanted, so I thought I&#x27;d try this cheap alternative.  </li>
            <li> it was worth a try...</li>
            <li> I chose this because after reading reviews it seemed the most likely to fit any hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It was not a snug fit on my blow dryer even though my blow dryer just has a standard barrel like most blow dryers do.  </li>
            <li> She is thrilled to have finally found one,</li>
            <li> I purchased this because most &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; diffusers aren&#x27;t since my dryer is not round.  </li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite diffuser.</li>
            <li> Not only does it work better, but it works on any dryer, is super easy to store and travels really well.</li>
            <li> It leaves my fine curly hair soft and full.  </li>
            <li> Because of the elastic opening on the Hot Sock, I&#x27;m sure it would fit on any blower--now THAT IS universal!  </li>
            <li> Not only does the &#x27;hot sock&#x27; not stay on my dryer but most importantly it makes my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> &quot; That&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li> Flew right off my hairdryer</li>
            <li> Lets just the right amount of air through.  </li>
            <li> The Hot Sock has elastic at the end and really does seem like it would fit any hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This item is exactly what I need for travel, it is very compact and light in weight and functions well with all hair dryers.</li>
            <li> What a great little invention!  </li>
            <li> This squishes down to nothing in my toiletry bag and works wonderfully on the standard dryers there.  </li>
            <li> It might not be as good as my large plastic one, but it&#x27;s cheap and won&#x27;t take up half my suitcase!</li>
            <li> I came upon the Hot Sock, read the reviews and thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> I got it for a recent trip, &amp; fortunately, my hotel had a good hair dryer with a regular diffuser.</li>
            <li> You can purchase other name brands but nothing works as good as this Hot Sock.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much I stopped using my old diffuser and use this instead.</li>
            <li> Instead of the big round plastic diffuser, this is awesome.</li>
            <li> After a recent hole in my old Hot Sock, I am so happy to see I can purchase a new one.</li>
            <li> Simple to use, easy to store and drys the hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> I like the Hot Sock very much.  </li>
            <li> This hot sock did not do what I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go!</li>
            <li> With this hot sock thing, you can&#x27;t rest your hair on it, because there&#x27;s no saucer-like surface with grips to hold your hair on it.  </li>
            <li> The Hot Sock does the trick.  </li>
            <li> My first \\&quot;Hot Sock\\&quot; lasted 2 years using it every day.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much, it has replaced the old one completely.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for continuing to make/offer this product!</li>
            <li> the &#x27;hot sock&#x27; kept falling off of the dryer</li>
            <li> Wish more actual air would come out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my Hot Sock now for over 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had one of these for more than 15 years and finally tore a hole in it.</li>
            <li> I also think it may affect the ionic tourmaline settings for my hairdryer, because my hair is frizzy after using the hot sock.</li>
            <li> I have tried to use this several times and the smell is more than I can handle.</li>
            <li> I put it on my blow dryer and the first thing it did when I turned my dryer on was blow off.  </li>
            <li> I used this as specified on the package and the Hot Sock</li>
            <li> May hair was very frizzy!</li>
            <li> I was able to recreate my curls with this sock just as I would with a regular diffuser.</li>
            <li> At first, I was concerned that this could be a fire hazard.</li>
            <li> first,</li>
            <li> I bought the Hot Sock  to use when I travel.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I would always have to pack my own hairdryer with my huge diffuser attachment.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and buy a REAL diffuser!</li>
            <li> This diffuser did not help do that; my big (hard-to-travel-with) plastic one works much better.</li>
            <li> Ideal for travel as it fit at least 4 different style hairdryers I encountered.  </li>
            <li> the Hot Sock DID succeed in MELTING MY HAIRDRYER.</li>
            <li> (Thankfully I tried it on my ancient dryer first.)</li>
            <li> Been using hot sock for years</li>
            <li> Hot Sock Diffuser does not stay on hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Just at first glance, this product is sketchy, how could a piece of foam do anything for my hair?</li>
            <li> The hot sock diffuse does exactly what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> Works so much better than any regular defuser .</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells the first week or two that you use it.  </li>
            <li> I like these sock type diffusers much better than big clunky plastic diffusers,</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it gave off a plastic smell, after that it works but nothing like a diffuser.. takes a lot</li>
            <li> it does fit any hair dryer I&#x27;ve encountered so far.</li>
            <li> I would think if you have lots and lots of hair and you use this hot sock, it might take a while.</li>
            <li> it just turns into frizz) and the hot sock always helps keep in the curl and keep out the frizz.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say that it worked exactly the same, but it was a much better alternative than no diffuser at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hot sock will not even stay on my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hot sock for about a year now.  </li>
            <li> so I just leave it in my suitcase and it makes my life sooo much easier!  </li>
            <li> It gives off a funny smell when I use it.</li>
            <li> So I got a safety pin and gathered it up and that made it a little snugger and was able to fit and stay on my barrel.  </li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
            <li> I love that it is very light, especially since it can take up to 20 minutes to dry my hair!</li>
            <li> Works perfect with my small hair dryer and long, curly &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite diffuser by far for my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Less frizz, more curl, lightweight, inexpensive -- no complaints!  </li>
            <li> This gives me really nice curls all over without the frizzy hot mess it could be.</li>
            <li> This could use a tighter elastic or something less &#x27;smooth&#x27; on the end because it slips off my hair dryer too easily ... but it works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very decent diffuser</li>
            <li> Takes more time to dry hair at the gym.</li>
            <li> With curly hair the diffuser is supposed to dry it without a lot of touching which breaks the curl.  </li>
            <li> Overall will be fine for lighter packing and that was what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li> I bought the Hot Sock Diffuser to use with an older dryer and realized I could use it on all of my dryers.  </li>
            <li> When I turned my drier on high, the sock got so hot</li>
            <li> I have VERY THICK AND CURLY hair and this diffuser does a great job.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a universal (ha!) &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; collapsible diffuser for traveling, but found it didn&#x27;t fit onto either of my 2 blow-dryers.</li>
            <li> I have very \\&quot;wavy\\&quot; hair</li>
            <li> Others either don&#x27;t fit the dryer well or tend to fall apart in a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> I will absolutely travel with it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to pay as much attention</li>
            <li> Used it on a client and didn&#x27;t seem to do a whole lot, or stay on the dryer very well.</li>
            <li> Thought this product would really help with frizziness after drying hair, but I didn&#x27;t see a difference at all.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t feel much air movement coming out of it.</li>
            <li> I have a giant pronged plastic diffuser for my regular hair dryer, and I think I actually like this one better... :)</li>
            <li> Save up for a real diffuser.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> It delivers a gentle flow of air so as not to frizz my curls.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is what I was looking for but doesn&#x27;t stay on very well.  </li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for curly hair!  </li>
            <li> really?</li>
            <li> Plus, it is SO much easier to pack on the go without the bulky diffuser.</li>
            <li> Made my hair very frizzy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much to eliminate frizz in my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t worsen it either like a couple of people have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> OK, not a very practical item.</li>
            <li> Convenient too ,but if you will need a diffuser every day I suggest getting a real one.</li>
            <li> works really well.</li>
            <li> and it seems to work as well on my curly hair as the bigger traditional kind.</li>
            <li> I carry enough with me to the gym that I can&#x27;t take my own blow dryer and diffuser, especially since they have dyers at the gym.  </li>
            <li> And when the plastic attachment breaks or gets lost, you&#x27;re pretty much looking at buying an entirely new hair dryer just to get the attachment.</li>
            <li> I thought it was the new Hot Sock fabric.</li>
            <li> This one star review is for the total misrepresentation in the original product description that says \\&quot;PACK OF 2.\\</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for traveling, as I didn&#x27;t want to use the luggage space to pack my giant plastic diffuser.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s top small of a surface area to hold enough hair on top of the dryer to curl it.</li>
            <li> I originally bought it for travel because it is small and easy to cram into my suitcase.</li>
            <li> it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great concept - the &amp;#34;sock&amp;#34; portion is a thick kind of mesh-like substance and it keeps the heat and lets only a little of the air through, so I scrunch my curls while using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The diffuser itself is feather light, and I was somewhat skeptical of it staying on my hair dryer, but I was impressed with not only the quality of the elastic seal but that it actually works in dispersing the air.</li>
            <li> so I figured I would purchase this as a universal diffuser that would fit my new hair blow dryer.</li>
            <li> The hot sock arrived very quickly and has helped make my hair less frizzy.</li>
            <li> However, since hotels don&#x27;t have diffusers available,  if you need to dry your hair in a hurry it will do.</li>
            <li> It fit perfectly on my old Conair Quiet Tone dryer and</li>
            <li> Was looking for a diffuser light enough for my 10 yr old to hold up with her hair dryer...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Although it slips off the barrel  if used on high.</li>
            <li> works great and is not bulky and heavy like other diffusers.</li>
            <li> Helped transform my waves into soft curls without the frizz!!  </li>
            <li> That hasn&#x27;t affected its performance (yet), and for the price I paid, I really shouldn&#x27;t be surprised...</li>
            <li> I have intense naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the heavy plastic diffusers but this one works just as well, maybe better.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it though, especially for travel.</li>
            <li> Pretty much no noticeable different in air flow with or without this on my blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> Tried it on 2 different hair dryers and once they turn on, it blows right off.</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel purposes b/c it weights virtually nothing and can be flattened with no problem - pops right back into shape.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it would hold up under that kind of regular use, but for what I needed, I was really surprised at how such a simple design @</li>
            <li> The reason I purchased this item was because I bought a new hair dryer that didn&#x27;t come with an attachment for a diffuser</li>
            <li> Once my blow dryer needs repair, I will purchase a new one with a diffuser attachment and use this one for travel.</li>
            <li> With a short barrel dryer you may have to hold the diffuser on with a finger, but it wasn&#x27;t too hard to do this, and the air flow was good.</li>
            <li> This product is cheap and sucks and not even worth $1.</li>
            <li> It came in pretty quick but was not worth it!</li>
            <li> My hair dryer is small with a short, oval-shaped barrel, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could find a diffuser to fit it.(In reviews of other diffusers that claimed to fit any dryer, people often complained that they didn&#x27;t fit their dryers.)</li>
            <li> Be advised, only one Hot Sock comes in the order.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Hot Sock diffuser for my recent trip to the UK and Ireland.</li>
            <li> I use my hair blow dryer on Low with the &#x27;hot sock&#x27; to diffuse my curly hair but</li>
            <li> Do not expect to get the same performance out of this hot sock as you would a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at first, then I gave it a second chance...</li>
            <li> My hair is past my shoulders and now I am going to have to cut about an inch or more to get rid of the damage.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have used, the first lasted for around 8 years.</li>
            <li> Years and years ago, my Mom found a Hot Sock Diffuser at a local store and I&#x27;ve used them ever since.  </li>
            <li> It gives the exact same effect on my curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I gave this hot sock 5 stars for several reasons.  </li>
            <li> so I also have a perm which has left my hair pretty curly.  </li>
            <li> Actually does work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this as my last diffuser (which I bought at Wal-Mart for 1.99 several years ago), finally developed a hole in it and had to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased many Hot Socks but this one seemed to be poorly constructed.  </li>
            <li> It does leave my hair a little straighter and flatter than I&#x27;d prefer, but it&#x27;s better than using a hair dryer without a diffuser at all, for someone like me with coarse and wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> If you use a difuser, this is so much better than the bulky hard plastic ones.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the same nice airflow that my hard plastic one has so it takes longer.</li>
            <li> (I hadn&#x27;t noticed how much effort I was taking to keep the big one from falling off while drying my hair!)</li>
            <li> I really prefer the regular diffuser where you hair lays into it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> (well, I CAN, but my hair ends up all frizzy instead of having soft curls if i don&#x27;t use</li>
            <li> but my hair drier is old</li>
            <li> My daughter has been looking for a diffuser that would fit on her blow dryer for a few years.</li>
            <li> Works well but does slip off frequently.  </li>
            <li> I have natural curl</li>
            <li> So much easier than regular diffuser.</li>
            <li> This thing works OK as a diffuser my thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Now, I only need to scrunch up my little sock in my garment bag! :-)  </li>
            <li> Works really well for stretching out natural hair while blow drying when using the tension method which is what I mainly use it for and it  can works well diffusing wash and go hair styles, it does not scatter your curly do all over, but this is not a method I use much but for women who wear wash and go frequently I would quicker suggest the plastic diffuser that usually comes with some dryers</li>
            <li> I appreciate how much it lightens up the weight of my hairdryer, too, as I have a bit of arthritis in my arms and hands and it helps not to have to strain so much to hold it, as I did with the old plastic one that weighed down the end of the dryer.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted about 4 years and multiple vacations before it finally died.  </li>
            <li> These last about 2 years with daily use before they start to get funny</li>
            <li> I am travelling in September and wanted to just bring a small, light diffuser for my naturally curly hair to use on the dryer at the hotel.</li>
            <li> It is so much easier to maneuver than the old one, especially when drying the back of my hair.  </li>
            <li> so cheap, small, convenient.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is the mouth was so tight it would hardly fit over the hotel hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> , it fits any dryer (I do secure it with a tight hair band on dryers with smaller and/or stubby nozzles), and packs in a bag without taking up any space.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> However, this diffuser does allow me to dry my hair on a faster speed without producing too much fuzzing.  </li>
            <li> so much it wouldn&#x27;t dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> Helps dry my curly hair fast without a lot of fizz.</li>
            <li> It dries my curls too fast it makes my hair feel dry.</li>
            <li> Small, easy to navigate, unlike the big plastic orb with nozzles sticking out of the air holes.</li>
            <li> Because it is a soft diffuser, you can roll it, scrunch it up, flatten it, and cram it in just about any tiny spot in your luggage</li>
            <li> Went back to my old diffuser.</li>
            <li> This little \\&quot;Sock\\&quot; fits right over my blow dryer and sends out all the heat</li>
            <li> (Most of you with long curly hair should know what I mean.)  </li>
            <li> When I use the dryer without the diffuser, my hair becomes straight in spots and fuzzy in other places.  </li>
            <li> only fault is that it doesn&#x27;t have the prongs on a conventional diffuser, but with a little more effort and scrunching the hair with your fingers you can achieve the same result</li>
            <li> When I use my hair dryer without the diffuser, it gets tangled because I just blast it and run the dryer back and forth to get it dry as fast as possible.  </li>
            <li> Truthfully, this is sort of a useless product, on a professional level.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair that, if I don&#x27;t use a diffuser, looks like I stuck my finger in a light socket.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally blow dry my hair until it is halfway dry, just a few minutes to add body to my fine wavy/curly  weather dependent hair.</li>
            <li> This little item is a quick way to dry hair without the bulk of a plastic diffuser.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that I wear about 6-8 inches long all over--and just let it curl naturally.  </li>
            <li> Dry&#x27;s quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Great if you want natural curls</li>
            <li> The last thing is I have very long, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its the fabric of the &#x27;hot sock&#x27; or the texture of it that does it, but this item was a real let down in comparison to all of its &#x27;rave-reviews&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Not bad, not good,</li>
            <li> Once the original could not be used anymore, I tried drying my hair without a diffuser with poor results.</li>
            <li> No more large, bulky diffusers.</li>
            <li> but I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this for anyone with thicker, coarse and loose curls.</li>
            <li> For those people that complained this made their hair frizzy, it&#x27;s probably because they were using high heat with their dryer (curly hair you&#x27;re supposed to use a low setting - with or without the sock).</li>
            <li> I have long and curly hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t add weight to your hair dryer like standard diffusers do, and it dries your hair quickly without disturbing your style.</li>
            <li> Did not take too long to dry my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If the opening is too big for your hair dryer, just put a rubber band or other form of tie around it</li>
            <li> I have gotten rid of my other diffusers and only use this now.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find them once the next one dies.and from looking at other reviews I want to say I have never had a problem with it falling off the dryer.</li>
            <li> I read other people&#x27;s reviews that it was too big for their hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It packs flat, taking up no real weight or room.</li>
            <li> I am Very careful about my hair, use heat occasionally and keep it hydrated.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ll stick to using my hard nozzle attachment at home (I like the effect from the &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34;), this works EXTREMELY well for travel!</li>
            <li> and when I just want to blow it dry it</li>
            <li> This item allows me to blow it dry without the bush.  </li>
            <li> It did allow me to dry my hair, but I ended up with friz any way.</li>
            <li> They I blow-dried with this thing until my hair was maybe 90-95% dry</li>
            <li> I use this on the dryers that are furnished to us at my gym to dry my hair after a workout.  </li>
            <li> The hair comes out just as nice as the other expensive diffusers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy hair that doesn&#x27;t exactly curl.</li>
            <li> This sometimes blows off the dryer, but not very much.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and if I am going to blow dry, a diffuser is a must!  </li>
            <li> I only ran the dryer on max speed for a couple minute, and when I did I smelled an odd smell.</li>
            <li> Normal hard plastic diffusers (the ones that come with your dryer) usually hit my hair too hard with air, and it frizzes very fast.  </li>
            <li> After a few times of using it, I finally washed it with some soap and water and let it dry.  </li>
            <li> Since hotel hair dryers never have diffusers - essential for drying curly hair - I would have to lug my diffuser hair dryer with me when traveling if I didn&#x27;t have this lightweight little product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever tried it on, even my tiny little travel dryer.</li>
            <li> knocked off one star because the pink thread that holds the seam together at the opening started to unravel almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I am so careful</li>
            <li> A total waste.</li>
            <li> I bought a travel dryer with a diffuser, but i still think it&#x27;s rather big and heavy,  </li>
            <li> I use a rubber hair-tie to keep the diffuser from slipping off my hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I still need to use product on both wet and dry hair to keep the pouf down and give definition.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, but for the price I had to try it since my diffuser was on its last leg.  </li>
            <li> Hard to hold on and dry hair at the same time.</li>
            <li> I still get some frizz, but it could be due to my hair products, not the diffuser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed, but glad I didn&#x27;t purchase it from my hair dresser who sold it for $10.</li>
            <li> Contrary to other reviewers, mine stays on my hair dryer well.</li>
            <li> I ordered it in addition to some other items that did arrive separately but, sadly, no Hot Sock.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on dryer tried using a rubber band and other things nothing worked...</li>
            <li> I usually resorted to throwing my hair in a bun, especially when traveling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a mini defuser without the giant hard plastic blow dryer-attachment.</li>
            <li> Not the same as a hard diffuser.</li>
            <li> The next thing that I noticed was when it got hot it emitted a chemical smell that was so bad it almost made my eyes water.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this sock diffuser made my hair an absolute frizzball.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, naturally wavy hair that luckily never gets frizzy.  </li>
            <li> little air comes out of this ugly thing, that even with my dryer on high, it would have taken me five years to blow dry my short hair using this</li>
            <li> This means my hair still ends up slightly frizzy because it ends up rubbing against the surface of the sock.</li>
            <li> It takes up much less space in the drawer and stays on the dryer with a lot less effort</li>
            <li> I think my hair dries even faster now that it isn&#x27;t being blown about by my travel hair dryer&#x27;s weird definition of high (gail force wind).</li>
            <li> However, based on the reviews I was halfway expecting a miracle from this product only to be a little disappointed due to the fact that this product made my hair very frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair has body and waves, no true curls.  </li>
            <li> Although I use a rubber band to keep it on tightly as the pressure blows it off otherwise.</li>
            <li> It would take forever and a day to dry my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> is the only diffuser I&#x27;ve used for at least the past 15 years.  </li>
            <li> A little garnier anti-frizz serum and this diffuser</li>
            <li> Just a little mesh sock you stick on the end of your blow dryer?</li>
            <li> I have tried a few types of bowl blow dryers and they all make my wavy/curly 2c hair a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fighting the urge to by an extra one in the event I lose this one or worse yet, the company stops making it.</li>
            <li> One size does NOT fit most/all.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Use almost everyday.</li>
            <li> so I can control the direction my hair is being dried in</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it just made my thick medium length curly hair very frizzy.</li>
            <li> Does blow off the longer nozzles at high speed, but not enough to be annoying.</li>
            <li> I found them, but they were very expensive and with a vacation coming up, I really didn&#x27;t want to buy another hair dryer or spend the additional money.</li>
            <li> My hair looks worse than if I just let it air dry (this takes hours).</li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser after a girl at the salon used it on my hair instead of the usual type of diffusers.  </li>
            <li> I have used this item in the past, but needed it replaced.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, in trying to practice with it at home it regularly falls off the end of the dryer.</li>
            <li> Epic Fail in my book!</li>
            <li> I have very heavy thick hair</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding one at the beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> My every-day dryer with a hard plastic diffuser went out.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if I use it a lot that smell will go away, but I probably won&#x27;t use it - I&#x27;m just wondering what icky chemicals I&#x27;m breathing when using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what all the rave reviews were for, because I missed the fascination of this diffuser sock!</li>
            <li> The plastic diffuser I had used to frequently fall off the dryer which was annoying.</li>
            <li> I imagine that my hair suffers less damage with this product, though.</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever made my hair look like this (or this bad)- not even the extreme humidity of Mexico in August.  </li>
            <li> and so when my awkward, ugly big plastic diffuser that came with my hairdryer broke, I ordered one of these.  </li>
            <li> I should have sent it back, but hated being without, so</li>
            <li> I was a little doubtful of how well it would work, because...</li>
            <li> Useless purchase.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical @</li>
            <li> Lame.</li>
            <li> Although it is quite portable, sadly it did not work for my hair.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product for the price.</li>
            <li> I have difficult curls (without a diffuser</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I&#x27;d never find another one.</li>
            <li> stinks.  </li>
            <li> Anyway I think its useless.... :(</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product, but decided to give it a try because it was so inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> but for now I will. :(</li>
            <li> This is a very disappointing product.</li>
            <li> This just pulled on my hair and became annoying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated the bulkiness of plastic diffusers.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, it did nothing it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!!</li>
            <li> Horrible purchase.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Performs well. Very good for diffusing different size dryers.</li>
            <li> Great for travel.  Keeps air flow sufficiently diffused.</li>
            <li> Kept coming off my blow dryer.</li>
            <li> This hot sock did not do what I wanted it to. It made my hair frizzy and fly away. I wanted to take it on a month-long trip to Europe, but I am going to have to find something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this item for a month now and it does the trick.  It&#x27;s perfect for traveling because it takes up virtually no space in my bag--unlike my normal diffuser.  Because I don&#x27;t use it every day I don&#x27;t know how it would hold up under that kind of regular use, but for what I needed, I was really surprised at how such a simple design @ an inexpensive price could work so well.  I had purchased a universal (ha!) &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; collapsible diffuser for traveling, but found it didn&#x27;t fit onto either of my 2 blow-dryers. Back that went.&lt;br /&gt;  Because of the elastic opening on the Hot Sock, I&#x27;m sure it would fit on any blower--now THAT IS universal!  I have curly hair that I wear about 6-8 inches long all over--and just let it curl naturally.  A little garnier anti-frizz serum and this diffuser and I&#x27;m ready to go!</li>
            <li> It was delivered on time.  It works well. It stays on the blow dryer quite well.</li>
            <li> I like the Hot Sock very much.  It&#x27;s easy to use and lightweight to pack for trips. The only drawback is the mouth was so tight it would hardly fit over the hotel hair dryers.  It would be nice to have a slightly more elastic opening.</li>
            <li> While the concept is great, the practicality isn&#x27;t quite there.  It does a good job of diffusing the air to reduce the wind while still letting heat through.  And it fits nicely on travel-sized hair dryers, like the ones attached to the wall at chain hotels.  I&#x27;ll give it that.  What I didn&#x27;t realize until I&#x27;d taken it traveling, is that when I use my full-size diffuser at home, I tend to &amp;#34;rest&amp;#34; my curls on the surface of the diffuser as I&#x27;m going around my head.  (Most of you with long curly hair should know what I mean.)  With this hot sock thing, you can&#x27;t rest your hair on it, because there&#x27;s no saucer-like surface with grips to hold your hair on it.  So while you can waive it around amongst your curls, you can&#x27;t actually bounce and rest your curls on the surface while it emits heat.  This means my hair still ends up slightly frizzy because it ends up rubbing against the surface of the sock.</li>
            <li> Why would I ever use another diffuser? Not only does this one work the best, it fits any dryer (I do secure it with a tight hair band on dryers with smaller and/or stubby nozzles), and packs in a bag without taking up any space. Love it.</li>
            <li> I like this so much better than the plastic diffusers.</li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser after a girl at the salon used it on my hair instead of the usual type of diffusers.  So I ordered this one, and was super pleased with the price and quick shipment!!  I have very \\&quot;wavy\\&quot; hair, that is kind of in between a great wave and a true curl, but this diffuser worked awesome on my hair.  Helped transform my waves into soft curls without the frizz!!  I was super pleased with the result!  For me, this works better than the old-fashioned diffuser, and it travels great!  So glad I found this product for so cheap!</li>
            <li> Who knew that a hair dryer diffuser could be so light and portable and still so effective?  It really is a wonderful product and well worth the (inexpensive) price!  I can&#x27;t wait to have a chance to pack it with ease when I go on vacation!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my curly hair.  When I need to replace this one in the future, I will definitely get the two pack!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product throughout my curly-haired lifetime. It&#x27;s a very decent diffuser and it&#x27;s great for travel. This one star review is for the total misrepresentation in the original product description that says \\&quot;PACK OF 2.\\&quot; That&#x27;s right. It says it in all capital letters. Be advised, only one Hot Sock comes in the order.</li>
            <li> Great product. It does its job perfectly</li>
            <li> The Hot Sock does the trick.  I have very heavy thick hair and when I just want to blow it dry it bushes out so big my husband just laughs at me.  This item allows me to blow it dry without the bush.  It&#x27;s light weight making it perfect for travel.  If the opening is too big for your hair dryer, just put a rubber band or other form of tie around it and it will solve that problem.</li>
            <li> My first \\&quot;Hot Sock\\&quot; lasted 2 years using it every day.  It finally ripped but I ordered a replacement as is the best \\&quot;soft\\&quot; diffuser that I have ever used.  Others either don&#x27;t fit the dryer well or tend to fall apart in a short period of time.  Plus it&#x27;s great for travel as it weighs next to nothing.</li>
            <li> I was hunting on the internet for a travel dryer with a diffuser. I found them, but they were very expensive and with a vacation coming up, I really didn&#x27;t want to buy another hair dryer or spend the additional money. The Hot Sock fit the bill, I was told by one of the stylists at the salon,\\&quot;You will never keep your curl out in Palm Springs\\&quot;.....OH YES I DID!!!!!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for traveling, as I didn&#x27;t want to use the luggage space to pack my giant plastic diffuser.  I liked it so much, it has replaced the old one completely.  It takes up much less space in the drawer and stays on the dryer with a lot less effort (I hadn&#x27;t noticed how much effort I was taking to keep the big one from falling off while drying my hair!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have naturally curly hair for over 15 years and this diffuser works the best to keep my curls natural and not frizzy. After a recent hole in my old Hot Sock, I am so happy to see I can purchase a new one. Thanks for continuing to make/offer this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Hot Sock diffuser for my recent trip to the UK and Ireland. It packs well, and it fit on every dryer I used. I had no problems keeping it on. Of course, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as a proper bowl diffuser, but it kept my wavy/curly hair from getting too blown around during the drying process. I will absolutely travel with it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked off one star because the pink thread that holds the seam together at the opening started to unravel almost immediately. That hasn&#x27;t affected its performance (yet), and for the price I paid, I really shouldn&#x27;t be surprised... but I&#x27;m withholding a perfect score nevertheless.</li>
            <li> Product shipped quickly and seems to work just fine!  I don&#x27;t use it a lot but when i have it seems to work as well as the one my hair person uses.</li>
            <li> This is awesome. It is easier to use than a diffuser because you can kind of stick it anywhere in your hair, and the air is at the same time more targeted and diffused. I don&#x27;t have to pay as much attention, I get better results, and it dries my hair more quickly. Because it is a sock, it will fit any dryer. The only (very slight) issue is that the sock easily comes off of the dryer; I just put a hair elastic around it to secure it and it stays in place perfectly. Wish I&#x27;d found this years ago for my curly hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated the bulkiness of plastic diffusers. The Hot Sock works like a charm and is easy to travel with!</li>
            <li> This product was not enough for my needs. Did not stay on my dryer. Did not meet my standards. But price was good.</li>
            <li> I have thin, naturally wavy hair that luckily never gets frizzy.  I use a diffuser to help create more curl, and was looking for something lightweight to take when I travel.  Unfortunately this sock diffuser made my hair an absolute frizzball.  Nothing has ever made my hair look like this (or this bad)- not even the extreme humidity of Mexico in August.  Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Fit is perfect around the hairdryer and doesn&#x27;t fall off. The diffuser has a chemical smell. Maybe in time the smell will go away.</li>
            <li> Ordered to replace the one I&#x27;ve already had for many years. Great product! Easy to use and great for traveling.</li>
            <li> Have never used another diffuser, but because of the oval shape of my hair dryer, nothing else fit.  This seems to work.  I still get some frizz, but it could be due to my hair products, not the diffuser. Love that it is so portable and storable.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted about 4 years and multiple vacations before it finally died.  I bought a second one and am just as happy with this one.  Works perfect with my small hair dryer and long, curly &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> The clunky plastic diffuser that came with my dryer seemed to blow more air than it should, making my hair extra frizzy and not giving me the curls I wanted, so I thought I&#x27;d try this cheap alternative.  So far I&#x27;m very pleased.  Less frizz, more curl, lightweight, inexpensive -- no complaints!  Shipped very quickly too.</li>
            <li> This item works like a diffuser... it does what it is supposed to do. However, based on the reviews I was halfway expecting a miracle from this product only to be a little disappointed due to the fact that this product made my hair very frizzy. The reason I purchased this item was because I bought a new hair dryer that didn&#x27;t come with an attachment for a diffuser so I figured I would purchase this as a universal diffuser that would fit my new hair blow dryer. I use my hair blow dryer on Low with the &#x27;hot sock&#x27; to diffuse my curly hair but the &#x27;hot sock&#x27; kept falling off of the dryer so now I have to hold the sock on the dryer with my thumb whenever I diffuse my hair. Not only does the &#x27;hot sock&#x27; not stay on my dryer but most importantly it makes my hair frizzy. I&#x27;m not sure if its the fabric of the &#x27;hot sock&#x27; or the texture of it that does it, but this item was a real let down in comparison to all of its &#x27;rave-reviews&#x27;. Just a note, that this may not work for everyone. It&#x27;s so cheap though... might as well try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> This is a very disappointing product. It is a flimsy piece of foam. It is so light that it flies off the hair dryer even at the lowest setting.  Useless purchase.</li>
            <li> Works good. Wish more actual air would come out. Takes more time to dry hair at the gym. This is where I use it. Still prefer regular difuser but for where I use it and the price, can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Really good for travelling and when using hotel driers in lieu of a diffuser.  Works well and gives body to my fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Truthfully, this is sort of a useless product, on a professional level. Used it on a client and didn&#x27;t seem to do a whole lot, or stay on the dryer very well. At home might be a different story, however.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my Hot Sock now for over 6 months.  It works well for my purposes and situation and I bought a 2nd one as a backup.  However, it does tend to make the dryer run warmer.  Since I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair but twice a week, it does not hurt my dryer.  If I used it for the same length of time every day, I suspect it might wear my dryer out faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the heavy plastic diffusers but this one works just as well, maybe better.  It&#x27;s also crushable, so I can pack it in my suitcase along with my hair blower without using up more space.  It does a pretty good job of allowing heat without significant air pressure to gently dry curly or fine hair without burning or flattening it.  Sure, Fashion Ave. says straight is in, but I like my curls and this diffuser keeps them plump and happy.  I say Be Yourself.</li>
            <li> This little \\&quot;Sock\\&quot; fits right over my blow dryer and sends out all the heat but none of the blow!  It&#x27;s a great invention, works great!  Slips off occassionally, but is simply to put back on.  I can see it being easy to travel with (my original intent) and now I use it almost every day!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best inventions ever!!!! I bought two and will never be without one again! By orally smooth hair!</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for drying my curly hair without all the air flow.  My beautician recommended it for me.  I had a hard time finding one at the beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I go to the gym every day, and was looking for an easy to carry diffuser. This is it!!  I like it so well I need to buy another one for at home.. works much better for curly hair than the &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; diffuser.</li>
            <li> I had had one of these before and left it in a hotel room. Since hotel hair dryers never have diffusers - essential for drying curly hair - I would have to lug my diffuser hair dryer with me when traveling if I didn&#x27;t have this lightweight little product. I wish I had invented it!</li>
            <li> I actually liked my hair during my latest trip. A huge help and way easier than packing a bulky diffuser. Love that it works with any size hair dryer.</li>
            <li> What a great little invention!  I noticed that my hairdresser used one of these and so when my awkward, ugly big plastic diffuser that came with my hairdryer broke, I ordered one of these.  Great price and wonderful little gadget.  It fit perfectly on my old Conair Quiet Tone dryer and what a difference it makes to drying my hair.  It is so much easier to maneuver than the old one, especially when drying the back of my hair.  I appreciate how much it lightens up the weight of my hairdryer, too, as I have a bit of arthritis in my arms and hands and it helps not to have to strain so much to hold it, as I did with the old plastic one that weighed down the end of the dryer.</li>
            <li> Thought this product would really help with frizziness after drying hair, but I didn&#x27;t see a difference at all.  I&#x27;m disappointed, but glad I didn&#x27;t purchase it from my hair dresser who sold it for $10.</li>
            <li> had one before and needed a new one great for home or travel to keep curly hair away from direct heat. works great, I bought two.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get it. Can&#x27;t feel much air movement coming out of it. But I&#x27;m bald, so what do I know. My wife loves it and has recommended it to a number of friends.</li>
            <li> I always read all the reviews who said this fits everything and figured for this price it was worth a try... well, it doesn&#x27;t fit every dryer...so it went back.</li>
            <li> The Hot Sock Diffuser is an effective low-cost styling aid to pack in carry-on luggage. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I think this might work better than my diffuser. I originally bought it for travel because it is small and easy to cram into my suitcase. I love it so much I stopped using my old diffuser and use this instead. I&#x27;m fighting the urge to by an extra one in the event I lose this one or worse yet, the company stops making it.</li>
            <li> Works better that by bell diffuser and travels well also.</li>
            <li> It figures thebest from blow dryer. Ready to slip onto end of blow dryerslips on easily.</li>
            <li> Figured this was probably gonna be one of those &amp;#34;waste of money/end up in the back of the drawer&amp;#34; purchases. Nope! This actually works.</li>
            <li> This is a great diffuser for curly hair/permed hair.  I highly recommend.  It&#x27;s a very economical option as well.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser. I think my hair dries even faster now that it isn&#x27;t being blown about by my travel hair dryer&#x27;s weird definition of high (gail force wind). The diffuser itself is feather light, and I was somewhat skeptical of it staying on my hair dryer, but I was impressed with not only the quality of the elastic seal but that it actually works in dispersing the air. I have a giant pronged plastic diffuser for my regular hair dryer, and I think I actually like this one better... :)</li>
            <li> I thought this might be a good choice for my naturally curly hair; plus I did not want to shell out the $$ for the Deva diffuser. All I can say is, this must be some sort of practical joke!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So little air comes out of this ugly thing, that even with my dryer on high, it would have taken me five years to blow dry my short hair using this monstrosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess you do get what you pay for. Save up for a real diffuser.</li>
            <li> this is the simplest yet best tool I use on a daily basis in the salon! And I make sure every curly haired client that leaves has one.</li>
            <li> This lightweight packable diffuser is ideal. It doesn&#x27;t add weight to your hair dryer like standard diffusers do, and it dries your hair quickly without disturbing your style. I&#x27;d had one of these for more than 15 years and finally tore a hole in it. I was afraid I&#x27;d never find another one. Thank you Amazon.com. By the way, when the diffuser opening was too big for the nozzle of my hair dryer, I used a needle and thread and made the opening smaller so it would fit.</li>
            <li> As the title of this review states, it&#x27;s good for travel so you don&#x27;t need to pack a big diffuser.  Do not expect to get the same performance out of this hot sock as you would a diffuser.</li>
            <li> One size does NOT fit most/all. Tried it on 2 different hair dryers and once they turn on, it blows right off. Wish there was a way to secure it on to any size nozzle. Epic Fail in my book!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and have to use a diffuser.  I bought this for travel purposes b/c it weights virtually nothing and can be flattened with no problem - pops right back into shape.  It fits virtually any size hairdryer.  Super happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Greatest way to convert hair dryer&lt;br /&gt; into diffuser for travel or home!  Great product. Should have bought several and given them as gifts!</li>
            <li> Flew right off my hairdryer</li>
            <li> It works great, just as good as an expensive diffuser. You put it on the end of any blow dryer and it fits.</li>
            <li> This diffuser did nothing for my hair. I like normal diffusers better.  Just seems like putting a sock or glove over the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work like I thought it would, didn&#x27;t help my hair get any curlier</li>
            <li> Works well and order was delivered promptly</li>
            <li> I have had a perm since 1991 and have tried many diffuser&#x27;s.  I love this one, it&lt;br /&gt;fits any dryer.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at first, then I gave it a second chance... and I have the same opinion! It&#x27;s very portable and it&#x27;s better than nothing, but that&#x27;s it... There are better diffusers on the market which you don&#x27;t have to be touching your hair.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this.  It did allow me to dry my hair, but I ended up with friz any way.</li>
            <li> Great little item.  If you use a difuser, this is so much better than the bulky hard plastic ones.  Easy to store and great for travel.  I just slip it over the dryers provided by the hotels.</li>
            <li> Work fine on my hairdryer, which didn&#x27;t come with it&#x27;s own diffuser. Gentle on my fine thin hair. Dry&#x27;s quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Great if you want natural curls</li>
            <li> Works like it said it would and handy when traveling.</li>
            <li> All you need for a diffuser ever.  Great for home or travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely cheap and I&#x27;m glad if this works for you, but it doesn&#x27;t help my curls at all. I also think it may affect the ionic tourmaline settings for my hairdryer, because my hair is frizzy after using the hot sock. I&#x27;ve been using it for many years now and this has never changed despite different hairdryers and different hair drying techniques.</li>
            <li> I will be using this to travel with when on vacation in hotels or camping to save space.  It works very well.</li>
            <li> She used the diffuser on a trip with the hair drier in the hotel.  Liked it because it worked as well as her own drier.</li>
            <li> Works really well for stretching out natural hair while blow drying when using the tension method which is what I mainly use it for and it  can works well diffusing wash and go hair styles, it does not scatter your curly do all over, but this is not a method I use much but for women who wear wash and go frequently I would quicker suggest the plastic diffuser that usually comes with some dryers</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t understand how people like this. It&#x27;s top small of a surface area to hold enough hair on top of the dryer to curl it. It&#x27;s nothing like the curling attachment that comes with the dryer.</li>
            <li> I have tried to use this several times and the smell is more than I can handle. I have tried washing, but it is still there. It smells like plastic burning. I was hoping this would work well so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to pack my huge plastic diffuser when traveling but for now I will. :(</li>
            <li> Works very well. Takes up almost no space in a drawer or suitcase. I chose this because after reading reviews it seemed the most likely to fit any hair dryer. My hair dryer is small with a short, oval-shaped barrel, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could find a diffuser to fit it.(In reviews of other diffusers that claimed to fit any dryer, people often complained that they didn&#x27;t fit their dryers.) The Hot Sock has elastic at the end and really does seem like it would fit any hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Comes in handy when traveling - easy to pack.</li>
            <li> This just didn&#x27;t work for me.  It would take forever and a day to dry my thick hair.  The couple of times I&#x27;ve tried it, it immediately made my hair frizz.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this as my last diffuser (which I bought at Wal-Mart for 1.99 several years ago), finally developed a hole in it and had to be replaced.  I put it on my blow dryer and the first thing it did when I turned my dryer on was blow off.  It was not a snug fit on my blow dryer even though my blow dryer just has a standard barrel like most blow dryers do.  So I put it back on and it blew off again.  So I got a safety pin and gathered it up and that made it a little snugger and was able to fit and stay on my barrel.  The next thing that I noticed was when it got hot it emitted a chemical smell that was so bad it almost made my eyes water.  After a few times of using it, I finally washed it with some soap and water and let it dry.  That seemed to do the trick with the smell.  The last thing is I have very long, naturally curly hair.  My hair will get &amp;#34;hung up&amp;#34; on the fabric of this diffuser and of course, pulls it off.  Unless you want to go through the frustration that I go through, I&#x27;d suggest trying to find something else.  I should have sent it back, but hated being without, so I&#x27;ll make do until I take the time to find another one.</li>
            <li> I got this item in a timely manner, no complaints about that. I used this as specified on the package and the Hot Sock almost FRIED my hair. I have very coarse, wavy hair that curls and I use a standard defuser on my hair dryer. I came upon the Hot Sock, read the reviews and thought it was worth a try. Big mistake! I am Very careful about my hair, use heat occasionally and keep it hydrated. I am so careful and I never have split ends.  My hair is past my shoulders and now I am going to have to cut about an inch or more to get rid of the damage. Very disappointing!!</li>
            <li> I have VERY THICK AND CURLY hair and this diffuser does a great job. I love that it is very light, especially since it can take up to 20 minutes to dry my hair! Its very portable too which is great since I bring it with me on vacations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years, but lost mine somewhere along the way.  So...a great substitute is a piece of cheesecloth and a rubber band.</li>
            <li> May hair was very frizzy! A total waste.</li>
            <li> This is great little diffuser that works well.  My favorite diffuser by far for my naturally curly hair.  Stores easily in my bathroom and is not bulky.  Also great for travel.  So glad Amazon carries these, and hope they will always do so.  This is the only diffuser I will ever use.</li>
            <li> This hot sock  is Inexpensive, portable, light-weight, fits all hairdryers and still does the job! What more could you ask for:)</li>
            <li> I love my hot sock!  It dries my hair quickly and keeps it from frizzing.  Easy to slide on and off hairdryer. Although I use a rubber band to keep it on tightly as the pressure blows it off otherwise.</li>
            <li> I really only bought this for travel.  I really prefer the regular diffuser where you hair lays into it.&lt;br /&gt;The big one seems to make hair fuller.  This thing smells, I don&#x27;t what the deal is with it, but&lt;br /&gt;it stinks.  Thank God its only for travel and it was cheap.</li>
            <li> This item is exactly what I need for travel, it is very compact and light in weight and functions well with all hair dryers.</li>
            <li> I went on a sailing trip and could not pack a lot in my luggage. I did pack the sock with my travel dryer. My travel dryer did not come with a diffuser. I have wavy hair and to make it super curly I diffuse my hair. I was able to recreate my curls with this sock just as I would with a regular diffuser. For those people that complained this made their hair frizzy, it&#x27;s probably because they were using high heat with their dryer (curly hair you&#x27;re supposed to use a low setting - with or without the sock). I imagine it&#x27;s the heat that makes it frizzy because I couldn&#x27;t figure out how their hair was getting &amp;#34;frizzier.&amp;#34; I had a friend who also had curly hair and she used the sock and loved it, no extra frizz!</li>
            <li> Ihad to put a rubber band around this, otherwise it just flies off my blow dryer, otherwise it works great</li>
            <li> Simple to use, easy to store and drys the hair quickly.  The hair comes out just as nice as the other expensive diffusers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly. Great for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> This works much better than the large plastic diffuser attachments! I get better curls from this product. Not only does it work better, but it works on any dryer, is super easy to store and travels really well. If you travel, take this with you! The plastic diffuser I had used to frequently fall off the dryer which was annoying. This sometimes blows off the dryer, but not very much. At first, I was concerned that this could be a fire hazard. But after over a year of use, I have found that there is no hazard at all with using this product. I have gotten rid of my other diffusers and only use this now.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is simple and excellent. This is the second one I have used, the first lasted for around 8 years. Once the original could not be used anymore, I tried drying my hair without a diffuser with poor results. The hot sock arrived very quickly and has helped make my hair less frizzy.</li>
            <li> This works well as advertised. I like what it does for my hair. It&#x27;s great for travel when you don&#x27;t want to pack a bulky dryer just because it has a diffuser on it. Or when you don&#x27;t want to pack a big plastic diffuser attachment. This takes up almost no space.</li>
            <li> Love mine. Contrary to other reviewers, mine stays on my hair dryer well. (Different sized barrel?) It delivers a gentle flow of air so as not to frizz my curls. Small, easy to navigate, unlike the big plastic orb with nozzles sticking out of the air holes. Did not take too long to dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes we think everything good has to be  high-tech. This is a good quality low-tech device. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This little hair-sock is so awesome. It works great for drying your hair &amp; keeping you natural curls. I was a bit skeptical @ first, but the 1st time I used it, it blew me away how well it works. It&#x27;s like a mini defuser without the giant hard plastic blow dryer-attachment. I highly recommend this product. You&#x27;ll be amazed :)</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great and is very compact and portable.</li>
            <li> Perfect little diffuser. Love the price and how well it works!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that frizzes easily.  Normal hard plastic diffusers (the ones that come with your dryer) usually hit my hair too hard with air, and it frizzes very fast.  Years and years ago, my Mom found a Hot Sock Diffuser at a local store and I&#x27;ve used them ever since.  I love mine and can&#x27;t live without it (well, I CAN, but my hair ends up all frizzy instead of having soft curls if i don&#x27;t use it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great concept - the &amp;#34;sock&amp;#34; portion is a thick kind of mesh-like substance and it keeps the heat and lets only a little of the air through, so I scrunch my curls while using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also so easy to pack and take on trips - it takes up virtually almost no space at all.  Because it is a soft diffuser, you can roll it, scrunch it up, flatten it, and cram it in just about any tiny spot in your luggage and it still works just fine when you need it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only diffuser I&#x27;ve used for at least the past 15 years.  (Yes, I do have those others, and from time-to-time I do give them a try, but they just aren&#x27;t as good as this one)</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed each of these products!</li>
            <li> Great..dryer is better then ever now..</li>
            <li> This product is cheap and sucks and not even worth $1. This was a waste of time and money. Lame.</li>
            <li> Best used for traveling and not wanting to bring a big diffuser.</li>
            <li> THIS. IS. AWESOME.  I bought the Hot Sock  to use when I travel.  In the past, I would always have to pack my own hairdryer with my huge diffuser attachment. Even though most places where you stay already have a hairdryer, I&#x27;d still need to bring my own since not all hair dryers are designed to fit a diffuser attachment. So I&#x27;d always need to make room in my suitcase for this big and bulky thing.  Now, I only need to scrunch up my little sock in my garment bag! :-)  It&#x27;s brilliant.  It will fit over any hairdryer nozzle. My only suggestion is to allow several inches of space between the air flow and the end of the sock to help prevent any heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;Now as for the comparison to how it works vs. using a regular big plastic diffuser....It works just the same. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It gives the exact same effect on my curly hair.  I&#x27;m just delighted with this product.  Kudos to whoever came up with this idea!! :-)</li>
            <li> This diffuser is what I was looking for but doesn&#x27;t stay on very well.  I will have to put a hairband or something to keep it on dryer.</li>
            <li> I have a blow dryer that did not come with a diffuser, so I purchased this one to avoid buying an ill fitting add on.  It is light weight, fits on all blow dryers, and does exactly what it is supposed to do.  You can&#x27;t beat it for the price.  Once my blow dryer needs repair, I will purchase a new one with a diffuser attachment and use this one for travel.</li>
            <li> Its good for travel as it is weightless.&lt;br /&gt;Its only fault is that it doesn&#x27;t have the prongs on a conventional diffuser, but with a little more effort and scrunching the hair with your fingers you can achieve the same result</li>
            <li> I wanted something compact to bring on vacation.  Worked great with the hotel blow dryer!</li>
            <li> product arrived quickly and met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what all the rave reviews were for, because I missed the fascination of this diffuser sock! All it is is a \\&quot;sock\\&quot; of sorts made of some funky fabric that fits over your hairdryer nozzle. Really? I wish I would of thought of this bogus product first! Do yourself a favor and buy a REAL diffuser!</li>
            <li> My diffuser is too big to travel with, but this one does the trick. It might not be as good as my large plastic one, but it&#x27;s cheap and won&#x27;t take up half my suitcase!</li>
            <li> I would love to rate the item on it&#x27;s quality but I never received it. I ordered it in addition to some other items that did arrive separately but, sadly, no Hot Sock. I have since cut my hair short and no longer need it.</li>
            <li> I have had this for some time and It works OK. It isn&#x27;t, IMO, as good as a regular diffuser and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for home use.  However, since hotels don&#x27;t have diffusers available,  if you need to dry your hair in a hurry it will do. I don&#x27;t generally blow dry my hair until it is halfway dry, just a few minutes to add body to my fine wavy/curly  weather dependent hair. I haven&#x27;t noticed  a lot of frizzing using this product in that manner. It doesn&#x27;t fit all blow dryers and sometimes I hold it on while drying, but someone used a rubber band which sounds like a good idea. I bought a travel dryer with a diffuser, but i still think it&#x27;s rather big and heavy,  so I use this when I travel by plane.</li>
            <li> Although it is quite portable, sadly it did not work for my hair. I have wavy hair to which I want to add curliness. This diffuser did not help do that; my big (hard-to-travel-with) plastic one works much better.</li>
            <li> seems cheap and will not stay on the hairdryer</li>
            <li> I got this to try out to see if it would be good to travel with. Unfortunately, it just made my thick medium length curly hair very frizzy. I&#x27;ll just stick with my bulky plastic diffuser.</li>
            <li> My hair has body and waves, no true curls.  I have to say that if I want the waves, I have to use a regular diffuser with the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34;, as this one doesn&amp;#34;t produce the same result.  However, this diffuser does allow me to dry my hair on a faster speed without producing too much fuzzing.  Ideal for travel as it fit at least 4 different style hairdryers I encountered.  Does blow off the longer nozzles at high speed, but not enough to be annoying.</li>
            <li> It works really good &amp; easy to travel with</li>
            <li> This thing works OK as a diffuser my thick, wavy hair. Not bad, not good, just OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Hot Sock DID succeed in MELTING MY HAIRDRYER. (Thankfully I tried it on my ancient dryer first.) I only ran the dryer on max speed for a couple minute, and when I did I smelled an odd smell. I thought it was the new Hot Sock fabric. Nope, it was the smell of my dryer cooking the plastic at the end of its nozzle. I&#x27;m going to go ahead and call this a safety hazard.</li>
            <li> Great product, perfect for travel!</li>
            <li> Overall I like this product.  It does leave my hair a little straighter and flatter than I&#x27;d prefer, but it&#x27;s better than using a hair dryer without a diffuser at all, for someone like me with coarse and wavy hair.  (I&#x27;m told I have &amp;#34;Italian hair&amp;#34;!)</li>
            <li> As a hairstylist, this is the best diffuser. It&#x27;s light, it works and fits any blow dryer! Been using hot sock for years</li>
            <li> Good quality - heavier foam than other brands so diffuses heat better; perfect for travel; depending on hair dryer may or may not stay on nozzle without holding on to it.</li>
            <li> I have long and curly hair. Unlike most curl hair my hair strands are very fine even though I have TONS of hair. I got this years ago and it lasted forever (over 3.5 years) and when it started to rip I couldn&#x27;t find them in stores anymore. Thank goodness I found them on here! I ordered 3 of them just I case I can&#x27;t find them once the next one dies.and from looking at other reviews I want to say I have never had a problem with it falling off the dryer.</li>
            <li> It came in pretty quick but was not worth it! Didn&#x27;t work and it kept falling off my blow dryer!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like this on my curls</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Use almost everyday.</li>
            <li> Had to return it, it kept catching my hair.  With curly hair the diffuser is supposed to dry it without a lot of touching which breaks the curl.  This just pulled on my hair and became annoying.</li>
            <li> Works great! It leaves my fine curly hair soft and full.  I love that I can easily travel with it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for curly hair!  It is easy to travel with and works better than the plastic attachments that cost so much more.  Genius!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product, but decided to give it a try because it was so inexpensive.  It not only works great, it fits every hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever tried it on, even my tiny little travel dryer.</li>
            <li> It is literally a sock. When I turned my drier on high, the sock got so hot I was worried it would melt. Horrible purchase.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason this has so many great reviews. I was a little doubtful of how well it would work, because... really? Just a little mesh sock you stick on the end of your blow dryer? I have tried a few types of bowl blow dryers and they all make my wavy/curly 2c hair a frizzy mess. I liked that this didn&#x27;t require any cupping or anything. So I said why not, it&#x27;s $7, might as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This is a good place to note that the shipping was quick and my product came in great condition.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to how it worked... I tried it last night and am in LOVE! I washed/conditioned then put in leave-in conditioner and mousse, then scrunched. They I blow-dried with this thing until my hair was maybe 90-95% dry (I didn&#x27;t blast my roots), put it in a low clip, did my makeup, then ran through some anti-frizz cream and voila! Beautiful soft waves that weren&#x27;t crunchy! Love love love.</li>
            <li> this thing is awesome.  so cheap, small, convenient.  can&#x27;t beat it as a diffuser.  works better than some plastic ones i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Did its job. I only use it when I travel so I hope it stays sturdy.</li>
            <li> Hot Sock Diffuser does not stay on hair dryer.  flies off even at low speed. Hard to hold on and dry hair at the same time.</li>
            <li> Just at first glance, this product is sketchy, how could a piece of foam do anything for my hair? So I went on youtube.com and found out how to use it. I figured, what the heck, I&#x27;ll order it. One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made on here! So worth the money and a cheap good product that does the job! I have very thick, wavy hair that doesn&#x27;t exactly curl. This product made my hair have lots of volume and really enhanced the waves nicely that lasted all day. I got so many compliments on my hair - I didn&#x27;t change my process, just got the hot sock! Plus, it is SO much easier to pack on the go without the bulky diffuser. A+ product!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on dryer tried using a rubber band and other things nothing worked...</li>
            <li> Compact. Easy to use on all dryers</li>
            <li> This saved me from buying a new blow dryer and it works better than a plastic defuser.</li>
            <li> It is a great buy for a diffuser. Although it slips off the barrel  if used on high. Well worth it though, especially for travel.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea as traditional diffusers are so bulky.  I bought it for traveling.  Tried it out twice before I went on vacation and the foam material stuck to my hair and pulled out most of the curls while drying.  Made my hair very frizzy.</li>
            <li> The hot sock diffuse does exactly what it is supposed to.  I have curly, frizzy hair and so the hot sock is perfect for allowing my hair to get the perfect curl.  I read other people&#x27;s reviews that it was too big for their hair dryer.  I own an old Revlon hair dryer and the hot sock fit on it perfectly.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product for the price.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use a diffuser for my hair but my hair drier is old and I couldn&#x27;t find one to fit. This was the perfect answer to my dilema. It works beautifully and when I travel I can pop it into my luggage and use it with the drier in the hotel room because it&#x27;s universal.</li>
            <li> With a short barrel dryer you may have to hold the diffuser on with a finger, but it wasn&#x27;t too hard to do this, and the air flow was good.</li>
            <li> I gave this hot sock 5 stars for several reasons.  It stays on my hair drier well, it&#x27;s priced well, I can use it easily on any drier when I travel and don&#x27;t need to bring my whole hair drier with me and it seems to work as well on my curly hair as the bigger traditional kind.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, it did nothing it was supposed to do. Would never use it again. The product did t even come close to making hair curly.</li>
            <li> I use a rubber hair-tie to keep the diffuser from slipping off my hair dryer.  When I use my hair dryer without the diffuser, it gets tangled because I just blast it and run the dryer back and forth to get it dry as fast as possible.  It doesn&#x27;t do much to eliminate frizz in my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t worsen it either like a couple of people have mentioned.  I still need to use product on both wet and dry hair to keep the pouf down and give definition.  I imagine that my hair suffers less damage with this product, though.</li>
            <li> would not stay on ....even with rubberbands....</li>
            <li> Works really well and great for travel. Better than those bulky diffusers</li>
            <li> OK, not a very practical item.</li>
            <li> Works so much better than any regular defuser . Also great for adding volume to your hair. Best defuser out there!</li>
            <li> I carry enough with me to the gym that I can&#x27;t take my own blow dryer and diffuser, especially since they have dyers at the gym.  This squishes down to nothing in my toiletry bag and works wonderfully on the standard dryers there.  It&#x27;s not as nice as the large plastic diffusers that have the little &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; on them, so I wouldn&#x27;t use this at home, but it&#x27;s great for gym bags or space-limited travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells the first week or two that you use it.  Yes, the smell does go away.</li>
            <li> Works great, awesome for packing on trips. I am very happy with my purchase and would reccomend it to anyone (plus the price is great).</li>
            <li> Fits any hair dryer, easy to store or travel with, and works great.  These last about 2 years with daily use before they start to get funny and you will want to replace them.</li>
            <li> My every-day dryer with a hard plastic diffuser went out.  I bought the Hot Sock Diffuser to use with an older dryer and realized I could use it on all of my dryers.  It works like a charm!  And, it saved me a lot of $$$.</li>
            <li> What a great invention.  I found this while trolling on Amazon and wonder what I did without it.  Just buy it!</li>
            <li> I have used this item in the past, but needed it replaced.  The original one lasted me 4 years.  You can purchase other name brands but nothing works as good as this Hot Sock.  Love it!</li>
            <li> My daughter has been looking for a diffuser that would fit on her blow dryer for a few years. She is thrilled to have finally found one,</li>
            <li> This diffuser works great and is so easy to pack for travel.  I like these sock type diffusers much better than big clunky plastic diffusers, because they&#x27;re easy to use, they fit on any blow dryer, and they leave my hair looking wavy and full.</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel.  I tried it on several hair dryers, wouldn&#x27;t stay on any one of them and blocked the air flow so much it wouldn&#x27;t dry my hair.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser! Fits my dryer perfectly! Helps dry my curly hair fast without a lot of fizz. Love it! Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This little item is a quick way to dry hair without the bulk of a plastic diffuser. A nice travel item! It does tear easily so treat it gently.</li>
            <li> Works great if you have Curly hair</li>
            <li> It dries my curls too fast it makes my hair feel dry. Maybe I am not using it properly. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought this for traveling, so i didn&#x27;t have to bring my hair dryer and diffuser for my curly hair. The first time I used it, it gave off a plastic smell, after that it works but nothing like a diffuser.. takes a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;But it does fit any hair dryer I&#x27;ve encountered so far.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair that, if I don&#x27;t use a diffuser, looks like I stuck my finger in a light socket. I also travel a lot so I&#x27;m trying to find a way to lighten my luggage so I thought I&#x27;d try this out. Definitely not for me. My hair looks worse than if I just let it air dry (this takes hours). I&#x27;ll keep looking for a solution but I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this for anyone with thicker, coarse and loose curls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I am travelling in September and wanted to just bring a small, light diffuser for my naturally curly hair to use on the dryer at the hotel. It fits the bill for that purpose. It&#x27;s not perfect, in trying to practice with it at home it regularly falls off the end of the dryer. It doesn&#x27;t have the same nice airflow that my hard plastic one has so it takes longer. But it works. It does give a more concentrated diffuse if that makes sense. Overall will be fine for lighter packing and that was what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li> I have intense naturally curly hair so a diffuser has always been necessary, but those big plastic attachments are such a hassle to deal with that I usually resorted to throwing my hair in a bun, especially when traveling. And when the plastic attachment breaks or gets lost, you&#x27;re pretty much looking at buying an entirely new hair dryer just to get the attachment. This hot sock was the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made, it slips right on to any hair dryer and works like magic. DEFINITELY recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> Terrific. Recommended by my hairdresser. Should have had one years ago.</li>
            <li> Works well but does slip off frequently.  For the price..its all good.</li>
            <li> Not the same as a hard diffuser. My hairdresser uses it with a big brush, but I can&#x27;t manage that operation like she does. Went back to my old diffuser.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because most &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; diffusers aren&#x27;t since my dryer is not round.  This could use a tighter elastic or something less &#x27;smooth&#x27; on the end because it slips off my hair dryer too easily ... but it works.</li>
            <li> Instead of the big round plastic diffuser, this is awesome. I would think if you have lots and lots of hair and you use this hot sock, it might take a while. My hair&#x27;s fine so it works for me.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite diffuser. Super portable, lasts for ages, and works perfectly. I have difficult curls (without a diffuser it just turns into frizz) and the hot sock always helps keep in the curl and keep out the frizz. Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for our European honeymoon. When packing space is at a premium, even the curly haired girl hates her diffuser! I won&#x27;t say that it worked exactly the same, but it was a much better alternative than no diffuser at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I didn&#x27;t like was the smell. And using it with very hot air made me question what sort of plastic chemicals I was heating up and inhaling. So I wouldn&#x27;t use this on a daily basis, but it&#x27;s great when you need to rely on borrowed/hotel hair dryers and need a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I use this on the dryers that are furnished to us at my gym to dry my hair after a workout.  It works great diffusing the air so I can control the direction my hair is being dried in</li>
            <li> I use this occasionally and it works great. Convenient too ,but if you will need a diffuser every day I suggest getting a real one.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time. That is the only good thing I can say. The hot sock will not even stay on my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Love this.Works great for curly hair,and especially great for travel. No more large, bulky diffusers.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair less curly and more frizzy!! Also drying hair now takes FOREVER!! I&#x27;m not impressed at all. Good thing it&#x27;s cheap and light weight. Maybe I will use it when I travel....or maybe not.... Anyway I think its useless.... :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hot sock for about a year now.  It still is working great.  I have natural curl but it&#x27;s spotty so I also have a perm which has left my hair pretty curly.  When I use the dryer without the diffuser, my hair becomes straight in spots and fuzzy in other places.  This gives me really nice curls all over without the frizzy hot mess it could be.</li>
            <li> This is great--exactly what I have been looking for.  I wish the elastic opening was stronger as it does blow off once or twice during each use.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many Hot Socks but this one seemed to be poorly constructed.  It fell apart after one month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a diffuser light enough for my 10 yr old to hold up with her hair dryer...perfect solution. Just the right amount of warm air to allow curls to curl and no weight added at all.  She can dry her own hair now :)</li>
            <li> I finally found a diffuser I can travel with!!! I am a curly hair girl that always has to travel with her own hairdryer and diffuser.  Not anymore!  This fun sock fits on most of the hotel hairdryers so I just leave it in my suitcase and it makes my life sooo much easier!  Great invention!!!</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ll stick to using my hard nozzle attachment at home (I like the effect from the &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34;), this works EXTREMELY well for travel! It packs flat, taking up no real weight or room. It fits snuggly and well on any hair dryer model nozzle.  It definitely diffuses the heat well to maintain a curly style without causing frizz. If I lose or damaged mine, I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Actually does work pretty well.  Used it on vacation and was pleased that it could be used on all the hotel hair dryers, and so easy to pack.</li>
            <li> works great and is not bulky and heavy like other diffusers. Also, it fits all dryers so you don&#x27;t have to wonder if it will work with yours.</li>
            <li> So much better than plastic bulky diffusers</li>
            <li> Love it.  Very handy.</li>
            <li> Lets just the right amount of air through.  Light. Flexible. Packable.</li>
            <li> It works okay. It gives off a funny smell when I use it. So I haven&#x27;t used it a lot.</li>
            <li> Love it! So much easier than regular diffuser. Light weight, easy to store and pack. Works great. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and if I am going to blow dry, a diffuser is a must!  I was a little skeptical at first, but for the price I had to try it since my diffuser was on its last leg.  The Hot Sock works perfectly and I will never go back to plastic again!  In my opinion, it diffuses the heat/air better than the plastic ones.  Being able to travel with it is just an added bonus and would be worth the money all in itself.  I have only been using it for a month and my only concern is the elastic band wearing out over time from the heat of the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to the crappy plastic diffuser that I already have and this is not it.  Pretty much no noticeable different in air flow with or without this on my blow dryer.  Returning.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for years. great for traveling too. works really well. wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
            <li> I got it for a recent trip, &amp; fortunately, my hotel had a good hair dryer with a regular diffuser. The Hot Sock diffuser has a strong chemical smell that didn&#x27;t go away after washing it.  Maybe if I use it a lot that smell will go away, but I probably won&#x27;t use it - I&#x27;m just wondering what icky chemicals I&#x27;m breathing when using it.</li>
