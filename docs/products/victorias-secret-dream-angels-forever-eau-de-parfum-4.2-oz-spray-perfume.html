            <li> I&#x27;m tempted to stock up on these because I will be so sad if there comes a day I can&#x27;t purchase it anymore!</li>

            <li> This is my favorite perfume and I have been using it for years! Victoria&#x27;s Secret doesn&#x27;t sell this perfume anymore, so I am so thankful for Amazon!!</li>
            <li> It was awful.  It was old and smell like rubbing alcohol.  I threw it away because I had already thrown away labels. I am so disappointed! I don&#x27;t want to check any stars!</li>
            <li> Given as a gift to granddaughter</li>
            <li> Very confused why Christy said that it was a little over priced because about 2 years ago i bought this perfume at Victorias Secret and it was only 1 oz for about $42, and this is 4.2 oz for like half the price. But anyways, i bought this perfume and it smells amazing just like the one i bought 2 years ago. It also arrived only after 3 days after i ordered it!  Its my favorite one and I&#x27;m about to order another one but this one will be for my mom&#x27;s birthday</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Fast shipping.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Excelente product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Excelent product and excelent seller! I recommend him!!</li>
            <li> packaging looks fine but the perfume is definitely not a real. the bottle is different from the original that was sold by Victoria&#x27;s Secret and the scent isn&#x27;t nearly as good. I&#x27;m disappointed. I was worried about buying a dupe.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s absolute favorite. I&#x27;m very pleased I found it on Amazon as its been discontinued at Victoria a secret.</li>
            <li> the item was as expected and the packaging was great</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  I get compliments all the time.  So glad to find it here on amazon.com - great price  for a perfume you can&#x27;t find anymore at Victoria Secret.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume of all time. It smells so good and I never fail to get complimented on the scent whenever I wear it. Also my boyfriend loves it. This is the third bottle I&#x27;ve purchased already. I was so disappointed when they stopped selling it at the Victoria&#x27;s Secret store. I mean it&#x27;s called Forever for goodness sake, lol how are they going to stop selling it? So a very sad me decided I had to find it and so I searched online for anywhere they might have it and, Amazon to the rescue. Not only could I have it shipped to me, but the price was lower that what I had paid when buying it from the store! What a great win. I&#x27;m tempted to stock up on these because I will be so sad if there comes a day I can&#x27;t purchase it anymore! This is a large bottle that comes brand new in the package. It is packaged and sealed exactly the same as when you purchase it from the store. I wish I could give this perfume 10 stars because it is so perfect and wonderful.</li>
            <li> Great Scent, and a lot cheaper on amazon!</li>
            <li> Great girlfriend loved it</li>
            <li> A little high priced but worth it for getting my favorite perfume that is no longer sold in stores :(</li>
