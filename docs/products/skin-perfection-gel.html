            <li>I think this is a very good product to use when just heading out the door mid-day.  </li>
            <li>Worn under makeup, it does a great job of smoothing the skin.  </li>
            <li>great primer...</li>
            <li>If you have oily, scarred, or problem skin you won&#x27;t get good coverage.</li>
            <li>I saw this item on QVC and it looked like it was really good.</li>
            <li>It will not transfer and is actually good for your skin so it can be slept in -</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I have used Clarins tinted moisturizer for years, which is very good, but like this better since it is oil free.</li>

            <li>OK -</li>
            <li>I do love the way it feels but it does not do ANYTHING to cover up anything on my face.</li>
            <li>I need more</li>
            <li>If you need more coverage, there is also the Perfekt Skin perfection conceal.</li>
            <li>I love this Product.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of the gel during and after application.</li>
            <li>I love this product :)</li>
            <li>love this as it gives me a glow</li>
            <li>I asked the lady if this products will break me out and make me even more oily.</li>
            <li>I told her it was okay</li>
            <li>The best make up I have ever purchased goes on so smooth and even and makes your skin feel so soft</li>
            <li>I LOVE PERFEKT products.  </li>
            <li>I really love the cheek color</li>
            <li>Great for covering up mild rosacea &amp; in summer so my face won&#x27;t shine (we have very high humidity).  </li>
            <li>It promises to blend easily and it does.</li>
            <li>If you want to save time and money...this is Prefekt.&lt;br /&gt;It easy to apply and and you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It has a silky smooth finish and for me it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>This is all I need to keep my skin smooth and even.</li>
            <li>It is quite light.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so smooth.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you use the right color, too.  </li>
            <li>Overall perfect new discovery for me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used over an almost white primer and the results are just wow - flawless.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good product for people who do not like to wear heavy foundation.  </li>
            <li>For evening, I wear a true foundation over my Perfekt skin gel.  </li>
            <li>You must try this if you want natural coverage, with great skin care and super soft skin.  </li>
            <li>I have cleared up tremendously and will not ouch as this product again.</li>
            <li>I do like the new application method much better.</li>
            <li>But you sure as heck can find a (just as good) primer for a third or fourth of the cost of this product.</li>
            <li>I have generally good skin, normal to dry, on the pale or sallow side, occasional patches of dermatitis in my T zone, so this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I got a sample in a fragrance purchase and loved the way it smoothed on with just a little color, leaves a silky feel to the complexion.</li>
            <li>to my original review***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted their customer service department and they said they&#x27;d send me a new product because my packaging fell apart, I just needed to send them my address.  </li>
            <li>If you need zit coverage, use the conceal first, then layer the Skin Perfection Gel over it.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought It was my hormones that changed or because I stopped taking a certain medication.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this a few times and the product is great for my skin in the summer, when I want minimal coverage.  </li>
            <li>so I twist the top off and get every last application I can - use a long Qtip.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be surprised how refreshed you look in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Makes your makeup go on seamlessly; large but not bulky bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I&#x27;m happy with the product, the packaging is consistently bad.  </li>
            <li>This is not a heavy foundation but can be built up for extra coverage if needed.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so the price is not bad considering.</li>
            <li>, I WILL NEVER BE WITHOUT IT and always keep an extra on hand since you can&#x27;t really see when the tube is close to empty.  </li>
            <li>She then proceeded to tell me she had been breaking out as well, but thought it was because she has dry sensitive skin and that maybe the makeup just didn&#x27;t agree with her.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really love this product. The only problem I found is on occasion the pump won&#x27;t work. If it always worked I would have given this 5 stars</li>
            <li> Did not like it. No coverage</li>
            <li> I love this product. I got a sample in a fragrance purchase and loved the way it smoothed on with just a little color, leaves a silky feel to the complexion. I checked out all the ingredients and there is nothing worrisome compared with some makeups. I have generally good skin, normal to dry, on the pale or sallow side, occasional patches of dermatitis in my T zone, so this is perfect for me. Gives a nice glow. If you have oily, scarred, or problem skin you won&#x27;t get good coverage. This is a tinted moisturizer-type cover. I have used Clarins tinted moisturizer for years, which is very good, but like this better since it is oil free. The oil tends to cause the dermatitis. A little goes a long way, so the price is not bad considering.</li>
            <li> OK - BUT PRICEY - WILL NOT REORDER</li>
            <li> I saw this item on QVC and it looked like it was really good. So I bought it. I do love the way it feels but it does not do ANYTHING to cover up anything on my face. I dont use it anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this a few times and the product is great for my skin in the summer, when I want minimal coverage.  It doesn&#x27;t work well for me in the winter, though - I need more coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m happy with the product, the packaging is consistently bad.  The applicator falls apart, the pump breaks, the nozzle falls off.  The last time I bought it, the pump broke and the product dried out to an unusable state.  It was rubbery and I couldn&#x27;t get it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame for such an expensive product that they can&#x27;t improve the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update to my original review***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted their customer service department and they said they&#x27;d send me a new product because my packaging fell apart, I just needed to send them my address.  A year later they still haven&#x27;t sent anything and haven&#x27;t responded to my phone calls and emails.  Bad customer service for an expensive product.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for people who do not like to wear heavy foundation.  It has a silky smooth finish and for me it lasts all day.  If you need more coverage, there is also the Perfekt Skin perfection conceal. If you need zit coverage, use the conceal first, then layer the Skin Perfection Gel over it.  You do not need to use a lot of the gel as the product does blend and match with your skin tone.  Make sure you use the right color, too.  I use the radiant as I have olive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. This is all I need to keep my skin smooth and even. I love this Product.</li>
            <li> Perfekt is the smoothest, silkiest stuff.  Worn under makeup, it does a great job of smoothing the skin.  For a casual day, it can be worn by itself.</li>
            <li> Great for covering up mild rosacea &amp; in summer so my face won&#x27;t shine (we have very high humidity).  Product is not cheap so I twist the top off and get every last application I can - use a long Qtip.  I also use it sparingly in addition to a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I think this is a very good product to use when just heading out the door mid-day.  For evening, I wear a true foundation over my Perfekt skin gel.  I love the feel of the gel during and after application.</li>
            <li> great primer... But that&#x27;s it. No coverage at all.. And it smells like paint thinner. If u have $50 to blow on a primer buy this... But you sure as heck can find a (just as good) primer for a third or fourth of the cost of this product. Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> It promises to make my skin look airbrushed and reduce the appearance of redness. It does neither. My skin around my nose still looks red. It promises to blend easily and it does. I don&#x27;t feel like I have anything on my skin. It is quite light.  No scent, no oils. But I cannot discern any difference to the appearance or quality of my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It makes my skin feel so smooth.  I feel like I&#x27;ve had it air brushed on.  And a little does go along way.</li>
            <li> Perfection! I love this product :)</li>
            <li> Tip came off so could no longer pump out - for that price, its totally not worth it if you can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> love this as it gives me a glow</li>
            <li> My friend and I bought this product after a lady demonstrated it on the both of us. I have oily skin and I am prone to breakouts.  I asked the lady if this products will break me out and make me even more oily. She assured me that it won&#x27;t do neither. When I tried wearing the product at home it did not cover anything and only help reduce redness just a little. After 2 weeks of wearing it I began to have really bad breakouts. I haven&#x27;t broke out this badly in years. At first I thought It was my hormones that changed or because I stopped taking a certain medication. Then my friend asked me how I like the makeup. I told her it was okay but that I had been breaking out a lot and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the make up or something else. She then proceeded to tell me she had been breaking out as well, but thought it was because she has dry sensitive skin and that maybe the makeup just didn&#x27;t agree with her. I have stopped using this product for 2 days now and I have already seen a difference in my skin. I have cleared up tremendously and will not ouch as this product again.</li>
            <li> The best make up I have ever purchased goes on so smooth and even and makes your skin feel so soft</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get all the hype surrounding this primer. It really didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I recommend Urban Decay or Too Faced primer instead.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best primer out there. Several shades (and translucent) for every skin tone. Makes your makeup go on seamlessly; large but not bulky bottle will last a long time. Overall perfect new discovery for me!</li>
            <li> If you want to save time and money...this is Prefekt.&lt;br /&gt;It easy to apply and and you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;This gel like foundation sets to power once it&#x27;s applied&lt;br /&gt;and it&#x27;s waterproof!</li>
            <li> You must try this if you want natural coverage, with great skin care and super soft skin.  Simply amazing product.  This is not a heavy foundation but can be built up for extra coverage if needed.  It will not transfer and is actually good for your skin so it can be slept in - you&#x27;ll be surprised how refreshed you look in the morning.  I&#x27;ve used over an almost white primer and the results are just wow - flawless.  Gives my airbrush some competition !</li>
            <li> I LOVE PERFEKT products.  I have been using them for many years and have been very pleased with all the items in this line.  I really love the cheek color, I WILL NEVER BE WITHOUT IT and always keep an extra on hand since you can&#x27;t really see when the tube is close to empty.  I do like the new application method much better.</li>
