            <li>really good came in little time love the smell!!!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t exactly smell as good as I thought.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a present for my girlfriend, she liked a lot and besides that smells great</li>
            <li>and I was lucky because it had a great price and fast shipping.</li>

            <li>Exactly what I ordered!!</li>
            <li>The perfume is lovely but your service is out of this world!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much for all you do.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a unique fragrance.</li>
            <li>Sweet and gentle :-)</li>
            <li>Wow, what kind of perfume do you use?</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a subdued scent, very versatile and elegant; works well for day and night.</li>
            <li>My wife loved this present</li>
            <li>- wow!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a wonderful perfume - subtle, feminine - a new love.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice perfume - wonderful scent, pretty bottle, very luxurious, especially because it is hard to find in our local stores.  </li>
            <li>When I initially spray it, it smells very nice; however,  shortly after I can&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
            <li>you pretty much have to wash it off!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>It makes you feel pretty.</li>
            <li>Everyone asks what I&#x27;m wearing plus my man really digs it!</li>
            <li>OMG, love it, have been wearing the same perfume for 20+ years till now.....</li>
            <li>I tried it at my local Macys and loved it, but when I bought the bottle and had it home it smelled a bit different.</li>
            <li>But then when we tried to buy it it was not available in any good store, we where looking for it in several cities when we traveled, then it occurred to me that it may be available at amazon</li>
            <li>Not the real thing,  </li>
            <li>, i highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>The smell lasts all day and never loses it effect</li>
            <li>This perfume is new and I smelled it in my Glamour magazine on a sample.  </li>
            <li>I find it to be very soft and feminine.</li>
            <li>I ordered the smaller size at first to see how I would like it.  </li>
            <li>Very dissapointed and wishing I could get my money back.</li>
            <li>Normally I can&#x27;t get through a single bottle of anything.</li>

            <li> When I initially spray it, it smells very nice; however,  shortly after I can&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> Comments I get with this fragrance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- How can you smell so good?&lt;br /&gt;- Wow, what kind of perfume do you use? Smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough? :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a subdued scent, very versatile and elegant; works well for day and night.</li>

            <li> Thank you so much! This scent is simply wonderful and not too strong at all. Would purchase this perfume again.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance! Sweet and gentle :-)</li>
            <li> Just wonderful!! I love it. It makes you feel pretty. Everyone asks what I&#x27;m wearing plus my man really digs it!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, and so does everyone she works with. Great price</li>
            <li> amazing scent, is persisting and very lovely, i got many compliments for it, not to mention the price was great</li>
            <li> I would recommend trying this scent out at your local mall before purchasing. Scents are so different on every person. I tried it at my local Macys and loved it, but when I bought the bottle and had it home it smelled a bit different. Not in a bad way, but different. A lot affects the way scents smell, but this is a beautiful scent worth purchasing!</li>
            <li> No complaints. Exactly what I ordered!! The aroma is subtle yet powerful. My husband loves it.  Will get more when this runs out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve set my heart on Signorina for a while, and when I saw it on Amazon for under $60 - wow!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a wonderful perfume - subtle, feminine - a new love.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice perfume - wonderful scent, pretty bottle, very luxurious, especially because it is hard to find in our local stores.  I only gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t think it lasts as long on the skin as I would have hoped.  Next time I am going to buy Signorina Eleganza!</li>
            <li> The perfume is lovely but your service is out of this world!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much for all you do.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my girlfriend, she liked a lot and besides that smells great, i highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, alluring and captivating fragrance that I fell in love with.  I ordered the smaller size at first to see how I would like it.  I immediately ordered the larger size when I smelled it.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Great... thanks.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> This is an amazing smell. Keep in mind it is very tiny. I purchased the 3.4 oz and got this to throw in my purse.</li>
            <li> My wife loved this present AND I FELL IN LOVE AGAIN AND AGAIN WHEN SHE WEAR THIS FRAGRANCE!</li>
            <li> My wife loves the smell ever since she tried it. But then when we tried to buy it it was not available in any good store, we where looking for it in several cities when we traveled, then it occurred to me that it may be available at amazon and I was lucky because it had a great price and fast shipping. It was a great gift and my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> My wife asked for this after &#x27;smelling&#x27; it in a magazine ad.  It&#x27;s an incredible perfume. Soft and pleasant.  Not overbearing.  Gives me yet another reason to get close...</li>
            <li> Love it! I have been waiting for this perfume for a month now, and I am happily pleased. The service was excellent, too.</li>
            <li> Package was perfect. The perfume arrived in perfect shape and I saved a lot of money. Thank you</li>
            <li> OMG, love it, have been wearing the same perfume for 20+ years till now.....</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchase this perfume. I find it to be very soft and feminine. Some people might say that it doesn&#x27;t last the entire day, however, I beg to differ. This is definitely a perfume I&#x27;d continue to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t exactly smell as good as I thought. Will use this bottle but probably will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great product; great service!</li>
            <li> Not the real thing,  thats all I have to say!</li>
            <li> Very, very, very, very subtle and short lasting. Very disappointing for a major brand. More like a drugstore brand...cant return</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume and, just like all of the other reviews have stated, it does not last at all. It smells great but it doesn&#x27;t last, not even for an hour. Very dissapointed and wishing I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> Best price on Amazon. Double the size and almost half the price! This is my 3rd bottle of this perfume. Normally I can&#x27;t get through a single bottle of anything.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a unique fragrance. It&#x27;s both musky and citrusy, with faint hints of lime and---dare I say?--margaritas. Amazingly, though, I don&#x27;t hate it. It&#x27;s just not for me. I suggest you try before you buy.</li>
