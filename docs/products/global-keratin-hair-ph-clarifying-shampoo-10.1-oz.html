            <li> 0 stars if it was possible</li>
            <li> Great product! loved it!!</li>
            <li> this shampoo actually clarify your hair from everything and you will feel it. delivery was fast and in a good condition.</li>
            <li> My packaging looks as though it has been tampered with. I&#x27;m very nervous to use this because the safety seal looks like it&#x27;s been opened aleady. Probably will be returned.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much! I love the product and I got it in 1day!</li>
            <li> It does what it says, completely cleans your hair pre-keratin treatment.  Only gripe is that next you&#x27;re supposed to comb through your hair and this has no detangling capabilities. Not of a struggle if you have curly hair!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for a client. She had a hard time finding it locally so I bought it for her. Her hair came out beautiful. The smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to apply and the results amazing. I am finally free from the hair salon as I can do it myself and save a lot of money! All You need is the combo, clarifying shampoo + the best keratin treatment and Voila: You are blonde and beautiful! I recommend!</li>
            <li> Works very well and smells good,</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product. I wish I would have found it sooner. Makes my African American hair shine brilliantly. Arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Hair clarifier does its job.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this product for me.  It came wrapped in plastic as of its new.  Once I opened it and took the cap off the seal looks as if it&#x27;s been cut open with a small knife.  Slit right down the center and easy to peel back.  Makes me wonder if this is the real product.  Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have time to return it as I have an appointment with my client first thing in the morning.  I hope it works because I don&#x27;t trust that this is genuine product!</li>
            <li> Global Keratin was the first keratin  treatment that I tried. I started going to Dominican hair salons and they use a different product. Their keratin products didn&#x27;t work for me as well. I ordered Global from Amazon and my daughter and I put the treatment in my hair. It came out perfect and I didn&#x27;t pay $250. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Product more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product beyond description&lt;br /&gt;I advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it personally&lt;br /&gt;I am very wonderful wonderful performance&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I needed it to prepare for my keratin treatment. Better price than trying to get it through a salon.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other clarifying shampoos so I have nothing to compare it to but it really does the job.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t use it. got the wrong one.</li>
