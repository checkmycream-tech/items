            <li>and she was quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li>and has a really nice light smell to it.</li>

            <li>Most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t build up!</li>
            <li>Simply the best!!!!</li>
            <li>so I decided to buy this since it was the cheapest styler in walmart at the time (around $8).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try more products from this line I seem to be having pretty good luck with them.</li>
            <li>keeps curls really well, pleasant but not lingering smell.</li>
            <li>Great curl for natural hair</li>
            <li>the curls stayed for a whole week and it smells good.</li>
            <li>Great  on all hair types, soft smooth curls</li>
            <li>It makes the process alot easy for attempting to define 4 c hair.</li>
            <li>Made the purchase to go home and try, honestly I have NEVER said  about any other product ( even those I thought was great)</li>
            <li>and I have type 4b fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It is light and does a good job of holding the natural curl of my hair.</li>
            <li>but i like this product because it is light and has no greasy build up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, and SMELLS FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>it leaves my natural hair nice shiny and moist and most of all</li>
            <li>It smells light, and fresh, and i just love it.</li>
            <li>This has been such an amazing find for me!</li>
            <li>It also has a clean &amp; citrusy scent which I like.</li>
            <li>product on the market Murray&#x27;s, Full of Waves, Sportn&#x27; Waves, 360 Waves............</li>
            <li>etc ( all of these products mentioned are full of petroleum, lanolin &amp; perfume)</li>
            <li>The seller got the product to me quickly and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li>her hair type is 3b curly spirally with her crown part being the most unruly with a more coarse texture.</li>
            <li>She had found it in Target, love it of course, went back to get more</li>
            <li>I apply the curl sealer all over my freshly washed and detangled hair and let it sit for about 7 or 8 mins.</li>
            <li>Lo and behold, my hair got really soft and I was able to pull a comb through it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, I was referred to it on instragram from a natural hair page.</li>
            <li>Just right amount of hold for your curls.  </li>
            <li>While I still think that I prefer Eco gel a little better, this is a good companion product to the Taliah curl cr√®me that I regularly buy and use.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair first, condition, spray the Protective Mist Bodifier and then set angle with a denman brush.</li>
            <li>I cant get enough of it will be buying more.</li>
            <li>curly, wavy, coarse,  nappy, &amp; straight Seems like the more</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m sure it would last much longer if I tied my hair up at night or used a silk pillowcase</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product I put too much on my hair...</li>
            <li>It can be used daily which is a blessing and is so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>to me it is what makes this product so unusual.</li>
            <li>Both worked really well.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, no build up on hair like other products.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did because this gives you a soft hold &amp; my wng still had those soft curls the next day.</li>
            <li>I like this stuff, although i didn&#x27;t realize it was mainly for ethnic hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing the natural hair thing for about a year and after much trial and error</li>
            <li>Initially, I was using the pink eco styler which actually works pretty good, but I&#x27;m not a big fan of using a lot of gel &amp; I&#x27;m also not a fan of the crunch in my hair either,  </li>
            <li>I am of negro decent and my hair is now natural.</li>
            <li>On to a new product that will keep my hair soft.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a product that gives me good definition once my hair is dry</li>
            <li>but I ended up with soft, cottony hair.</li>
            <li>My household can never be without this product for the moisture it provides to natural hair.  </li>
            <li>Your natural hair will shine and flow.</li>
            <li>but it completely dries out my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft.</li>
            <li>but my next purchase will be from amazon because i really like the product.</li>
            <li>it would damage her hair texture completely.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone with natural hair.</li>
            <li>Hair was soft and not crunchy and it did seal in the moisture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been  natural almost two weeks after transitioning eight months &amp; have been rocking a wash n</li>
            <li>i am surprised no other customer mentioned that about the product.</li>
            <li>i also like that it is for natural hair because i use this on my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair because she is way too young for the flat iron over and over her hair.</li>
            <li>I live outside the US</li>
            <li>I have hair that is wild and curly - similar to wild mint in growth.</li>
            <li>My history with waves go waaaay back to the old Ultra Wave \\&quot;lye\\&quot; process days!  </li>
            <li>It works really well on wet hair.</li>
            <li>I order this product regularly cause I like the way it helps me manage ethnic hair, from kinky to loose curls, keeps much needed moisture in...</li>
            <li>It defines the natural curl pattern, holds the definition one the hair dries, the hair is shiny and the product lasts a long time.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s really hard for me to even show off my natural waves because my hair is so damaged by coloring, this actually helped bring out my natural waves a lot.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that take forever to dry.but</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I took so long to find this product.</li>
            <li> This was for my sister who has long curly hair.</li>
            <li> so many black hair products have an lousy scent to it.</li>
            <li> This product takes a while to dry</li>
            <li> When it does dry my  OCEAN waves be SHINNING like STARS!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I let air dry.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit to dry even after sitting under hair dryer for 10 mins.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more than difficult and it&#x27;s not fine in texture.</li>
            <li> way tooo much product (at least for me), use one or the other.</li>
            <li> It came half open and leaked some of the contents.</li>
            <li> So far it doesn&#x27;t seem to build up or flake or make the hair overly hard.  </li>
            <li> but I like the wet look effect it gives before it dries.</li>
            <li> I use this product to twist my hair while wet</li>
            <li> so it spilled out (not a whole lot)</li>
            <li> but the next day when my hair dried it felt crunchy and brittle.</li>
            <li> I use this product after co-washing and applying Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie to soaking wet hair.</li>
            <li> I am white, and have just plain wavy hair.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> watch out a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, hard, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> There are other products I thought was the one.</li>
            <li> This product moisturizes my curls without leaving them greasy and it doesn&#x27;t weigh them down.</li>
            <li> Check out my blog for a full review:  [...]</li>
            <li> Because i use this product everyday.  </li>
            <li> Apply a little to small sections of your hair and twirl that section, let sit for a few minutes then undue the twirl.  </li>
            <li> Makes my 4C hair hard; however my daughter loves the product.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels soft....and no more frizz!</li>
            <li> The humidity on the East Coast has been BRUTAL the last couple of days but this sealer has kept my hair on point  through it all!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it was tedious</li>
            <li> Disappointing product.</li>
            <li> This product did what I thought Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie PROMISED to do  but FAILED!</li>
            <li> I have the WORST hard to hold  combination hair.....</li>
            <li> /&gt; Even though Curl Sealer does not hold your hair like a brick it still withstands the worst humidity and keeps my hair in place.  </li>

            <li> Wonderful product for natural hair that is not chemically treated.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for natural hair. Not sticky or flaky.</li>
            <li> I first used the Curl Cream which is a VERY GOOD product with IMPRESSIVE results  but when I tried the Curl Sealer I was TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY  This product did what I thought Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie PROMISED to do  but FAILED! This product takes a while to dry but I like the wet look effect it gives before it dries. When it does dry my  OCEAN waves be SHINNING like STARS!&lt;br /&gt; Even though Curl Sealer does not hold your hair like a brick it still withstands the worst humidity and keeps my hair in place.  The humidity on the East Coast has been BRUTAL the last couple of days but this sealer has kept my hair on point  through it all!&lt;br /&gt;  I have the WORST hard to hold  combination hair.....EVER! curly, wavy, coarse,  nappy, &amp; straight Seems like the more I use this the wavier and CONTROLED my wave pattern becomes! My history with waves go waaaay back to the old Ultra Wave \\&quot;lye\\&quot; process days!  I have  used every wave  product on the market Murray&#x27;s, Full of Waves, Sportn&#x27; Waves, 360 Waves............etc ( all of these products mentioned are full of petroleum, lanolin &amp; perfume) Waajid Curl Sealer is the HOLY GRAIL my hair has been praying for!</li>
            <li> Great, Fantastic product.  I am of negro decent and my hair is now natural. I use this product to twist my hair while wet and it works amazingly well for me; keeps curls really well, pleasant but not lingering smell. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing the natural hair thing for about a year and after much trial and error this is a product that I&#x27;ll be keeping as a part of my regimen. I have a TWA and I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a product that gives me good definition once my hair is dry but this product lasts days. And I&#x27;m sure it would last much longer if I tied my hair up at night or used a silk pillowcase but I&#x27;m not that kind of girl. I wash my hair first, condition, spray the Protective Mist Bodifier and then set angle with a denman brush. I apply the curl sealer all over my freshly washed and detangled hair and let it sit for about 7 or 8 mins. Then I section and finger curl all over into spirals. Takes about 30 mins. Then I let air dry. Pull the curls apart and Voila!!</li>
            <li> I sooooo love this product.....it leaves my natural hair nice shiny and moist and most of all it don&#x27;t leave my hair flakey....I love all their products....love love love</li>
            <li> Thisis the best natural hair product that I have ever used.  Finally found what I was looking for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have dry, hard, coarse hair.  I have tried a lot of products that people recommend to moisturize my hair.  I don&#x27;t know what made me select the curl sealer out of the entire product line but I am so glad I did.  I went home and started applying it to sections of my hair but it was tedious and I decided to rub the product over my hair.  I honestly did not think it was going to work.  Lo and behold, my hair got really soft and I was able to pull a comb through it.  I have type 4c hair.  I find that this product worked well to soften my hair.  I don&#x27;t have (well-defined) curly hair but I ended up with soft, cottony hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my hair and my curls - it keeps the look longer than without. Just wish there was more of it! A little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Makes my 4C hair hard; however my daughter loves the product.  She states that it keeps her 4A curls in shape &amp; she does not have the frizz.  Great product for her hair, but not mine.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I was referred to it on instragram from a natural hair page. I loved how polished her curls looked and I decided upon her review to try it myself and I am SO happy I did. This makes my twistouts pop and the curls are beautiful I had never heard of this brand before, but it&#x27;ll be a staple in my house now.</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this by total mistake pondered over it in store for 20 minutes. Made the purchase to go home and try, honestly I have NEVER said  about any other product ( even those I thought was great) This is awesome. Love it. There are other products I thought was the one. Until I tried this one. The detangler and curl sealer I have long hair that take forever to dry.but once it did with product looked Moisterized and curls on fleek.</li>
            <li> While I still think that I prefer Eco gel a little better, this is a good companion product to the Taliah curl cr√®me that I regularly buy and use. So far it doesn&#x27;t seem to build up or flake or make the hair overly hard.  The seller got the product to me quickly and it was packaged well. I&#x27;m going to try more products from this line I seem to be having pretty good luck with them.</li>
            <li> Im impresed with this product. the curls stayed for a whole week and it smells good. definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> Works great with kinky curls. Just wish it had a better sent to it.</li>
            <li> Disappointing product. I try to avoid wasting money, but I got hooked after reading a glowing review. This product didn&#x27;t hold curls, nor did it offer stretch or moisture. I ended up tossing it out because I knew I wouldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> Great  on all hair types, soft smooth curls no frizz, or hardness. Best curly hair gel I have found. In love.</li>
            <li> Besides the fact the lid was not all the way sealed when I received it so it spilled out (not a whole lot)... It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> My household can never be without this product for the moisture it provides to natural hair.  We use it specifically for two strand twists.</li>
            <li> This is a MUST have for defining 4c hair! It makes the process alot easy for attempting to define 4 c hair. This is a must buy! Check out my blog for a full review:  [...]</li>
            <li> Because i use this product everyday.  I love it....it makes my curls look so good. My hair feels soft....and no more frizz!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, no build up on hair like other products. Product is very light based. It&#x27;s so amazing how to conditions the hair n how it revitalizes the curls instantly. One of the best products I have used for a 4c kinky curly hair</li>
            <li> This is a great for hold with zero build up. I would like to see the price under $9.00 however.</li>
            <li> Great curl for natural hair</li>
            <li> Although this is not what I meant to order, it is a really nice product. It is light and does a good job of holding the natural curl of my hair.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Took a longer time to receive than anticipated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok product, it did stretch my hair as a wash and go but the next day when my hair dried it felt crunchy and brittle.</li>
            <li> Just right amount of hold for your curls.  Apply a little to small sections of your hair and twirl that section, let sit for a few minutes then undue the twirl.  Your natural hair will shine and flow.</li>
            <li> I like that it does define my curls well but it completely dries out my hair. On to a new product that will keep my hair soft.</li>
            <li> My My My... I love this product it holds my twist out so well. My hair is soft. I cant get enough of it will be buying more. Now I see what the rave is it a great product.</li>
            <li> This product is like magic! It defines the natural curl pattern, holds the definition one the hair dries, the hair is shiny and the product lasts a long time. Just spritz it with water the next day and reactivate the product. I can&#x27;t believe that I took so long to find this product. It give me the versatility for wash and go styles. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product. Bought it for my niece and her daughter and she was quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It came half open and leaked some of the contents.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from a drug store. but my next purchase will be from amazon because i really like the product. i also like that it is for natural hair because i use this on my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair because she is way too young for the flat iron over and over her hair. her hair type is 3b curly spirally with her crown part being the most unruly with a more coarse texture. but i feel her hair is&#x27;nt coarse enough for a relaxer it would damage her hair texture completely. but i like this product because it is light and has no greasy build up. and has a really nice light smell to it. i am surprised no other customer mentioned that about the product. to me it is what makes this product so unusual. so many black hair products have an lousy scent to it. this is so nice and has no greasy build up it&#x27;s a great buy. i did not give 5 stars because i did notice her hair start to frizz up towards the end of the day and i had to touch it up again. but than again that was the crown area. so whatever it&#x27;s still a great product to me.</li>
            <li> very smooth creamy not drying gel with no hardness to my hairr</li>
            <li> Perfect for my hair type. I would recommend this product to anyone with natural hair. It works really well on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Like the product and I have type 4b fine hair.  The first time I used this product I put too much on my hair...watch out a little goes a long way.  Hair was soft and not crunchy and it did seal in the moisture. I would NOT use the sealer and the pudding...way tooo much product (at least for me), use one or the other. Would re-order this product.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff, although i didn&#x27;t realize it was mainly for ethnic hair. I am white, and have just plain wavy hair. It&#x27;s really hard for me to even show off my natural waves because my hair is so damaged by coloring, this actually helped bring out my natural waves a lot. It&#x27;s light, and SMELLS FANTASTIC. I love the smell of this stuff, i want to smell it all day! It smells light, and fresh, and i just love it.</li>
            <li> I use this product after co-washing and applying Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie to soaking wet hair. I have tried many products but this is what works for me and my hair. It takes a bit to dry even after sitting under hair dryer for 10 mins. I live outside the US currently so I order from Amazon but I hope it&#x27;s cheaper in the states so I can stock up.</li>
            <li> This has been such an amazing find for me! This product works so well on my hair. It makes my curls look perfect and shiny. Most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t build up! I just wish it came in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> I order this product regularly cause I like the way it helps me manage ethnic hair, from kinky to loose curls, keeps much needed moisture in...</li>
            <li> If u want the best all day hold get this product. I tried the curl cream wasn&#x27;t that impressed but the curl sealer is wonderful</li>
            <li> I have hair that is wild and curly - similar to wild mint in growth. It&#x27;s more than difficult and it&#x27;s not fine in texture. This product moisturizes my curls without leaving them greasy and it doesn&#x27;t weigh them down. It can be used daily which is a blessing and is so easy to apply. Just put it on and leave it alone....curls are bouncy, shiny and glowing with health...Simply the best!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been  natural almost two weeks after transitioning eight months &amp; have been rocking a wash n go on my twa. Initially, I was using the pink eco styler which actually works pretty good, but I&#x27;m not a big fan of using a lot of gel &amp; I&#x27;m also not a fan of the crunch in my hair either,  so I decided to buy this since it was the cheapest styler in walmart at the time (around $8). I am glad I did because this gives you a soft hold &amp; my wng still had those soft curls the next day. I&#x27;ve used this with Shea moisture curl &amp; style milk as well as the TW great detangler. Both worked really well. It also has a clean &amp; citrusy scent which I like.</li>
            <li> This was for my sister who has long curly hair. She had found it in Target, love it of course, went back to get more and it was gone!!! We looked everywhere for it....GONE!!! I looked on Amazon and their it was so I bought her 6 jars!!! She loves it!!</li>
