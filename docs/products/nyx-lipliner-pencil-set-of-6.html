            <li>The color takes a while to apply and it didn&#x27;t glide on smoothly after priming my lips!</li>
            <li>Most of the colors I like and they mix well with the lipstick.</li>
            <li>I love the brand.</li>
            <li>Love the pencil colors, rich and Can be used as a lip stick....</li>
            <li>but, the ones that I have it went on smoothly and stayed on for a while...</li>
            <li>I brought this for my daughter for Xmas since she liked mines so much</li>

            <li>These are very comparable to MAC lip pencils but for only a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>I kept on seeing MUA&#x27;s using NYX mixed with other lipsticks, mixing different pencils with lip gloss to top it off unless looking for a matte look or ombre style and wanted to try it for myself.  </li>
            <li>These lip liners are very pigmented, and last long.</li>

            <li> These lip liners are very pigmented, and last long.</li>
            <li> The only problem was the colors I received weren&#x27;t exactly the same as the picture (though they were close) and I was looking forward to the really dark one to complete an ombre lip look, but that one wasn&#x27;t in there :/</li>
            <li> I have a couple of the sets and they&#x27;re all long lasting, highly pigmented, and not too hard and not too soft.</li>
            <li> Colors are not vivid.</li>
            <li> Do not recommend for dark skinned women</li>
            <li> It was a disappointment!</li>
