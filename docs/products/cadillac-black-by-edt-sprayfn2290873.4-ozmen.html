            <li>I am a Ford man myself, and while it kills me a little everytime I spray a little GM on myself, I must say  that I love this automotive related cologne.</li>

            <li> and it is in a big spray bottle, should last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is a steal for the price; a $70.00 value for far less.  </li>
            <li> they all smell the same,  I expected a diferente aroma.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t  spray to much, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is with the bottle I ordered, is it has a very slight leak around the base of the spray button.  </li>
            <li> Tough to beat for the price!</li>
