    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am happy about it!!</li>
            <li>Am I impressed?</li>
            <li>Very Happy!    </li>
            <li>She uses this and has been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I should have been a perfect candidate for laser hair removal.</li>
            <li>oh my god, i don&#x27;t have a five oclock shadow anymore&amp;#34; thank you tria for making my wife feel as beautiful as i always told her she is!!</li>
            <li>The directions say for best results use once every two weeks for about three months, but I am going to try for once a week.</li>
            <li>so I should be a perfect candidate.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best shipment and product</li>
            <li>I am the ideal candidate for this machine.</li>
            <li>I think it works great.</li>
            <li>Great call experience.</li>
            <li>but what i have seen is great.</li>
            <li>Tria has not worked great on some of my chin hair, but some of it is gray/colorless.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the treatment in this area, so I&#x27;m happy with the Tria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I think it&#x27;s a great product, it&#x27;s not for my skin tone/hair color combo.</li>
            <li>Yes, I&#x27;m impressed (and thrilled beyond belief).</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how GREAT this is.</li>
            <li>Deal was excellent and sophisticated and there are speed of response we hope that&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Note - There are probably good safety reasons why this isn&#x27;t a non-rechargeable corded unit.</li>
            <li>That lasts for a good 6 to 8 weeks.</li>
            <li>Are there just some of us despite having fair skin and brown hair that this just does not work on????</li>
            <li>Good Product, I recommend it and take the pain.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to be able to retire my tweezers, and I feel so much more beautiful and confident.  </li>
            <li>Probably two more treatments and I will never have to shave again!</li>
            <li>I had bought the TRIA 4x and it made me MORE HAIRY!</li>
            <li>Great way to get rid of hairs and remarkably cheap compared to going to paying someone to do it.</li>
            <li>i plan on sticking with it until i get the results i desire and should it not be 100% effective</li>
            <li>Not as effective as going to the clinic for laser hair removal.</li>
            <li>I will say I call the company twice with question, and they were so nice and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a pain, because recharging can take 2-3 hours, and if you don&#x27;t want to lose your place, you have to mark off the regions done with a pen or something</li>
            <li>I am already thrilled by my results  </li>
            <li>I didnt even have hair in certain spots and they doubled or more!!!</li>
            <li>After reading many peoples reviews i was kind of nervous.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would not recommend ordering this product and if you do it might be best to order it directly from the dealer.</li>
            <li>The Tria is easy to use and it works!</li>
            <li>What has continued to regrow is very fine</li>
            <li>I tested myself and was able to begin treatments at a 4 bars.  </li>
            <li>Ok guys</li>
            <li>Ok Guys-    </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m not even sure how well it worked.    </li>
            <li>I hope you all get the same great results!!</li>
            <li>Would I be able to go a week without shaving, no.</li>
            <li>Within about 4 days, most of the hairs had fallen out.  </li>
            <li>So, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be able to use it at the highest setting, but it&#x27;s working even on the lower settings.</li>
            <li>better get to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bikini</li>
            <li>Waxing myself is ok but just not something</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get bumps any more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not hair-free, but I am so much better in the areas where it matters most TO ME.  </li>
            <li>This level or more .. thank you</li>
            <li>I chose this over some IPL systems because in reviews, I&#x27;ve heard that it has better longer term</li>
            <li>: 3 treatments + 1 week&lt;</li>
            <li>and it just made more hair grow.</li>
            <li>and she got WAY more hair.</li>
            <li>BUT I WARNED YOU ALREADY :)</li>
            <li>Hope this helps some of you :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I would look at their return policy and see if it&#x27;s better than Amazon&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I am still dumbfounded on how they made a laser safe for at home use</li>
            <li>It has always bothered me because being fair skinned, you can see the hair growth right under the skin even after I shave.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to have this laser and to be able to do it in the privacy of my own home.</li>
            <li>The treatment tip does get rather warm and the fan turns on to cool it during use</li>
            <li>device seems well made, came mostly charged, and was fairly easy to activate.</li>
            <li>AFTER I ORDERED AND RECEIVED THE ITEM, I READ MORE DETAILS AND FOUND IT WOULD NOT WORK ON LIGHT HAIR.  </li>
            <li>No tears any more and a significant decrease in hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, well designed, probably effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If this isn&#x27;t your thing, fine, but if you are a woman in transition, read on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>am lucky to have online Sephora credit!  </li>
            <li>Yes, if you turn it to the highest setting it hurts a little (but highest works best).</li>
            <li>I wanted to write an honest customer review of the 4X - I also wanted to give it a certain amount of time before writing this so it would be accurate.</li>
            <li>Get 6 treatments for the $400 &amp; be hair free that way.</li>
            <li>I do fit the profile for the TRIA.</li>
            <li>Feel free to ask any questions below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;BTW, I am from India and my skin is light brown.</li>
            <li>Follow directions and enjoy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an OMG fantastic beauty tool.</li>
            <li>two is really the best I can handle, especially on my legs.</li>
            <li>: I also realize to many consumers, this review will not affect their judgement because they are simply interested in if the product works or not.</li>
            <li>Original review May 2014...    </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get my Tria, to be hairless.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be able to work my way up to higher levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more effective and smarter that way since you only get</li>
            <li>have pretty fine light brown-colored leg hair.  </li>
            <li>Like many of you I saw reviews of people who it did not work for and those it worked for really well.    </li>
            <li>These were good enough for me, as I did not expect the device to render my skin baby-smooth.</li>
            <li>, I am among those who had regrowth even after the full 6 sessions.</li>
            <li>It has to cool itself between pulses; this has been taking about  1 to 1.5 seconds for me, but can take longer.</li>
            <li>It takes time though, so if you are really hairy and pressed for time then a salon might be a better option (or get on hormones and see how that goes!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through 3 full treatments (2 weeks apart), which should put me at the halfway point, according to the manual.</li>
            <li>I strongly suspect Tria Beauty employs people to write those reviews and the “submit your own review” option is there only to provide the site with an alibi.</li>
            <li>It made me and my girlfriend grow more HAIR than NORMAL!</li>
            <li>It feels like a quick sting, so level</li>
            <li>For those with the appropriate skin tone and hair color, and a level of patience and perseverance, I highly recommend purchasing this.</li>
            <li>ya, that&#x27;s pretty accurate.</li>
            <li>the Tria did seem to work at first very well, and the hair was coming in finer and lighter and in many places began to disappear altogether.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m that good at or willing to do on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>i find them very helpful!!</li>
            <li>Very very easy to use, feels very solid and holds a good long charge.</li>
            <li>For the price, I figured it was worth the gamble to see if an in home product would work.  </li>
            <li>But consider that if you are buying a product that starts off by misleading you from the moment you open the packaging, do you really think you are going to have a good experience with?</li>
            <li>well worth the money</li>
            <li>is why I bought it and what makes it worth it for me.  </li>
            <li>More details added&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to make it clear that I&#x27;m a man.</li>
            <li>have had two professional laser hair removal treatments on my face, since this is the area I am most concerned about.</li>
            <li>would still say it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>which is all I can handle, but to save years of shaving, totally worth it--</li>
            <li>It is easy to operate, easy to handle and the instructions are simple.  </li>
            <li>approach was very time consuming, but after some time I fancied I could see some significant results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s right at home</li>
            <li>Since I know that laser hair removal does work on me, I figured it would be worth it to at least try this device, since I would be able to treat all of my problem areas and be able to give myself as many treatments as necessary, since I think I&#x27;ll need more than recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right, is not a permanent solution but it drastically reduces hair growth.</li>
            <li>It is a good easy to handle size-so far it works as expected.  </li>
            <li>There weren’t many credible reviews available online back then, but the producer provided links to study results by supposedly independent researchers, and they promised long-lasting results.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and very dark brown hair which helps the laser pick up the hair follicle and zap it.</li>
            <li>Sure beats the $5K the dermatologist wanted for the same job!  </li>
            <li>When you try to use the device for the first time you must go on-line and activate it.</li>
            <li>I wake up in the morning, and am not obsessed with finding my mirror and tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Followed directions exactly and had others try.  </li>
            <li>It is most likely just an information mining vehicle for marketing reasons.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li>Also areas that had no hair in the first place now grow hair.</li>
            <li>First of all, I do not understand the price on Amazon today (about 650).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Places where the hair grows in thicker, it definitely takes more treatments to see results, but stick with it</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only had the product for ~3 weeks now, so this is more of a preliminary report, which I hope to update with results.</li>
            <li>The manual warns you that in hot environments, it may take unreasonably long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pretty frickin&#x27;</li>
            <li>one higher.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In addition to the hair in normal places, I also have dark hair that grows on my face, neck, chest, around my nipples, and along my happy trail that makes me very self-conscious.</li>
            <li>After I completed my face, I was able to use the device at level 4 on my underarms and my bikini line, but only at level 3 on my neck, chest, and around my belly button.</li>
            <li>But as soon as I skip a moths or two it starts to grow back and diminishes most of the result.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>--I do notice that the tip gets hotter as you continue to use it, but for me, not uncomfortably hot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If in time I see even more results, I&#x27;ll definitely give it a five!</li>
            <li>I have been embarrassed  with facial hair for many years and  </li>
            <li>Also as time progresses you can take it a level higher.</li>
            <li>At that point it had to be returned and I had to send an email to get Amazon to take it back because it had been more then 30 days</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if it works, I think it will be quite worth it for me, since a single salon treatment would cost more than the device (and you need 4-6 visits).</li>
            <li>The upper legs (lasered) have only short, fine hair growing in; it&#x27;s really a remarkable difference.  </li>
            <li>Despite the number of positive reviews, I was still reluctant to purchase this.  </li>
            <li>In fact, almost all reviews on the manufacturer’s webpage are positive.</li>
            <li>At first it didn&#x27;t seem to do much at all to take the edge off, but then I started massaging it into the skin and letting it sit for a minute.</li>
            <li>With the Tria, it seems more like a probabilistic thing; some percentage of the follicles are deactivated each time, and some hair is unaffected and keeps growing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really seems to be working very well!</li>
            <li>Intensity 4 and 5 are definitely strong and equal to the laser at the leading spas.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get ~675 zaps at the highest power on a single charge.</li>
            <li>Not sure how many more treatments my chin will require, but so far my expectations &amp; hopes have been 100% met.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of the lucky ones with light skin and dark hair (hence the need for it in the first place).</li>
            <li>/&gt;What would be really helpful would be a laser-safe pen one could use to mark out a grid on large areas, like they do at a salon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is so much easier and CHEAPER than paying $100s of dollars to go to the spa every 4-6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Fast FWD</li>
            <li>The hair grows at a much slower rate  and this hair is much much finer with every use.</li>
            <li>it took til my 6th treatment before i really started to see this</li>
            <li>and they appear very infrequently.  </li>
            <li>This does sting like a real laser treatment.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>It is so much NOT like that now.  </li>
            <li>$$$ would have been better spent for salon treatment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I spent the money</li>
            <li>This made me think that the whole Tria Laser device is a scam.</li>
            <li>However, today I saw an advertisement of the product online, remembered the whole affair.</li>
            <li>However, today I saw an advertisement of the product online, remembered the whole affair.</li>
            <li>A very upsetting experience.</li>
            <li>So that doesn&#x27;t really compute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; We&#x27;ll see if it makes that much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, so it is very time consuming.</li>
            <li>I primarily purchased this item for removal of hair on my chin and lip and the back of my neck</li>
            <li>I wish it were possible to upload pictures to back up my review, so that people can make up their own minds.</li>
            <li>I wish it were possible to upload pictures to back up my review, so that people can make up their own minds.</li>
            <li>she has had a problem with unwanted facial hair most of her adult life.</li>
            <li>With regular consistent use I was able to significantly reduce hair density,thickness and regrowth time probably up to 90% in bikini area and about 70% less hair in underarm area.</li>
            <li>last year i wrote a glowing review of my Tria hair removal system 4X, but after a year I really feel like I must be honest and update this review to reflect the long term results so you won&#x27;t make the mistake I did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m using this mostly for chest and upper legs; shaving my arms and lower legs is not a big deal, but the first two areas get razorburn and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I am very light skinned with dark hair</li>
            <li>Even though I am not finished, my skin finally feels normal and feminine and smooth.  </li>
            <li>, using it: First off, I have a pretty good skin/hair match (pretty pale with medium to dark brown hair), so if this works at all, it should work on me.</li>
            <li>Theoretically, I was the perfect candidate for the treatment (dark hair and pale skin) and while I was using the device, I could observe limited hair shedding some two weeks after each treatment, which I took for a sign that the device was working its magic.</li>
            <li>gave the device a 4 star review so far because I do believe it is working for me, and it is easy to use, but the size of the treatment area really isn&#x27;t very big at all</li>
            <li>That was the  best money I ever spent however as new dark hairs grew in different areas I had to have the laser treatment again costing around $175 a visit.  </li>
            <li>cool that such a home device exists</li>
            <li>They will most likely not get back to you.</li>
            <li>but the product is definitely as advertised and the shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>In only 6 weeks, my chin is smooth and free of pimples, ingrowns, and dark hair.  </li>
            <li>I decided to spend the money, believing that so long as I had fair skin and brown hair, this thing work for sure to remove hair permanently - and after all - even though this device is expensive, it is cheaper than a series of hair removal treatments at the doctors office.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m continuing my experiment where I&#x27;m very thorough on my right upper leg, and</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>, the laser isn&#x27;t as high power, so to make up for that, the pulses are longer</li>
            <li>/&gt;Level 3 was better, it still stung a little on the areas with dense hair, but it wasn&#x27;t making me flinch like level 4 or 5.</li>
            <li>I usually have a pretty high pain threshold, and the two professional treatments that I had were done at the highest level, so I figured I would be okay on level 5 on my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the key to success with using Tria is a combination of consistency and being resigned to a level of discomfort - not unlike an insect sting.  </li>
            <li>tried to turn it on using the top green button.</li>
            <li>way to \\&quot;activate\\&quot; a unit is to press the green power button at the top and hold it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>And the pain using the device seemed like a normal snap/</li>
            <li>Me, I&#x27;m way too impatient :).</li>
            <li>I am too lazy to keep going back for &amp;#34;touch ups&amp;#34;, but love the results as no other method leaves my skin smooth and with lighter regrowth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to shave new growth as often, and there are no bumps or stubble.  </li>
            <li>purchased a new unit</li>
            <li>I have hypopigmented areas on my face and underarms as a result of using the New Tria Hair Removal Laser 4X.</li>
            <li>I would probably have to buy new Tria at some point.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft, smooth, and there is a minimal amount of new growth/regrowth.  </li>
            <li>And after a few weeks, the results have been nothing short of amazing.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, it feels more like a slow burn than the fast snap of a pro laser.</li>
            <li>She had made it very clear that treatment might take a while.  </li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin, so every time I shave my legs</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that has dark hair and light skin.  </li>
            <li>But after the first week, I noticed how the tiny bits of hair (stubble) in the treated area would fall out - often along with the transparent follicle shaft.  </li>
            <li>For reference I have light skin (though well tanned atm), and dark brown hair for all my body hair and my head</li>
            <li>First, as I said before, there is a variable delay between pulses, unlike a pro laser that can zap several times a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I just used my Tria Hair Removal 4x device for the first time, so I thought I would write an initial review.</li>
            <li>Because I had been plucking, hairs continued to grow-in over the first few weeks, so I did treat one area more often than recommended during the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t light up to use after a week and half.  </li>
            <li>I cannot explain the positive feedback otherwise, especially since the device DOES NOT WORK in my case,</li>
            <li>I did try my underarm but found the sting to be pretty intense on such deep hairs and reduced level to 3.  </li>
            <li>and my hair grows quick enough that no matter what form of hair removal I use, I have hair again the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I still have all my hair, my wife&#x27;s professional lasering worked.</li>
            <li>Check groupon, for $200 you frequently find 3 treatments for a body area.</li>
            <li>I have been bothered by it for as long as I can remember and did see undergo a professional treatment with electrologist awhile ago for a few dark hairs on my happy trail.</li>
            <li>When I use my Tria with this method i can use it on a 5 with no trouble even on sensitive spots like bikini and armpits.</li>
            <li>I have been getting professional lasering for years.</li>
            <li>So it works but not even as close to a professional laser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still too early to tell if this will work as well as professional laser hair removal systems</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for three months now, and the hair under my arms is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>If you buy it directly from Tria you supposedly have 90 days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tried to publish this review directly on the manufacturer’s web page, however, the review got rejected, even though it conformed to all formal requirements</li>
            <li>It was a conscious purchase.</li>
            <li>cannot pretend to feel surprised at that.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, despite following the treatment plan set out in the device’s manual very strictly, I did not see the described the manual promised.</li>
            <li>The hair will never be gone completely but it does ease it.</li>
            <li>would take up to 6 months to complete all the sessions</li>
            <li>this review is written from the standpoint of a transwoman early in transition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nowhere near powerful enough to actually singe hair like a pro laser, so no burning hair</li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t see much difference, so maybe you don&#x27;t need the 25 zaps per square inch</li>
            <li>It pays off completely.</li>
            <li>As for me, the only area that really hurts on the highest setting is the bikini area and armpits.</li>
            <li>Long story short, I decided to splurge, as the $75 sessions quickly add up, and if it doesn&#x27;t work, I can return it.</li>
            <li>For most of my adult life I have struggled in dealing with some unsightly, dark facial hair - especially on my chin and along the sides of my face.  </li>
            <li>gave this a four star rating pending long term use and could easily give it a five at a later time if the long term results are as hoped.</li>
            <li>Of course I&#x27;m willing to change my view if technical details are provided publicly about how the activation is done.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly and did test patches at different levels on each area; and waited the recommended 24 hours to see if there were any adverse effects or skin tone changes before starting treatment.  </li>
            <li>As such, I&#x27;ll mainly cover experience of using the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the tria beauty twice and on level 2, which is pretty low, but I am already seeing results!</li>
            <li>I have had many laser treatments in the past and I can already tell this is similar to that.</li>
            <li>I barely use any makeup on the area since the redness is nearly gone.  </li>
            <li>zap with a little redness that went away fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m 23 years old, of Irish heritage with pale skin, freckles, and light brown/reddish hair on my head.</li>
            <li>I shave a day ahead to allow my skin to calm down.</li>
            <li>This new model requires you to pick up the laser and replace it in the same spot for it to pulse again.  </li>
            <li>I wasn’t particularly hairy to begin with, but I was hoping to get rid of the occasional coarse black hair on my shoulders and back completely and to significantly reduce the hair covering my chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love having dark hair on my head and brows, but could do without the dark body hair everywhere else.</li>
            <li>I will admit that I used it about every other day for the first week.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a MAJOR wuss).</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey, but I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m Italian and Spanish decent.</li>
            <li>(~2800 pulses) to do one upper leg (and I don&#x27;t have huge upper legs; maybe a bit bigger than the average woman).</li>
            <li>Clearly they have multiple reviews from people involved in this company here.</li>
            <li>Buy it from two different professional laser places.</li>
            <li>I am on my fourth cycle of treatment, and the results are far beyond my expectations.  </li>
            <li>The constant redness my chin was once plagued by is completely gone.   </li>
            <li>Apparently, what Tria Beauty finds inappropriate is any content that contains information unfavorable user experience.</li>
            <li>After 3 times of use on upper lip and chin, results are comparable to the professional sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have only used this one time so far</li>
            <li>(Short version: so far,</li>
            <li>As is made abundantly clear, the Tria is *NOT* for male facial hair; for that you&#x27;ll need a professional laser salon or electrolysis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My thigh hair is dark, but pretty fine.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>so she barely had any hair</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried anything similar to it, but so far I&#x27;d say I like it.</li>
            <li>I have had 4 professional laser treatments on my bikini line before that again only worked marginally.</li>
            <li>It feels about the same as if you got it done professionally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an active swimmer and cyclist, and partially bought it to do removal on my lower legs, as studies show for cycling that being clean shaven reduces the severity of road rash in an accident.</li>
            <li>I first noticed a white/hypopigmented area that covered half my armpit</li>
            <li>six months from now.&lt;br /&gt;I am seeing lighter growth in the areas I have used it (mostly upper lip and chin at this point) and feel that if I continue to see less and less hair, I will continue to be pleased.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, in order to prevent leaving out patches of the skin untreated, I would treat each area twice at different settings and following different orientation, e.g. I would treat my chest first at the highest setting gliding the device horizontally, and would repeat the treatment the following day on the middle setting, but this time I would glide the device vertically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I remembered the money spent on the expensive device, but more importantly, I remember the HOURS spent in front of the mirror treating my skin.</li>
            <li>I remembered the money spent on the expensive device, but more importantly, I remember the HOURS spent in front of the mirror treating my skin.</li>
            <li>He said the right one (treated) was a lot less hairy!  </li>
            <li>what I understand every unit gets released into the market with a very simple \\&quot;activation code\\&quot;, which is a low natural integer number: \\&quot;1\\&quot; or \\&quot;2\\&quot; or \\&quot;3\\&quot;, etc...</li>
            <li>I have had laser done professionally before, and not only was it exp ($75 per session for upper lip and chin)</li>
            <li>This removing and replacing causing the entire process to take double the time of the old model.  </li>
            <li>The first few times i must confess I did not see much if any difference, but i kept going (I treated once a week) because I heard other reviews talking about persistence paying off with their TRIA.    </li>
            <li>Not as much ouch now since less hair.  </li>
            <li>Now that my product is no longer under warranty I have to keep it and use if for TEMPORARY HAIR REDUCTION - but would recommend if you truly want it to work and have long lasting results to save up and go to a well reviewed professional laser salon and leave it to the professionals.</li>
            <li>I did notice the device was cleared by the FCC, so Im hoping this means there is an actual packet exchange between the device and the manufacturer (because this would be a pretty cool safety feature), but Im still skeptical because I can&#x27;t find solid evidence on the web that data packets are actually transmitted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am returning the product and receiving my money back, but that will not cover costs of seeing a dermatologist or other costs to attempt to get my skin back to normal (depending on what the doctor recommends).</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I am happy about it!!</li>
            <li> Am I impressed?</li>
            <li> Very Happy!    </li>
            <li> She uses this and has been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I should have been a perfect candidate for laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> oh my god, i don&#x27;t have a five oclock shadow anymore&amp;#34; thank you tria for making my wife feel as beautiful as i always told her she is!!</li>
            <li> The directions say for best results use once every two weeks for about three months, but I am going to try for once a week.</li>
            <li> so I should be a perfect candidate.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best shipment and product</li>
            <li> I am the ideal candidate for this machine.</li>
            <li> I think it works great.</li>
            <li> Great call experience.</li>
            <li> but what i have seen is great.</li>
            <li> Tria has not worked great on some of my chin hair, but some of it is gray/colorless.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the treatment in this area, so I&#x27;m happy with the Tria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I think it&#x27;s a great product, it&#x27;s not for my skin tone/hair color combo.</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m impressed (and thrilled beyond belief).</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how GREAT this is.</li>
            <li> Deal was excellent and sophisticated and there are speed of response we hope that&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Note - There are probably good safety reasons why this isn&#x27;t a non-rechargeable corded unit.</li>
            <li> That lasts for a good 6 to 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> Are there just some of us despite having fair skin and brown hair that this just does not work on????</li>
            <li> Good Product, I recommend it and take the pain.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to be able to retire my tweezers, and I feel so much more beautiful and confident.  </li>
            <li> Probably two more treatments and I will never have to shave again!</li>
            <li> I had bought the TRIA 4x and it made me MORE HAIRY!</li>
            <li> Great way to get rid of hairs and remarkably cheap compared to going to paying someone to do it.</li>
            <li> i plan on sticking with it until i get the results i desire and should it not be 100% effective</li>
            <li> Not as effective as going to the clinic for laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> I will say I call the company twice with question, and they were so nice and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a pain, because recharging can take 2-3 hours, and if you don&#x27;t want to lose your place, you have to mark off the regions done with a pen or something</li>
            <li> I am already thrilled by my results  </li>
            <li> I didnt even have hair in certain spots and they doubled or more!!!</li>
            <li> After reading many peoples reviews i was kind of nervous.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would not recommend ordering this product and if you do it might be best to order it directly from the dealer.</li>
            <li> The Tria is easy to use and it works!</li>
            <li> What has continued to regrow is very fine</li>
            <li> I tested myself and was able to begin treatments at a 4 bars.  </li>
            <li> Ok guys</li>
            <li> Ok Guys-    </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m not even sure how well it worked.    </li>
            <li> I hope you all get the same great results!!</li>
            <li> Would I be able to go a week without shaving, no.</li>
            <li> Within about 4 days, most of the hairs had fallen out.  </li>
            <li> So, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be able to use it at the highest setting, but it&#x27;s working even on the lower settings.</li>
            <li> better get to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bikini</li>
            <li> Waxing myself is ok but just not something</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get bumps any more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not hair-free, but I am so much better in the areas where it matters most TO ME.  </li>
            <li> This level or more .. thank you</li>
            <li> I chose this over some IPL systems because in reviews, I&#x27;ve heard that it has better longer term</li>
            <li> : 3 treatments + 1 week&lt;</li>
            <li> and it just made more hair grow.</li>
            <li> and she got WAY more hair.</li>
            <li> BUT I WARNED YOU ALREADY :)</li>
            <li> Hope this helps some of you :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I would look at their return policy and see if it&#x27;s better than Amazon&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I am still dumbfounded on how they made a laser safe for at home use</li>
            <li> It has always bothered me because being fair skinned, you can see the hair growth right under the skin even after I shave.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to have this laser and to be able to do it in the privacy of my own home.</li>
            <li> The treatment tip does get rather warm and the fan turns on to cool it during use</li>
            <li> device seems well made, came mostly charged, and was fairly easy to activate.</li>
            <li> AFTER I ORDERED AND RECEIVED THE ITEM, I READ MORE DETAILS AND FOUND IT WOULD NOT WORK ON LIGHT HAIR.  </li>
            <li> No tears any more and a significant decrease in hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, well designed, probably effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If this isn&#x27;t your thing, fine, but if you are a woman in transition, read on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> am lucky to have online Sephora credit!  </li>
            <li> Yes, if you turn it to the highest setting it hurts a little (but highest works best).</li>
            <li> I wanted to write an honest customer review of the 4X - I also wanted to give it a certain amount of time before writing this so it would be accurate.</li>
            <li> Get 6 treatments for the $400 &amp; be hair free that way.</li>
            <li> I do fit the profile for the TRIA.</li>
            <li> Feel free to ask any questions below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;BTW, I am from India and my skin is light brown.</li>
            <li> Follow directions and enjoy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OMG fantastic beauty tool.</li>
            <li> two is really the best I can handle, especially on my legs.</li>
            <li> : I also realize to many consumers, this review will not affect their judgement because they are simply interested in if the product works or not.</li>
            <li> Original review May 2014...    </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my Tria, to be hairless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be able to work my way up to higher levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s more effective and smarter that way since you only get</li>
            <li> have pretty fine light brown-colored leg hair.  </li>
            <li> Like many of you I saw reviews of people who it did not work for and those it worked for really well.    </li>
            <li> These were good enough for me, as I did not expect the device to render my skin baby-smooth.</li>
            <li> , I am among those who had regrowth even after the full 6 sessions.</li>
            <li> It has to cool itself between pulses; this has been taking about  1 to 1.5 seconds for me, but can take longer.</li>
            <li> It takes time though, so if you are really hairy and pressed for time then a salon might be a better option (or get on hormones and see how that goes!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through 3 full treatments (2 weeks apart), which should put me at the halfway point, according to the manual.</li>
            <li> I strongly suspect Tria Beauty employs people to write those reviews and the “submit your own review” option is there only to provide the site with an alibi.</li>
            <li> It made me and my girlfriend grow more HAIR than NORMAL!</li>
            <li> It feels like a quick sting, so level</li>
            <li> For those with the appropriate skin tone and hair color, and a level of patience and perseverance, I highly recommend purchasing this.</li>
            <li> ya, that&#x27;s pretty accurate.</li>
            <li> the Tria did seem to work at first very well, and the hair was coming in finer and lighter and in many places began to disappear altogether.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m that good at or willing to do on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> i find them very helpful!!</li>
            <li> Very very easy to use, feels very solid and holds a good long charge.</li>
            <li> For the price, I figured it was worth the gamble to see if an in home product would work.  </li>
            <li> But consider that if you are buying a product that starts off by misleading you from the moment you open the packaging, do you really think you are going to have a good experience with?</li>
            <li> well worth the money</li>
            <li> is why I bought it and what makes it worth it for me.  </li>
            <li> More details added&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to make it clear that I&#x27;m a man.</li>
            <li> have had two professional laser hair removal treatments on my face, since this is the area I am most concerned about.</li>
            <li> would still say it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> which is all I can handle, but to save years of shaving, totally worth it--</li>
            <li> It is easy to operate, easy to handle and the instructions are simple.  </li>
            <li> approach was very time consuming, but after some time I fancied I could see some significant results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s right at home</li>
            <li> Since I know that laser hair removal does work on me, I figured it would be worth it to at least try this device, since I would be able to treat all of my problem areas and be able to give myself as many treatments as necessary, since I think I&#x27;ll need more than recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right, is not a permanent solution but it drastically reduces hair growth.</li>
            <li> It is a good easy to handle size-so far it works as expected.  </li>
            <li> There weren’t many credible reviews available online back then, but the producer provided links to study results by supposedly independent researchers, and they promised long-lasting results.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and very dark brown hair which helps the laser pick up the hair follicle and zap it.</li>
            <li> Sure beats the $5K the dermatologist wanted for the same job!  </li>
            <li> When you try to use the device for the first time you must go on-line and activate it.</li>
            <li> I wake up in the morning, and am not obsessed with finding my mirror and tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Followed directions exactly and had others try.  </li>
            <li> It is most likely just an information mining vehicle for marketing reasons.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li> Also areas that had no hair in the first place now grow hair.</li>
            <li> First of all, I do not understand the price on Amazon today (about 650).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Places where the hair grows in thicker, it definitely takes more treatments to see results, but stick with it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had the product for ~3 weeks now, so this is more of a preliminary report, which I hope to update with results.</li>
            <li> The manual warns you that in hot environments, it may take unreasonably long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> pretty frickin&#x27;</li>
            <li> one higher.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In addition to the hair in normal places, I also have dark hair that grows on my face, neck, chest, around my nipples, and along my happy trail that makes me very self-conscious.</li>
            <li> After I completed my face, I was able to use the device at level 4 on my underarms and my bikini line, but only at level 3 on my neck, chest, and around my belly button.</li>
            <li> But as soon as I skip a moths or two it starts to grow back and diminishes most of the result.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> --I do notice that the tip gets hotter as you continue to use it, but for me, not uncomfortably hot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If in time I see even more results, I&#x27;ll definitely give it a five!</li>
            <li> I have been embarrassed  with facial hair for many years and  </li>
            <li> Also as time progresses you can take it a level higher.</li>
            <li> At that point it had to be returned and I had to send an email to get Amazon to take it back because it had been more then 30 days</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if it works, I think it will be quite worth it for me, since a single salon treatment would cost more than the device (and you need 4-6 visits).</li>
            <li> The upper legs (lasered) have only short, fine hair growing in; it&#x27;s really a remarkable difference.  </li>
            <li> Despite the number of positive reviews, I was still reluctant to purchase this.  </li>
            <li> In fact, almost all reviews on the manufacturer’s webpage are positive.</li>
            <li> At first it didn&#x27;t seem to do much at all to take the edge off, but then I started massaging it into the skin and letting it sit for a minute.</li>
            <li> With the Tria, it seems more like a probabilistic thing; some percentage of the follicles are deactivated each time, and some hair is unaffected and keeps growing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really seems to be working very well!</li>
            <li> Intensity 4 and 5 are definitely strong and equal to the laser at the leading spas.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to get ~675 zaps at the highest power on a single charge.</li>
            <li> Not sure how many more treatments my chin will require, but so far my expectations &amp; hopes have been 100% met.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of the lucky ones with light skin and dark hair (hence the need for it in the first place).</li>
            <li> /&gt;What would be really helpful would be a laser-safe pen one could use to mark out a grid on large areas, like they do at a salon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is so much easier and CHEAPER than paying $100s of dollars to go to the spa every 4-6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Fast FWD</li>
            <li> The hair grows at a much slower rate  and this hair is much much finer with every use.</li>
            <li> it took til my 6th treatment before i really started to see this</li>
            <li> and they appear very infrequently.  </li>
            <li> This does sting like a real laser treatment.  </li>
            <li> This is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> It is so much NOT like that now.  </li>
            <li> $$$ would have been better spent for salon treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I spent the money</li>
            <li> This made me think that the whole Tria Laser device is a scam.</li>
            <li> However, today I saw an advertisement of the product online, remembered the whole affair.</li>
            <li> However, today I saw an advertisement of the product online, remembered the whole affair.</li>
            <li> A very upsetting experience.</li>
            <li> So that doesn&#x27;t really compute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; We&#x27;ll see if it makes that much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , so it is very time consuming.</li>
            <li> I primarily purchased this item for removal of hair on my chin and lip and the back of my neck</li>
            <li> I wish it were possible to upload pictures to back up my review, so that people can make up their own minds.</li>
            <li> I wish it were possible to upload pictures to back up my review, so that people can make up their own minds.</li>
            <li> she has had a problem with unwanted facial hair most of her adult life.</li>
            <li> With regular consistent use I was able to significantly reduce hair density,thickness and regrowth time probably up to 90% in bikini area and about 70% less hair in underarm area.</li>
            <li> last year i wrote a glowing review of my Tria hair removal system 4X, but after a year I really feel like I must be honest and update this review to reflect the long term results so you won&#x27;t make the mistake I did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m using this mostly for chest and upper legs; shaving my arms and lower legs is not a big deal, but the first two areas get razorburn and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I am very light skinned with dark hair</li>
            <li> Even though I am not finished, my skin finally feels normal and feminine and smooth.  </li>
            <li> , using it: First off, I have a pretty good skin/hair match (pretty pale with medium to dark brown hair), so if this works at all, it should work on me.</li>
            <li> Theoretically, I was the perfect candidate for the treatment (dark hair and pale skin) and while I was using the device, I could observe limited hair shedding some two weeks after each treatment, which I took for a sign that the device was working its magic.</li>
            <li> gave the device a 4 star review so far because I do believe it is working for me, and it is easy to use, but the size of the treatment area really isn&#x27;t very big at all</li>
            <li> That was the  best money I ever spent however as new dark hairs grew in different areas I had to have the laser treatment again costing around $175 a visit.  </li>
            <li> cool that such a home device exists</li>
            <li> They will most likely not get back to you.</li>
            <li> but the product is definitely as advertised and the shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> In only 6 weeks, my chin is smooth and free of pimples, ingrowns, and dark hair.  </li>
            <li> I decided to spend the money, believing that so long as I had fair skin and brown hair, this thing work for sure to remove hair permanently - and after all - even though this device is expensive, it is cheaper than a series of hair removal treatments at the doctors office.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m continuing my experiment where I&#x27;m very thorough on my right upper leg, and</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> , the laser isn&#x27;t as high power, so to make up for that, the pulses are longer</li>
            <li> /&gt;Level 3 was better, it still stung a little on the areas with dense hair, but it wasn&#x27;t making me flinch like level 4 or 5.</li>
            <li> I usually have a pretty high pain threshold, and the two professional treatments that I had were done at the highest level, so I figured I would be okay on level 5 on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the key to success with using Tria is a combination of consistency and being resigned to a level of discomfort - not unlike an insect sting.  </li>
            <li> tried to turn it on using the top green button.</li>
            <li> way to \\&quot;activate\\&quot; a unit is to press the green power button at the top and hold it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> And the pain using the device seemed like a normal snap/</li>
            <li> Me, I&#x27;m way too impatient :).</li>
            <li> I am too lazy to keep going back for &amp;#34;touch ups&amp;#34;, but love the results as no other method leaves my skin smooth and with lighter regrowth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to shave new growth as often, and there are no bumps or stubble.  </li>
            <li> purchased a new unit</li>
            <li> I have hypopigmented areas on my face and underarms as a result of using the New Tria Hair Removal Laser 4X.</li>
            <li> I would probably have to buy new Tria at some point.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft, smooth, and there is a minimal amount of new growth/regrowth.  </li>
            <li> And after a few weeks, the results have been nothing short of amazing.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, it feels more like a slow burn than the fast snap of a pro laser.</li>
            <li> She had made it very clear that treatment might take a while.  </li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin, so every time I shave my legs</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that has dark hair and light skin.  </li>
            <li> But after the first week, I noticed how the tiny bits of hair (stubble) in the treated area would fall out - often along with the transparent follicle shaft.  </li>
            <li> For reference I have light skin (though well tanned atm), and dark brown hair for all my body hair and my head</li>
            <li> First, as I said before, there is a variable delay between pulses, unlike a pro laser that can zap several times a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I just used my Tria Hair Removal 4x device for the first time, so I thought I would write an initial review.</li>
            <li> Because I had been plucking, hairs continued to grow-in over the first few weeks, so I did treat one area more often than recommended during the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t light up to use after a week and half.  </li>
            <li> I cannot explain the positive feedback otherwise, especially since the device DOES NOT WORK in my case,</li>
            <li> I did try my underarm but found the sting to be pretty intense on such deep hairs and reduced level to 3.  </li>
            <li> and my hair grows quick enough that no matter what form of hair removal I use, I have hair again the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I still have all my hair, my wife&#x27;s professional lasering worked.</li>
            <li> Check groupon, for $200 you frequently find 3 treatments for a body area.</li>
            <li> I have been bothered by it for as long as I can remember and did see undergo a professional treatment with electrologist awhile ago for a few dark hairs on my happy trail.</li>
            <li> When I use my Tria with this method i can use it on a 5 with no trouble even on sensitive spots like bikini and armpits.</li>
            <li> I have been getting professional lasering for years.</li>
            <li> So it works but not even as close to a professional laser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still too early to tell if this will work as well as professional laser hair removal systems</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for three months now, and the hair under my arms is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> If you buy it directly from Tria you supposedly have 90 days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried to publish this review directly on the manufacturer’s web page, however, the review got rejected, even though it conformed to all formal requirements</li>
            <li> It was a conscious purchase.</li>
            <li> cannot pretend to feel surprised at that.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, despite following the treatment plan set out in the device’s manual very strictly, I did not see the described the manual promised.</li>
            <li> The hair will never be gone completely but it does ease it.</li>
            <li> would take up to 6 months to complete all the sessions</li>
            <li> this review is written from the standpoint of a transwoman early in transition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nowhere near powerful enough to actually singe hair like a pro laser, so no burning hair</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t see much difference, so maybe you don&#x27;t need the 25 zaps per square inch</li>
            <li> It pays off completely.</li>
            <li> As for me, the only area that really hurts on the highest setting is the bikini area and armpits.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I decided to splurge, as the $75 sessions quickly add up, and if it doesn&#x27;t work, I can return it.</li>
            <li> For most of my adult life I have struggled in dealing with some unsightly, dark facial hair - especially on my chin and along the sides of my face.  </li>
            <li> gave this a four star rating pending long term use and could easily give it a five at a later time if the long term results are as hoped.</li>
            <li> Of course I&#x27;m willing to change my view if technical details are provided publicly about how the activation is done.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly and did test patches at different levels on each area; and waited the recommended 24 hours to see if there were any adverse effects or skin tone changes before starting treatment.  </li>
            <li> As such, I&#x27;ll mainly cover experience of using the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the tria beauty twice and on level 2, which is pretty low, but I am already seeing results!</li>
            <li> I have had many laser treatments in the past and I can already tell this is similar to that.</li>
            <li> I barely use any makeup on the area since the redness is nearly gone.  </li>
            <li> zap with a little redness that went away fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m 23 years old, of Irish heritage with pale skin, freckles, and light brown/reddish hair on my head.</li>
            <li> I shave a day ahead to allow my skin to calm down.</li>
            <li> This new model requires you to pick up the laser and replace it in the same spot for it to pulse again.  </li>
            <li> I wasn’t particularly hairy to begin with, but I was hoping to get rid of the occasional coarse black hair on my shoulders and back completely and to significantly reduce the hair covering my chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love having dark hair on my head and brows, but could do without the dark body hair everywhere else.</li>
            <li> I will admit that I used it about every other day for the first week.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a MAJOR wuss).</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m Italian and Spanish decent.</li>
            <li> (~2800 pulses) to do one upper leg (and I don&#x27;t have huge upper legs; maybe a bit bigger than the average woman).</li>
            <li> Clearly they have multiple reviews from people involved in this company here.</li>
            <li> Buy it from two different professional laser places.</li>
            <li> I am on my fourth cycle of treatment, and the results are far beyond my expectations.  </li>
            <li> The constant redness my chin was once plagued by is completely gone.   </li>
            <li> Apparently, what Tria Beauty finds inappropriate is any content that contains information unfavorable user experience.</li>
            <li> After 3 times of use on upper lip and chin, results are comparable to the professional sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have only used this one time so far</li>
            <li> (Short version: so far,</li>
            <li> As is made abundantly clear, the Tria is *NOT* for male facial hair; for that you&#x27;ll need a professional laser salon or electrolysis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My thigh hair is dark, but pretty fine.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> so she barely had any hair</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried anything similar to it, but so far I&#x27;d say I like it.</li>
            <li> I have had 4 professional laser treatments on my bikini line before that again only worked marginally.</li>
            <li> It feels about the same as if you got it done professionally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an active swimmer and cyclist, and partially bought it to do removal on my lower legs, as studies show for cycling that being clean shaven reduces the severity of road rash in an accident.</li>
            <li> I first noticed a white/hypopigmented area that covered half my armpit</li>
            <li> six months from now.&lt;br /&gt;I am seeing lighter growth in the areas I have used it (mostly upper lip and chin at this point) and feel that if I continue to see less and less hair, I will continue to be pleased.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, in order to prevent leaving out patches of the skin untreated, I would treat each area twice at different settings and following different orientation, e.g. I would treat my chest first at the highest setting gliding the device horizontally, and would repeat the treatment the following day on the middle setting, but this time I would glide the device vertically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I remembered the money spent on the expensive device, but more importantly, I remember the HOURS spent in front of the mirror treating my skin.</li>
            <li> I remembered the money spent on the expensive device, but more importantly, I remember the HOURS spent in front of the mirror treating my skin.</li>
            <li> He said the right one (treated) was a lot less hairy!  </li>
            <li> what I understand every unit gets released into the market with a very simple \\&quot;activation code\\&quot;, which is a low natural integer number: \\&quot;1\\&quot; or \\&quot;2\\&quot; or \\&quot;3\\&quot;, etc...</li>
            <li> I have had laser done professionally before, and not only was it exp ($75 per session for upper lip and chin)</li>
            <li> This removing and replacing causing the entire process to take double the time of the old model.  </li>
            <li> The first few times i must confess I did not see much if any difference, but i kept going (I treated once a week) because I heard other reviews talking about persistence paying off with their TRIA.    </li>
            <li> Not as much ouch now since less hair.  </li>
            <li> Now that my product is no longer under warranty I have to keep it and use if for TEMPORARY HAIR REDUCTION - but would recommend if you truly want it to work and have long lasting results to save up and go to a well reviewed professional laser salon and leave it to the professionals.</li>
            <li> I did notice the device was cleared by the FCC, so Im hoping this means there is an actual packet exchange between the device and the manufacturer (because this would be a pretty cool safety feature), but Im still skeptical because I can&#x27;t find solid evidence on the web that data packets are actually transmitted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am returning the product and receiving my money back, but that will not cover costs of seeing a dermatologist or other costs to attempt to get my skin back to normal (depending on what the doctor recommends).</li>
            <li> So I bought this and hoped with all my heart it would work, I followed the directions religiously with slight discomfort stings a little more than a tattoo,  but Isaw little results maybe an extra day or so before shaving.  </li>
            <li> After a time the only thing it left me with is permanent dryer skin, a few spots formed after I stopped use, skin is a little more fragile, and I get hair growing odd in those areas now that can build up collagen.  </li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t wait to get started, even though I am about to begin my period (meaning it would be more painful than normal), so I popped a couple of Ibuprofen, shaved the areas I was going to treat, and began.</li>
            <li> So, the Tria hurt like crap for the first few weeks, particularly in areas where the hair was darker, thicker and more concentrated.  </li>
            <li> I really thought this works, I have used on and off for the past year</li>
            <li> so she naturally has dark hair.  </li>
            <li> Given small surface head, takes way too much time for the bother.  </li>
            <li> Then again, I haven&#x27;t seen much change in the past 3 weeks</li>
            <li> If you do not remove it from your skin for a long enough duration it will not pulse.  </li>
            <li> Just commit to the every other week for three months, and you will be amazed after just the first few times.</li>
            <li> I have been told that once I start taking the correct hormone regimen, masculine body hair eventually becomes much less of an issue.</li>
            <li> that I had circular white spots (some with a darker area in the center) in the shape of the laser treatment window in the pattern used on my face (upper lip and chin).</li>
            <li> Wishing I tried electrolysis (or did professional laser in a doctor&#x27;s office) on those few hairs popping up on my upper lip and chin rather than using this device.</li>
            <li> Was plucking them and that eventually led to constant pimples, ingrowns, and deep red damaged skin that I covered with heavy makeup daily.  </li>
            <li> : The main con is tied to 2 factors: small spot size and the fact that it&#x27;s rechargeable.</li>
            <li> The device is useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Tria Hair Removal Laser 4X’s direct predecessor (same power as the current model, but without the counter) for a little over a year before the device suddenly stopped working just a few weeks after the warranty elapsed.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions from Tria and used it faithfully for 90 days but the same 29 dark hairs remained on my upper lip and chin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it will take that long for me.  </li>
            <li> I am not complete with my treatment</li>
            <li> I spent $1500 several years ago for laser hair removal on my face.  </li>
            <li> After carefully reading the outside of the box, I had to return this unopened.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to long term results, but after a couple weeks already seeing improvements.</li>
            <li> I will have to update my review after I see the long term results perhaps</li>
            <li> (I have a very low hairline) and it is working as expected in these areas.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s probably less painful, but it&#x27;s a different kind of pain.</li>
            <li> I have two more sessions left and when it&#x27;s time to do it again after two weeks, less and lighter hair than the thick black stubble from before Tria after just a few days.</li>
            <li> I should also say that I&#x27;ve been on the strongest level 5 since my 3rd week because I was not seeing any results with the other levels.</li>
            <li> There are no cables involved and yet the activation process can be done indoors (very strange for a device thats not a cell phone).</li>
            <li> use the highest setting at all times and have not experienced any real side effects (such as pain or swelling).  </li>
            <li> chest I could do in 10-15 minutes on a single charge, but it took me 4 recharge cycles</li>
            <li> The hair on my underarms is partially removed, but not completely.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, individual hairs might (and I cannot put enough emphasis on the conditional here) seem less thick than before, but the overall visual effect is negligible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I go back down to three.</li>
            <li> Black hair, white skin.</li>
            <li> Red marks are almost gone from previous in-grown hairs.  </li>
            <li> The lower legs (unlasered) have about 1/4 inch of dark coarse hair, as expected.</li>
            <li> quite a bit less so for my left.</li>
            <li> This item is not recommended, buy the previous model if at all possible.</li>
            <li> I am of Irish/Italian descent and have pale Irish alabaster skin with coarse dark body hair.</li>
            <li> Since the information is not freely available on the web, I have to conclude the activation is a scam and that the device is not actually transmitting a single packet of data to another radio frequency device.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little pricey (but it willl pay itself back in within 6 months)</li>
            <li> I might have had a small patch of hair gone for a short time while actively using the device, but now that I have given up, that hair is back, too.</li>
            <li> an experiment I tried the other upper leg going much less densely, using ~1400 pulses</li>
            <li> I tried an epilator (most painful thing ever).</li>
            <li> Called support within work hours and got empty silence.</li>
            <li> not much difference at all.</li>
            <li> It has decreased the growth time and that is really all.</li>
            <li> Not really.</li>
            <li> so I did and kept it out of the return window but got no real results, ended up selling it.  </li>
            <li> careful.</li>
            <li> and then a few days later after going out for the day in the sun (with 70 SPF sunscreen on my face)</li>
            <li> the minus side, expect it to take quite a while; both lots of zaps and lots of time waiting for recharge.</li>
            <li> I know some IPL systems are corded, but this is a frickin&#x27; follicle destroying LASER, so different rules</li>
            <li> LED screen stays on for only as long as I keep the green button pressed down.</li>
            <li> I have thick black hair in all of the places that hair normally grows (legs, underarms, arms, bikini, etc.)</li>
            <li> 4 x is not strong enough .I</li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve used it on my feets and toes, my chest, my back and a few other places.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little annoying how tiny the head is, but it works better than the other at home systems I&#x27;ve tried and doesn&#x27;t require cartridges, so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I just was not willing to do it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not why I bought the Tria, but I figured I&#x27;d try it on one leg and not the other just for comparison.  </li>
            <li> … well, almost all; I guess it was rejected because it contained “Other information that Tria Beauty finds inappropriate.”</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s over, but I underestimated how difficult it would be to willingly inflict that pain on myself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, modest as such demands might have been, they proved to be too exaggerated.</li>
            <li> The rest of the areas I treated did not respond to this even while actively using it.</li>
            <li> When holding it pressed down you will see that the LCD lights up and a small counter appears on it increasing every second.</li>
            <li> Iam too shy to do the wax thing by an aesthetician and certainly don&#x27;t want to get laser or electrolysis by some stranger either.  </li>
            <li> 1.5 years after I used the device last, there’s hardly any difference between my body hair now and then.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the device broke down suddenly for no apparent reason a few months later.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and ivory skin that is just a tinge ivory-beige on my face since it&#x27;s summer</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me and my hair is dark.  </li>
            <li> After the 2nd session at least 1/2 of the hairs that were treated were gone.</li>
            <li> and I do not see how this couldn&#x27;t work on anyone with dark hair.</li>
            <li> The results will be better than this worthless tria.</li>
            <li> been doing professional laser for 5 years and it has decreased hair by 50% and I have 100 % shedding .The</li>
            <li> At the highest setting, so I toned it down to 3, still hurts:</li>
            <li> Maybe it is slightly finer in places but</li>
            <li> I have black hair</li>
            <li> but I do notice that there are areas where the hair is already a bit less dense.</li>
            <li> Mine lost about 20% of it&#x27;s charge in a year and a half.</li>
            <li> The previous model you could hold in one spot</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slight pinch/burn.</li>
            <li> but I have been using my TRIA for a little over 2 months</li>
            <li> Two patches of icky dark hairs had developed over abt 6 years and were getting worse.  </li>
            <li> Just a little snapping.  </li>
            <li> and I get a little darker even with sunscreen).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got nothing but praise for this little laser that can be bought and used at home.</li>
            <li> Everything on me is pale, except for my body hair, which grows in black.</li>
            <li> Years and years of being embarrassed every day due to dark and scary facial, pit, and leg hair---no longer!!!</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m playing catch-up with the other leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underarms:&lt;br /&gt;OUCH!!  </li>
            <li> I had the treatments about 2 years ago, costing $200 each, and although they definitely were working for me (the hair was falling out by its self about a week after treatments) and things improved a little bit after the two treatments, I moved to an area with no available treatment center and was unable to continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Conclusion, over $400 wasted, this tria is garbage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> to a few months ago</li>
            <li> I ordered Tria 4x, stopped plucking and shaved area for a few days.  </li>
            <li> I followed the recommended treatment pattern -- which overlaps and seems to zap each hair a few times per treatment.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t tell my husband and then after a few weeks, I asked him to see if he felt a difference in my legs.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money .I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all unless it&#x27;s working and actually destroying the hair follicles, so the pain made me feel like this device will work for me.</li>
            <li> What a waste of hundreds of dollars....</li>
            <li> A few problems with delivery</li>
            <li> Just a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I mean, come on, it&#x27;s really expensive, and who knows if it really works.</li>
            <li> If it is a trick/scam, then under any circumstance whatsoever, consumers should be wary of buying this product because it likely means the company could be misleading them on other things.</li>
            <li> even though it has only been a month, we have both noticed a dramatic difference in the amount of hair she had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving the product a poor review not because it must be activated, but because they are not clearly stating how the activation is done (is it using a cell phone tower?</li>
            <li> But..I never went for that either so have just continued plucking away for the past few years.  </li>
            <li> Maybe they have other ways, but i seriously doubt they have embedded microwave receivers (i.e. cellular tech.)</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you&#x27;ve got someone that can hold the laser for you, do it, because I had to turn the device down to level 3 just because I couldn&#x27;t make myself use it on level 4 or 5.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially, I found it difficult to resort to shaving rather than tweezing, although I realized it was necessary in order</li>
            <li> I would expect by now I could get at least a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I never saw improvement, but in their defense, I didn&#x27;t keep going back because it was so expensive.  </li>
            <li> Not super-thick and has decreased as I&#x27;ve aged.  </li>
            <li> I wish they would have also had a cd to watch instead of small print paper direction.  </li>
            <li> I know its not what the device is intended, but I noticed people complaining their tattoos faded with laser hair removal and went AHA, no more explaining in shame what my tattoo means.</li>
            <li> I have been using it once a week for the past three weeks and each week I raise the &amp;#34;level&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Be careful on thin skin areas, like underarms or feet and hands.</li>
            <li> Well, after using it as directed for the past year and on the highest setting, the hair is not gone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this approx 3 weeks ago and feel I have wasted my money!  </li>
            <li> I have tried every form of hair removal with not very good results...</li>
            <li> I typically use at the highest settings (4-5), and take my time - moving very slowly across the skin and changing locations when I need a bit of relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super-hirsute; I have enough chest hair to be annoying, but I&#x27;m not a bear by a long shot.</li>
            <li> so I had a hard time knowing how to use the machine</li>
            <li> Having a reading comprehension problem made it hard for me.  </li>
            <li> and you should, or at least I have.</li>
            <li> cuz I&#x27;ve tried the clinic and it least with me one month before the hair grow up agin</li>
            <li> : I can imagine worse ways to spend money on than buying this device, but I cannot imagine a worse way to waste your time than by using it.</li>
            <li> and I already notice a serious reduction in hair growth.  </li>
            <li> I have waxed, tweezed and used chemical depilatories, and have always been frustrated by the never ending cycle of having to deal with the embarrassing regrowth - on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> I was REALLY SKEPTICAL because it promised permanent hair reduction in a few weeks at the fraction of the price it costs to go to a salon - which I was about to do.</li>
            <li> I have to use a fresh razor and soak in the tub for about an hour before shaving, and I still wind up covered in blood after shaving, and with terrible razor</li>
            <li> Very little pain with hair removal, butt puckering pain on my very unfortunate tattoo.</li>
            <li> Oh, and by the way, the lies that it barely hurts is disgusting.</li>
            <li> The dark hair on my face is already retarded in growth and the hair on my legs is slowing in growth.</li>
            <li> Hard to use and painful.</li>
            <li> It was expensive, tedious</li>
            <li> I always end up with awful bumps too, which leave red marks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s still rather tedious.</li>
            <li> that makes shaving difficult, as I always have a shadow underneath my skin, and I get a ton of ingrown hairs whenever I use any form of hair removal.</li>
            <li> I was wrong....</li>
            <li> I held it on my skin until the skin was almost burning fro the cold.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve reach all I can achieve.</li>
            <li> To bad here you get no gain &amp; all pain.</li>
            <li> even delete the bad reviews on some sites .They</li>
            <li> It is a bit painful at times, but nothing you can&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> I sometimes try to go to four, but it&#x27;s always too painful</li>
            <li> Admittedly, the warranty had already elapsed, but I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of response, even of a polite “no”.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, the warranty had already elapsed, but I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of response, even of a polite “no”.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using it on the lowest setting to get rid of a stupid tattoo.  </li>
            <li> I either have terrible break outs, razor burn, or rashes (from chemicals like Nair)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am a physician. I know about hair growth cycles. Black hair, white skin. The experiment: Used this thing for myself. Paid for my wife to get her hair done at a professional center. The results 1.5 years later. I still have all my hair, my wife&#x27;s professional lasering worked. Conclusion, over $400 wasted, this tria is garbage. Check groupon, for $200 you frequently find 3 treatments for a body area. Buy it from two different professional laser places. Get 6 treatments for the $400 &amp; be hair free that way. The results will be better than this worthless tria. Oh, and by the way, the lies that it barely hurts is disgusting. Clearly they have multiple reviews from people involved in this company here. No one else would say it doesn&#x27;t hurt. To bad here you get no gain &amp; all pain.</li>
            <li> This is so much easier and CHEAPER than paying $100s of dollars to go to the spa every 4-6 weeks.  This way I can use it weekly and it pays for itself after 3 treatments.  It is easy to operate, easy to handle and the instructions are simple.  Intensity 4 and 5 are definitely strong and equal to the laser at the leading spas.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I bought this Tria 4x after the dermatologist told me their office would do my legs and underarms and bikini area for $5,000.00.  Their treatment plan would have taken up to  6 months!  For the price, I figured it was worth the gamble to see if an in home product would work.  I began seeing a difference by the second week of using the tria.  I will admit that I used it about every other day for the first week.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and I can go without shaving for several days before any sign of hair growth and you can&#x27;t see it but, I can feel it.  The product instructions say it can take up to 6 months but I don&#x27;t think it will take that long for me.  I tested myself and was able to begin treatments at a 4 bars.  I bought some skin numbing cream but I have never needed it.  I would recommend this to anyone that has dark hair and light skin.  I think it works great. Sure beats the $5K the dermatologist wanted for the same job!  The Tria is easy to use and it works!</li>
            <li> I really thought this works, I have used on and off for the past year and i see no improvement. Waste of money.  My advice : DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> When you try to use the device for the first time you must go on-line and activate it. There are no cables involved and yet the activation process can be done indoors (very strange for a device thats not a cell phone). I&#x27;m giving the product a poor review not because it must be activated, but because they are not clearly stating how the activation is done (is it using a cell phone tower? is it using satellite reception (likely not since it is indoors)? or is it a scam?). Since the information is not freely available on the web, I have to conclude the activation is a scam and that the device is not actually transmitting a single packet of data to another radio frequency device. If it is a trick/scam, then under any circumstance whatsoever, consumers should be wary of buying this product because it likely means the company could be misleading them on other things. Of course I&#x27;m willing to change my view if technical details are provided publicly about how the activation is done. I did notice the device was cleared by the FCC, so Im hoping this means there is an actual packet exchange between the device and the manufacturer (because this would be a pretty cool safety feature), but Im still skeptical because I can&#x27;t find solid evidence on the web that data packets are actually transmitted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I also realize to many consumers, this review will not affect their judgement because they are simply interested in if the product works or not. But consider that if you are buying a product that starts off by misleading you from the moment you open the packaging, do you really think you are going to have a good experience with?</li>
            <li> Despite the number of positive reviews, I was still reluctant to purchase this.  For most of my adult life I have struggled in dealing with some unsightly, dark facial hair - especially on my chin and along the sides of my face.  I have waxed, tweezed and used chemical depilatories, and have always been frustrated by the never ending cycle of having to deal with the embarrassing regrowth - on a daily basis.  From years of tweezing - and breaking the skin to get at emerging and ingrown hair - my skin was irritated and showed signs of discoloration/scarring from my constant manipulation, application of concealers, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided that Tria was a last-ditch hope... and now I wondered why I ever waited to try it.  I am on my fourth cycle of treatment, and the results are far beyond my expectations.  Even though I am not finished, my skin finally feels normal and feminine and smooth.  The discoloration from my tweezing &amp;#34;scars&amp;#34; has virtually all vanished.  I wake up in the morning, and am not obsessed with finding my mirror and tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the key to success with using Tria is a combination of consistency and being resigned to a level of discomfort - not unlike an insect sting.  I won&#x27;t lie - it hurts a bit.  I typically use at the highest settings (4-5), and take my time - moving very slowly across the skin and changing locations when I need a bit of relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I found it difficult to resort to shaving rather than tweezing, although I realized it was necessary in order have the Tria target the follicle.  But after the first week, I noticed how the tiny bits of hair (stubble) in the treated area would fall out - often along with the transparent follicle shaft.  And after a few weeks, the results have been nothing short of amazing.  My skin feels soft, smooth, and there is a minimal amount of new growth/regrowth.  I don&#x27;t have to shave new growth as often, and there are no bumps or stubble.  It is truly vanishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use my Tria on a weekly or bi-weekly basis until I feel I no longer need to.  I am so happy to be able to retire my tweezers, and I feel so much more beautiful and confident.  For those with the appropriate skin tone and hair color, and a level of patience and perseverance, I highly recommend purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and it does not work at all!  I charged it, when I push the button to turn it on it goes off immediately.  Followed directions exactly and had others try.  It was a gift so when I gave it the time to return had passed so I totally feel ripped off.  Do not trust this product</li>
            <li> Please tell me what I am doing wrong.&lt;br /&gt;- purchased a new unit&lt;br /&gt;- charged it for 2 hours till the battery indicator is no longer moving&lt;br /&gt;- unplugged from power&lt;br /&gt;- went online and activated it. received a confirmation&lt;br /&gt;- tried to turn it on using the top green button. The unit does not turn on&lt;br /&gt;- Called support within work hours and got empty silence. Nobody there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LED screen stays on for only as long as I keep the green button pressed down. The second i release the button, the screen switches off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. It is beyond my comprehension how their so called \\&quot;activation&#x27; works. You go online, punch in your email and serial number of the device and voila! The unit has been activated! AFAIK there is no communication mechanism between their servers and the unit in my home, so how does the unit get \\&quot;unlocked\\&quot; or \\&quot;activated\\&quot;? Maybe... it&#x27;s... MAGIC!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE on 4/21/2014&lt;br /&gt;Called and spoke to a product support representative at Tria. Great call experience. The rep was helpful.&lt;br /&gt;Here is a bit on the so called \\&quot;Activation\\&quot;. It is most likely just an information mining vehicle for marketing reasons.&lt;br /&gt;From what I understand every unit gets released into the market with a very simple \\&quot;activation code\\&quot;, which is a low natural integer number: \\&quot;1\\&quot; or \\&quot;2\\&quot; or \\&quot;3\\&quot;, etc...&lt;br /&gt;The way to \\&quot;activate\\&quot; a unit is to press the green power button at the top and hold it. When holding it pressed down you will see that the LCD lights up and a small counter appears on it increasing every second. When you reach your \\&quot;activation code\\&quot; you release the power button and \\&quot;activation\\&quot; will get triggered.&lt;br /&gt;Where I am going with this is that you can probably simply guess the \\&quot;activation code\\&quot; by trial and error. There is no need to \\&quot;register\\&quot; the unit... Oops! I meant \\&quot;activate\\&quot; it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, that is one way to activate. Maybe they have other ways, but i seriously doubt they have embedded microwave receivers (i.e. cellular tech.) in those devices to have them communicate to their servers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll fiddle around with the device and update the review to 5 stars if all works as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and lastly, don&#x27;t even bother sending Tria an email via their website. They will most likely not get back to you. They didn&#x27;t in my case. Just have to call them and hope they pick up. Don&#x27;t get discouraged by an overpowering gush of utter silence on their hotline. That&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> UPDATE************ TRIA REVIEW ALMOST A YEAR LATER***********  Ok guys last year i wrote a glowing review of my Tria hair removal system 4X, but after a year I really feel like I must be honest and update this review to reflect the long term results so you won&#x27;t make the mistake I did. YES! the Tria did seem to work at first very well, and the hair was coming in finer and lighter and in many places began to disappear altogether. I kept diligently at it and didn&#x27;t miss a treatment, I was fully convinced this product was a miracle and well worth the money yada yada yada (see below) but a year later I would say ALL the hair has come back almost as soon as I stopped using it. Maybe it is slightly finer in places but not much difference at all. I was prepared to do some touch ups, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it all to return. I am the ideal candidate for this machine. I have fair skin and very dark brown hair which helps the laser pick up the hair follicle and zap it. Now that my product is no longer under warranty I have to keep it and use if for TEMPORARY HAIR REDUCTION - but would recommend if you truly want it to work and have long lasting results to save up and go to a well reviewed professional laser salon and leave it to the professionals. Get a group on or what you can to save cost but this is not the answer.      Ok Guys-    I wanted to write an honest customer review of the 4X - I also wanted to give it a certain amount of time before writing this so it would be accurate. I am not complete with my treatment but I have been using my TRIA for a little over 2 months so let&#x27;s just call this a \\&quot;progress report\\&quot;.    I do fit the profile for the TRIA. I am of Irish/Italian descent and have pale Irish alabaster skin with coarse dark body hair. I love having dark hair on my head and brows, but could do without the dark body hair everywhere else. It has always bothered me because being fair skinned, you can see the hair growth right under the skin even after I shave. I have heardother people call it the \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; and ya, that&#x27;s pretty accurate. I have been bothered by it for as long as I can remember and did see undergo a professional treatment with electrologist awhile ago for a few dark hairs on my happy trail. It was expensive, tedious and i&#x27;m not even sure how well it worked.    Fast FWD to a few months ago and I happened to see an ad for the Tria. I was REALLY SKEPTICAL because it promised permanent hair reduction in a few weeks at the fraction of the price it costs to go to a salon - which I was about to do. I am someone who researches everything thoroughly before I spend my money on it because I am in the arts and I don&#x27;t have a lot of money to burn. After reading many peoples reviews i was kind of nervous. Like many of you I saw reviews of people who it did not work for and those it worked for really well.    I have been doing: armpits, arms, bikini, toes and some spots on my face. The first few times i must confess I did not see much if any difference, but i kept going (I treated once a week) because I heard other reviews talking about persistence paying off with their TRIA.    I should also say I purchased the cooling gel. At first it didn&#x27;t seem to do much at all to take the edge off, but then I started massaging it into the skin and letting it sit for a minute. Then I took a big ziplock bag of frozen peas and ice and placed that on the area of the skin I was going to treat. I held it on my skin until the skin was almost burning fro the cold. When I use my Tria with this method i can use it on a 5 with no trouble even on sensitive spots like bikini and armpits. TRY IT!!!!!!    I have not seen total hair removal yet but what i have seen is great. The hair grows at a much slower rate  and this hair is much much finer with every use. it took til my 6th treatment before i really started to see this so i would suggest sticking with it!!! also i saw a much bigger difference when i treated everything on a 5 as opposed to a 4 which is where i started.    i plan on sticking with it until i get the results i desire and should it not be 100% effective I may save and finish up and do the rest at the salon. but i have to say it is WORKING! I am happy about it!! definitely try the ice method with the cooling gel. I hope you all get the same great results!! i will post again when i am finished with my treatment. please post your reviews too - i find them very helpful!!</li>
            <li> I have been getting professional lasering for years. I am the 1% that does not have permanent results. I have black hair and I&#x27;m Italian and Spanish decent. I have been using this laser now since January and still must continue using it weekly. It has decreased the growth time and that is really all. In one week I must shave and laser. Am I impressed? Not really. I would expect by now I could get at least a few weeks. Would I be able to go a week without shaving, no. So it works but not even as close to a professional laser.</li>
            <li> ****UPDATE SEPT 2014****  Have continued using Tria on my chin and gradually about 90%+ of the hairs have stopped regrowing.   What has continued to regrow is very fine and they appear very infrequently.  The constant redness my chin was once plagued by is completely gone.   Patience has paid off.  Very Happy!    Original review May 2014...    Purchased for facial/chin hair.  Two patches of icky dark hairs had developed over abt 6 years and were getting worse.  Was plucking them and that eventually led to constant pimples, ingrowns, and deep red damaged skin that I covered with heavy makeup daily.  I ordered Tria 4x, stopped plucking and shaved area for a few days.  I followed the recommended treatment pattern -- which overlaps and seems to zap each hair a few times per treatment. I used the highest level.  This does sting like a real laser treatment.  Within about 4 days, most of the hairs had fallen out.  Because I had been plucking, hairs continued to grow-in over the first few weeks, so I did treat one area more often than recommended during the first few weeks.  In only 6 weeks, my chin is smooth and free of pimples, ingrowns, and dark hair.  I barely use any makeup on the area since the redness is nearly gone.  I keep 50 SPF on the area daily.  I did try my underarm but found the sting to be pretty intense on such deep hairs and reduced level to 3.  This is the real deal.  Not sure how many more treatments my chin will require, but so far my expectations &amp; hopes have been 100% met.</li>
            <li> Hard to use and painful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still too early to tell if this will work as well as professional laser hair removal systems but the product is definitely as advertised and the shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I considered purchasing this for months before I finally took the plunge. I mean, come on, it&#x27;s really expensive, and who knows if it really works. Well, it does! It takes a while, but it does work. I&#x27;ve been using it for three months now, and the hair under my arms is almost completely gone. Probably two more treatments and I will never have to shave again! It is a bit painful at times, but nothing you can&#x27;t handle. It has five settings, so you can adjust it to a &amp;#34;comfortable&amp;#34; level. They recommend putting it at the highest setting you can tolerate, then increasing as you get used to it. I started at three, and I&#x27;m still at three. I sometimes try to go to four, but it&#x27;s always too painful and I go back down to three. So, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be able to use it at the highest setting, but it&#x27;s working even on the lower settings. So, even if you&#x27;re wimpy like me, it works!</li>
            <li> So I bought this and hoped with all my heart it would work, I followed the directions religiously with slight discomfort stings a little more than a tattoo,  but Isaw little results maybe an extra day or so before shaving.  But after a wile my skin adjusted and I was back to the same growth, I tried returning it to the company the convinced me to try it longer so I did and kept it out of the return window but got no real results, ended up selling it.  After a time the only thing it left me with is permanent dryer skin, a few spots formed after I stopped use, skin is a little more fragile, and I get hair growing odd in those areas now that can build up collagen.  Also areas that had no hair in the first place now grow hair.</li>
            <li> I was so hopeful that this hair removal system would work on my facial hair but it did not.  I followed the directions from Tria and used it faithfully for 90 days but the same 29 dark hairs remained on my upper lip and chin.&lt;br /&gt;Sephora gives credit card return within 30 days and online Sephora credit 61-90 days which does not allow you to used the machine for the 90 days that Tria recommends.  If you buy it directly from Tria you supposedly have 90 days.&lt;br /&gt;I am lucky to have online Sephora credit!  It will take me years to use up $480.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful.</li>
            <li> First of all, I do not understand the price on Amazon today (about 650). I ordered from Tria back in January so I could have 90 days.  I&#x27;m almost there and will be keeping it.  I have used it once a week on various areas since I got it.  I shave a day ahead to allow my skin to calm down. I also use an after-shave serum or 2.5% benzoyl peroxide if needed.  This helps with bumps.  I have always used level 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chin and upper lip:&lt;br /&gt;I had gone to a plastic surgeon a while back for laser treatments.  They were $200 a pop.  I never saw improvement, but in their defense, I didn&#x27;t keep going back because it was so expensive.  I think I went three times.  It hurt like ...  too.  And I smelled of burning hair when done.  She had made it very clear that treatment might take a while.  I just was not willing to do it.  I figured that electrolysis would be a lot cheaper and permanent too.  But..I never went for that either so have just continued plucking away for the past few years.  Tria has not worked great on some of my chin hair, but some of it is gray/colorless.  I&#x27;ll have to do electrolysis to get rid of that. I&#x27;ve seen some improvement in the upper lip, though, and some of the chin hairs too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legs:&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty fine light brown-colored leg hair.  Not super-thick and has decreased as I&#x27;ve aged.  It&#x27;s not why I bought the Tria, but I figured I&#x27;d try it on one leg and not the other just for comparison.  I saw an almost immediate difference in the hairiness of my leg. I didn&#x27;t tell my husband and then after a few weeks, I asked him to see if he felt a difference in my legs.  He said the right one (treated) was a lot less hairy!  Now, I&#x27;m playing catch-up with the other leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underarms:&lt;br /&gt;OUCH!!  Tears-in-my-eyes hurt.  But there is a definite decrease in the hair.  Not as much ouch now since less hair.  Today is treatment day..better get to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bikini area:&lt;br /&gt;This is why I bought it and what makes it worth it for me.  Iam too shy to do the wax thing by an aesthetician and certainly don&#x27;t want to get laser or electrolysis by some stranger either.  I tried an epilator (most painful thing ever). Waxing myself is ok but just not something I&#x27;m that good at or willing to do on a regular basis.  I always end up with awful bumps too, which leave red marks.  So, the Tria hurt like crap for the first few weeks, particularly in areas where the hair was darker, thicker and more concentrated.  It is so much NOT like that now.  Just a little snapping.  No tears any more and a significant decrease in hair. The skin is smoother.  Don&#x27;t get bumps any more.  Red marks are almost gone from previous in-grown hairs.  I&#x27;m happy with the treatment in this area, so I&#x27;m happy with the Tria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read an NIH study regarding these types of lasers before I ordered.  As stated, I also ordered from Tria to allow a 90-day trial.  I was skeptical and determined that at that price ($450) I would send it back for sure if it did not work.  I&#x27;m not hair-free, but I am so much better in the areas where it matters most TO ME.  I&#x27;m keeping it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, she is of european desent so she naturally has dark hair.  She uses this and has been very happy with it.  It is a little pricey, but I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Given small surface head, takes way too much time for the bother.  $$$ would have been better spent for salon treatment.</li>
            <li> I spent $1500 several years ago for laser hair removal on my face.  That was the  best money I ever spent however as new dark hairs grew in different areas I had to have the laser treatment again costing around $175 a visit.  This product has replaced the visits.  I&#x27;m so glad I spent the money</li>
            <li> After carefully reading the outside of the box, I had to return this unopened. While I think it&#x27;s a great product, it&#x27;s not for my skin tone/hair color combo. READ the information on this thing before you order it.</li>
            <li> I tried to publish this review directly on the manufacturer’s web page, however, the review got rejected, even though it conformed to all formal requirements… well, almost all; I guess it was rejected because it contained “Other information that Tria Beauty finds inappropriate.” Apparently, what Tria Beauty finds inappropriate is any content that contains information unfavorable user experience. In fact, almost all reviews on the manufacturer’s webpage are positive. This made me think that the whole Tria Laser device is a scam. I strongly suspect Tria Beauty employs people to write those reviews and the “submit your own review” option is there only to provide the site with an alibi. I cannot explain the positive feedback otherwise, especially since the device DOES NOT WORK in my case, although I used it for over twice the time the manufacturer claims would be necessary to achieve long-lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here’s the review I wanted to publish originally:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up: I can imagine worse ways to spend money on than buying this device, but I cannot imagine a worse way to waste your time than by using it. The device is useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Tria Hair Removal Laser 4X’s direct predecessor (same power as the current model, but without the counter) for a little over a year before the device suddenly stopped working just a few weeks after the warranty elapsed. That was over 1.5-2 years ago, which is why I decided to concentrate in this review on the long-term effects rather than the immediate impressions from the use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the device as a man in his mid-twenties to use it on my chest and abdomen as well as dedicated areas on shoulders and back. It was a conscious purchase. There weren’t many credible reviews available online back then, but the producer provided links to study results by supposedly independent researchers, and they promised long-lasting results. These were good enough for me, as I did not expect the device to render my skin baby-smooth. I wasn’t particularly hairy to begin with, but I was hoping to get rid of the occasional coarse black hair on my shoulders and back completely and to significantly reduce the hair covering my chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, modest as such demands might have been, they proved to be too exaggerated. 1.5 years after I used the device last, there’s hardly any difference between my body hair now and then. Admittedly, individual hairs might (and I cannot put enough emphasis on the conditional here) seem less thick than before, but the overall visual effect is negligible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot pretend to feel surprised at that. Theoretically, I was the perfect candidate for the treatment (dark hair and pale skin) and while I was using the device, I could observe limited hair shedding some two weeks after each treatment, which I took for a sign that the device was working its magic. Nevertheless, despite following the treatment plan set out in the device’s manual very strictly, I did not see the described the manual promised. I therefore increased the frequency of treatments. Back then the manual recommended one treatment a month. I treated my skin once every two weeks (which happens to be the recommended regimen for the current device, too). Furthermore, in order to prevent leaving out patches of the skin untreated, I would treat each area twice at different settings and following different orientation, e.g. I would treat my chest first at the highest setting gliding the device horizontally, and would repeat the treatment the following day on the middle setting, but this time I would glide the device vertically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This approach was very time consuming, but after some time I fancied I could see some significant results. Unfortunately, the device broke down suddenly for no apparent reason a few months later. The display showed an “ERROR” message and the skin sensor would not unlock the device anymore. I tried to contact the producer, but got no reply. Admittedly, the warranty had already elapsed, but I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of response, even of a polite “no”. I didn’t want to start a personal vendetta with the producer, and the device did seem to have reduced my body hair somewhat, so I decided to let it be. However, today I saw an advertisement of the product online, remembered the whole affair. I remembered the money spent on the expensive device, but more importantly, I remember the HOURS spent in front of the mirror treating my skin. Before writing this review, I even compared my reflection in the mirror with some pictures I had taken before I bought the device and I could not see any difference. I wish it were possible to upload pictures to back up my review, so that people can make up their own minds. But I hope this review will help a potential buyer consider all the pros and cons before making the purchase.. I tried to contact the producer, but got no reply.

            <li> AFTER I ORDERED AND RECEIVED THE ITEM, I READ MORE DETAILS AND FOUND IT WOULD NOT WORK ON LIGHT HAIR.  HAD TO SEND IT BACK...</li>
            <li> Not as effective as going to the clinic for laser hair removal. But, I do notice when I do not use it. The hair will never be gone completely but it does ease it.</li>
            <li> Edited: More details added&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to make it clear that I&#x27;m a man. I&#x27;m an active swimmer and cyclist, and partially bought it to do removal on my lower legs, as studies show for cycling that being clean shaven reduces the severity of road rash in an accident. Since then I&#x27;ve used it on my feets and toes, my chest, my back and a few other places. For reference I have light skin (though well tanned atm), and dark brown hair for all my body hair and my head hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Places where the hair grows in thicker, it definitely takes more treatments to see results, but stick with it and you should, or at least I have. Feel free to ask any questions below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works. It&#x27;s a little annoying how tiny the head is, but it works better than the other at home systems I&#x27;ve tried and doesn&#x27;t require cartridges, so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I have hypopigmented areas on my face and underarms as a result of using the New Tria Hair Removal Laser 4X. I followed the directions exactly and did test patches at different levels on each area; and waited the recommended 24 hours to see if there were any adverse effects or skin tone changes before starting treatment.  There were none so I used the device for 8-10 weeks on my face (one treatment per week on level 5) and 3-4 weeks on my underarms (one treatment per week also on level 5). I first noticed a white/hypopigmented area that covered half my armpit and then a few days later after going out for the day in the sun (with 70 SPF sunscreen on my face) that I had circular white spots (some with a darker area in the center) in the shape of the laser treatment window in the pattern used on my face (upper lip and chin). There were zero warning signs on my skin that would indicate that I needed to stop treatment prior to this discovery. No burns, no blisters, no sunburn. And the pain using the device seemed like a normal snap/zap with a little redness that went away fairly quickly. The hair on my face is still there -- no change. The hair on my underarms is partially removed, but not completely. I am returning the product and receiving my money back, but that will not cover costs of seeing a dermatologist or other costs to attempt to get my skin back to normal (depending on what the doctor recommends). Wishing I tried electrolysis (or did professional laser in a doctor&#x27;s office) on those few hairs popping up on my upper lip and chin rather than using this device. I have dark brown hair and ivory skin that is just a tinge ivory-beige on my face since it&#x27;s summer and I get a little darker even with sunscreen). I should have been a perfect candidate for laser hair removal. A very upsetting experience. I&#x27;m hoping these side effects are not permanent, but from my research hypopigmentation often can be.</li>
            <li> my wife loves it!!! she has had a problem with unwanted facial hair most of her adult life. even though it has only been a month, we have both noticed a dramatic difference in the amount of hair she had. she said &amp;#34; oh my god, i don&#x27;t have a five oclock shadow anymore&amp;#34; thank you tria for making my wife feel as beautiful as i always told her she is!!</li>
            <li> It does nothing actually I&#x27;m upset with it whenever I use it in the 3d day the hair grow up again.. Only losing money for no result.. They say u get the same clinic Laser results but that&#x27;s totally untrue cuz I&#x27;ve tried the clinic and it least with me one month before the hair grow up agin</li>
            <li> Deal was excellent and sophisticated and there are speed of response we hope that&lt;br /&gt;  This level or more .. thank you</li>
            <li> I have a reading comprehension problem so I had a hard time knowing how to use the machine, I was not reading the directions correctly. I wish they would have also had a cd to watch instead of small print paper direction.  Having a reading comprehension problem made it hard for me.  I will say I call the company twice with question, and they were so nice and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;This machine take 6 weeks before you see results so I am still waiting.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money .I&#x27;ve been doing professional laser for 5 years and it has decreased hair by 50% and I have 100 % shedding .The tria 4 x is not strong enough .I actually think its a scam .They tell you it takes multiple treatments to work but you only have 3 months to send it back .It would take up to 6 months to complete all the sessions so when it doesn&#x27;t work and you call them they tell you it takes time bla bla. Also most of these reviews are fake .They even delete the bad reviews on some sites .They have multiple people on YouTube making pro comments .Do not buy this product .</li>
            <li> I bought this through the tria website as they offer a 90 day money back guarantee. I have had laser done professionally before, and not only was it exp ($75 per session for upper lip and chin), I am among those who had regrowth even after the full 6 sessions. I am too lazy to keep going back for &amp;#34;touch ups&amp;#34;, but love the results as no other method leaves my skin smooth and with lighter regrowth. Long story short, I decided to splurge, as the $75 sessions quickly add up, and if it doesn&#x27;t work, I can return it. After 3 times of use on upper lip and chin, results are comparable to the professional sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my underarm (also had done at the doc&#x27;s office), and it hurts!! At the highest setting, so I toned it down to 3, still hurts:( So only tried there once, but will use again and hopefully it will work there as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I am from India and my skin is light brown.</li>
            <li> I have only used this one time so far and I already notice a serious reduction in hair growth.  I&#x27;m also using it on the lowest setting to get rid of a stupid tattoo.  Very little pain with hair removal, butt puckering pain on my very unfortunate tattoo. I know its not what the device is intended, but I noticed people complaining their tattoos faded with laser hair removal and went AHA, no more explaining in shame what my tattoo means.</li>
            <li> 2 MONTH UPDATE BELOW (Short version: so far, so good!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this review is written from the standpoint of a transwoman early in transition. If you&#x27;re a bit unclear, in brief, this means I&#x27;ve got a physically male body, which doesn&#x27;t jibe with my self image, so I&#x27;m taking steps make my body female. If this isn&#x27;t your thing, fine, but if you are a woman in transition, read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I should say that I&#x27;m pre-HRT. I have been told that once I start taking the correct hormone regimen, masculine body hair eventually becomes much less of an issue. So if you are on or shortly starting HRT, you might want to see how that works before dropping several hundred dollars. Me, I&#x27;m way too impatient :). I chose this over some IPL systems because in reviews, I&#x27;ve heard that it has better longer term success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this mostly for chest and upper legs; shaving my arms and lower legs is not a big deal, but the first two areas get razorburn and ingrown hairs. As is made abundantly clear, the Tria is *NOT* for male facial hair; for that you&#x27;ll need a professional laser salon or electrolysis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had the product for ~3 weeks now, so this is more of a preliminary report, which I hope to update with results. As such, I&#x27;ll mainly cover experience of using the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, using it: First off, I have a pretty good skin/hair match (pretty pale with medium to dark brown hair), so if this works at all, it should work on me. I&#x27;m not super-hirsute; I have enough chest hair to be annoying, but I&#x27;m not a bear by a long shot. My thigh hair is dark, but pretty fine.&lt;br /&gt;For my facial hair, I&#x27;m going to a laser removal salon, so I&#x27;ll make some comparisons there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The device seems well made, came mostly charged, and was fairly easy to activate. Using it is also extremely simple - besides turning it on and selecting a power level, there are no buttons to push; it detects when the head is pressed against your skin, beeps, lases, beeps again, and waits for you to pick it up and move it, where the process repeats itself. It has to cool itself between pulses; this has been taking about  1 to 1.5 seconds for me, but can take longer. The manual warns you that in hot environments, it may take unreasonably long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Differences from a salon;&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s pretty frickin&#x27; cool that such a home device exists, however, it&#x27;s quite different than a salon laser. First, as I said before, there is a variable delay between pulses, unlike a pro laser that can zap several times a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Next, the laser isn&#x27;t as high power, so to make up for that, the pulses are longer (I use it on its highest setting.) Therefore, it feels more like a slow burn than the fast snap of a pro laser. Overall, it&#x27;s probably less painful, but it&#x27;s a different kind of pain. It&#x27;s also nowhere near powerful enough to actually singe hair like a pro laser, so no burning hair smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Finally, the spot size is much smaller than a pro laser, and needs to overlap quite a bit. At the salon, they use maybe 2-3 zaps per square inch. The manual for the Tria recommends *25*. Expect it to take some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The main con is tied to 2 factors: small spot size and the fact that it&#x27;s rechargeable. I&#x27;m able to get ~675 zaps at the highest power on a single charge. That sounds like a lot, but including overlap, you can only treat a 1/4\\&quot;x1/4\\&quot; area/zap. The manual claims that 600 zaps is enough to treat your upper leg, but at the recommended zap-density, that works out to be about the same area as the core of a paper towel roll! So that doesn&#x27;t really compute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My chest I could do in 10-15 minutes on a single charge, but it took me 4 recharge cycles (~2800 pulses) to do one upper leg (and I don&#x27;t have huge upper legs; maybe a bit bigger than the average woman). It&#x27;s kind of a pain, because recharging can take 2-3 hours, and if you don&#x27;t want to lose your place, you have to mark off the regions done with a pen or something (PROTIP - do not mark an area until AFTER you&#x27;ve treated it, otherwise you could burn yourself.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an experiment I tried the other upper leg going much less densely, using ~1400 pulses; We&#x27;ll see if it makes that much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would be really helpful would be a laser-safe pen one could use to mark out a grid on large areas, like they do at a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, initial impressions: Easy to use, well designed, probably effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the minus side, expect it to take quite a while; both lots of zaps and lots of time waiting for recharge. (Note - There are probably good safety reasons why this isn&#x27;t a non-rechargeable corded unit. I know some IPL systems are corded, but this is a frickin&#x27; follicle destroying LASER, so different rules apply).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if it works, I think it will be quite worth it for me, since a single salon treatment would cost more than the device (and you need 4-6 visits). It takes time though, so if you are really hairy and pressed for time then a salon might be a better option (or get on hormones and see how that goes!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;M&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.: Some preliminary results -  I&#x27;ve only just started on my second treatment but I do notice that there are areas where the hair is already a bit less dense. Again, it&#x27;s not like a pro laser, where ALL the hair falls out after a week or so, and you are left baby-smooth. With the Tria, it seems more like a probabilistic thing; some percentage of the follicles are deactivated each time, and some hair is unaffected and keeps growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 3 treatments + 1 week&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been through 3 full treatments (2 weeks apart), which should put me at the halfway point, according to the manual. It really seems to be working very well! I finished the 3rd treatment a week ago, at which point I shaved my legs. The lower legs (unlasered) have about 1/4 inch of dark coarse hair, as expected. The upper legs (lasered) have only short, fine hair growing in; it&#x27;s really a remarkable difference.  Similarly, the chest hair is definitely disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still rather tedious. I&#x27;m continuing my experiment where I&#x27;m very thorough on my right upper leg, and quite a bit less so for my left. I actually don&#x27;t see much difference, so maybe you don&#x27;t need the 25 zaps per square inch recommended.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update after the next 3 treatments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got nothing but praise for this little laser that can be bought and used at home. WOW! Finally, all the hair I ever wanted to get rid off, is no longer there. It pays off completely. No regrets. No going anywhere. It&#x27;s right at home and you got rid of the unwanted hair. Follow directions and enjoy.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my Tria, to be hairless. Didn&#x27;t happen. I&#x27;ve used it 4 times and the hair on my face is still there. I&#x27;ve gone to be lasered for several years. That lasts for a good 6 to 8 weeks. Was hoping to save myself a lot of money, instead I&#x27;m $449. poorer and will still haveto spend money to see a proprofessional.</li>
            <li> I had bought the TRIA 4x and it made me MORE HAIRY! I didnt even have hair in certain spots and they doubled or more!!! It HURTS a lot and it just made more hair grow. TRUST me I looked up the feedback option just so I tell someone else NOT to buy this thing. It made me and my girlfriend grow more HAIR than NORMAL! Shes asian so she barely had any hair and then she used the Tria 4x under her arm pit area and she got WAY more hair. It&#x27;s up to you if you want to take the GAMBLE! BUT I WARNED YOU ALREADY :)</li>
            <li> I have been using it once a week for the past three weeks and each week I raise the &amp;#34;level&amp;#34; one higher. What I didn&#x27;t realize is that the laser actually hurts! Be careful on thin skin areas, like underarms or feet and hands. The actual product is very simple to use, understand, and store. I haven&#x27;t tried anything similar to it, but so far I&#x27;d say I like it. I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I have followed the directions.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me and my hair is dark.  Disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> Great way to get rid of hairs and remarkably cheap compared to going to paying someone to do it. Very very easy to use, feels very solid and holds a good long charge. I can&#x27;t speak to long term results, but after a couple weeks already seeing improvements.</li>
            <li> I just used my Tria Hair Removal 4x device for the first time, so I thought I would write an initial review. I&#x27;ll be updating this post as I continue using my device to document my results, hopefully this will work for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 23 years old, of Irish heritage with pale skin, freckles, and light brown/reddish hair on my head. Everything on me is pale, except for my body hair, which grows in black. I have thick black hair in all of the places that hair normally grows (legs, underarms, arms, bikini, etc.) that makes shaving difficult, as I always have a shadow underneath my skin, and I get a ton of ingrown hairs whenever I use any form of hair removal. I also have very sensitive skin, so every time I shave my legs I have to use a fresh razor and soak in the tub for about an hour before shaving, and I still wind up covered in blood after shaving, and with terrible razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the hair in normal places, I also have dark hair that grows on my face, neck, chest, around my nipples, and along my happy trail that makes me very self-conscious. The hair is sporadically placed in all of these places (but there is enough of it for it to be noticeable) except for my chin, where the hair grows in at about the same density as a man&#x27;s beard. I have tried every form of hair removal with not very good results...I either have terrible break outs, razor burn, or rashes (from chemicals like Nair) and my hair grows quick enough that no matter what form of hair removal I use, I have hair again the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had two professional laser hair removal treatments on my face, since this is the area I am most concerned about. I had the treatments about 2 years ago, costing $200 each, and although they definitely were working for me (the hair was falling out by its self about a week after treatments) and things improved a little bit after the two treatments, I moved to an area with no available treatment center and was unable to continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a ton of reviews before deciding to save up and purchase the Tria 4x. Since I know that laser hair removal does work on me, I figured it would be worth it to at least try this device, since I would be able to treat all of my problem areas and be able to give myself as many treatments as necessary, since I think I&#x27;ll need more than recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received my device in the mail, I couldn&#x27;t wait to get started, even though I am about to begin my period (meaning it would be more painful than normal), so I popped a couple of Ibuprofen, shaved the areas I was going to treat, and began. I usually have a pretty high pain threshold, and the two professional treatments that I had were done at the highest level, so I figured I would be okay on level 5 on my face. I was wrong....Level 5 hurt. It&#x27;s not an unbearable hurt, it&#x27;s very similar to the pain of getting a tattoo or having a rubber band snapped across your skin, and it&#x27;s so brief that by the time you&#x27;ve registered that it hurts, it&#x27;s over, but I underestimated how difficult it would be to willingly inflict that pain on myself. Seriously, if you&#x27;ve got someone that can hold the laser for you, do it, because I had to turn the device down to level 3 just because I couldn&#x27;t make myself use it on level 4 or 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Level 3 was better, it still stung a little on the areas with dense hair, but it wasn&#x27;t making me flinch like level 4 or 5. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all unless it&#x27;s working and actually destroying the hair follicles, so the pain made me feel like this device will work for me. After I completed my face, I was able to use the device at level 4 on my underarms and my bikini line, but only at level 3 on my neck, chest, and around my belly button. Hopefully as I continue to use it I&#x27;ll be able to work my way up to higher levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the device a 4 star review so far because I do believe it is working for me, and it is easy to use, but the size of the treatment area really isn&#x27;t very big at all, so it is very time consuming. I&#x27;ll update my review again once I have results to talk about! Hope this helps some of you :)</li>
            <li> Update:&lt;br /&gt;After using it for over a year I can say that results don&#x27;t last. With regular consistent use I was able to significantly reduce hair density,thickness and regrowth time probably up to 90% in bikini area and about 70% less hair in underarm area. But as soon as I skip a moths or two it starts to grow back and diminishes most of the result.&lt;br /&gt;I would still say it&#x27;s worth it but it&#x27;s a commitment and results are not permanent.I would probably have to buy new Tria at some point.Mine lost about 20% of it&#x27;s charge in a year and a half.</li>
            <li> I like this item a lot. It is a good easy to handle size-so far it works as expected.  I will have to update my review after I see the long term results perhaps six months from now.&lt;br /&gt;I am seeing lighter growth in the areas I have used it (mostly upper lip and chin at this point) and feel that if I continue to see less and less hair, I will continue to be pleased.  I primarily purchased this item for removal of hair on my chin and lip and the back of my neck (I have a very low hairline) and it is working as expected in these areas.&lt;br /&gt;I use the highest setting at all times and have not experienced any real side effects (such as pain or swelling).  I realize that this is an individual thing and others may  have much different levels of pain when using this item.  The treatment tip does get rather warm and the fan turns on to cool it during use--I do notice that the tip gets hotter as you continue to use it, but for me, not uncomfortably hot.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this a four star rating pending long term use and could easily give it a five at a later time if the long term results are as hoped.</li>
            <li> I decided to spend the money, believing that so long as I had fair skin and brown hair, this thing work for sure to remove hair permanently - and after all - even though this device is expensive, it is cheaper than a series of hair removal treatments at the doctors office. Well, after using it as directed for the past year and on the highest setting, the hair is not gone. I might have had a small patch of hair gone for a short time while actively using the device, but now that I have given up, that hair is back, too. The rest of the areas I treated did not respond to this even while actively using it. Are there just some of us despite having fair skin and brown hair that this just does not work on???? What a waste of hundreds of dollars....</li>
            <li> Years and years of being embarrassed every day due to dark and scary facial, pit, and leg hair---no longer!!! The Tria has changed my life. Just commit to the every other week for three months, and you will be amazed after just the first few times. I have two more sessions left and when it&#x27;s time to do it again after two weeks, less and lighter hair than the thick black stubble from before Tria after just a few days. I&#x27;m one of the lucky ones with light skin and dark hair (hence the need for it in the first place). Yes, I&#x27;m impressed (and thrilled beyond belief). Yes, I would buy it again (and if I&#x27;d known what the results would be for the price, would have purchased years ago). Yes, I would 100% recommend. Yes, it HURTS (even on 3 out of five setting which is all I can handle, but to save years of shaving, totally worth it--and I&#x27;m a MAJOR wuss). It&#x27;s an OMG fantastic beauty tool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the tria beauty twice and on level 2, which is pretty low, but I am already seeing results! The dark hair on my face is already retarded in growth and the hair on my legs is slowing in growth. It feels like a quick sting, so level two is really the best I can handle, especially on my legs. Each zap only covers a quarter inch of skin, so it is time consuming. The directions say for best results use once every two weeks for about three months, but I am going to try for once a week. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare the tria to, so I gave it a four. If in time I see even more results, I&#x27;ll definitely give it a five!</li>
            <li> Right, is not a permanent solution but it drastically reduces hair growth. Good Product, I recommend it and take the pain.</li>
            <li> This model in not an improvement over the last model.  The previous model you could hold in one spot and it would keep pulsing or slide it along your skin as it pulses.  This new model requires you to pick up the laser and replace it in the same spot for it to pulse again.  If you do not remove it from your skin for a long enough duration it will not pulse.  This removing and replacing causing the entire process to take double the time of the old model.  This item is not recommended, buy the previous model if at all possible.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS !!!!!  I have been embarrassed  with facial hair for many years and  I have always carried a tweezer (TweezerMan) in my purse.  After the 2nd session at least 1/2 of the hairs that were treated were gone. I am already thrilled by my results  Thank You Tria !!!!! .</li>
            <li> I tried to purchase from the website, but my credit card company blocked the sale and advised me not to. But I read all the reviews and decided to buy from Amazon. A few problems with delivery but I eventually got it and started using it 3 months ago on Easter. I have used it every weekend since on my lower legs, bikini line, under arms and upper lip. I have had 4 professional laser treatments on my bikini line before that again only worked marginally. I am very light skinned with dark hair so I should be a perfect candidate. I should also say that I&#x27;ve been on the strongest level 5 since my 3rd week because I was not seeing any results with the other levels. The discomfort is moderate and tolerable. You know when you are zapping hairs because that&#x27;s when you feel the sting. The pain has lessened over the weeks so it must be working. I can say that I was addicted to smooth skin because I shaved every day before the Tria and I hoped to eliminate that from my daily routine. However, I can only go 2 days now without shaving. So. Is it working, yes, somewhat. But I feel it&#x27;s going to take another 2 months (total would be 5 months) of weekly treatments to achieve any lasting smoothness. Then again, I haven&#x27;t seen much change in the past 3 weeks so I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve reach all I can achieve. It has definitely REDUCED my hair but I have not achieved HAIR REMOVAL, YET. I&#x27;m still hopeful, but when do you quit when you want it to work?</li>
            <li> I purchased this approx 3 weeks ago and feel I have wasted my money!  It won&#x27;t light up to use after a week and half.  I have never been so dissapointed in a product like I am over this!  I feel like I was robbed!  Not up to the advertisement...not even close!</li>
            <li> Just a waste of money and time. I bought, used it for month, didn&#x27;t help a bit!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best shipment and product</li>
            <li> Some people may say it doesn&#x27;t work but this product takes patience. Also if you see the instructions when buying tria it states to do it about twice a month (every two weeks ) until the pulses are done. I&#x27;ve done it about 5 times now and my (leg) hair grows way slower and thinner. I LOVE IT. Also as time progresses you can take it a level higher. It&#x27;s a slight pinch/burn. I can do the highest level now and it&#x27;s more effective and smarter that way since you only get about 3000some pulses</li>
            <li> I had zero results from using this weekly for 6 weeks. At that point it had to be returned and I had to send an email to get Amazon to take it back because it had been more then 30 days (I thought I had 90 days to return). Amazon did take it back, but they charged me $90 to re-stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend ordering this product and if you do it might be best to order it directly from the dealer. I would look at their return policy and see if it&#x27;s better than Amazon&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to have this laser and to be able to do it in the privacy of my own home. I have had many laser treatments in the past and I can already tell this is similar to that. I don&#x27;t know if I have ever been happier about a product and I do not see how this couldn&#x27;t work on anyone with dark hair. I am still dumbfounded on how they made a laser safe for at home use but I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how GREAT this is. Yes, it is a little pricey (but it willl pay itself back in within 6 months) Yes, if you turn it to the highest setting it hurts a little (but highest works best). As for me, the only area that really hurts on the highest setting is the bikini area and armpits. It feels about the same as if you got it done professionally. If you have been thinking about getting this, DO IT.</li>
