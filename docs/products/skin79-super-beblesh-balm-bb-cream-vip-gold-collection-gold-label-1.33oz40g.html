    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I introduced my friends to this product and they were very happy also.</li>
            <li>I am not saying it has the perfect coverage</li>
            <li>but if you just set it with powder or but a dab of concealer on a problem spot it will look marvelous.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the best part about it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>i bought the 4 pack skin79 sampler and of all the 4 items there, this is the one that worked best for</li>
            <li>Application is best with a sponge or a stippling brush.</li>
            <li>and it looks flawless.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this BB cream.  </li>
            <li>Wore just this and mascara in 106 degree weather(without melting!), and got some wonderful compliments.</li>

            <li>and I notice my skin condition has greatly improved.</li>
            <li>so was happy with that.  </li>
            <li>I did anyway and have to tell you that I am extremely happy with my cream.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Skin79 Beblesh Balm in Gold and the product works great as an all-in-one sunscreen, foundation and even concealer.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Looks great but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mac nc 25 skin tone, and I bought this after seeing great reviews.</li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>Great product over all.</li>
            <li>this works soooooo great</li>
            <li>Great BB cream.</li>
            <li>The color works great for me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great for my combination skin even if others have said it&#x27;s for oily skin.</li>
            <li>but it made my face look too gray and ashy, and the coverage wasn&#x27;t great either.  </li>
            <li>the coloring is great.  </li>
            <li>This is great when you&#x27;re on the go.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a foundation person, so this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li>Made my skin feel great.</li>
            <li>The shipping (I used the advertised seller) was great, here in five days.</li>
            <li>Great value for my money.</li>
            <li>Great coverage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an experienced BB cream user.  </li>
            <li>It gives me flawless glowing skin, and when I look into the mirror I feel kind of</li>
            <li>what a great combination.</li>
            <li>This cream is great.  </li>
            <li>Great price, the store in my area sell it for $39.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I can imagine that it would make a great primer for makeup too.  </li>
            <li>Over all, love it!!    </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>I will buy more SKIN79 products!!</li>

            <li>:  feels good, non-drying, evens skin tone &amp; gives me a happy glow almost.  </li>
            <li>Nice and even coverage!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had great looking skin but with this product I get good coverage</li>
            <li>have good consistency and coverage and are a great price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my skin, love the texture, color and the finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m most impressed with</li>
            <li>Plus the packaging is amazing, so cute! :D</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, this is best and most surprising beauty purchase I have ever made.</li>
            <li>Its goes on so easy and makes my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li>The product itself is great, and the packaging is adorable!</li>
            <li>I ordered two brands, one for myself and one for my very fair skinned daughter (I&#x27;m medium, leaning more towards fair).</li>
            <li>bright and well rested.</li>
            <li>My face is moisturized, and so bright.</li>
            <li>great on my skin and goes great with so many tones.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product because of a review I watched by a beloved makeup guru .</li>
            <li>It said it was a really good BB cream</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go for the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it is not so good as I heard.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and makes my skin look wonderful, (</li>
            <li>When I washed my face at the end of the day my skin felt and looked good.  </li>
            <li>I have bought knock offs from the drug store and they never work as good.</li>
            <li>Do a mix of rubbing in lightly and patting on(this is the method I feel that is best for me)</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>Thoroughly loved it and would recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li>and I loved</li>
            <li>because it seemed like a good deal.</li>
            <li>Fair coverage.</li>
            <li>The cream itself is good and moisturizes the skin, it also brightens it, It takes 5 mins before it oxedates to match your skintone.</li>
            <li>Before I bought it, I read a lot of review and it seems to be a good one.</li>
            <li>and she thought it was good as a primer.  </li>
            <li>If you are a beginner, this is a good starter bb cream.</li>
            <li>Also the bb cream is good, no break out or anything.</li>
            <li>My skin tone isn&#x27;t fair but in between medium and fair</li>
            <li>it has good coverage but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for people with dry/combination skin like myself, although now that it&#x27;s getting colder</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know whether it has done anything FOR my skin, but I take good care of it so who knows?</li>
            <li>shipping was good and pricing us good for this product.</li>
            <li>If not, then why sell it to people and get money from them when they think they are getting a good product?</li>
            <li>Gorgeous coverage, hydrating formula.</li>
            <li>BB cream manages to match my light skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li>and the coverage lasts a good time when it is set with powder.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great , and it has a nice coverage</li>
            <li>I originally ordered a sample pack to see which version worked the best for me.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wonderful, great under powder, easy to apply, fast and wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>Best to apply before foundation for full coverage.</li>
            <li>Beblesh Balm BB cream Vip Gold, after reading and watching reviews (on YouTube) and I&#x27;m super impressed.  </li>
            <li>Ordered 3 more products,delivery was fantastic!!Am 83 yrs old,match was great on my fair skin.</li>
            <li>I loved this one the most!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually an ideal tinted moisturizer because it is so light</li>
            <li>I was so happy :)</li>
            <li>I used the product today with great anticipation and love it.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with price, shipping cost and speed</li>
            <li>It also shipped 3 days ahead of scheduled delivery, so I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is a good product to be honest...</li>
            <li>this is a good product to be honest...</li>
            <li>NEway, I still continue to use it for another week or so before I was tire of having all my make up melt off my face by lunch time, and my skin right now is not the best shape</li>
            <li>Leave your skin so smooth and make up goes on beautifully.</li>

            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>The finish is lovely!</li>
            <li>My first impression of the BB cream itself was that it was a bit sticky and best to apply with your fingers.</li>
            <li>i love it !</li>
            <li>but this VIP gold is my top pick!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>But otherwise I love it!</li>
            <li>For best results, first wash the face with an oil-based cleanser (e.g. [...] then moisturize, then apply this to the skin.</li>
            <li>I honestly love this make up!</li>
            <li>but this is a top contender!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this BB Cream!</li>
            <li>So many things in one!</li>
            <li>So glad I found this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love!  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of a tinted moisturizer, but better!</li>
            <li>I really love it!</li>
            <li>So glad I orderd 2!</li>
            <li>I wear this under a foundation powder for more coverage and it holds all my make up in place!</li>
            <li>:) Thank you!</li>
            <li>I&#x60;m in love!</li>
            <li>This BB cream is better than the ones they sale at retail stores, I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li>bought the 4 skin79 sampler pack first and this gold version is def the best for me.</li>
            <li>Loved this product, does easily blend in and match skin tone, will be re-purchasing!</li>
            <li>I have always had great skin (very lucky), but this made it even better!</li>
            <li>This cream is very light with good coverage.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was amazing, and it came about 4 days after I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>This product works amazing.</li>
            <li>I thought I would give it a try and its been amazing.</li>
            <li>My skin still looks amazing at night when I wash it off.</li>
            <li>It smells great and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Super+Beblesh Balm is in a word amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This BB felt moisturizing and did not look greasy on my skin, it gave an amazing finish.</li>
            <li>This stuff works amazing.</li>
            <li>This works great, but it&#x27;s a tad light.</li>
            <li>This product is very well packaged, with an excellent pump.</li>
            <li>Of all the BB creams so far this seemed to be the best coverage wise and also emanates a glow.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t know quite what to expect with this BB Cream.</li>
            <li>It does look gray-ish on hand like another reviewer mentioned, but if you blend it in really good on your face, it looks better.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has spf 25 for some good protection.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is what makes it nice for someone who wears glasses.  </li>
            <li>But, honestly, since I will be using this during the day, I prefer having the SPF in it to protect my face.</li>
            <li>but BB cream is popular now</li>
            <li>As much as I liked it, it caused breakouts.  </li>
            <li>If you have oily skin, this isn&#x27;t the product for you but Skin79 does have others geared towards your type of skin (in fact I own it</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product!</li>
            <li>But it still blended nicely with my skin</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it goes on kind of gray because it neutralizes my skin tone.</li>
            <li>and honestly it feels like I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup.</li>
            <li>that was a nice touch.</li>
            <li>that was a nice touch.</li>
            <li>and let&#x27;s be honest how often do people even say that stuff?</li>
            <li>She liked that it gave her a dewy complexion and helped her makeup stay on longer.</li>
            <li>It blends nicely and evenly.</li>
            <li>This is a nice BB Cream.  </li>
            <li>I loved this so far the best of all the BB creams I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>My &amp;#34;tend to be dry&amp;#34; winter skin is loving this bb cream.</li>
            <li>just so good, best coverage, moisturizing, no breakout, not heavy.</li>
            <li>The VIP Gold Collection is really moisturizing, perfect during winter.</li>
            <li>I really liked the coverage of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I blended it into my skin (with my fingers, which I normally wouldn&#x27;t do), and it seemed to adjust perfectly to my skin tone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, great product, AMAZING shipping.... if you&#x27;re looking into it, it is totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>more importantly feels great.</li>
            <li>But what I loved the most is that for some reason my HUGE pores are not noticeable at all!</li>
            <li>Good on any skin tone easy to use recommend it.</li>
            <li>I really love this product and will be buying again! :)</li>
            <li>I bought the three to see which one I would like more, but I love them all!</li>
            <li>The product feels very light and nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>but so far this one does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li>If you want a BB cream that gives a natural and dewy glow, this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li>I also tried the Smashbox BB Cream and thought I liked that, but then after trying the Skin79 brand I am in love.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all nice, but this one is the most invisible, in my experience.</li>
            <li>I love how nice it makes my skin look as well,</li>
            <li>A friend recommended this product, and it offers great results!  </li>
            <li>but when I return to my natural color it will be perfect.</li>
            <li>and I find it is more effective to blend with fingers than with a sponge or brush.</li>
            <li>This BB cream is by far the BEST thing I have put on my face .......</li>
            <li>I think it is a great product and worth a try</li>
            <li>This goes on smoothly and covers fairly well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It truly is the most effective cosmetic (make-up)</li>

            <li>It looked so natural yet flawless.</li>
            <li>The packaging of this product is very cute and the pump is easy to use.   </li>
            <li>Out of the two, I would have to say that I liked with one more because it had a bit more coverage.  </li>
            <li>Excellent coverage for my fair skin with pink undertones.</li>
            <li>Great product, does exactly what it promises.</li>

            <li>I have used the Skin 79 Diamond bb cream before and love it.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell and texture.</li>
            <li>I love how it works but the smell made me not want to buy from them.</li>
            <li>I really think this works great with powder atop of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really think this works great with powder atop of it.       </li>
            <li>overall a great product!</li>
            <li>and I love this one sooo much better.  </li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with BB creams.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Most days I throw this on with some finishing powder, and I&#x27;m out of the door in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>And boy, was I glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I just got it today and am already in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love that has SPF, looking forward to the lightening of some sun-freckles.  </li>
            <li>I never had a BB cream before and there were more pros than cons about this BB cream, so i decided to try</li>
            <li>I love how this lightens my freckles.</li>
            <li>Lovely.</li>
            <li>I love that non makeup</li>
            <li>it was an authentic product(checked the sticker).</li>
            <li>and I felt as though time was taken to make sure it arrived to me safely.</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much thicker product, with moisturizing feel, great coverage</li>
            <li>BUT I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is packaged in a really cute pump out bottle.</li>
            <li>I actually really love the way it made my skin look.     </li>
            <li>can also work to better your skin.  </li>
            <li>I really, really, really love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It looks better on me with powder, but I wish I could just wear the BB cream by itself without looking weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would use it for a night on the town, when I feel like I would need more coverage.</li>
            <li>It is definitely an authentic product!!!!!PHEW....</li>
            <li>It wore great the whole day.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Will purchase more</li>
            <li>I love BB cream.</li>
            <li>but this product made my skin that much more healthy and radiant.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what I was buying when I got this, I just viewed the highest ranking moisturizers and this came up.  </li>
            <li>What I love is after taking it off my skin looks better with use.</li>
            <li>But I love how my skin looks and feels with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this BB Cream.</li>
            <li>BB Cream goes on so lovely and just leaves your face glowing.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, great transaction I will order again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn revlon foundation for years, and was quite pleased with it, but I had to try this.</li>
            <li>This provided more coverage with one application.</li>
            <li>Like the pick bottle much better.</li>
            <li>I am a NC20-25 shade and it definitely matched my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li>I would say this is more of a medium coverage</li>
            <li>This is my favorite bb cream of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Before I&#x27;ve tried this, I&#x27;ve tried missha, ihope, mammonde, laniege, rimmel London, and more</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make me get pimples and that&#x27;s what I love about it most.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find a product to cover up my inperfections on my face and this one covers it 90%.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m darker than most Asians.</li>
            <li>I like the consistency of this a lot better.</li>
            <li>And it blends in with my skin more.</li>
            <li>I love using this during the winter.</li>
            <li>so be safe and buy from the manufacturer&#x27;s site.</li>
            <li>but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Working great, thanks.</li>
            <li>Researched online the various BB creams and found that these are the best the ones.  </li>
            <li>My daughter introduced me to this product, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>One of my most favorite BB cream I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I just wished it covered imperfections a bit more</li>
            <li>so well it makes my skin glow :)</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>It works like magic.</li>
            <li>I have waited a week to write a review just to be sure.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this product.</li>
            <li>and i prefer this 10x more than those.</li>
            <li>And it also came wrapped in bubble wrap and the outside container the bb cream container was in was a bit damaged but the product itself was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the company that sells it</li>
            <li>And it also came wrapped in bubble wrap and the outside container the bb cream container was in was a bit damaged but the product itself was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>absolutely love it and WILL purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I really love the Skin79 BB cream line.</li>
            <li>My friend from Korea recommended this product and I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li>I really love that it also has SPF and whitening (for my scars).     </li>
            <li>I have used many BB creams this one and</li>
            <li>there are many out there</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look brighter and give my face a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I love the packaging and the feel of the product.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy make up at all over the internet except from Sephora, or unless I have used the product before and know for sure that it will work on me.</li>
            <li>I love the look of the bottle.</li>
            <li>The color is more flesh toned, not gray at all.</li>
            <li>I still use this BB cream from time to time and would buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>There are many fakes on here</li>
            <li>my skin color is kind of a light medium tan</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>My skin has a healthier glow and more people compliment me on my skin.</li>
            <li>Overall this product was awesome.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love Skin79&#x27;s BB Cream.</li>
            <li>It has a better consistency and coverage.</li>
            <li>I love that it has SPF in it as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely in love for this product.</li>
            <li>I do feel my skin itself become even better and whiter gradually</li>
            <li>stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this product :)</li>
            <li>I wish that this BB cream came in more shades though.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>is much better.</li>
            <li>I love the ease of use, the coverage, the price is inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I liked the light feel of this cream for medium coverage.  </li>
            <li>decided to try SKIN79 the VIP Gold label for the extra moisture and dewey-ness.&lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly as described.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love that is has the SPF too.</li>
            <li>it, you won&#x27;t regret it. :)</li>
            <li>but my face does seem brighter and my complexion looks a bit more evened out.</li>
            <li>And this foundation feels like nothing on your face which is perfect especially for summer.</li>
            <li>Bb Creams will definitely give you the \\&quot;porcelain\\&quot;, flawless skin look.</li>
            <li>love this you must try it.</li>
            <li>It takes just a minute in the morning to pat and blend this in, focusing on under my eyes and T-zone, to look healthy and glowing.</li>
            <li>I notice many like this one a lot.</li>
            <li>It feel more luxury than lighter ones.</li>
            <li>one of the top 5 products in my make up bag.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>, I like this one better.  </li>
            <li>I heard the Gold edition was more moist for winter time, so I tried it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I mix my foundation with this product (60 foundation/40 balm) and it works much better.</li>
            <li>I hope your experience with their line is as fabulous as mine has been!</li>
            <li>I am in love and I don&#x27;t think I would ever wear anything else.  </li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>always love this product.</li>
            <li>Have all of my friends in love with this stuff</li>
            <li>It moisturizes, makes your skin look flawless better than regular foundation.</li>
            <li>I love this because it has SPF in it too.  </li>
            <li>I love the packaging it&#x27;s in.</li>
            <li>This is more of a tinted moisturizer and is buildable.</li>
            <li>I love what it&#x27;s done for me today</li>
            <li>Could NOT be more pleased.</li>
            <li>And the price is OK as well.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft, blends so well, good as a primer for foundation or alone!</li>
            <li>As you smooth the cream out, it blends into your own skin color, becoming invisible.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use a product that actually feels good on my skin and has some healthy ingredients, not just like a mask or a &amp;#34;cover.&amp;#34;  I appreciate the light hue and SPF also.</li>
            <li>Comes out grey, but eventually evens out perfectly!</li>
            <li>This makeup matches well and gives pretty good coverage without being cakey looking.</li>
            <li>and you have to have pretty good skin to start off.  </li>
            <li>It is wonderful for a quick, light, fast, and easy on the go cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not messy at all, easy application, and very easy to blend!!</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure I will love Lioele Beyond the Solution as well but if not I&#x27;ll update this review!  :)</li>
            <li>I will surely continue to order this product and strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Goes on greyish, but quickly adjusts to your own skin tone once it warms up to body temp.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good buy &amp; good alternate makeup.  </li>
            <li>Also, the most important thing is the product is authentic as the seller stated.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d easily pay twice as much for this kind of cosmetic excellence!</li>
            <li>The color is fine for my NW 13 skin, although the Missha Signature Wrinkle Filler #21 was better (I just didn&#x27;t do well with the fragrance in Missha).</li>
            <li>This is just an amazing product, and the price is really not expensive!</li>
            <li>It smells nice, is super hypoallergenic and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>am a white woman, with very fair skin.  </li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned, I almost always buy my foundations in Ivory or the next shade darker and this works well with my skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to look their best!</li>
            <li>It gives a great natural appearance.</li>
            <li>It is almost like magic the way it just transforms your skin to give you a blemish free face.</li>
            <li>but I love how light it is and how you can apply it with your hands if you want.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll probably enjoy the sebum control more now.shment\\</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll probably enjoy the sebum control more now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this first foray into beblesh balm, and I&#x27;ve let my husband know that he can go spackle</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for light coverage, Super+BB Cream will do the magic.</li>
            <li>It has not made me break out, which is one of the most important things to me when buying these creams.</li>
            <li>The cream seems to reduce the size of my pores and make my skin smooth and more refined.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Lancôme absolute makeup because I loved the moisturizing aspect.</li>
            <li>It feels good and looks very nature.</li>
            <li>I use my mineral hygienics foundation in medium golden over it and then contour with their warm kiss and then apply the rest of my makeup</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t take much to get good coverage.</li>
            <li>I bought this item a year ago and I loved it, it was the real thing and worked well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also fair skinned, thanks to being a redhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re nowhere near as good, and most of them either cost as much or more than Skin79.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-- Light and airy and easy to apply and blend - I love he way</li>
            <li>But, the price is great, and it was super fast shipping, so thank you Seoul Glamour ^^</li>
            <li>It minimizes pores, redness, and other inperfections to leave skin looking flawless.</li>
            <li>The bottle is attractive and small, the pump is excellent and it&#x27;s easy to control how much product you want.</li>
            <li>The size is larger than I thought but that means it holds more too, so I am happy.</li>
            <li>One easy step</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this product as I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about from friends and on Asian website reviews, but it didn&#x27;t show the results I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>the pencil can easily be rubbed off, unlike if I darken my eyebrows with no makeup/cream on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the pencil can easily be rubbed off, unlike if I darken my eyebrows with no makeup/cream on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I can easily see this occurring.</li>
            <li>almost see-through so redness is not something I can really easily hide.</li>
            <li>makes my face look clean and healthy</li>
            <li>It blends easily and gives what it promises.</li>
            <li>With this cream, I&#x27;ve noticed that it doesn&#x27;t break me out, and it glides on easily.</li>
            <li>and she strongly recommended this one.</li>
            <li>My skin looks clearer, it goes on very easily and looks super smooth on--doesn&#x27;t sink into wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I liked it a lot so far, my skin looks pretty good better then</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this for you, this product works best on pale or lighter skinned people :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that this helps it adjust to many other skin tones beyond those of us who are very fair</li>
            <li>My lab partner in school asked me what I&#x27;m doing differently because my skin looks so smooth and dewy (made me feel so good!)</li>
            <li>Loving this so much!</li>
            <li>I own three different Skin79 BB creams, and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>when i got in the mail it was so nicely package and when i opened it, it was so pretty.</li>
            <li>but it still hides many major flaws, its specially really good for the morning</li>
            <li>Also huge plus for pumpbottle, it so easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with this BB cream, it not only matches a majority of skin colors but is very moisturizing and conceals evenly!</li>
            <li>i love this product, been using it for the past year and its still the best from others that ive tried</li>
            <li>But I heard so many good things about BB cream in general</li>
            <li>It seems to emphasize the fine lines and wrinkles (I have droopy eyelids), and they look dried-out.  </li>
            <li>It seems to emphasize the fine lines and wrinkles (I have droopy eyelids), and they look dried-out.  </li>
            <li>or so it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>But coverage is medium and covers my freckles and redness just fine.</li>
            <li>I think with some mineral powder to set it in warmer weather, it will be fine.</li>
            <li>It does not settle into pores or fine lines either.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, kinda like my old olay moisturizer.</li>
            <li>otherwise, the bottle is super cute, the packaging was good and came in prompt (even with the normal shipping option), and i got a free sample.</li>
            <li>The color looks good on my fair skin tone because the product has more of a beige color that I usually like.</li>
            <li>It gives great coverage, but it feels light enough to be a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>So this cream was a huge relief with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Light, good for acne prone skin, gets rid of blemishes, makes skin soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a rare win to find something that looks natural on my face..</li>
            <li>I wear it alone or as my primary foundation.</li>
            <li>Overall great product</li>
            <li>It comes out of the bottle much darker then my skin but works amazing.</li>
            <li>This BB cream is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Overall, a GREAT product.</li>
            <li>the scent is light, rosey floral</li>
            <li>and smooth^^</li>
            <li>and I noticed that it makes your skin look really smooth once you apply it.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I&#x27;m Vietnamese and have light...</li>
            <li>And the color really does adjust to light-to-medium skin tones nicely.</li>
            <li>This cream is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I am not asian and it works great.</li>
            <li>I was thinking it would be too light for my skin because I am in America</li>
            <li>it was light on my face</li>
            <li>This bb cream is light to medium coverage</li>
            <li>I also like the light scent of this one.</li>
            <li>I would say this is about light to medium coverage.</li>
            <li>I would say this is about light to medium coverage.</li>
            <li>I use it as a light foundation.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed it whitening my face, but it does even the tone like a light foundation should.</li>
            <li>, i just put a light layer of foundation over it to even it out.</li>
            <li>The opaque container protects the product from the light.</li>
            <li>Light coverage.</li>
            <li>But you do need to dust with light powder or bronzer or it seems to sort of melt off.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is quite light but buildable.</li>
            <li>It is great on Asian skin tone.</li>
            <li>I normally do not write reviews, but this product is too good to pass up!  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>I just got this yesterday but so far so good.</li>
            <li>The gray ashiness that you first get right after application oxidizes within 15 minutes to a beautiful finish that matches my skin tone really well.  </li>
            <li>The price is more than right, too.</li>
            <li>It is great alone, or with blush or other mineral powder on top of it.</li>
            <li>It is a tad thick and grey, but spreads out nicely and evenly and blends perfectly with my skin which is fair</li>
            <li>I think the English translation could use some improvement, but the cream itself gives my skin a very very nice appearance.</li>
            <li>i love this product, it gives me good coverge to my skin and is also suitable for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed when I received this product from Pink Gelee, exactly when the package was said to arrive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m caucasian with a medium-fair skin tone (fair but tan easily)  and even though I believe this brand is aimed at Asian skin tones (has &#x27;whitening&#x27; as one of its selling points)</li>
            <li>This BB Cream was originally raved on youtube by Bubzbeauty.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this product.</li>
            <li>A lot of my usual redness is clearing, and I&#x27;m so impressed a \\&quot;concealer\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I am really excited I found this product</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say Missha&#x27;s BB cream is better overall because its formula feels better and it has a better range of colors.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love it so much though!</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s almost indistinguishable from the original and comes with all the markers of an original, (perforation, expiry date</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product because a beauty guru I watch collects BB Creams</li>
            <li>Missha was the first BB cream I tried, and I thought it was okay</li>
            <li>originally bought the sample box.</li>
            <li>This is my first BB cream, and I like it better than any foundation I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>While it does take quite a while to receive it, it is worth the wait!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, and I&#x27;ve never felt like I had to re-apply it, even after a full day at work.</li>
            <li>I went to the BB Cream website and all of the products are a pretty good chunk of money (around $40 for this particular BB Cream), so I came here.</li>
            <li>but this one is great for the winter when I need a little bit more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>And this color is perfect for me and make my skin look white and young.</li>
            <li>What I like about it is the fact it matches my skin better and look more natural.  </li>
            <li>I have tested so many foundations and this is by far my favorite alternative.</li>
            <li>The first time I wore this, multiple people told me how beautiful I looked that day.</li>
            <li>It works great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants BB Cream, especially a Real SKIN79 BB cream. :)</li>
            <li>Because my skin is so light, all of my blemishes and marks are bright red.</li>
            <li>My skin looks great, and My face isn&#x27;t shiny OR dry.</li>
            <li>However, if I am just staying in or running errands, applying this only makes my face bright and even feels smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin is really tan and after blending the cream in, it sinks perfectly onto my skin.  </li>
            <li>So I received the BB Cream very early which was amazing to me.</li>
            <li>It is more than enough to provide a mild coverage and make the face more bright and natural once it oxidizes!</li>
            <li>i tan easily in summer and probably cannot use this product (maybe can if i have the right powder to put over it...will have to try)...</li>
            <li>After trying many higher end (UD, josie maran, tarte, most things in sephora) and lower end (loreal, CG, etc) foundations/tinted moisturizers/ bb creams (i just want my skin to look normal!</li>
            <li>I love this product and it is by far better than much higher priced BB creams!</li>
            <li>Pink is the lightest color and is great for winter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll stay dry and keep my face fine for a good 6</li>
            <li>I found oriental bb gold too oily at the end of day (though loved its initial dewiness),  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>I really love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t suggest a full pump or it&#x27;s too oily.</li>
            <li>Trying this gold vip by Skin 79, I did notice the coverage wasn&#x27;t full coverage like Missha&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Good for daily sunscreen wear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the company that sells it (my shipping estimated time was supposed to be at least 4 weeks</li>
            <li>I heard so much about how magic BB cream is.</li>
            <li>Bare Minimum Pressed Powder for a more skin-like natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Lioele Triple the Solution BB Cream out of curiosity, and after applying it on my skin I was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful my skin looks!  </li>
            <li>It instantly covered my blemishes and did a good job at concealing acne scars as well.</li>
            <li>2 at the most, towards the end of the year.&lt;br /&gt;I really want to try the orange VIP</li>
            <li>I have a fair complexion that can get a bit sallow at times, especially during a winter like this one.</li>
            <li>I know that BB creams &amp;#34;adjust&amp;#34; to your color, but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>I have light to medium skin tone with golden tones.</li>
            <li>but three days is not enough time to tell me how good the product is for me.    </li>
            <li>Were those words true?</li>
            <li>I recommend the sampler before buying in full.</li>
            <li>If you have very cool toned skin and are pretty pale, it&#x27;s good and it&#x27;ll blend in better.</li>
            <li>(it also makes a great gift) and probably won&#x27;t buy the other foundation again.</li>
            <li>If it was less gray and more yellow, it would&#x27;ve been perfect.</li>
            <li>but it oxidizes really quick and</li>
            <li>My blush looks more vibrant and stays in place all day with this.</li>
            <li>On a side note I purchased from Pink Gelee and they are amazing and totally authentic products.</li>
            <li>The smell is light(powdery)and disappears quickly.</li>
            <li>This SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li>Received the package quickly with no</li>
            <li>this BB cream is very helpful for me,as it is light and fit to our skin.</li>
            <li>My morning routine is so quick:</li>
            <li>I purchased the Skin79 Super+</li>
            <li>SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li>SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li>I have had acne for most of the last 2 decades and have scars from it, and this bb cream covers better then concealer and foundation.</li>
            <li>The coverage of this bb cream is adequate.</li>
            <li>and it has improved my skin tremendously</li>
            <li>and I set my BB cream with Maybelline Dream Matte Powder for a super matte finish or Sonia Kashuk</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased it several times and I love it :)</li>
            <li>I have mild rosacea on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>That quickly blends in and disappears though.  </li>
            <li>and we both enjoy it very much.  </li>
            <li>I personally prefer Skin79 Hot Pink for the more matte finish, but this formula is wonderful for me in the winter.</li>
            <li>I was very much looking forward to trying out this product after reading so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>This was my very first BB cream I purchased for myself.</li>
            <li>I can say that this seller is VERY fast at shipping!</li>
            <li>My very first BB cream.</li>
            <li>I put it on everyday like sunscreen protection, highly recommend to my friend, very good product!</li>
            <li>and If i get more info if this is just a new design for the vip gold.</li>
            <li>It took about four days to deliver and the product is 100% authentic and brand new.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works like a charm -- great coverage with half a pump</li>
            <li>I have fair, sensitive acne prone skin and normal foundation breaks me out.</li>
            <li>I absolutely fell in love with this product the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>It had pretty good coverage.. not as sheer as some BB creams</li>
            <li>Exactly what i was looking for!</li>
            <li>it have pretty good coverage,  tones down the redness, and gives me a clean smooth and dewy  look.</li>
            <li>and it really was  great for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>And comparing them, i personally like this one better, because this is soo moisturizing and easy to apply with my fingers.</li>
            <li>Very light and natural on the skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth, natural looking.</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding foundations that match me because I&#x27;m very fair and seem to oxidize everything.</li>
            <li>great product for me because i need little to no coverage.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and when I first put it on it seems too dark but blends in and looks fine when I spread it around - it evens out my skin tone</li>
            <li>(because of my lack of past experience), but i can say that this was a very good first experience with bb cream.</li>
            <li>The color matches my light olive tone very well.</li>
            <li>I really like its texture, since I did have a light tan</li>
            <li>Even when I have not used this for a few days, my skin still looks great.</li>
            <li>It is light and it doesn&#x27;t oxidize as much as Skin79, but the finish makes my skin look like my skin</li>
            <li>It is so light and blends very well with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>i have combo oily skin and rarely break out.  </li>
            <li>my skin cleared up even more and my blemish scars have almost completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>The fast shipment really did make me love this product</li>
            <li>definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I am 41 years old and thought this may be a better try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it offers a better (medium) coverage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does seem a bit challenging to wash off completely.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does seem a bit challenging to wash off completely.  </li>
            <li>then i pat a bit more on my old acne scars and any blemishes i may have.</li>
            <li>It is a more light to medium coverage which was the only thing that bothered me.</li>
            <li>This BB cream is amazing, this is actually one of my top 5 favorite bb cream, i did buy the pink one and this one.</li>
            <li>Love that it uses a natural (Titanium dioxide) sunscreen.</li>
            <li>What everyone says is true -- the product does at first look greyish when you put it on your skin.</li>
            <li>various (caucasian) skin tones and found that it miraculously blends to their own skin as well.</li>
            <li>and so i bought it in hopes of it making my skin look more evened out and natural</li>
            <li>When used with enough powder and blush, this can serve as a nice canvas.</li>
            <li>Liole triple action BB cream is even better.</li>
            <li>I never use my old makeup now, this just looks so much better.</li>
            <li>If you want want any authentic Skin79 products than buy it directly from Skin79&#x27;s website.    </li>
            <li>I am fairly light skinned and have not had any issues with my face and neck looking different colors :)</li>
            <li>Wish it lasts a bit longer but overall, it is a nice product.</li>
            <li>I went with the Skin 79 brand based on very positive reviews.</li>
            <li>and I love how it matches my skin better than the other line.  </li>
            <li>I started using the gold version, which I equally love, for when I want a more dewy natural look since it&#x27;s more moisturizing than the hot pink version.  </li>
            <li>anyway aside from the grayish undertone, its best for dry skin people since my skin is all dry.</li>
            <li>This has a pretty light coverage, but it&#x27;s buildable which is great, as I can add layers on my nose and cheeks without it looking thick or clumpy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably try that one at some point, just to see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on this is very good, especially considering how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>I applied it to my face and it evened out my skin tone and shine right away.</li>
            <li>With this cream, it feels so lightweight, and gives me just the right amount of coverage that I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>First off, in case I wasn&#x27;t clear, I love this BB cream.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is thick and gel like with great full coverage.</li>
            <li>use a primer with this, and build it a bit for coverage, and am happy with that, more so after I began following a beauty blogger&#x27;s advice to pat-pat-pat upon application (previously I&#x27;d been using a foundation brush).</li>
            <li>The price is worth it because my Loreal True Match Foundation costs just as much</li>
            <li>This BB cream at first has a grayish tint (which at first is quite jarring!)</li>
            <li>Asian brand BB Creams are much better than their American counterparts (many US brands are just tinted moisturizers) and when you compare the ingredients and read up about what a BB Cream started out as and what it&#x27;s supposed to do you&#x27;ll see the huge differences.</li>
            <li>Also, I read that the Beyond the Solution has a more natural coloring since there&#x27;s no SPF (no white ashiness like most BB cream</li>
            <li>I can layer it on thicker in some areas for more coverage and barely use concealer over it.  </li>
            <li>However, I found the staying power of this product to not be as good, it melted off my face half way thru the day.  </li>
            <li>I loved how it gave me a natural look and last all day.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s light coverage looks very natural.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast</li>
            <li>I like this product very much - for the price</li>
            <li>but so far this product works fine on me</li>
            <li>first, which is also very reasonably priced and gives a nourished, matte look to my otherwise shiny face.</li>
            <li>This was my first BB cream and it raised the bar in my book.</li>
            <li>When I first squeezed it out, I was worried; it was a yellowish-grayish, blah-looking moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is the first BB cream I have tried.</li>
            <li>I got the Skin 79 Oriental Gold BB cream first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as soft and light as a tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li>This was my first bb cream</li>
            <li>I absolutely enjoy it so far.</li>
            <li>At first, it leaves somewhat of a greyish cast</li>
            <li>Using a powder similar to your coloring will help make this skin79 product &#x27;match up&#x27; to ur skin coloring (IF you are about nc30 or more).  </li>
            <li>It isnt drying, and u dont become &#x27;oily&#x27; after several hours (not quite dewy but healthy moisturized skin).  </li>
            <li>I have pretty oily skin</li>
            <li>It was my first time ever trying one, and after researching/ looking up Youtube reviews/</li>
            <li>It is not a fake product.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time ever using a BB cream product.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of any sort of BB cream.</li>
            <li>First off I have to make notice that I am acne prone</li>
            <li>The cream may first appear to be sort of grayish when first apply; however, after an hour it blend in pretty well.</li>
            <li>This was my first BB cream purchase ever</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy again from neverprice &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>Well this was my first BB cream</li>
            <li>A light dewy finish with a soft feel to it.</li>
            <li>The coverage is smooth and natural looking~</li>
            <li>This was my first order on the Amazon site</li>
            <li>it would have saved me soooo much money!</li>
            <li>This stuff is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>this product gives you a light natural coverage with a lightening effect.</li>
            <li>Just received my first bottle of SKIN79 BB cream VIP Gold Collection.  </li>
            <li>This was my first experience with BB cream.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty clear and smooth already</li>
            <li>By the way, this product is not fake.</li>
            <li>It also gives a pretty glow.  </li>
            <li>and it is flaky on my forehead and cheeks, but this bb cream is very moisturizing and does not accentuate my flakiness at all!</li>
            <li>I completely love this product and it will definitely replace my moisturizer and tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li>I had the pleasure of using this bb cream as my first experience with bb cream, and ordering anything on amazon.  </li>
            <li>I first tried this product on my hand</li>
            <li>So, before I purchased this product, I have tried the Missha BB cream first</li>
            <li>It goes on so much smoother than Missha&#x27;s and it melts in your skin so it feels like you aren&#x27;t wearing anything at all!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s really no telling what kind of concoction you&#x27;d be putting on your skin</li>
            <li>A lot more sheer that what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>It does have a grayish tone when you first put it on</li>
            <li>The company \\&quot;SeoulGlamour\\&quot; seemed reputable based on the multiple reviews here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My advice at this point, honestly is, if you want the real thing without any deception then order straight from the company that actually makes the product.</li>
            <li>My skin has NEVER been this clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>and on days when I need more coverage I mix it with my regular makeup</li>
            <li>just in case, I wanted to try it) and the VIP Gold collection is pretty</li>
            <li>When it first comes out I was really scared because it looked kind of grey...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad this also contains SPF even though I still wear it under my daily moisturizer with SPF 30.</li>
            <li>I ordered my first bottle over a year ago and used it off and on.</li>
            <li>only muchmuch better.  </li>
            <li>I first heard about this product through a YouTube beauty guru who recommended it.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>if you like having lighter skin or if you do have light skin, this&#x27;ll be it for your foundation, but because i like my face looking natural</li>
            <li>It is a bit ashy at first but after a while it gets close to my skin tone albeit lighter.</li>
            <li>Not quite as nice as the pink version on my skin, but as advertised.</li>
            <li>I am also getting on a bit in age, but am holding out pretty well.</li>
            <li>First off this product shipped and arrived a lot faster than the estimated delivery time.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using BB cream</li>
            <li>It gives me a even skintone without sticking and leaving my skin soft and smooth throughout the day.</li>
            <li>This one especially, and it matches my skin more than the others.</li>
            <li>They each are all 100% real!</li>
            <li>Provides just right amount of moist needed for certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li>This came in the mail just yesterday, and I already feel confident enough to rate it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>But I finally have! :)</li>
            <li>I was a bit worried at first, but it worked out quite well.</li>
            <li>there, TWIST the top of the canister off and you can see that you have 85-90% of product left.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>When I first applied it, it didn&#x27;t seem to give a lot of coverage.</li>
            <li>Good product, covers well but tends to have a greyish coverage, not good for my light skin.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It really helps keep my skin hydrated and relaxed throughout the day!</li>
            <li>unlike several of the reviews that I&#x27;ve read here, it is an authentic product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Caucasian with fair skin and a few freckles.</li>
            <li>Good for an everyday look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Previously: I think Refinery29 had glowingly reviewed the [[ASIN:B00EC43CK0 Skin79 Hot Pink Super Plus Bb Cream 40g Spf25 Pa++_pump]], but as an over-50 minimalist with a rather ruddy Caucasian complexion, I too went with this Gold version instead, and have been SO pleased.</li>
            <li>when I know I&#x27;m going to have my picture taken since SPF reflects light particles, making your face super white and glowy in photographs.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t so much as developed a whitehead since using any of the BB creams, and this particular one does the best job of hiding old acne scars, veins, and puffy, dark circles.</li>
            <li>Like most other BB creams, brightens my skin very nicely although it does darken a little over time (oxidizes).</li>
            <li>although because I spent most of my summer in Taiwan and Japan which is very hot and humid, it melted off my face a bit.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the packaging was attractive, but it just did not do what I had expected.</li>
            <li>Natural, slightly dewy look that I really like - great for a no-makeup look</li>
            <li>And to top it off, my skin used to be full of acne scars and dark spots.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this BB cream if you&#x27;re skin tone is light to a medium golden shade.</li>
            <li>I love that it has sunscreen which works very well - I recently hiked in Italy for hours in the sun and was never burned.  </li>
            <li>completely get rid of any acne and lighten dark spots and freckles, ntm anti aging, which is best to start young with not wait until you&#x27;re old,</li>
            <li>This is light feeling, but offers pretty decent coverage.</li>
            <li>I did hear the Pink one is good during the summer months when you are a little more darker.  </li>
            <li>I went on reading reviews online and heard a lot of positive feedback</li>
            <li>On days I don&#x27;t wear this, no problems, so I am positive that this is the cause.  </li>
            <li>I am able to cover my minor spider veins, but it feels like I am wearing nothing.</li>
            <li>There seem to be many comments on a grey undertone being seen on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I am able to cover under eye circles and minor blemishes without looking or feeling like I&#x27;m wearing a mask.</li>
            <li>I am sure once I have some color this will be my summer BB cream, I just have to figure out how to counter the grey tones.  </li>
            <li>First, the box and everything seem real even with an stick when u peel off</li>
            <li>This BB cream works really well and hides the pores on my nose which are pretty large and noticeable.</li>
            <li>Will be using this for a very long time :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Missha for a very long time, love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I ordered super BB cream about two weeks ago, I am 20 years old Caucasian and have combination skin.</li>
            <li>The packaging was really cute, came in a plastic hot pink wrap -</li>
            <li>The packaging was really cute, came in a plastic hot pink wrap -</li>
            <li>so I started using Skin79 hot pink BB cream, which I fell in love with.  </li>
            <li>This is easily set with a powder and definitely lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I still have wrinkles but they seem less noticeable when one&#x27;s skin tone is nice and even.  </li>
            <li>If you have dry skin though, it will probably work better for you.</li>
            <li>The VIP gold is recommended for dry skin, however I will use it during the summer but mostly during the winter.</li>
            <li>I recommend this method instead of rubbing in large swathes like lotion.</li>
            <li>And I certainly buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This could be positive in that it really stays on, even through sweat/water, but I worry it&#x27;ll clog my pores.  </li>
            <li>This could be positive in that it really stays on, even through sweat/water, but I worry it&#x27;ll clog my pores.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 27, but feel \\&quot;old\\&quot;, I guess, so I bought this silver version, since some reviewers who were older said the pink label seemed more appropriate for younger skin.  </li>
            <li>The container functions as a simple pump which is easy to use and very hygienic.</li>
            <li>Everything else seems fine besides the things I mentioned above.</li>
            <li>to mention that these above BB creams also lasts all day, and stays matte on my super oily skin without ever having to blot!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing foundation, though in heat or humidity, it does get a little shiny for my taste.</li>
            <li>It goes on a bit grayish but after a few mins looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Within a few minutes my skin looked amazing.</li>
            <li>Oriental gold is more moisturizing, which I did not really need.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>The coverage is MUCH better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Turns out the two creams were very close in color.</li>
            <li>I do not even need a whole pump to cover my face</li>
            <li>BB creams tend not to have that much coverage</li>
            <li>Later skin79 gold adjusts a bit to my skin color though i think it is a tad light for me.  </li>
            <li>I really think powdering is a must for this product.  </li>
            <li>This could be the real thing.</li>
            <li>And so much so that I don&#x27;t even need to wear foundation at all sometimes (</li>
            <li>This product does not take away real \\&quot;problem\\&quot; areas, but does cover up redness and evens the skin out.</li>
            <li>that much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>North Americans really need to try this cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very tan with red/yellow undertones</li>
            <li>Also it moisturizes my skin really well,</li>
            <li>I am Chinese and have light medium skin and it works.</li>
            <li>It freaked her out initially because it looked so light.</li>
            <li>This was shipped straight from Korea and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing, but even with my acne-prone, oily skin, I see fewer breakouts, and my skin stays matte longer than when I use oil-control products.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Additionally, it makes drawing/darkening my eyebrows a bit trickier since using the pencil on top of this stuff is almost like \\&quot;wet</li>
            <li>I believe this product really does improve skin to an extent</li>
            <li>Additionally, it makes drawing/darkening my eyebrows a bit trickier since using the pencil on top of this stuff is almost like \\&quot;wet</li>
            <li>I believe this product really does improve skin to an extent overtime.</li>
            <li>I hope very girl has a BB cream like that.</li>
            <li>I really like the coverage, medium-light</li>
            <li>I would consider this a medium coverage much like my revlon age defying.</li>
            <li>I absolutely swear by this BB Cream now.</li>
            <li>Seller was fast with shipping.</li>
            <li>if you have to rub it in you are using too much.</li>
            <li>It blends in really well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>so it doesnt cover as much</li>
            <li>it removes all the black/dark areas under your eyes and nose, it makes your whole skin seem smoother</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really brakeout.</li>
            <li>They helped so much.</li>
            <li>but I just absolutely adore it.</li>
            <li>visibly reduces redness for me, but I wouldn&#x27;t say you can conceal much with it.</li>
            <li>It visibly reduces redness for me, but I wouldn&#x27;t say you can conceal much with it.</li>
            <li>I apply with a foundation brush (makes ALL the difference) and gently dust a translucent powder over it with a fan brush to set.</li>
            <li>However, it evens out the whole face and and gives you a glow look.</li>
            <li>It made my oily/shiny skin matte for the whole day and it feels like I have nothing on.</li>
            <li>I did NOT want to put it on my face and was really scared to try it.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.    </li>
            <li>the pink one are my favorite they have no smell</li>
            <li>The cream works very well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t help so much with the pores, but it got rid of the dryness without being greasy.</li>
            <li>(I have light to medium skin tone, with yellow undertone), but this doesn&#x27;t match my skin tone at all.</li>
            <li>Very fancy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Straight out of the box</li>
            <li>and Pink Gelee has authentic products.  </li>
            <li>Item arrived very promptly considering where it is coming from.</li>
            <li>The color blends very well and does not look oily.</li>
            <li>But the pink Skin79 bb cream has a better finish.</li>
            <li>The make-up aspect alone and the price make this an absolute must-buy.</li>
            <li>The pump is very hygienic and the container has 40 g of product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put too much cream on, just about 1/2 a pump.</li>
            <li>I really like the texture and coverage</li>
            <li>It is very affordable and I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li>makes my skin very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a light/medium coverage very silky and leaves your skin looking very healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage, so if you&#x27;ll still need concealer to cover up spots.</li>
            <li>It does adjust to some extent, but it&#x27;s definitely still a shade too light for me.</li>
            <li>Its a very creamy texture and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your whole face</li>
            <li>really is the Gold of creams</li>
            <li>Pink Gelee sent an authentic item.  </li>
            <li>This covers redness really well</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really tell how it has improved my skin</li>
            <li>Then I pat this all over and lightly blend, repeating to add layers to specific areas as needed.</li>
            <li>The seller also shipped it so fast</li>
            <li>I just have very acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>it feels light on my skin , and it&#x27;s not that white</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is absolutely everything i wanted that others couldn&#x27;t provide.</li>
            <li>(I am white fair skin with pink undertones).  </li>
            <li>I only use it several times, so far so good.</li>
            <li>This product provides a nice even coverage without the heavy makeup feel.  </li>
            <li>The finish is not completely matte, it&#x27;s more dewey but not shiny, it literally looks like normal skin.</li>
            <li>I have a few nice foundations already</li>
            <li>Prior to this one I was using the Maybelline BB cream, which I found offers better coverage.</li>
            <li>It looks nice indoors, but outdoors or under heavy lighting you can sort of tell a difference.</li>
            <li>The texture is kind of heavy</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Warning: it really is grey-ish at first like most other reviews say, but evens out to a normal neutral skin look.</li>
            <li>The day I tried it on my face, someone at work made a comment on how my freckles were super apparent that day.</li>
            <li>because the product gives light coverage but does quite a good job on blemishes, I still use my concealer to conceal my dark circles and uneven spots.   </li>
            <li>The product is authentic IF you buy it from WorldInc365, i dont know about the other sellers.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll have to open it up and get your pennies&#x27; worth!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you&#x27;ve tried the drugstore bb creams and are ready for the real deal.</li>
            <li>I will be disappointed if it is because it looks so good on and matches my pale skin perfectly.</li>
            <li>This makes me question whether the BB cream is genuine and I&#x27;ll just go back to ordering from my normal vendor.</li>
            <li>After about 30 minutes when the oxidizing is complete, it pretty much blends in perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, i have to have powder for this or it wont last long and coloring looks  a bit off.  </li>
            <li>but Im not sure if this is good for sensitive skin with acne.</li>
            <li>It made a nice first layer for my concealer to stick to and didn&#x27;t look thick or like I was wearing five pounds of makeup.  </li>
            <li>This shipped quickly and is a genuine SKIN79 product, which I verified by doing a little homework.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really make me more or less oily.</li>
            <li>It settles into my smile lines and the fine lines around my eyes a little, but that may be because I have to super-moisturize that area.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my sister who have dry skin and it work perfectly fine for her.</li>
            <li>I cannot describe exactly what it does, basically makes your face all one color, and clear.</li>
            <li>I think it is very hit and miss with people with normal type skin.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m asian and fair with definite yellow undertones, and I found that this bb cream has sort of a pink-ish tint to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 36 and have a fair complexion with very small pores, experience significant oiliness and, depending on the weather, severe dryness, and have a long history of cystic acne (read:</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m on differin and quite acne prone), is light enough and DOESN&#x27;T oxidize!, doesn&#x27;t show my dry skin flakes or cause dry flakes, can be light or full coverage depending on how much you want</li>
            <li>One recommendation though is that a little goes a long way, you don&#x27;t need too much to get good coverage, just about a pump or two for your whole face + a bit of your neck.</li>
            <li>One recommendation though is that a little goes a long way, you don&#x27;t need too much to get good coverage, just about a pump or two for your whole face + a bit of your neck.</li>
            <li>I have very fair and sensitive skin, so I was skeptical on whether or not this will work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I kept on using the BB cream for about a month until I noticed that it made my skin really dry and patchy around my eyebrow (especially right above my nose, between the eyebrows), and mouth area.</li>
            <li>and I was concerned about fake products; I&#x27;m happy to report that this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I used it as a foundation everyday and It feel really nice and natural</li>
            <li>It keeps my face moisturized and provides decent coverage.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good cream for everyday use without breakouts or drying of the skin.</li>
            <li>PULL the top of the bottle up (grab onto the indent in the back and spout) to get to the inner canister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would use this one if my skin was being particularly uncooperative (redness, blemishes, etc.).</li>
            <li>one is only slightly more gray than Skin79&#x27;s hot pink BB cream, but I like its texture a bit</li>
            <li>VERY NATURAL!</li>
            <li>I have used the Skin79 hot pink BB cream before and decided to try this as I&#x27;ve heard that it is similar except with more anti-wrinkle properties.</li>
            <li>what i didn&#x27;t like about the bottle was that each time i pressed down the top for a new bead, it would practically \\&quot;shoot\\&quot; the bb cream out of the nozzle.</li>
            <li>so I highly suggest not to use this if you plan to go out at night if you&#x27;re going to take pictures with flash.</li>
            <li>I highly highly highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for those looking for light/moderate coverage that is lightweight.</li>
            <li>It actually changes color to a nice pale ivory on the skin, not grayish like it first appears.</li>
            <li>This BB cream was originally formulated for people who naturally have grayer undertones in their skin, so for someone with white undertones like me, it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I like to wear it without much of other makeup for a more natural look and feel like on weekends to do errands.  </li>
            <li>- I wish for a little more coverage.</li>
            <li>However it covers a little better.</li>
            <li>Not as thick in feel and in coverage as others (particularly Dr. Jart+) which translates to not as nice of coverage.</li>
            <li>The holographic logo rubs off very easily which should be a clear warning that the product&#x27;s not genuine.</li>
            <li>It&#x60;s thick, but it apply very easily and stayed whole day.</li>
            <li>(so don&#x27;t be like me and press the top all the way down!).</li>
            <li>The difference between this item and the one listed on the Skin79 North America website, is that this one is the older version, whereas the New &amp; Improved version is listed on the official site.  </li>
            <li>I got it for almost half the original price!</li>
            <li>Real Complete B.B BB Cream SPF25</li>
            <li>PA++ No. 21 Light Pink Beige]](nice)</li>
            <li>It made my skin look really matte and natural-</li>
            <li>SURE to understand what the product does and determine what U need before buying as if I used this everyday on my face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m exciting to see it help fade some hyperpigmentation from acne, but I also get glycolic peels and occasional microderms to help with that</li>
            <li>I have dehydrated but oily/combination skin and have not been able to use foundation to cover up my uneven skin tone and blemishes because I get so greasy.</li>
            <li>This will work nicely on normal skin</li>
            <li>I have deep golden tan skin color</li>
            <li>When I first tried the product it was a strange grey/brownish color and felt really funny.</li>
            <li>My skin is mainly dry, and her skin is a little oily and she loved it because it mattified  her skin.</li>
            <li>Normally I would just use a powder foundation but that made my dehydrated skin even more dry (especially in the winter).</li>
            <li>The weird thing is when I tried it on the back of my hand, it looked really ashy and grey like what some of the reviewers said but when I put it on my face it was fine, and after about 30-45 minutes (after it oxidize) it looked great.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it is a great product and I plan to purchase the Pink Label, which is for oily skin next.</li>
            <li>It is pretty good also but feels a little heavy and itchy for me.</li>
            <li>I have had coworkers compliment my skin and asked if I have a new makeup up.</li>
            <li>So I am eager to brag about my new BB cream.</li>
            <li>I was quite leary of buying yet something new.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after applying it, it was extremely grey and light (as expected) but after a few minutes (20 min+) it started to match my skin color more!</li>
            <li>I bought this one over the pink one, because on youtube, the pink one was popular with the 20 somethings.</li>
            <li>The Missha covers a tiny bit better but is not as hydrating as this formula and is harder to spread on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also 5 stars to the seller.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased a very high quality, very expensive foundation, and honestly, this stuff works better than that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on chalky and grey in color at first, but don&#x27;t panic!</li>
            <li>For those with VERY sensitive skin like me, use a protective moisturizer before application of the BB</li>
            <li>Very natural look.</li>
            <li>Gives a very natural finish even when you look at yourself upclose.</li>
            <li>Overall the product is good, be wary of the sellers on Amazon and check the reviews first!</li>
            <li>My T-zone gets really oily and my cheeks stay dry even in the summer after cleansing, and I found that this really didn&#x27;t give me any flakes like some makeup products do, but it also didn&#x27;t make my t-zone look oily!</li>
            <li>I did set with bare minerals powder and it looks better than my usual tinted moisturizer (more coverage, but less color)so</li>
            <li>thought this was just an ordinary moisturizer, and was seeking something that wouldn&#x27;t encourage blackheads or oil, as many ones I have tried do, and my skin is very, very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Product is very easy to apply, only takes a little and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>I have researched this product, and it is the exact same product that is being offered by a website called prettyandcute.com, where they sell all Korean beauty products.  </li>
            <li>I recently started trying BB creams and paid $40 for a version from Boscia which was better than the aforementioned options but didn&#x27;t provide quite enough coverage for my tastes.</li>
            <li>This might be due to the fact that I am in my mid 20&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have that many wrinkles to begin with.    </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>better packaged (a small box with packing popcorn vs. a padded envelope);</li>
            <li>I usually do not leave reviews, but felt like this one deserved it.</li>
            <li>It does leave a white cast when taking flash photography, so be aware of that.</li>
            <li>It does leave a white cast when taking flash photography, so be aware of that.</li>
            <li>I have gotten several compliments on my skin since using this which is a first for me.  </li>
            <li>I do not usually wear a lot of make up</li>
            <li>The Skin 79 green is a bit paler and a better match, but sadly settles into wrinkles and pores, even with a good primer and moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seriously, you are going to send expired BB cream to someone who obviously is trying to get something good for their skin?</li>
            <li>I personally purchased this product and the Super Plus BB Triple Functions Hot Pink BB Cream, and have not had any problems.  </li>
            <li>I really like the scent although it fades pretty fast so if it bothers you, I&#x27;m not sure if it would matter so much</li>
            <li>If you have even slightly tan skin it will probably do that since it is so light.</li>
            <li>This was my first BB cream and honestly, I was not impressed.</li>
            <li>i think what happened was that every time after pressing the top down, air bubbles would get caught in the tube (or nozzle) and the next time i would use it, the air bubbles would pop out of the nozzle and cause the shooting...</li>
            <li>Worth every single penny.</li>
            <li>I am light with yellow undertones, and even though it has a slight grayish cast upon initial application, it adjusts quickly and gives me a dewy finish.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything from oil-controlling foundation (too drying) to mineral powder foundation (too cakey) to tinted moisturizer (doesn&#x27;t last long) which have all been mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>The seller wrapped the product tight and securely and nothing was damaged.</li>
            <li>I use it daily for the most part, but I am admittedly lazy about it -- even not remembering to use it everyday, the results are STILL stunning.</li>
            <li>It evened out my face like a foundation, but wasn&#x27;t dry or cakey; it blended right in and felt amay-zing.</li>
            <li>The color looked a bit flat at first but after a minute or so it looked natural with my skin.</li>
            <li>I have sun spots, large pores, redness &amp; all the age related marks on my face.  </li>
            <li>I do like it, but still feel like its still a little too light.</li>
            <li>but this was still a little too light for me.</li>
            <li>I have one fine smile line that appears when I&#x27;m dehydrated or tired.</li>
            <li>The only con is that after four or more hours, it starts to get a little \\&quot;oily feeling\\&quot; but it&#x27;s nothing</li>
            <li>It does lighten my skin a little, and better yet, evens out everything and gracefully covers some of my red</li>
            <li>in conclusion, I highly recommend these BB Creams: Skin79 Hot Pink, Skin79 Gold,</li>
            <li>This BB cream is a new one for me, as I used to use the similar BB cream made by the same company, but in super hot pink color.</li>
            <li>I naturally have clear skin but was looking for something to smooth it out a little.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very moisturizing which is great for the windy winter weather that dries my skin so bad.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if this provides great coverage, but it made my skin have an awkward gray undertone.</li>
            <li>Then it has this rectanglular dent in which the clear plastic part of the bottom of the bottle dents in.</li>
            <li>I have clear skin</li>
            <li>and my skin looks even and clear.</li>
            <li>Under Primer (clear)</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft not sticky.</li>
            <li>but it covers so well, and looks SO natural.</li>
            <li>It has a sticker that says natural science skin solution near the bottom.</li>
            <li>It also causes my skin to look very oily and shiny after several hours of using it.</li>
            <li>But it adjusted to her chemistry and looks completely natural.</li>
            <li>It was in a small, hot pink plastic bag which I thought was cute.</li>
            <li>If you feel that a tinted moisturizer doesn&#x27;t give enough coverage and that a liquid foundation adds too much grease go with this BB cream...</li>
            <li>Fakes will also have a date of manufacture on the back, the real has it on the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li>As for any anti-aging properties the product claims to have, I can&#x27;t vouch for that yet as I am 22 years old.</li>
            <li>Makes face look old and sallow</li>
            <li>It is not heavy at all</li>
            <li>Covers old acne scars, redness and makes my skin tone look even.</li>
            <li>the appearance of old acne scars is beginning to fade away.</li>
            <li>A solution I&#x27;ve heard (although don&#x27;t approve of) is to skip moisturizing completely before putting the BB cream on.</li>
            <li>this is extremely natural looking unless you put powder on to minimize the shine (if you have oily skin) but for me, i had to wait around 1.5 to 2 hours for the gray tone to blend to my skin</li>
            <li>I have had acne roseacea since i was eight years old (I&#x27;m 33).</li>
            <li>But then it blends into your natural skin color and makes you look radiant.</li>
            <li>Only 1 pump is needed for the whole face</li>
            <li>Not too heavy and not too light.</li>
            <li>I have had adult acne (vulgaris) for 42+ years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It brightened my skin and leaves a really soft, moisturizing glow (without looking oily).</li>
            <li>I really am surprised this went with my tan skin tone.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t give off the natural matte look that I prefer for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li>So all in all I like this product and would repurchase and recommend it, especially if you don&#x27;t have a whole lot of scars or spots to cover.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and last all day.</li>
            <li>It look so natural as if I don&#x27;t have any make up on.</li>
            <li>It fits my Asian skin very well.</li>
            <li>SO all I can say is WOW.</li>
            <li>and WOW.</li>
            <li>last night after I removed my makeup and washed my face, my skin still looked very even and refined.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating without feeling greasy or oily, actually feels weightless.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and gives it the moisture it needs throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many different foundations and as someone who just a few years ago never even had to wear foundation and now has to --</li>
            <li>I had been using Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream, but felt it was too heavy and didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>(if you like that then use it).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a keeper for me - I&#x27;ll use Missha on days I don&#x27;t need the extra moisture and will use this one when I&#x27;m a bit dried out and needs more moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Seller</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of foundation, especially during the summer, so I tend to reach for BB creams more often.  </li>
            <li>As with any beauty product, a little goes a long way; which makes it an even better investment.</li>
            <li>The packaging is a little strange since when you run out, you may have more sitting at the bottom</li>
            <li>I was tired of how quickly my tinted moisturizer would wear off, I love how much longer this wears without feeling heavy or looking cake-y.  </li>
            <li>I was a little iffy about buying this product because though I am asian, I definately don&#x27;t have the typical fair porcelain skin.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable, actually costs less than the first three on my list here.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s start by saying I am going to copy and paste this review onto the PINK version because I alternate between the two, the GOLD is more moisturizing for when I dry out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to definitely order again from this particular seller.</li>
            <li>It covers my dark circles better than I would have expected, and it oxidizes within five minutes.</li>
            <li>The pump may stop working early on, which is a major flaw in the packaging.</li>
            <li>My face is a bit oily half way through the day when using this, so I like the pink version much better for my skin type.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this product I was skeptical on whether it was authentic, but after using it I realized its too great to be fake.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t finish it with a powder and just wear it as my last step, but if it diverges too much from your natural skin tone I would definitely suggest a setting/finishing powder that matches your skin</li>
            <li>straight up clay face mask grey.</li>
            <li>IT WAS FABULOUS AND MY FRIENDS ASK ME IF WHY AM I NOT WEARING FOUNDATION ( USUALLY I DO )</li>
            <li>I used the hot pink, gold, and oriental gold.</li>
            <li>, one is hot pink, I&#x27;ll try them soon.</li>
            <li>By the way, I have normal (not oily/dry) Asian skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tad darker than the Hot Pink bottle.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product along with the Skin 79 Hot Pink BB Cream.  </li>
            <li>Also can&#x27;t wait to try the samples that came with my purchase, including the hot pink bb cream.</li>
            <li>Tinted moisturizers were too wimpy, and foundation gives me a face full of makeup that feels heavy and unnatural.</li>
            <li>I use another Skin79 bb cream as a lovely shimmer cheek highlighter then go over it with loose powder and voila done in less than 5 minutes!</li>
            <li>I bought this maybe a little more than a month ago, and my bottle is almost empty now.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin, andit usually looks inflamed after my skincare regimen is complete.</li>
            <li>I had finally gotten my acne under control and hadn&#x27;t gotten a new blemish in awhile.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be on the dry side and this is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It ran on my face smoothly, brightening it up and evening out all the uneven and red parts of my skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say to much for now since I have only made the one order, but they definitely exceeded my expectation!!!</li>
            <li>It blends so easily and the formula is not too thick or too watery.</li>
            <li>Medium to thick coverage thick consiatancy and great spf</li>
            <li>I have little to complain about the first bottle but the second one is much nicer.</li>
            <li>She has very dry skin and large pores.</li>
            <li>When first applied, it looks very gray, but then it oxidizes after a few minutes, at which point, it turns really white.</li>
            <li>I usually never write reviews, but I definitely thought this product deserved one!</li>
            <li>it comes in a small (it fits entirely in your palm) cylinder bottle and a pump for easy access.</li>
            <li>It looks super natural, yet covers small flaws and imperfections.</li>
            <li>I rarely stay with the same products, due to breakouts</li>
            <li>i also have really dry ichy sensitive skin, and after using the product, it made my skin feel very soft</li>
            <li>This one is definitely thicker and a little heavier than the Pink one, which provides more comprehensive coverage.</li>
            <li>but I generally don&#x27;t have to blot again</li>
            <li>, I have light skin with pink undertone (Diorskin Nude 010 or 020, I like neutral) dark eyes and hair.</li>
            <li>The color is a bit grey when you first squeeze it out on your hand, but once I blended it on my face it was no longer grey.</li>
            <li>Since the primers she usually likes tend to be in 40 dollar range this big deal for her since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>My skin is generally clear, with occasional blemishes,  so I do like coverage!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and do not recommend this for people with similar skin types.</li>
            <li>For years, I just went with a bare face.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and have had no reaction, I also have hyper-pigmentation and this covers the red!!!</li>
            <li>but it apparently oxidizes and in 10 minutes</li>
            <li>I thought this would make me look younger and cover well, just made me look white, still had to do all my normal makeup routine after so</li>
            <li>I want to be able to cover up the broken capillaries and redness but without looking like I&#x27;m wearing a mask</li>
            <li>The coverage is more than a tinted moisturizer but a little less than a foundation.</li>
            <li>I waited a wekk for the skin to calm down before trying again but it still gave the same result.</li>
            <li>The formula applies evenly (a little goes a long way), and at first feels heavy, but lightens up when you smooth it out.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who has dry skin or even normal skin.</li>
            <li>This is made for people with normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>(I am Caucasian with pale pink skin that tans easily).</li>
            <li>i am SE asian (about medium toned compared to most native SE Asians) with about NC30 skin minus the heavy yellow undertones.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have too much experience with all the other brands</li>
            <li>I used the SKIN79 pink bottle bb cream before and they are practically the same, except with this gold bottle bb cream I don&#x27;t have to blot as much (I have oily skin)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve completely switched over from foundation to BB creams (Korean brands only since US BB creams are basically just tinted moisturizers which does not have the same consistency, coverage, or benefits of Korean BB creams).  </li>
            <li>No dry patches or streaks.</li>
            <li>It has a more matte finish than the Pink and isn&#x27;t as thick.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make sense to me since the older bottle was empty.</li>
            <li>No dry skin flakes on my forehead</li>
            <li>It seems decent enough for pale skin, but is a twinge dark on my skin (for reference, I&#x27;m a W2-ish in L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s True Match foundation line).</li>
            <li>I am a little paler at first, but then the cream oxidizes and matches my skin color and evens out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>(the skin tries to compensate for the dry skin and produces oil, etc etc ;)).  </li>
            <li>For about 20$ this will last for a pretty long time because a little of it really goes a long way.</li>
            <li>My last BB Cream from a much more expensive place smelled like old peanuts.</li>
            <li>when you first start to use it, it&#x27;ll take a few pumps for the bb cream to surface (you&#x27;ll start to feel the pressure), but</li>
            <li>Maybe a little powder on top but no more hardcore foundation for me.</li>
            <li>Not sure why that couldn&#x27;t have been done that right away.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend the Oriental gold for mature skin or really dry skin.</li>
            <li>so far it doesn&#x27;t look dry at all on this Canadian &amp;#34;Fall-weather&amp;#34; ( -10ºC / 14ºF ).</li>
            <li>The finish is very dewy, so I&#x27;d recommend setting with a powder if you prefer a less shiny look.</li>
            <li>Recently I had a bout of psoriasis (extremely dry, flaky, and red patches) on my face, and this made it possible to leave the house looking normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s possible to see skin improvements after just one use, so it&#x27;s probably just a coincidence, but I still find it worth mentioning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it felt super cakey and thick.</li>
            <li>The bottle is also VERY hygienic because it has a little pump.</li>
            <li>When I ran out I was hesitant to purchase another because the finish was very dewy and it smelled a little like plastic.</li>
            <li>and I was already a little held back by how it just did not blend very well.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t know if the design of the real one changed or the fake one just got a little better?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that was a good thing or a bad thing.    </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I introduced my friends to this product and they were very happy also.</li>
            <li> I am not saying it has the perfect coverage</li>
            <li> but if you just set it with powder or but a dab of concealer on a problem spot it will look marvelous.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the best part about it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> i bought the 4 pack skin79 sampler and of all the 4 items there, this is the one that worked best for</li>

            <li> and it feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li> great product - color is no where close to my skin, so I mix it with my foundation and it works well.  </li>
            <li> It has a great consistancy and blends well just like people&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li> ... why haven&#x27;t we heard of this before if it was so great?</li>

            <li> I am happy and will be reordering as soon as I run out which</li>
            <li> and I notice my skin condition has greatly improved.</li>
            <li> so was happy with that.  </li>
            <li> I did anyway and have to tell you that I am extremely happy with my cream.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Skin79 Beblesh Balm in Gold and the product works great as an all-in-one sunscreen, foundation and even concealer.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Looks great but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mac nc 25 skin tone, and I bought this after seeing great reviews.</li>
            <li> LOL.</li>
            <li> Great product over all.</li>
            <li> this works soooooo great</li>
            <li> Great BB cream.</li>
            <li> The color works great for me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great for my combination skin even if others have said it&#x27;s for oily skin.</li>
            <li> but it made my face look too gray and ashy, and the coverage wasn&#x27;t great either.  </li>
            <li> the coloring is great.  </li>
            <li> This is great when you&#x27;re on the go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a foundation person, so this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> The shipping (I used the advertised seller) was great, here in five days.</li>
            <li> Great value for my money.</li>
            <li> Great coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an experienced BB cream user.  </li>
            <li> It gives me flawless glowing skin, and when I look into the mirror I feel kind of</li>
            <li> what a great combination.</li>
            <li> This cream is great.  </li>
            <li> Great price, the store in my area sell it for $39.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I can imagine that it would make a great primer for makeup too.  </li>
            <li> Over all, love it!!    </li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I will buy more SKIN79 products!!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing qualities are very nice,</li>
            <li> but the product itself is very nice.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice product, and works well.</li>
            <li> and although this is very light, when i apply make up it blends perfectly!!!</li>

            <li> IS AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This BB cream is amazing!</li>
            <li> AMAZING!</li>
            <li> HOW AMAZING IS THAT PEOPLE!</li>
            <li> So I am extremely impressed with this product, since it out performed a product more than twice the cost.</li>
            <li> :  feels good, non-drying, evens skin tone &amp; gives me a happy glow almost.  </li>
            <li> Nice and even coverage!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had great looking skin but with this product I get good coverage</li>
            <li> have good consistency and coverage and are a great price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my skin, love the texture, color and the finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m most impressed with</li>
            <li> Plus the packaging is amazing, so cute! :D</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, this is best and most surprising beauty purchase I have ever made.</li>
            <li> Its goes on so easy and makes my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great, and the packaging is adorable!</li>
            <li> I ordered two brands, one for myself and one for my very fair skinned daughter (I&#x27;m medium, leaning more towards fair).</li>
            <li> bright and well rested.</li>
            <li> My face is moisturized, and so bright.</li>
            <li> great on my skin and goes great with so many tones.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because of a review I watched by a beloved makeup guru .</li>
            <li> It said it was a really good BB cream</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go for the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it is not so good as I heard.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and makes my skin look wonderful, (</li>
            <li> When I washed my face at the end of the day my skin felt and looked good.  </li>
            <li> I have bought knock offs from the drug store and they never work as good.</li>
            <li> Do a mix of rubbing in lightly and patting on(this is the method I feel that is best for me)</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> Thoroughly loved it and would recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> and I loved</li>
            <li> because it seemed like a good deal.</li>
            <li> Fair coverage.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is good and moisturizes the skin, it also brightens it, It takes 5 mins before it oxedates to match your skintone.</li>
            <li> Before I bought it, I read a lot of review and it seems to be a good one.</li>
            <li> and she thought it was good as a primer.  </li>
            <li> If you are a beginner, this is a good starter bb cream.</li>
            <li> Also the bb cream is good, no break out or anything.</li>
            <li> My skin tone isn&#x27;t fair but in between medium and fair</li>
            <li> it has good coverage but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for people with dry/combination skin like myself, although now that it&#x27;s getting colder</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether it has done anything FOR my skin, but I take good care of it so who knows?</li>
            <li> shipping was good and pricing us good for this product.</li>
            <li> If not, then why sell it to people and get money from them when they think they are getting a good product?</li>
            <li> Gorgeous coverage, hydrating formula.</li>
            <li> BB cream manages to match my light skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li> and the coverage lasts a good time when it is set with powder.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s great , and it has a nice coverage</li>
            <li> I originally ordered a sample pack to see which version worked the best for me.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wonderful, great under powder, easy to apply, fast and wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> Best to apply before foundation for full coverage.</li>
            <li> Beblesh Balm BB cream Vip Gold, after reading and watching reviews (on YouTube) and I&#x27;m super impressed.  </li>
            <li> Ordered 3 more products,delivery was fantastic!!Am 83 yrs old,match was great on my fair skin.</li>
            <li> I loved this one the most!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually an ideal tinted moisturizer because it is so light</li>
            <li> I was so happy :)</li>
            <li> I used the product today with great anticipation and love it.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with price, shipping cost and speed</li>
            <li> It also shipped 3 days ahead of scheduled delivery, so I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is a good product to be honest...</li>
            <li> this is a good product to be honest...</li>
            <li> NEway, I still continue to use it for another week or so before I was tire of having all my make up melt off my face by lunch time, and my skin right now is not the best shape</li>
            <li> Leave your skin so smooth and make up goes on beautifully.</li>
            <li> i love this product!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> it was more try-error while applying the product at the beginning!</li>
            <li> I just love it!</li>
            <li> The finish is lovely!</li>
            <li> My first impression of the BB cream itself was that it was a bit sticky and best to apply with your fingers.</li>
            <li> i love it !</li>
            <li> but this VIP gold is my top pick!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> But otherwise I love it!</li>
            <li> For best results, first wash the face with an oil-based cleanser (e.g. [...] then moisturize, then apply this to the skin.</li>
            <li> I honestly love this make up!</li>
            <li> but this is a top contender!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this BB Cream!</li>
            <li> So many things in one!</li>
            <li> So glad I found this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love!  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of a tinted moisturizer, but better!</li>
            <li> I really love it!</li>
            <li> So glad I orderd 2!</li>
            <li> I wear this under a foundation powder for more coverage and it holds all my make up in place!</li>
            <li> :) Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x60;m in love!</li>
            <li> This BB cream is better than the ones they sale at retail stores, I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> bought the 4 skin79 sampler pack first and this gold version is def the best for me.</li>
            <li> Loved this product, does easily blend in and match skin tone, will be re-purchasing!</li>
            <li> I have always had great skin (very lucky), but this made it even better!</li>
            <li> This cream is very light with good coverage.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was amazing, and it came about 4 days after I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> This product works amazing.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give it a try and its been amazing.</li>
            <li> My skin still looks amazing at night when I wash it off.</li>
            <li> It smells great and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> Super+Beblesh Balm is in a word amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This BB felt moisturizing and did not look greasy on my skin, it gave an amazing finish.</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazing.</li>
            <li> This works great, but it&#x27;s a tad light.</li>
            <li> This product is very well packaged, with an excellent pump.</li>
            <li> Of all the BB creams so far this seemed to be the best coverage wise and also emanates a glow.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t know quite what to expect with this BB Cream.</li>
            <li> It does look gray-ish on hand like another reviewer mentioned, but if you blend it in really good on your face, it looks better.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it has spf 25 for some good protection.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is what makes it nice for someone who wears glasses.  </li>
            <li> But, honestly, since I will be using this during the day, I prefer having the SPF in it to protect my face.</li>
            <li> but BB cream is popular now</li>
            <li> As much as I liked it, it caused breakouts.  </li>
            <li> If you have oily skin, this isn&#x27;t the product for you but Skin79 does have others geared towards your type of skin (in fact I own it</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great product!</li>
            <li> But it still blended nicely with my skin</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it goes on kind of gray because it neutralizes my skin tone.</li>
            <li> and honestly it feels like I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup.</li>
            <li> that was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> that was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> and let&#x27;s be honest how often do people even say that stuff?</li>
            <li> She liked that it gave her a dewy complexion and helped her makeup stay on longer.</li>
            <li> It blends nicely and evenly.</li>
            <li> This is a nice BB Cream.  </li>
            <li> I loved this so far the best of all the BB creams I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;tend to be dry&amp;#34; winter skin is loving this bb cream.</li>
            <li> just so good, best coverage, moisturizing, no breakout, not heavy.</li>
            <li> The VIP Gold Collection is really moisturizing, perfect during winter.</li>
            <li> I really liked the coverage of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I blended it into my skin (with my fingers, which I normally wouldn&#x27;t do), and it seemed to adjust perfectly to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, great product, AMAZING shipping.... if you&#x27;re looking into it, it is totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> more importantly feels great.</li>
            <li> But what I loved the most is that for some reason my HUGE pores are not noticeable at all!</li>
            <li> Good on any skin tone easy to use recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and will be buying again! :)</li>
            <li> I bought the three to see which one I would like more, but I love them all!</li>
            <li> The product feels very light and nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> but so far this one does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> If you want a BB cream that gives a natural and dewy glow, this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li> I also tried the Smashbox BB Cream and thought I liked that, but then after trying the Skin79 brand I am in love.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all nice, but this one is the most invisible, in my experience.</li>
            <li> I love how nice it makes my skin look as well,</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product, and it offers great results!  </li>
            <li> but when I return to my natural color it will be perfect.</li>
            <li> and I find it is more effective to blend with fingers than with a sponge or brush.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is by far the BEST thing I have put on my face .......</li>
            <li> I think it is a great product and worth a try</li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly and covers fairly well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It truly is the most effective cosmetic (make-up)</li>
            <li> Goes on light, spreads well and gives good coverage.  </li>
            <li> It looked so natural yet flawless.</li>
            <li> The packaging of this product is very cute and the pump is easy to use.   </li>
            <li> Out of the two, I would have to say that I liked with one more because it had a bit more coverage.  </li>
            <li> Excellent coverage for my fair skin with pink undertones.</li>
            <li> Great product, does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li> This bb cream is perfect for my skin (pale) and gives it a fresh, dewy and flawless appearance.</li>
            <li> Feels very light on skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light coverage but also buildable.</li>
            <li> This is a nice bb cream with pretty good coverage.</li>
            <li> The can is super cute and the smell is really good</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very fair skinned (caucasian) and after oxidizing, the cream blends seamlessly into my complexion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll start by saying that I have sensitive, combination, acne-prone, acne-scarred, and very fair skin.</li>
            <li> Love this BB Cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so moisturizing, and have an ok coverage.</li>
            <li> I bought this product out of whim, and let me tell you, I am SO glad that I did.</li>
            <li> My makeup glided on like a dream and looks lovely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and nice for the summer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even take one week to get this baby to Sweden :)  </li>
            <li> I have used the Skin 79 Diamond bb cream before and love it.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell and texture.</li>
            <li> I love how it works but the smell made me not want to buy from them.</li>
            <li> I really think this works great with powder atop of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really think this works great with powder atop of it.       </li>
            <li> overall a great product!</li>
            <li> and I love this one sooo much better.  </li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with BB creams.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Most days I throw this on with some finishing powder, and I&#x27;m out of the door in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> And boy, was I glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I just got it today and am already in love with it.</li>
            <li> I love that has SPF, looking forward to the lightening of some sun-freckles.  </li>
            <li> I never had a BB cream before and there were more pros than cons about this BB cream, so i decided to try</li>
            <li> I love how this lightens my freckles.</li>
            <li> Lovely.</li>
            <li> I love that non makeup</li>
            <li> it was an authentic product(checked the sticker).</li>
            <li> and I felt as though time was taken to make sure it arrived to me safely.</li>
            <li> Overall, very happy :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much thicker product, with moisturizing feel, great coverage</li>
            <li> BUT I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is packaged in a really cute pump out bottle.</li>
            <li> I actually really love the way it made my skin look.     </li>
            <li> can also work to better your skin.  </li>
            <li> I really, really, really love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It looks better on me with powder, but I wish I could just wear the BB cream by itself without looking weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would use it for a night on the town, when I feel like I would need more coverage.</li>
            <li> It is definitely an authentic product!!!!!PHEW....</li>
            <li> It wore great the whole day.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Will purchase more</li>
            <li> I love BB cream.</li>
            <li> but this product made my skin that much more healthy and radiant.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what I was buying when I got this, I just viewed the highest ranking moisturizers and this came up.  </li>
            <li> What I love is after taking it off my skin looks better with use.</li>
            <li> But I love how my skin looks and feels with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this BB Cream.</li>
            <li> BB Cream goes on so lovely and just leaves your face glowing.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, great transaction I will order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn revlon foundation for years, and was quite pleased with it, but I had to try this.</li>
            <li> This provided more coverage with one application.</li>
            <li> Like the pick bottle much better.</li>
            <li> I am a NC20-25 shade and it definitely matched my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li> I would say this is more of a medium coverage</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bb cream of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Before I&#x27;ve tried this, I&#x27;ve tried missha, ihope, mammonde, laniege, rimmel London, and more</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me get pimples and that&#x27;s what I love about it most.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find a product to cover up my inperfections on my face and this one covers it 90%.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m darker than most Asians.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of this a lot better.</li>
            <li> And it blends in with my skin more.</li>
            <li> I love using this during the winter.</li>
            <li> so be safe and buy from the manufacturer&#x27;s site.</li>
            <li> but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Working great, thanks.</li>
            <li> Researched online the various BB creams and found that these are the best the ones.  </li>
            <li> My daughter introduced me to this product, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> One of my most favorite BB cream I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I just wished it covered imperfections a bit more</li>
            <li> so well it makes my skin glow :)</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> It works like magic.</li>
            <li> I have waited a week to write a review just to be sure.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this product.</li>
            <li> and i prefer this 10x more than those.</li>
            <li> And it also came wrapped in bubble wrap and the outside container the bb cream container was in was a bit damaged but the product itself was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the company that sells it</li>
            <li> And it also came wrapped in bubble wrap and the outside container the bb cream container was in was a bit damaged but the product itself was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> absolutely love it and WILL purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I really love the Skin79 BB cream line.</li>
            <li> My friend from Korea recommended this product and I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I really love that it also has SPF and whitening (for my scars).     </li>
            <li> I have used many BB creams this one and</li>
            <li> there are many out there</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look brighter and give my face a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging and the feel of the product.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy make up at all over the internet except from Sephora, or unless I have used the product before and know for sure that it will work on me.</li>
            <li> I love the look of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The color is more flesh toned, not gray at all.</li>
            <li> I still use this BB cream from time to time and would buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> There are many fakes on here</li>
            <li> my skin color is kind of a light medium tan</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> My skin has a healthier glow and more people compliment me on my skin.</li>
            <li> Overall this product was awesome.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love Skin79&#x27;s BB Cream.</li>
            <li> It has a better consistency and coverage.</li>
            <li> I love that it has SPF in it as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely in love for this product.</li>
            <li> I do feel my skin itself become even better and whiter gradually</li>
            <li> stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this product :)</li>
            <li> I wish that this BB cream came in more shades though.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> is much better.</li>
            <li> I love the ease of use, the coverage, the price is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I liked the light feel of this cream for medium coverage.  </li>
            <li> decided to try SKIN79 the VIP Gold label for the extra moisture and dewey-ness.&lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly as described.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love that is has the SPF too.</li>
            <li> it, you won&#x27;t regret it. :)</li>
            <li> but my face does seem brighter and my complexion looks a bit more evened out.</li>
            <li> And this foundation feels like nothing on your face which is perfect especially for summer.</li>
            <li> Bb Creams will definitely give you the \\&quot;porcelain\\&quot;, flawless skin look.</li>
            <li> love this you must try it.</li>
            <li> It takes just a minute in the morning to pat and blend this in, focusing on under my eyes and T-zone, to look healthy and glowing.</li>
            <li> I notice many like this one a lot.</li>
            <li> It feel more luxury than lighter ones.</li>
            <li> one of the top 5 products in my make up bag.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> , I like this one better.  </li>
            <li> I heard the Gold edition was more moist for winter time, so I tried it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I mix my foundation with this product (60 foundation/40 balm) and it works much better.</li>
            <li> I hope your experience with their line is as fabulous as mine has been!</li>
            <li> I am in love and I don&#x27;t think I would ever wear anything else.  </li>
            <li> You will love it.</li>
            <li> always love this product.</li>
            <li> Have all of my friends in love with this stuff</li>
            <li> It moisturizes, makes your skin look flawless better than regular foundation.</li>
            <li> I love this because it has SPF in it too.  </li>
            <li> I love the packaging it&#x27;s in.</li>
            <li> This is more of a tinted moisturizer and is buildable.</li>
            <li> I love what it&#x27;s done for me today</li>
            <li> Could NOT be more pleased.</li>
            <li> And the price is OK as well.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft, blends so well, good as a primer for foundation or alone!</li>
            <li> As you smooth the cream out, it blends into your own skin color, becoming invisible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to use a product that actually feels good on my skin and has some healthy ingredients, not just like a mask or a &amp;#34;cover.&amp;#34;  I appreciate the light hue and SPF also.</li>
            <li> Comes out grey, but eventually evens out perfectly!</li>
            <li> This makeup matches well and gives pretty good coverage without being cakey looking.</li>
            <li> and you have to have pretty good skin to start off.  </li>
            <li> It is wonderful for a quick, light, fast, and easy on the go cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not messy at all, easy application, and very easy to blend!!</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure I will love Lioele Beyond the Solution as well but if not I&#x27;ll update this review!  :)</li>
            <li> I will surely continue to order this product and strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Goes on greyish, but quickly adjusts to your own skin tone once it warms up to body temp.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good buy &amp; good alternate makeup.  </li>
            <li> Also, the most important thing is the product is authentic as the seller stated.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d easily pay twice as much for this kind of cosmetic excellence!</li>
            <li> The color is fine for my NW 13 skin, although the Missha Signature Wrinkle Filler #21 was better (I just didn&#x27;t do well with the fragrance in Missha).</li>
            <li> This is just an amazing product, and the price is really not expensive!</li>
            <li> It smells nice, is super hypoallergenic and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> am a white woman, with very fair skin.  </li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned, I almost always buy my foundations in Ivory or the next shade darker and this works well with my skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to look their best!</li>
            <li> It gives a great natural appearance.</li>
            <li> It is almost like magic the way it just transforms your skin to give you a blemish free face.</li>
            <li> but I love how light it is and how you can apply it with your hands if you want.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll probably enjoy the sebum control more now.shment\\</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll probably enjoy the sebum control more now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this first foray into beblesh balm, and I&#x27;ve let my husband know that he can go spackle</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for light coverage, Super+BB Cream will do the magic.</li>
            <li> It has not made me break out, which is one of the most important things to me when buying these creams.</li>
            <li> The cream seems to reduce the size of my pores and make my skin smooth and more refined.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Lancôme absolute makeup because I loved the moisturizing aspect.</li>
            <li> It feels good and looks very nature.</li>
            <li> I use my mineral hygienics foundation in medium golden over it and then contour with their warm kiss and then apply the rest of my makeup</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t take much to get good coverage.</li>
            <li> I bought this item a year ago and I loved it, it was the real thing and worked well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also fair skinned, thanks to being a redhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re nowhere near as good, and most of them either cost as much or more than Skin79.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-- Light and airy and easy to apply and blend - I love he way</li>
            <li> But, the price is great, and it was super fast shipping, so thank you Seoul Glamour ^^</li>
            <li> It minimizes pores, redness, and other inperfections to leave skin looking flawless.</li>
            <li> The bottle is attractive and small, the pump is excellent and it&#x27;s easy to control how much product you want.</li>
            <li> The size is larger than I thought but that means it holds more too, so I am happy.</li>
            <li> One easy step</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product as I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about from friends and on Asian website reviews, but it didn&#x27;t show the results I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> the pencil can easily be rubbed off, unlike if I darken my eyebrows with no makeup/cream on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the pencil can easily be rubbed off, unlike if I darken my eyebrows with no makeup/cream on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can easily see this occurring.</li>
            <li> almost see-through so redness is not something I can really easily hide.</li>
            <li> makes my face look clean and healthy</li>
            <li> It blends easily and gives what it promises.</li>
            <li> With this cream, I&#x27;ve noticed that it doesn&#x27;t break me out, and it glides on easily.</li>
            <li> and she strongly recommended this one.</li>
            <li> My skin looks clearer, it goes on very easily and looks super smooth on--doesn&#x27;t sink into wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I liked it a lot so far, my skin looks pretty good better then</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this for you, this product works best on pale or lighter skinned people :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that this helps it adjust to many other skin tones beyond those of us who are very fair</li>
            <li> My lab partner in school asked me what I&#x27;m doing differently because my skin looks so smooth and dewy (made me feel so good!)</li>
            <li> Loving this so much!</li>
            <li> I own three different Skin79 BB creams, and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> when i got in the mail it was so nicely package and when i opened it, it was so pretty.</li>
            <li> but it still hides many major flaws, its specially really good for the morning</li>
            <li> Also huge plus for pumpbottle, it so easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this BB cream, it not only matches a majority of skin colors but is very moisturizing and conceals evenly!</li>
            <li> i love this product, been using it for the past year and its still the best from others that ive tried</li>
            <li> But I heard so many good things about BB cream in general</li>
            <li> It seems to emphasize the fine lines and wrinkles (I have droopy eyelids), and they look dried-out.  </li>
            <li> It seems to emphasize the fine lines and wrinkles (I have droopy eyelids), and they look dried-out.  </li>
            <li> or so it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> But coverage is medium and covers my freckles and redness just fine.</li>
            <li> I think with some mineral powder to set it in warmer weather, it will be fine.</li>
            <li> It does not settle into pores or fine lines either.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell, kinda like my old olay moisturizer.</li>
            <li> otherwise, the bottle is super cute, the packaging was good and came in prompt (even with the normal shipping option), and i got a free sample.</li>
            <li> The color looks good on my fair skin tone because the product has more of a beige color that I usually like.</li>
            <li> It gives great coverage, but it feels light enough to be a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> So this cream was a huge relief with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Light, good for acne prone skin, gets rid of blemishes, makes skin soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a rare win to find something that looks natural on my face..</li>
            <li> I wear it alone or as my primary foundation.</li>
            <li> Overall great product</li>
            <li> It comes out of the bottle much darker then my skin but works amazing.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Overall, a GREAT product.</li>
            <li> the scent is light, rosey floral</li>
            <li> and smooth^^</li>
            <li> and I noticed that it makes your skin look really smooth once you apply it.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I&#x27;m Vietnamese and have light...</li>
            <li> And the color really does adjust to light-to-medium skin tones nicely.</li>
            <li> This cream is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I am not asian and it works great.</li>
            <li> I was thinking it would be too light for my skin because I am in America</li>
            <li> it was light on my face</li>
            <li> This bb cream is light to medium coverage</li>
            <li> I also like the light scent of this one.</li>
            <li> I would say this is about light to medium coverage.</li>
            <li> I would say this is about light to medium coverage.</li>
            <li> I use it as a light foundation.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed it whitening my face, but it does even the tone like a light foundation should.</li>
            <li> , i just put a light layer of foundation over it to even it out.</li>
            <li> The opaque container protects the product from the light.</li>
            <li> Light coverage.</li>
            <li> But you do need to dust with light powder or bronzer or it seems to sort of melt off.  </li>
            <li> The coverage is quite light but buildable.</li>
            <li> It is great on Asian skin tone.</li>
            <li> I normally do not write reviews, but this product is too good to pass up!  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> I just got this yesterday but so far so good.</li>
            <li> The gray ashiness that you first get right after application oxidizes within 15 minutes to a beautiful finish that matches my skin tone really well.  </li>
            <li> The price is more than right, too.</li>
            <li> It is great alone, or with blush or other mineral powder on top of it.</li>
            <li> It is a tad thick and grey, but spreads out nicely and evenly and blends perfectly with my skin which is fair</li>
            <li> I think the English translation could use some improvement, but the cream itself gives my skin a very very nice appearance.</li>
            <li> i love this product, it gives me good coverge to my skin and is also suitable for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed when I received this product from Pink Gelee, exactly when the package was said to arrive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m caucasian with a medium-fair skin tone (fair but tan easily)  and even though I believe this brand is aimed at Asian skin tones (has &#x27;whitening&#x27; as one of its selling points)</li>
            <li> This BB Cream was originally raved on youtube by Bubzbeauty.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this product.</li>
            <li> A lot of my usual redness is clearing, and I&#x27;m so impressed a \\&quot;concealer\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I am really excited I found this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d say Missha&#x27;s BB cream is better overall because its formula feels better and it has a better range of colors.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it so much though!</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s almost indistinguishable from the original and comes with all the markers of an original, (perforation, expiry date</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product because a beauty guru I watch collects BB Creams</li>
            <li> Missha was the first BB cream I tried, and I thought it was okay</li>
            <li> originally bought the sample box.</li>
            <li> This is my first BB cream, and I like it better than any foundation I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> While it does take quite a while to receive it, it is worth the wait!</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, and I&#x27;ve never felt like I had to re-apply it, even after a full day at work.</li>
            <li> I went to the BB Cream website and all of the products are a pretty good chunk of money (around $40 for this particular BB Cream), so I came here.</li>
            <li> but this one is great for the winter when I need a little bit more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> And this color is perfect for me and make my skin look white and young.</li>
            <li> What I like about it is the fact it matches my skin better and look more natural.  </li>
            <li> I have tested so many foundations and this is by far my favorite alternative.</li>
            <li> The first time I wore this, multiple people told me how beautiful I looked that day.</li>
            <li> It works great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants BB Cream, especially a Real SKIN79 BB cream. :)</li>
            <li> Because my skin is so light, all of my blemishes and marks are bright red.</li>
            <li> My skin looks great, and My face isn&#x27;t shiny OR dry.</li>
            <li> However, if I am just staying in or running errands, applying this only makes my face bright and even feels smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin is really tan and after blending the cream in, it sinks perfectly onto my skin.  </li>
            <li> So I received the BB Cream very early which was amazing to me.</li>
            <li> It is more than enough to provide a mild coverage and make the face more bright and natural once it oxidizes!</li>
            <li> i tan easily in summer and probably cannot use this product (maybe can if i have the right powder to put over it...will have to try)...</li>
            <li> After trying many higher end (UD, josie maran, tarte, most things in sephora) and lower end (loreal, CG, etc) foundations/tinted moisturizers/ bb creams (i just want my skin to look normal!</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is by far better than much higher priced BB creams!</li>
            <li> Pink is the lightest color and is great for winter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll stay dry and keep my face fine for a good 6</li>
            <li> I found oriental bb gold too oily at the end of day (though loved its initial dewiness),  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> I really love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suggest a full pump or it&#x27;s too oily.</li>
            <li> Trying this gold vip by Skin 79, I did notice the coverage wasn&#x27;t full coverage like Missha&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Good for daily sunscreen wear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the company that sells it (my shipping estimated time was supposed to be at least 4 weeks</li>
            <li> I heard so much about how magic BB cream is.</li>
            <li> Bare Minimum Pressed Powder for a more skin-like natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Lioele Triple the Solution BB Cream out of curiosity, and after applying it on my skin I was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful my skin looks!  </li>
            <li> It instantly covered my blemishes and did a good job at concealing acne scars as well.</li>
            <li> 2 at the most, towards the end of the year.&lt;br /&gt;I really want to try the orange VIP</li>
            <li> I have a fair complexion that can get a bit sallow at times, especially during a winter like this one.</li>
            <li> I know that BB creams &amp;#34;adjust&amp;#34; to your color, but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> I have light to medium skin tone with golden tones.</li>
            <li> but three days is not enough time to tell me how good the product is for me.    </li>
            <li> Were those words true?</li>
            <li> I recommend the sampler before buying in full.</li>
            <li> If you have very cool toned skin and are pretty pale, it&#x27;s good and it&#x27;ll blend in better.</li>
            <li> (it also makes a great gift) and probably won&#x27;t buy the other foundation again.</li>
            <li> If it was less gray and more yellow, it would&#x27;ve been perfect.</li>
            <li> but it oxidizes really quick and</li>
            <li> My blush looks more vibrant and stays in place all day with this.</li>
            <li> On a side note I purchased from Pink Gelee and they are amazing and totally authentic products.</li>
            <li> The smell is light(powdery)and disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> This SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li> Received the package quickly with no</li>
            <li> this BB cream is very helpful for me,as it is light and fit to our skin.</li>
            <li> My morning routine is so quick:</li>
            <li> I purchased the Skin79 Super+</li>
            <li> SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li> SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li> I have had acne for most of the last 2 decades and have scars from it, and this bb cream covers better then concealer and foundation.</li>
            <li> The coverage of this bb cream is adequate.</li>
            <li> and it has improved my skin tremendously</li>
            <li> and I set my BB cream with Maybelline Dream Matte Powder for a super matte finish or Sonia Kashuk</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased it several times and I love it :)</li>
            <li> I have mild rosacea on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> That quickly blends in and disappears though.  </li>
            <li> and we both enjoy it very much.  </li>
            <li> I personally prefer Skin79 Hot Pink for the more matte finish, but this formula is wonderful for me in the winter.</li>
            <li> I was very much looking forward to trying out this product after reading so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> This was my very first BB cream I purchased for myself.</li>
            <li> I can say that this seller is VERY fast at shipping!</li>
            <li> My very first BB cream.</li>
            <li> I put it on everyday like sunscreen protection, highly recommend to my friend, very good product!</li>
            <li> and If i get more info if this is just a new design for the vip gold.</li>
            <li> It took about four days to deliver and the product is 100% authentic and brand new.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works like a charm -- great coverage with half a pump</li>
            <li> I have fair, sensitive acne prone skin and normal foundation breaks me out.</li>
            <li> I absolutely fell in love with this product the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> It had pretty good coverage.. not as sheer as some BB creams</li>
            <li> Exactly what i was looking for!</li>
            <li> it have pretty good coverage,  tones down the redness, and gives me a clean smooth and dewy  look.</li>
            <li> and it really was  great for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> And comparing them, i personally like this one better, because this is soo moisturizing and easy to apply with my fingers.</li>
            <li> Very light and natural on the skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth, natural looking.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding foundations that match me because I&#x27;m very fair and seem to oxidize everything.</li>
            <li> great product for me because i need little to no coverage.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and when I first put it on it seems too dark but blends in and looks fine when I spread it around - it evens out my skin tone</li>
            <li> (because of my lack of past experience), but i can say that this was a very good first experience with bb cream.</li>
            <li> The color matches my light olive tone very well.</li>
            <li> I really like its texture, since I did have a light tan</li>
            <li> Even when I have not used this for a few days, my skin still looks great.</li>
            <li> It is light and it doesn&#x27;t oxidize as much as Skin79, but the finish makes my skin look like my skin</li>
            <li> It is so light and blends very well with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> i have combo oily skin and rarely break out.  </li>
            <li> my skin cleared up even more and my blemish scars have almost completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> The fast shipment really did make me love this product</li>
            <li> definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am 41 years old and thought this may be a better try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it offers a better (medium) coverage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does seem a bit challenging to wash off completely.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does seem a bit challenging to wash off completely.  </li>
            <li> then i pat a bit more on my old acne scars and any blemishes i may have.</li>
            <li> It is a more light to medium coverage which was the only thing that bothered me.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is amazing, this is actually one of my top 5 favorite bb cream, i did buy the pink one and this one.</li>
            <li> Love that it uses a natural (Titanium dioxide) sunscreen.</li>
            <li> What everyone says is true -- the product does at first look greyish when you put it on your skin.</li>
            <li> various (caucasian) skin tones and found that it miraculously blends to their own skin as well.</li>
            <li> and so i bought it in hopes of it making my skin look more evened out and natural</li>
            <li> When used with enough powder and blush, this can serve as a nice canvas.</li>
            <li> Liole triple action BB cream is even better.</li>
            <li> I never use my old makeup now, this just looks so much better.</li>
            <li> If you want want any authentic Skin79 products than buy it directly from Skin79&#x27;s website.    </li>
            <li> I am fairly light skinned and have not had any issues with my face and neck looking different colors :)</li>
            <li> Wish it lasts a bit longer but overall, it is a nice product.</li>
            <li> I went with the Skin 79 brand based on very positive reviews.</li>
            <li> and I love how it matches my skin better than the other line.  </li>
            <li> I started using the gold version, which I equally love, for when I want a more dewy natural look since it&#x27;s more moisturizing than the hot pink version.  </li>
            <li> anyway aside from the grayish undertone, its best for dry skin people since my skin is all dry.</li>
            <li> This has a pretty light coverage, but it&#x27;s buildable which is great, as I can add layers on my nose and cheeks without it looking thick or clumpy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably try that one at some point, just to see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on this is very good, especially considering how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I applied it to my face and it evened out my skin tone and shine right away.</li>
            <li> With this cream, it feels so lightweight, and gives me just the right amount of coverage that I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> First off, in case I wasn&#x27;t clear, I love this BB cream.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is thick and gel like with great full coverage.</li>
            <li> use a primer with this, and build it a bit for coverage, and am happy with that, more so after I began following a beauty blogger&#x27;s advice to pat-pat-pat upon application (previously I&#x27;d been using a foundation brush).</li>
            <li> The price is worth it because my Loreal True Match Foundation costs just as much</li>
            <li> This BB cream at first has a grayish tint (which at first is quite jarring!)</li>
            <li> Asian brand BB Creams are much better than their American counterparts (many US brands are just tinted moisturizers) and when you compare the ingredients and read up about what a BB Cream started out as and what it&#x27;s supposed to do you&#x27;ll see the huge differences.</li>
            <li> Also, I read that the Beyond the Solution has a more natural coloring since there&#x27;s no SPF (no white ashiness like most BB cream</li>
            <li> I can layer it on thicker in some areas for more coverage and barely use concealer over it.  </li>
            <li> However, I found the staying power of this product to not be as good, it melted off my face half way thru the day.  </li>
            <li> I loved how it gave me a natural look and last all day.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s light coverage looks very natural.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast</li>
            <li> I like this product very much - for the price</li>
            <li> but so far this product works fine on me</li>
            <li> first, which is also very reasonably priced and gives a nourished, matte look to my otherwise shiny face.</li>
            <li> This was my first BB cream and it raised the bar in my book.</li>
            <li> When I first squeezed it out, I was worried; it was a yellowish-grayish, blah-looking moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is the first BB cream I have tried.</li>
            <li> I got the Skin 79 Oriental Gold BB cream first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as soft and light as a tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li> This was my first bb cream</li>
            <li> I absolutely enjoy it so far.</li>
            <li> At first, it leaves somewhat of a greyish cast</li>
            <li> Using a powder similar to your coloring will help make this skin79 product &#x27;match up&#x27; to ur skin coloring (IF you are about nc30 or more).  </li>
            <li> It isnt drying, and u dont become &#x27;oily&#x27; after several hours (not quite dewy but healthy moisturized skin).  </li>
            <li> I have pretty oily skin</li>
            <li> It was my first time ever trying one, and after researching/ looking up Youtube reviews/</li>
            <li> It is not a fake product.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time ever using a BB cream product.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of any sort of BB cream.</li>
            <li> First off I have to make notice that I am acne prone</li>
            <li> The cream may first appear to be sort of grayish when first apply; however, after an hour it blend in pretty well.</li>
            <li> This was my first BB cream purchase ever</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy again from neverprice &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> Well this was my first BB cream</li>
            <li> A light dewy finish with a soft feel to it.</li>
            <li> The coverage is smooth and natural looking~</li>
            <li> This was my first order on the Amazon site</li>
            <li> it would have saved me soooo much money!</li>
            <li> This stuff is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> this product gives you a light natural coverage with a lightening effect.</li>
            <li> Just received my first bottle of SKIN79 BB cream VIP Gold Collection.  </li>
            <li> This was my first experience with BB cream.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty clear and smooth already</li>
            <li> By the way, this product is not fake.</li>
            <li> It also gives a pretty glow.  </li>
            <li> and it is flaky on my forehead and cheeks, but this bb cream is very moisturizing and does not accentuate my flakiness at all!</li>
            <li> I completely love this product and it will definitely replace my moisturizer and tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li> I had the pleasure of using this bb cream as my first experience with bb cream, and ordering anything on amazon.  </li>
            <li> I first tried this product on my hand</li>
            <li> So, before I purchased this product, I have tried the Missha BB cream first</li>
            <li> It goes on so much smoother than Missha&#x27;s and it melts in your skin so it feels like you aren&#x27;t wearing anything at all!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really no telling what kind of concoction you&#x27;d be putting on your skin</li>
            <li> A lot more sheer that what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It does have a grayish tone when you first put it on</li>
            <li> The company \\&quot;SeoulGlamour\\&quot; seemed reputable based on the multiple reviews here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My advice at this point, honestly is, if you want the real thing without any deception then order straight from the company that actually makes the product.</li>
            <li> My skin has NEVER been this clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> and on days when I need more coverage I mix it with my regular makeup</li>
            <li> just in case, I wanted to try it) and the VIP Gold collection is pretty</li>
            <li> When it first comes out I was really scared because it looked kind of grey...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad this also contains SPF even though I still wear it under my daily moisturizer with SPF 30.</li>
            <li> I ordered my first bottle over a year ago and used it off and on.</li>
            <li> only muchmuch better.  </li>
            <li> I first heard about this product through a YouTube beauty guru who recommended it.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> if you like having lighter skin or if you do have light skin, this&#x27;ll be it for your foundation, but because i like my face looking natural</li>
            <li> It is a bit ashy at first but after a while it gets close to my skin tone albeit lighter.</li>
            <li> Not quite as nice as the pink version on my skin, but as advertised.</li>
            <li> I am also getting on a bit in age, but am holding out pretty well.</li>
            <li> First off this product shipped and arrived a lot faster than the estimated delivery time.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using BB cream</li>
            <li> It gives me a even skintone without sticking and leaving my skin soft and smooth throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This one especially, and it matches my skin more than the others.</li>
            <li> They each are all 100% real!</li>
            <li> Provides just right amount of moist needed for certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li> This came in the mail just yesterday, and I already feel confident enough to rate it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> But I finally have! :)</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried at first, but it worked out quite well.</li>
            <li> there, TWIST the top of the canister off and you can see that you have 85-90% of product left.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> When I first applied it, it didn&#x27;t seem to give a lot of coverage.</li>
            <li> Good product, covers well but tends to have a greyish coverage, not good for my light skin.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It really helps keep my skin hydrated and relaxed throughout the day!</li>
            <li> unlike several of the reviews that I&#x27;ve read here, it is an authentic product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Caucasian with fair skin and a few freckles.</li>
            <li> Good for an everyday look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Previously: I think Refinery29 had glowingly reviewed the [[ASIN:B00EC43CK0 Skin79 Hot Pink Super Plus Bb Cream 40g Spf25 Pa++_pump]], but as an over-50 minimalist with a rather ruddy Caucasian complexion, I too went with this Gold version instead, and have been SO pleased.</li>
            <li> when I know I&#x27;m going to have my picture taken since SPF reflects light particles, making your face super white and glowy in photographs.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t so much as developed a whitehead since using any of the BB creams, and this particular one does the best job of hiding old acne scars, veins, and puffy, dark circles.</li>
            <li> Like most other BB creams, brightens my skin very nicely although it does darken a little over time (oxidizes).</li>
            <li> although because I spent most of my summer in Taiwan and Japan which is very hot and humid, it melted off my face a bit.  </li>
            <li> Overall, the packaging was attractive, but it just did not do what I had expected.</li>
            <li> Natural, slightly dewy look that I really like - great for a no-makeup look</li>
            <li> And to top it off, my skin used to be full of acne scars and dark spots.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this BB cream if you&#x27;re skin tone is light to a medium golden shade.</li>
            <li> I love that it has sunscreen which works very well - I recently hiked in Italy for hours in the sun and was never burned.  </li>
            <li> completely get rid of any acne and lighten dark spots and freckles, ntm anti aging, which is best to start young with not wait until you&#x27;re old,</li>
            <li> This is light feeling, but offers pretty decent coverage.</li>
            <li> I did hear the Pink one is good during the summer months when you are a little more darker.  </li>
            <li> I went on reading reviews online and heard a lot of positive feedback</li>
            <li> On days I don&#x27;t wear this, no problems, so I am positive that this is the cause.  </li>
            <li> I am able to cover my minor spider veins, but it feels like I am wearing nothing.</li>
            <li> There seem to be many comments on a grey undertone being seen on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I am able to cover under eye circles and minor blemishes without looking or feeling like I&#x27;m wearing a mask.</li>
            <li> I am sure once I have some color this will be my summer BB cream, I just have to figure out how to counter the grey tones.  </li>
            <li> First, the box and everything seem real even with an stick when u peel off</li>
            <li> This BB cream works really well and hides the pores on my nose which are pretty large and noticeable.</li>
            <li> Will be using this for a very long time :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Missha for a very long time, love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I ordered super BB cream about two weeks ago, I am 20 years old Caucasian and have combination skin.</li>
            <li> The packaging was really cute, came in a plastic hot pink wrap -</li>
            <li> The packaging was really cute, came in a plastic hot pink wrap -</li>
            <li> so I started using Skin79 hot pink BB cream, which I fell in love with.  </li>
            <li> This is easily set with a powder and definitely lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I still have wrinkles but they seem less noticeable when one&#x27;s skin tone is nice and even.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry skin though, it will probably work better for you.</li>
            <li> The VIP gold is recommended for dry skin, however I will use it during the summer but mostly during the winter.</li>
            <li> I recommend this method instead of rubbing in large swathes like lotion.</li>
            <li> And I certainly buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This could be positive in that it really stays on, even through sweat/water, but I worry it&#x27;ll clog my pores.  </li>
            <li> This could be positive in that it really stays on, even through sweat/water, but I worry it&#x27;ll clog my pores.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 27, but feel \\&quot;old\\&quot;, I guess, so I bought this silver version, since some reviewers who were older said the pink label seemed more appropriate for younger skin.  </li>
            <li> The container functions as a simple pump which is easy to use and very hygienic.</li>
            <li> Everything else seems fine besides the things I mentioned above.</li>
            <li> to mention that these above BB creams also lasts all day, and stays matte on my super oily skin without ever having to blot!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing foundation, though in heat or humidity, it does get a little shiny for my taste.</li>
            <li> It goes on a bit grayish but after a few mins looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes my skin looked amazing.</li>
            <li> Oriental gold is more moisturizing, which I did not really need.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> The coverage is MUCH better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Turns out the two creams were very close in color.</li>
            <li> I do not even need a whole pump to cover my face</li>
            <li> BB creams tend not to have that much coverage</li>
            <li> Later skin79 gold adjusts a bit to my skin color though i think it is a tad light for me.  </li>
            <li> I really think powdering is a must for this product.  </li>
            <li> This could be the real thing.</li>
            <li> And so much so that I don&#x27;t even need to wear foundation at all sometimes (</li>
            <li> This product does not take away real \\&quot;problem\\&quot; areas, but does cover up redness and evens the skin out.</li>
            <li> that much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> North Americans really need to try this cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very tan with red/yellow undertones</li>
            <li> Also it moisturizes my skin really well,</li>
            <li> I am Chinese and have light medium skin and it works.</li>
            <li> It freaked her out initially because it looked so light.</li>
            <li> This was shipped straight from Korea and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing, but even with my acne-prone, oily skin, I see fewer breakouts, and my skin stays matte longer than when I use oil-control products.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Additionally, it makes drawing/darkening my eyebrows a bit trickier since using the pencil on top of this stuff is almost like \\&quot;wet</li>
            <li> I believe this product really does improve skin to an extent</li>
            <li> Additionally, it makes drawing/darkening my eyebrows a bit trickier since using the pencil on top of this stuff is almost like \\&quot;wet</li>
            <li> I believe this product really does improve skin to an extent overtime.</li>
            <li> I hope very girl has a BB cream like that.</li>
            <li> I really like the coverage, medium-light</li>
            <li> I would consider this a medium coverage much like my revlon age defying.</li>
            <li> I absolutely swear by this BB Cream now.</li>
            <li> Seller was fast with shipping.</li>
            <li> if you have to rub it in you are using too much.</li>
            <li> It blends in really well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> so it doesnt cover as much</li>
            <li> it removes all the black/dark areas under your eyes and nose, it makes your whole skin seem smoother</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really brakeout.</li>
            <li> They helped so much.</li>
            <li> but I just absolutely adore it.</li>
            <li> visibly reduces redness for me, but I wouldn&#x27;t say you can conceal much with it.</li>
            <li> It visibly reduces redness for me, but I wouldn&#x27;t say you can conceal much with it.</li>
            <li> I apply with a foundation brush (makes ALL the difference) and gently dust a translucent powder over it with a fan brush to set.</li>
            <li> However, it evens out the whole face and and gives you a glow look.</li>
            <li> It made my oily/shiny skin matte for the whole day and it feels like I have nothing on.</li>
            <li> I did NOT want to put it on my face and was really scared to try it.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.    </li>
            <li> the pink one are my favorite they have no smell</li>
            <li> The cream works very well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t help so much with the pores, but it got rid of the dryness without being greasy.</li>
            <li> (I have light to medium skin tone, with yellow undertone), but this doesn&#x27;t match my skin tone at all.</li>
            <li> Very fancy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Straight out of the box</li>
            <li> and Pink Gelee has authentic products.  </li>
            <li> Item arrived very promptly considering where it is coming from.</li>
            <li> The color blends very well and does not look oily.</li>
            <li> But the pink Skin79 bb cream has a better finish.</li>
            <li> The make-up aspect alone and the price make this an absolute must-buy.</li>
            <li> The pump is very hygienic and the container has 40 g of product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put too much cream on, just about 1/2 a pump.</li>
            <li> I really like the texture and coverage</li>
            <li> It is very affordable and I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> makes my skin very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a light/medium coverage very silky and leaves your skin looking very healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage, so if you&#x27;ll still need concealer to cover up spots.</li>
            <li> It does adjust to some extent, but it&#x27;s definitely still a shade too light for me.</li>
            <li> Its a very creamy texture and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your whole face</li>
            <li> really is the Gold of creams</li>
            <li> Pink Gelee sent an authentic item.  </li>
            <li> This covers redness really well</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really tell how it has improved my skin</li>
            <li> Then I pat this all over and lightly blend, repeating to add layers to specific areas as needed.</li>
            <li> The seller also shipped it so fast</li>
            <li> I just have very acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> it feels light on my skin , and it&#x27;s not that white</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is absolutely everything i wanted that others couldn&#x27;t provide.</li>
            <li> (I am white fair skin with pink undertones).  </li>
            <li> I only use it several times, so far so good.</li>
            <li> This product provides a nice even coverage without the heavy makeup feel.  </li>
            <li> The finish is not completely matte, it&#x27;s more dewey but not shiny, it literally looks like normal skin.</li>
            <li> I have a few nice foundations already</li>
            <li> Prior to this one I was using the Maybelline BB cream, which I found offers better coverage.</li>
            <li> It looks nice indoors, but outdoors or under heavy lighting you can sort of tell a difference.</li>
            <li> The texture is kind of heavy</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Warning: it really is grey-ish at first like most other reviews say, but evens out to a normal neutral skin look.</li>
            <li> The day I tried it on my face, someone at work made a comment on how my freckles were super apparent that day.</li>
            <li> because the product gives light coverage but does quite a good job on blemishes, I still use my concealer to conceal my dark circles and uneven spots.   </li>
            <li> The product is authentic IF you buy it from WorldInc365, i dont know about the other sellers.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;ll have to open it up and get your pennies&#x27; worth!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you&#x27;ve tried the drugstore bb creams and are ready for the real deal.</li>
            <li> I will be disappointed if it is because it looks so good on and matches my pale skin perfectly.</li>
            <li> This makes me question whether the BB cream is genuine and I&#x27;ll just go back to ordering from my normal vendor.</li>
            <li> After about 30 minutes when the oxidizing is complete, it pretty much blends in perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, i have to have powder for this or it wont last long and coloring looks  a bit off.  </li>
            <li> but Im not sure if this is good for sensitive skin with acne.</li>
            <li> It made a nice first layer for my concealer to stick to and didn&#x27;t look thick or like I was wearing five pounds of makeup.  </li>
            <li> This shipped quickly and is a genuine SKIN79 product, which I verified by doing a little homework.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t really make me more or less oily.</li>
            <li> It settles into my smile lines and the fine lines around my eyes a little, but that may be because I have to super-moisturize that area.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my sister who have dry skin and it work perfectly fine for her.</li>
            <li> I cannot describe exactly what it does, basically makes your face all one color, and clear.</li>
            <li> I think it is very hit and miss with people with normal type skin.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m asian and fair with definite yellow undertones, and I found that this bb cream has sort of a pink-ish tint to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 and have a fair complexion with very small pores, experience significant oiliness and, depending on the weather, severe dryness, and have a long history of cystic acne (read:</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m on differin and quite acne prone), is light enough and DOESN&#x27;T oxidize!, doesn&#x27;t show my dry skin flakes or cause dry flakes, can be light or full coverage depending on how much you want</li>
            <li> One recommendation though is that a little goes a long way, you don&#x27;t need too much to get good coverage, just about a pump or two for your whole face + a bit of your neck.</li>
            <li> One recommendation though is that a little goes a long way, you don&#x27;t need too much to get good coverage, just about a pump or two for your whole face + a bit of your neck.</li>
            <li> I have very fair and sensitive skin, so I was skeptical on whether or not this will work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I kept on using the BB cream for about a month until I noticed that it made my skin really dry and patchy around my eyebrow (especially right above my nose, between the eyebrows), and mouth area.</li>
            <li> and I was concerned about fake products; I&#x27;m happy to report that this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I used it as a foundation everyday and It feel really nice and natural</li>
            <li> It keeps my face moisturized and provides decent coverage.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good cream for everyday use without breakouts or drying of the skin.</li>
            <li> PULL the top of the bottle up (grab onto the indent in the back and spout) to get to the inner canister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would use this one if my skin was being particularly uncooperative (redness, blemishes, etc.).</li>
            <li> one is only slightly more gray than Skin79&#x27;s hot pink BB cream, but I like its texture a bit</li>
            <li> VERY NATURAL!</li>
            <li> I have used the Skin79 hot pink BB cream before and decided to try this as I&#x27;ve heard that it is similar except with more anti-wrinkle properties.</li>
            <li> what i didn&#x27;t like about the bottle was that each time i pressed down the top for a new bead, it would practically \\&quot;shoot\\&quot; the bb cream out of the nozzle.</li>
            <li> so I highly suggest not to use this if you plan to go out at night if you&#x27;re going to take pictures with flash.</li>
            <li> I highly highly highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for those looking for light/moderate coverage that is lightweight.</li>
            <li> It actually changes color to a nice pale ivory on the skin, not grayish like it first appears.</li>
            <li> This BB cream was originally formulated for people who naturally have grayer undertones in their skin, so for someone with white undertones like me, it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I like to wear it without much of other makeup for a more natural look and feel like on weekends to do errands.  </li>
            <li> - I wish for a little more coverage.</li>
            <li> However it covers a little better.</li>
            <li> Not as thick in feel and in coverage as others (particularly Dr. Jart+) which translates to not as nice of coverage.</li>
            <li> The holographic logo rubs off very easily which should be a clear warning that the product&#x27;s not genuine.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s thick, but it apply very easily and stayed whole day.</li>
            <li> (so don&#x27;t be like me and press the top all the way down!).</li>
            <li> The difference between this item and the one listed on the Skin79 North America website, is that this one is the older version, whereas the New &amp; Improved version is listed on the official site.  </li>
            <li> I got it for almost half the original price!</li>
            <li> Real Complete B.B BB Cream SPF25</li>
            <li> PA++ No. 21 Light Pink Beige]](nice)</li>
            <li> It made my skin look really matte and natural-</li>
            <li> SURE to understand what the product does and determine what U need before buying as if I used this everyday on my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m exciting to see it help fade some hyperpigmentation from acne, but I also get glycolic peels and occasional microderms to help with that</li>
            <li> I have dehydrated but oily/combination skin and have not been able to use foundation to cover up my uneven skin tone and blemishes because I get so greasy.</li>
            <li> This will work nicely on normal skin</li>
            <li> I have deep golden tan skin color</li>
            <li> When I first tried the product it was a strange grey/brownish color and felt really funny.</li>
            <li> My skin is mainly dry, and her skin is a little oily and she loved it because it mattified  her skin.</li>
            <li> Normally I would just use a powder foundation but that made my dehydrated skin even more dry (especially in the winter).</li>
            <li> The weird thing is when I tried it on the back of my hand, it looked really ashy and grey like what some of the reviewers said but when I put it on my face it was fine, and after about 30-45 minutes (after it oxidize) it looked great.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it is a great product and I plan to purchase the Pink Label, which is for oily skin next.</li>
            <li> It is pretty good also but feels a little heavy and itchy for me.</li>
            <li> I have had coworkers compliment my skin and asked if I have a new makeup up.</li>
            <li> So I am eager to brag about my new BB cream.</li>
            <li> I was quite leary of buying yet something new.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after applying it, it was extremely grey and light (as expected) but after a few minutes (20 min+) it started to match my skin color more!</li>
            <li> I bought this one over the pink one, because on youtube, the pink one was popular with the 20 somethings.</li>
            <li> The Missha covers a tiny bit better but is not as hydrating as this formula and is harder to spread on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also 5 stars to the seller.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased a very high quality, very expensive foundation, and honestly, this stuff works better than that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on chalky and grey in color at first, but don&#x27;t panic!</li>
            <li> For those with VERY sensitive skin like me, use a protective moisturizer before application of the BB</li>
            <li> Very natural look.</li>
            <li> Gives a very natural finish even when you look at yourself upclose.</li>
            <li> Overall the product is good, be wary of the sellers on Amazon and check the reviews first!</li>
            <li> My T-zone gets really oily and my cheeks stay dry even in the summer after cleansing, and I found that this really didn&#x27;t give me any flakes like some makeup products do, but it also didn&#x27;t make my t-zone look oily!</li>
            <li> I did set with bare minerals powder and it looks better than my usual tinted moisturizer (more coverage, but less color)so</li>
            <li> thought this was just an ordinary moisturizer, and was seeking something that wouldn&#x27;t encourage blackheads or oil, as many ones I have tried do, and my skin is very, very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Product is very easy to apply, only takes a little and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I have researched this product, and it is the exact same product that is being offered by a website called prettyandcute.com, where they sell all Korean beauty products.  </li>
            <li> I recently started trying BB creams and paid $40 for a version from Boscia which was better than the aforementioned options but didn&#x27;t provide quite enough coverage for my tastes.</li>
            <li> This might be due to the fact that I am in my mid 20&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have that many wrinkles to begin with.    </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> better packaged (a small box with packing popcorn vs. a padded envelope);</li>
            <li> I usually do not leave reviews, but felt like this one deserved it.</li>
            <li> It does leave a white cast when taking flash photography, so be aware of that.</li>
            <li> It does leave a white cast when taking flash photography, so be aware of that.</li>
            <li> I have gotten several compliments on my skin since using this which is a first for me.  </li>
            <li> I do not usually wear a lot of make up</li>
            <li> The Skin 79 green is a bit paler and a better match, but sadly settles into wrinkles and pores, even with a good primer and moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously, you are going to send expired BB cream to someone who obviously is trying to get something good for their skin?</li>
            <li> I personally purchased this product and the Super Plus BB Triple Functions Hot Pink BB Cream, and have not had any problems.  </li>
            <li> I really like the scent although it fades pretty fast so if it bothers you, I&#x27;m not sure if it would matter so much</li>
            <li> If you have even slightly tan skin it will probably do that since it is so light.</li>
            <li> This was my first BB cream and honestly, I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> i think what happened was that every time after pressing the top down, air bubbles would get caught in the tube (or nozzle) and the next time i would use it, the air bubbles would pop out of the nozzle and cause the shooting...</li>
            <li> Worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> I am light with yellow undertones, and even though it has a slight grayish cast upon initial application, it adjusts quickly and gives me a dewy finish.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything from oil-controlling foundation (too drying) to mineral powder foundation (too cakey) to tinted moisturizer (doesn&#x27;t last long) which have all been mediocre at best.</li>
            <li> The seller wrapped the product tight and securely and nothing was damaged.</li>
            <li> I use it daily for the most part, but I am admittedly lazy about it -- even not remembering to use it everyday, the results are STILL stunning.</li>
            <li> It evened out my face like a foundation, but wasn&#x27;t dry or cakey; it blended right in and felt amay-zing.</li>
            <li> The color looked a bit flat at first but after a minute or so it looked natural with my skin.</li>
            <li> I have sun spots, large pores, redness &amp; all the age related marks on my face.  </li>
            <li> I do like it, but still feel like its still a little too light.</li>
            <li> but this was still a little too light for me.</li>
            <li> I have one fine smile line that appears when I&#x27;m dehydrated or tired.</li>
            <li> The only con is that after four or more hours, it starts to get a little \\&quot;oily feeling\\&quot; but it&#x27;s nothing</li>
            <li> It does lighten my skin a little, and better yet, evens out everything and gracefully covers some of my red</li>
            <li> in conclusion, I highly recommend these BB Creams: Skin79 Hot Pink, Skin79 Gold,</li>
            <li> This BB cream is a new one for me, as I used to use the similar BB cream made by the same company, but in super hot pink color.</li>
            <li> I naturally have clear skin but was looking for something to smooth it out a little.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s very moisturizing which is great for the windy winter weather that dries my skin so bad.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if this provides great coverage, but it made my skin have an awkward gray undertone.</li>
            <li> Then it has this rectanglular dent in which the clear plastic part of the bottom of the bottle dents in.</li>
            <li> I have clear skin</li>
            <li> and my skin looks even and clear.</li>
            <li> Under Primer (clear)</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft not sticky.</li>
            <li> but it covers so well, and looks SO natural.</li>
            <li> It has a sticker that says natural science skin solution near the bottom.</li>
            <li> It also causes my skin to look very oily and shiny after several hours of using it.</li>
            <li> But it adjusted to her chemistry and looks completely natural.</li>
            <li> It was in a small, hot pink plastic bag which I thought was cute.</li>
            <li> If you feel that a tinted moisturizer doesn&#x27;t give enough coverage and that a liquid foundation adds too much grease go with this BB cream...</li>
            <li> Fakes will also have a date of manufacture on the back, the real has it on the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> As for any anti-aging properties the product claims to have, I can&#x27;t vouch for that yet as I am 22 years old.</li>
            <li> Makes face look old and sallow</li>
            <li> It is not heavy at all</li>
            <li> Covers old acne scars, redness and makes my skin tone look even.</li>
            <li> the appearance of old acne scars is beginning to fade away.</li>
            <li> A solution I&#x27;ve heard (although don&#x27;t approve of) is to skip moisturizing completely before putting the BB cream on.</li>
            <li> this is extremely natural looking unless you put powder on to minimize the shine (if you have oily skin) but for me, i had to wait around 1.5 to 2 hours for the gray tone to blend to my skin</li>
            <li> I have had acne roseacea since i was eight years old (I&#x27;m 33).</li>
            <li> But then it blends into your natural skin color and makes you look radiant.</li>
            <li> Only 1 pump is needed for the whole face</li>
            <li> Not too heavy and not too light.</li>
            <li> I have had adult acne (vulgaris) for 42+ years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It brightened my skin and leaves a really soft, moisturizing glow (without looking oily).</li>
            <li> I really am surprised this went with my tan skin tone.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t give off the natural matte look that I prefer for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li> So all in all I like this product and would repurchase and recommend it, especially if you don&#x27;t have a whole lot of scars or spots to cover.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and last all day.</li>
            <li> It look so natural as if I don&#x27;t have any make up on.</li>
            <li> It fits my Asian skin very well.</li>
            <li> SO all I can say is WOW.</li>
            <li> and WOW.</li>
            <li> last night after I removed my makeup and washed my face, my skin still looked very even and refined.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating without feeling greasy or oily, actually feels weightless.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and gives it the moisture it needs throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many different foundations and as someone who just a few years ago never even had to wear foundation and now has to --</li>
            <li> I had been using Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream, but felt it was too heavy and didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> (if you like that then use it).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a keeper for me - I&#x27;ll use Missha on days I don&#x27;t need the extra moisture and will use this one when I&#x27;m a bit dried out and needs more moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Seller</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of foundation, especially during the summer, so I tend to reach for BB creams more often.  </li>
            <li> As with any beauty product, a little goes a long way; which makes it an even better investment.</li>
            <li> The packaging is a little strange since when you run out, you may have more sitting at the bottom</li>
            <li> I was tired of how quickly my tinted moisturizer would wear off, I love how much longer this wears without feeling heavy or looking cake-y.  </li>
            <li> I was a little iffy about buying this product because though I am asian, I definately don&#x27;t have the typical fair porcelain skin.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable, actually costs less than the first three on my list here.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start by saying I am going to copy and paste this review onto the PINK version because I alternate between the two, the GOLD is more moisturizing for when I dry out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to definitely order again from this particular seller.</li>
            <li> It covers my dark circles better than I would have expected, and it oxidizes within five minutes.</li>
            <li> The pump may stop working early on, which is a major flaw in the packaging.</li>
            <li> My face is a bit oily half way through the day when using this, so I like the pink version much better for my skin type.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product I was skeptical on whether it was authentic, but after using it I realized its too great to be fake.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t finish it with a powder and just wear it as my last step, but if it diverges too much from your natural skin tone I would definitely suggest a setting/finishing powder that matches your skin</li>
            <li> straight up clay face mask grey.</li>
            <li> IT WAS FABULOUS AND MY FRIENDS ASK ME IF WHY AM I NOT WEARING FOUNDATION ( USUALLY I DO )</li>
            <li> I used the hot pink, gold, and oriental gold.</li>
            <li> , one is hot pink, I&#x27;ll try them soon.</li>
            <li> By the way, I have normal (not oily/dry) Asian skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad darker than the Hot Pink bottle.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product along with the Skin 79 Hot Pink BB Cream.  </li>
            <li> Also can&#x27;t wait to try the samples that came with my purchase, including the hot pink bb cream.</li>
            <li> Tinted moisturizers were too wimpy, and foundation gives me a face full of makeup that feels heavy and unnatural.</li>
            <li> I use another Skin79 bb cream as a lovely shimmer cheek highlighter then go over it with loose powder and voila done in less than 5 minutes!</li>
            <li> I bought this maybe a little more than a month ago, and my bottle is almost empty now.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, andit usually looks inflamed after my skincare regimen is complete.</li>
            <li> I had finally gotten my acne under control and hadn&#x27;t gotten a new blemish in awhile.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be on the dry side and this is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It ran on my face smoothly, brightening it up and evening out all the uneven and red parts of my skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say to much for now since I have only made the one order, but they definitely exceeded my expectation!!!</li>
            <li> It blends so easily and the formula is not too thick or too watery.</li>
            <li> Medium to thick coverage thick consiatancy and great spf</li>
            <li> I have little to complain about the first bottle but the second one is much nicer.</li>
            <li> She has very dry skin and large pores.</li>
            <li> When first applied, it looks very gray, but then it oxidizes after a few minutes, at which point, it turns really white.</li>
            <li> I usually never write reviews, but I definitely thought this product deserved one!</li>
            <li> it comes in a small (it fits entirely in your palm) cylinder bottle and a pump for easy access.</li>
            <li> It looks super natural, yet covers small flaws and imperfections.</li>
            <li> I rarely stay with the same products, due to breakouts</li>
            <li> i also have really dry ichy sensitive skin, and after using the product, it made my skin feel very soft</li>
            <li> This one is definitely thicker and a little heavier than the Pink one, which provides more comprehensive coverage.</li>
            <li> but I generally don&#x27;t have to blot again</li>
            <li> , I have light skin with pink undertone (Diorskin Nude 010 or 020, I like neutral) dark eyes and hair.</li>
            <li> The color is a bit grey when you first squeeze it out on your hand, but once I blended it on my face it was no longer grey.</li>
            <li> Since the primers she usually likes tend to be in 40 dollar range this big deal for her since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> My skin is generally clear, with occasional blemishes,  so I do like coverage!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and do not recommend this for people with similar skin types.</li>
            <li> For years, I just went with a bare face.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have had no reaction, I also have hyper-pigmentation and this covers the red!!!</li>
            <li> but it apparently oxidizes and in 10 minutes</li>
            <li> I thought this would make me look younger and cover well, just made me look white, still had to do all my normal makeup routine after so</li>
            <li> I want to be able to cover up the broken capillaries and redness but without looking like I&#x27;m wearing a mask</li>
            <li> The coverage is more than a tinted moisturizer but a little less than a foundation.</li>
            <li> I waited a wekk for the skin to calm down before trying again but it still gave the same result.</li>
            <li> The formula applies evenly (a little goes a long way), and at first feels heavy, but lightens up when you smooth it out.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who has dry skin or even normal skin.</li>
            <li> This is made for people with normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> (I am Caucasian with pale pink skin that tans easily).</li>
            <li> i am SE asian (about medium toned compared to most native SE Asians) with about NC30 skin minus the heavy yellow undertones.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have too much experience with all the other brands</li>
            <li> I used the SKIN79 pink bottle bb cream before and they are practically the same, except with this gold bottle bb cream I don&#x27;t have to blot as much (I have oily skin)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve completely switched over from foundation to BB creams (Korean brands only since US BB creams are basically just tinted moisturizers which does not have the same consistency, coverage, or benefits of Korean BB creams).  </li>
            <li> No dry patches or streaks.</li>
            <li> It has a more matte finish than the Pink and isn&#x27;t as thick.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make sense to me since the older bottle was empty.</li>
            <li> No dry skin flakes on my forehead</li>
            <li> It seems decent enough for pale skin, but is a twinge dark on my skin (for reference, I&#x27;m a W2-ish in L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s True Match foundation line).</li>
            <li> I am a little paler at first, but then the cream oxidizes and matches my skin color and evens out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> (the skin tries to compensate for the dry skin and produces oil, etc etc ;)).  </li>
            <li> For about 20$ this will last for a pretty long time because a little of it really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My last BB Cream from a much more expensive place smelled like old peanuts.</li>
            <li> when you first start to use it, it&#x27;ll take a few pumps for the bb cream to surface (you&#x27;ll start to feel the pressure), but</li>
            <li> Maybe a little powder on top but no more hardcore foundation for me.</li>
            <li> Not sure why that couldn&#x27;t have been done that right away.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend the Oriental gold for mature skin or really dry skin.</li>
            <li> so far it doesn&#x27;t look dry at all on this Canadian &amp;#34;Fall-weather&amp;#34; ( -10ºC / 14ºF ).</li>
            <li> The finish is very dewy, so I&#x27;d recommend setting with a powder if you prefer a less shiny look.</li>
            <li> Recently I had a bout of psoriasis (extremely dry, flaky, and red patches) on my face, and this made it possible to leave the house looking normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s possible to see skin improvements after just one use, so it&#x27;s probably just a coincidence, but I still find it worth mentioning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it felt super cakey and thick.</li>
            <li> The bottle is also VERY hygienic because it has a little pump.</li>
            <li> When I ran out I was hesitant to purchase another because the finish was very dewy and it smelled a little like plastic.</li>
            <li> and I was already a little held back by how it just did not blend very well.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t know if the design of the real one changed or the fake one just got a little better?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that was a good thing or a bad thing.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very upset because it didn&#x27;t last as long as my previous bottle.</li>
            <li> To boost the coverage while avoiding a mask-like flat application, I apply the cream to the back of my left hand like a palette and dab my fingertips in.</li>
            <li> The coverage is natural, not cakey like other products.  </li>
            <li> and I was really concerned it wouldn&#x27;t work on me due to other reviews.</li>
            <li> Have used this cream for a long time and no one would be able to pass off a fake with me.  </li>
            <li> All liquid and cream foundations, tinted moisturizers, etc. are either too dark, too pink, or too orange on me, and look very unnatural.</li>
            <li> so none of the scars ever last long (1 year if left alone).</li>
            <li> you have troubled skin with acne, acne scars or large pores, the coverage could be a little light for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of BB Creams, and this product was recommended by a few Asian women doing makeup tutorials on YouTube.</li>
            <li> Although this BB cream provided adequate coverage and blended in nicely with my skin tone, I had horrible breakouts with this product.</li>
            <li> Just wait for the initial layer to dry, then blend a second layer into the areas that need additional coverage.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t affect how the product worked (as far as I can tell) nor did my skin have an adverse reaction to it but be forewarned if you have super sensitive skin and are wary of expiration dates!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and one can always layer it for particular problem areas.</li>
            <li> despite of the minor negatives above esp.</li>
            <li> despite of the minor negatives above esp.</li>
            <li> I have been amazed at how long it does last though.</li>
            <li> The gold has enough moisturizing benefits that I need not worry about lines and wrinkles long term.</li>
            <li> Last for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> /lot #,no obvious misspellings, strange texture, etc.</li>
            <li> I just received my BB creams in the mail, however, I tested all (I bought 4) and this definitely has a grey tone.  </li>
            <li> long as I can find it on amazon, skin79 will be the only makeup I buy for the rest of my life</li>
            <li> These last a long time.</li>
            <li> do I think it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick and does look cakey if you try to layer it.</li>
            <li> and about the texture, it&#x27;s pretty thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a heavy coverage, which I like, so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my skin down.</li>
            <li> In college, I spent about 3 years working as a makeup artist for a few large beauty companies.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little, and wow, what a difference.  </li>
            <li> I later then learned that the Gold Label was meant for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for people who have dry skin only.</li>
            <li> My skin is definitely on the dry side.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t emphasize dry patches as harshly as regular foundation.</li>
            <li> If you are still skeptical then I strongly suggest buying this from the official website.      </li>
            <li> I am consider to be fair to medium skin and my base skin tone is yellow.</li>
            <li> regular moisturizer + single pump all over the face + additional touch on spots.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this long enough to provide any review about how long it stays or the outcome in long term.</li>
            <li> but this might also be due to other factors, like my new skincare regime as well).    </li>
            <li> blends naturally with your skin tone while also covering up little imperfections.</li>
            <li> At first the bbcream does leave your skin looking greyish, but after a few minutes it disappears and your skin looks like if you just put a little of tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how accurate it will because this was posted in 2010 and that leaves quite time for enhancement of the fake products.</li>
            <li> Okay, so this product is an awkward color (almost gray on my skin) and it tends to bleach or whiten my skin over time:</li>
            <li> For example, it conceals my lighter freckles and a light in color scar on my nose, but if I have a beet-red angry zit, you&#x27;ll still see it through without concealer assistance.</li>
            <li> I use this one in the winter since it has extra skin moisturizing and will start using the Pink label in earnest soon since it&#x27;s warming up</li>
            <li> I use this one in the winter since it has extra skin moisturizing and will start using the Pink label in earnest soon since it&#x27;s warming up</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t look ashy or grey at all.</li>
            <li> As for the pink one, i would only use that during summer well becuz..</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this bb cream provides the same effect it did for the pink label.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to arrive from overseas, but it has been a pleasure to use it.</li>
            <li> I have heard that it gives some people a grey complexion.</li>
            <li> Used this BB cream for a long time.</li>
            <li> Can look grey and ashy.</li>
            <li> The color looks grey when it comes out, but not at all once it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li> But let it be known that out of the bottle, it is grey.</li>
            <li> have a sort of Grey note to it in  color</li>
            <li> so grey that i decided to give them both away.  </li>
            <li> However, i think my skin has minimal yellow undertones</li>
            <li> haha!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m white with a yellowish pale complexion and the VIP gold has just enough coverage to even out my skin and get rid of the yellow.</li>
            <li> Then I noticed the text was slightly off, and the sticker on the back was crooked.</li>
            <li> So I went back to the diamond line bcuz I figure whatever is going on with my skin, at least the other line can cover it the whole day.  </li>
            <li> Despite being a little wary of the color, this was great for my very pale, very pink skin.  </li>
            <li> Just pointing out a few things to know if it fake or real, this product that I bought was real and works so well!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the seller I bought from originally is still selling the fake though.</li>
            <li> Christian dior TM broke me out as well as the other skin79 items esp.</li>
            <li> Christian dior TM broke me out as well as the other skin79 items esp.</li>
            <li> so I actually have to put on moisturizer before applying,  but other than that,  </li>
            <li> &gt; The shipping was the quickest out of the three items in my total order (not cosmetics) from other vendors.  </li>
            <li> so I use a tiny tiny bit of bronze and mix it with the gold for a little bit of color.</li>
            <li> I still have a little dryness, but it is only my 2nd day</li>
            <li> As I said in my cleanser review I just recently discovered BB Cream and chose SKIN79 due to reviews I had seen.  </li>
            <li> A dot of it goes a very long way because it is so concentrated.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really match darker skintones as well as other bb creams I have tried, but a little dark foundation will help with the coloring.</li>
            <li> I have a dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, so I was worried it would dry it out, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and cause of the dryness</li>
            <li> I have dry skin,  </li>
            <li> but within 20 minutes (time I used to dry my hair) it matched my skin tone</li>
            <li> I can almost never wear foundations as they always clog my pores and dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> (yes, I had to use two moisturizers because my skin is THAT dry).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my face look dry and cakey.</li>
            <li> My foundations during the winter always make my face look dry and ashy.</li>
            <li> If you have really dry skin, this may be the formula for you.</li>
            <li> I have dry acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I moisturized by skin before applying this product because I have really dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cling onto dry patches and it feels hydrating.</li>
            <li> I use a moisturizer underneath the cream because my skin tend to get dry in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Then about 10 years ago my skin got so dry I couldn&#x27;t even wear foundation.</li>
            <li> For me though, it makes my unremovable dry skin show through.</li>
            <li> My skin can get dry</li>
            <li> This left a white pasty film on my skin and looked as if I was wearing heavy makeup on my face.</li>
            <li> With the older bottle, the cream was a thick consistency and smelled like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend purchasing bb creams from anywhere other than Pink Gelee, because upon doing some research there were many reports of fake bb creams from other sellers(on amazon and eBay).</li>
            <li> I was afraid the color wouldn&#x27;t match my complexion, but it naturally blends right in.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way, so i know it&#x27;ll last me a long time.</li>
            <li> This product gives a white cast when you take pictures in the dark with flash even after finished with powder foundation</li>
            <li> I am dark complexioned, however, with a darker powder the final outcome is perfection.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a 20 year old girl that usually doesn&#x27;t apply foundation because it feels so sticky and unnatural.</li>
            <li> And I had wanted to try a BB Cream, but all of the American ones seem to also be too dark for me.</li>
            <li> I do find that I get oily towards the end of the day, but setting this product with a loose powder seems to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I definitely, plan on trying the other BB products!</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way, but there&#x27;s not enough of it.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this BB makes my skin glow!</li>
            <li> so if you have oily skin, I would go with the Pink version instead as it is made for oily skin and this one is for dry skin.</li>
            <li> the pink is for oily skin and this one is for dry skin, and i myself have a combination.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry skin</li>
            <li> I wear a moisturizer under because my chin gets very dry.</li>
            <li> I got scared because of how grey it came out, but once you put on the cream and let it sit for a couple minutes it oxidizes extremely well and matches your skin tone.</li>
            <li> pink one made my skin look dead and didnt last long and blemish diamond bb cream was too sparkly to use.  </li>
            <li> I also forgot to mention that I have the driest skin of anyone I know, and most foundations cling to dry skin on my forehead and look terrible no matter how much I prime and moisturize.</li>
            <li> I like to pump a little on the back of my hand and use my fingers to spot my face with the product.   </li>
            <li> It does lighten your skin up but only a little bit</li>
            <li> When I want a little extra boost, I use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> on a bit too white / ashy, and took a little longer to oxidize - but eventually blended beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> The cream itself looks like it is white and when you apply it it brightens your face a little.  </li>
            <li> That was about 10 years ago, but I have a love of all things beauty even as I have minimalized my morning routine to about 5 minutes when I&#x27;m stuck in traffic (bad, I know).  </li>
            <li> The only thing negative I could say is that since it has SPF, it will have a white cast when you take pictures with flash.</li>
            <li> I ordered it from Beauty Works and recieved it the SAME day that it shipped...or at least the same day that Amazon displayed that it had shipped in my orders log.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a pink undertone, which suprised me that it worked so well with my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the pink one by skin 79</li>
            <li> It has a center hole thing.</li>
            <li> It suits me, goes on paler initially and blends in after a few minutes as I continue with brows and mascara.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t provide the moisture I needed, so I&#x27;m back to my Proactiv Green Tea Moisturizer \\&quot;</li>
            <li> I will order again from Pink Gelee.  </li>
            <li> I also spent $39 on Dr. Brandt&#x27;s bb cream.</li>
            <li> Cream Triple Function ( Pink Label )</li>
            <li> Cream Triple Function ( Pink Label )</li>
            <li> but I was not very tan since I like to stay out of the sun.</li>
            <li> I decided to go back to the face cream I was using before and the patches disappeared within a few days.    </li>
            <li> My package arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I tried this gold label after purchasing the pink label.</li>
            <li> and the pink Skin 79 BB creams</li>
            <li> Been on Accutane, spent thousands on dermatologists and every product you can imagine from infomercials to Sephora.</li>
            <li> I was trying to decide whether to get this one or the pink label one, but I ended up getting this one and some pink package samples (</li>
            <li> Also arrived way before I expected it.</li>
            <li> This BB cream works as well as the pink version.</li>
            <li> I brought mine from Pink Gelee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer the Gold &amp; the Pink</li>
            <li> I recommend buying this from Pink Gelee.  </li>
            <li> The VIP Gold and Oriental by skin79 are the only makeups I have used in a few years.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the pink, orange, elisha coy, liz k color veil,  and hanskin control.  </li>
            <li> I am thinking of purchasing Dr. Jart&#x27;s as well, but I have to finish the pink bb cream and a plethora of others before I return to this one.</li>
            <li> I prefer this BB cream over the pink bottle one.</li>
            <li> and it was expected to arrive from 28th to jan 2?</li>
            <li> I received my product along with the orange and pink</li>
            <li> I bought this one and the pink one.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one and the Pink one.</li>
            <li> My skin was always really clear and healthy until I started using bear minerals six months ago slowly my skin got worse and worse until I stopped ignoring it and realized that it was my make up causing the problem.</li>
            <li> It is too thick and it doesn&#x27;t spread on the skin naturally.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if the formula changed or if one was a fake but the new bottle is much nicer.</li>
            <li> very, very pale skin and several of the colours were either too dark for me or didn&#x27;t give enough coverage.  </li>
            <li> The coverage is not as heavy as I would have liked, and I find the scent to be a little unpleasant, but it does dissipate after awhile.</li>
            <li> With the new bottle, the cream wasn&#x27;t as thick, and it was lighter than the previous product.</li>
            <li> I ordered from Pink Gelee and have to tell you after looking on internet was hesitant to order from anywhere other than the official SKIN79 website.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not completely positive on this&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> The expiry date has faded considerably over the past few months, too.</li>
            <li> My skin is sooo thin (see through, I&#x27;m far from porcelain skin), prone to breakouts (no large pores), dry in winter (no wrinkles yet), normal/combination in summer.</li>
            <li> I do find that the color is a bit grey but with a little powder it warms up.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s why a little does go a long way</li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t seem different from the pink Skin79 BB Cream that I got before which did have the authenticity label, besides being a little thicker formula, but that still makes me a little nervous.</li>
            <li> I concur with other reviewers, it goes on a little grey, just let it oxidize it will blend in.</li>
            <li> It feels like it isn&#x27;t even put on, extremely airy and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Those areas perhaps need whitening as I have some discoloration and sun spots due to lack of use of sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing results from the other benefits over time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll probably purchase this again along with trying out other BB creams ^^</li>
            <li> Gonna throw away all my other products I&#x27;ve bought over the years.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried any other bb creams yet</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to other products:  i feel it does &#x27;brighten&#x27; the face a bit compared to the other skin79 sampler items.  </li>
            <li> Since you need such a small amount of the bb cream to cover your face (one pump), I would use sunscreen underneath this in the summer just in case.</li>
            <li> I have no idea when that will be because you can&#x27;t check the levels of the product due to the packaging.</li>
            <li> Every other foundation or BB cream</li>
            <li> When I opened the box and looked at the product, there was no authentication sticker on it like all my other BB creams.</li>
            <li> It also does not have a silver bottom like other fakes.</li>
            <li> Other products make my face oily and slippery, and it makes my glasses slippery, or the residue comes off on the nosepads (I wear plastic Vogue lenses, they don&#x27;t have those squishy nosepads).  </li>
            <li> Researching the ingredients is in order, and I&#x27;ll have to do what other users have suggested and use some sort of moisturizer underneath, then put this over it.  </li>
            <li> Researching the ingredients is in order, and I&#x27;ll have to do what other users have suggested and use some sort of moisturizer underneath, then put this over it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some other BB Creams, the  [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I purchased both my products from Tokyo Japan Outlet and they are BOTH legit, so I am not vouching for any other seller.</li>
            <li> Was a bit apprehensive after reading some of the other ratings on this product because of the color.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I will consider getting this product again, but I would also like to try other BB cream products too.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about other effects this product claims yet, but I will not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Who knows what other products the seller sells that are already expired?</li>
            <li> from Pink Gelee and loveeee it!</li>
            <li> I just want to inform and give a warning to those who are considering buying Skin79 products from Seoulglamor or any other sellers.</li>
            <li> I let it sit for a little and then applied another thin layer with my real techniques buffing brush.</li>
            <li> The color is too pale and grey for me</li>
            <li> Within the last few years I have started to hone in on products that address wrinkle prevention, uneven skin tone, and dullness while continuing to fight acne and oily skin.</li>
            <li> The textured is thick and heavy, didn&#x27;t like it much on my face.. makes me look darker than usual</li>
            <li> I am pale (about a MAC NC 15), always need to wear sunscreen, and have relatively dry skin that tends to break out.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover my undereye circles but helps cut them down a bit if I don&#x27;t have time for other products.</li>
            <li> My face is pretty taken over by rosacea and its flakey and red and mad everyday.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t hardly wait till my last order arrives.</li>
            <li> in cluster of zits-then my face developed bad red rash all over, totally inflamed and flaky, skin peeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Laura mercier brand oxidized way too much for me and made me feel like i was wearing a fake mask at end of the day</li>
            <li> it can cake up in one spot and or wash out the whole face, making it look like the color is wrong.</li>
            <li> I see my dark spots fading away a bit too.</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;m getting to that age when I need some coverage (for dark spots, etc.).</li>
            <li> The bronze was too dark for me</li>
            <li> I have tried it on at least 5 different people with</li>
            <li> because i have redness around the t-zone and my nose (including dark circles), i still had to use concealer.</li>
            <li> This highlights around the dark areas of my lower lids, nose, and mouth which tend to darken with sun.  </li>
            <li> I was always a fan of what tinted moisturizers do for evening out your skin tone, but they were ALL too dark for my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It fits on thick, like a liquid foundation, even though it wasn&#x27;t advertised as such.  </li>
            <li> I applied my powder over it so try and tone it down since the color wasn&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li> I store and use mine upside down to help the pump work a bit</li>
            <li> so the grey color is still a bit noticeable in certain lighting, which is a little disappointing since i will be using it for cosplay makeup D:</li>
            <li> Mixing the BB cream with a little bit of concealer makes it thick enough to cover up and spots or darkness underneath the eyes.</li>
            <li> It comes out really grey, which was shocking at first, but it oxidizes to a normal color about half an hour after putting it on.</li>
            <li> I have slightly oily skin</li>
            <li> I saw in a previous review that they are claiming that this is a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; product...</li>
            <li> The only Fake Skin79 product I have encountered are being sold on Ebay, and the differences are very obvious.  </li>
            <li> Beblish Balm has all the features I want for less than half the price.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t happened to me though, and I have a slightly oily t-zone</li>
            <li> just put half a pump and spread it between your four fingers and pat your face.</li>
            <li> I started having less acne.</li>
            <li> I use this as a foundation, if I go out or to work I typically apply my concealers and</li>
            <li> have very pale (Caucasian), somewhat dry, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> You will know it&#x27;s fake if it doesn&#x27;t have the little white authenticity sticker on the back or has a plastic covering on the pump.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what I expected.</li>
            <li> but now I just use a little bit over half pump and blend it with my fingers.</li>
            <li> I wash my face in the shower and five minutes after getting out, my face skin feels tight.</li>
            <li> also like the air tight container too.</li>
            <li> The Skin 79 VIP Gold is medium to heavy coverage and a little dark for my skin tone</li>
            <li> Now I have five or six new blemishes, so I am not impressed.  </li>
            <li> I have coverage and even skin tone without the heavy feel of typical foundations.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much the worst experience I&#x27;ve had to date.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a fake or real product</li>
            <li> use a makeup sponge to apply it thinly, with a little extra over the dark spots.</li>
            <li> It has a little gray cast for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a little bit of research and came across this website:&lt;br /&gt;[</li>
            <li> and my skin had evened out a little already.</li>
            <li> I had no flakey patches that I usually get with other foundations.  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried when I bought this product.</li>
            <li> It blends like a dream, plus it acts both as a concealer AND a foundation AND SPF AND wrinkle improvement AND nourishes the skin AND lightens your dark spots!</li>
            <li> I have oily acne prone skin and was a little iffy - used the product for two weeks</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a little thicker than the Oriental</li>
            <li> (Usually I&#x27;m affected by one or the other on any given day.)</li>
            <li> I have little bit redness on my cheeks and it covered them well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mix this with a tiny bit of moisturizer because it is very thick.</li>
            <li> The numbers on the bottom are clear and don&#x27;t wear off like the fake ones.</li>
            <li> One pump and a few dabs of concealer</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not greasy, heavy, or sticky, and doesn&#x27;t have a long-lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> Inside the bag it was heavily wrapped in bubble wrap</li>
            <li> I still need to moisturize heavily before applying it, but it never, ever looks chalky or thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For starters, it goes on so thick, it&#x27;s almost pasty and doesn&#x27;t appear wet and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like the medium heavy scent of it.  </li>
            <li> everyday anyway</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> some people have trouble with the colour.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it as it is not too heavy like some bb creams.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product instead of a heavy liquid makeup.</li>
            <li> PG said they get their items directly from Skin 79 and the code must&#x27;ve been damaged in transit (highly unlikely).  </li>
            <li> At this point I was just annoyed and wanted to send the product back.</li>
            <li> But the problem is that the word BB and the SKIN79 logo rubbed off after a few days.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> Plus, the company sends you a few samples along with it.</li>
            <li> I got my cream a few months ago, and am I still using it today.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for heavy coverage, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> That is why the bottle feels so heavy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottle is quite heavy, what I like.</li>
            <li> Wow, I was skeptical when reading SKIN79 BB Cream reviews online.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cover my dark marks from past pimples, but I didn&#x27;t expect it too.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky like alot of makeup.</li>
            <li> But for now... It&#x27;ll just be left in a box with my other failed products.    </li>
            <li> But not on my face which is already too pale without any sunspots.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already pale as it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36, Caucasian, and I have naturally pale skin with roseacea and freckles to boot.</li>
            <li> otherwise I&#x27;ll look too pale.</li>
            <li> I am medium skin tone and a bit pale.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about the raves of this bb cream (and bb creams in general).</li>
            <li> Not a strong smell like the Missha.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not easy to apply</li>
            <li> I used for a few days and then tried my foundation, and my foundation now is 2 shades too dark !!  </li>
            <li> This right after I walked out of the restroom from exfoliating. :(</li>
            <li> but I was very disapointed &amp; somewhat shocked upon receiving the BB cream as the product was expired by a few months.</li>
            <li> At least it makes my face slightly pinker).</li>
            <li> I did use some concealer for my dark circles because I was going out for the night,  but for everyday I wouldn&#x27;t even need under eye concealer, and I usually use a corrector and concealer on a regular basis with my foundations because my dark circles are so bad.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I did wrong, I&#x27;m still using my acne meds, same cleanser, moisturizer, etc...  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what caused me to break out :/</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the cream or</li>
            <li> and I usually have it on for around 12-13 hours.</li>
            <li> But the design on the bottom is different from the fake one too.</li>
            <li> I have tried using this product for a week and notices that I have small break out here and there.</li>
            <li> and I was already anxious to get it.</li>
            <li> It is my everyday go to product!</li>
            <li> I was wearing my usual moisturizer under it and noticed I was breaking out</li>
            <li> so now I just use this instead of wearing moisturizer and presto no more breakouts.</li>
            <li> like I usually do, and it stayed in place all day.</li>
            <li> so I usually put concelar and powder afterwards.</li>
            <li> Your skin will appear lighter than usual after using this cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not  sure if it&#x27;s just my skin color</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have zits at all.</li>
            <li> Try the sample box if you are not sure on which to get from this line.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is a knock off.</li>
            <li> It definitely does give you that weird tint at the beginning, but it does wear off eventually.</li>
            <li> Not sure.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how well it would be for those who are darker in complexion.  </li>
            <li> The Gold Skin79 BB Cream that I bought from this seller is NOT AUTHENTIC.  </li>
            <li> Proof that my product is not authentic:</li>
            <li> so I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t like the feel of it on my face (too heavy - like foundation), but it is not!  </li>
            <li> I like this BB cream more than the Garnier one which was terrible.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for very heavy coverage, you won&#x27;t find it here.</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin</li>
            <li> Have sensitive skin, had bad zits and rash from using product.  </li>
            <li> At least not the one I received.</li>
            <li> (my shipping estimated time was supposed to be at least 4 weeks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real product so don&#x27;t be afraid of getting a fake item.</li>
            <li> I have ever used ended up looking chalky, thick, or dark/orangey.</li>
            <li> Tint]](too thick and a bit TOO dewy,</li>
            <li> Aside from being cakey and thick it was also greasy -</li>
            <li> This product is too thick and does not blend well with my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this BB cream is EXTREMELY gray.</li>
            <li> This one is less expensive, so we are going to stick with this one when we need to reorder.</li>
            <li> I was sure it&#x27;d look awful and fake</li>
            <li> It seriously melts into my skin and makes it look even</li>
            <li> /&gt;She said the product is full of preservatives, bad things like TALC is carcinagin; not at all anti-aging, mineral oil is bad</li>
            <li> Bottom line, whitening is not good for my face</li>
            <li> but, unfortunatly this product was no good for me.</li>
            <li> In addition, I am not saying that the product I bought from Seoulglamor is not good.  </li>
            <li> I used this during winter as this has a very thick consistency.</li>
            <li> For lighter coverage simply thin it out with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out once since using this and</li>
            <li> The integrity of any company is that they stand behind the product they sell.</li>
            <li> Not happy with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The coverage is not so dramatic though.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this product, I use it everyday as my moisturizer/SPF/primer...</li>
            <li> I have used Olay Total Effects (which is what this product is like) and hated how oily, shiny and clogged it got my face.  </li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a youtube video, i was a little nervous about using it because of all the comments about it having a sickly greyish color and was unsure if it&#x27;d match my skin tone.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m a little worried about the real or fake factor.</li>
            <li> I think it was a fake, because I&#x27;ve used this product before with no breakouts.</li>
            <li> But, my probe isn&#x27;t 5mm in diameter, but 3mm like the fake one.</li>
            <li> From packaging to product - a fake product is a fake product.    </li>
            <li> It does make my face appear whiter after application which looks fake to me if worn alone which I don&#x27;t recommend...for me that is.</li>
            <li> As for the validity of the fake factor from this seller.</li>
            <li> Has a weird smell to it.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re wanting to cover difficult acne or scars, you might want to go with a heavier one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Could it be fake?</li>
            <li> (sorry.</li>
            <li> but i could be wrong</li>
            <li> but maybe I ordered wrong shade.</li>
            <li> I should have known something was wrong then.</li>
            <li> or I get bored.</li>
            <li> It put all my expensive foundations to shame.</li>
            <li> Even after 30 minutes to an hour, I still felt like I was ultra sickly and dull looking.</li>
            <li> I broke out like crazy after buying this -</li>
            <li> ill be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with that!</li>
            <li> It also has a very faint scent that fades after you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also has a very faint scent that fades after you apply it.     </li>
            <li> very stereotypical, i know),</li>
            <li> Tried to apply it like I do lotion,  bad mistake.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad happened with my skin, it covered well.</li>
            <li> But, the one I bought from this seller, seoulGlamour, doesn&#x27;t match the real or fake one.</li>
            <li> It drives me crazy!  </li>
            <li> I basically use it as a base then cover with powder.</li>
            <li> I HATE makeup.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Buy this product and you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Read the ingredients, shocking to read all the chemicals.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this BB Cream. I used the hot pink, gold, and oriental gold. Pink is the lightest color and is great for winter. I like the gold for summer. This stuff is thick and gel like with great full coverage. It blends beautifully and has a matte to satin finish. Leaves skin feeling soft not sticky. I&#x27;m combination to oily skin and find that this has longevity. It is even waterproof. I wore this to the water park and it looked great throughout the day. I wear it alone or as my primary foundation. Not a strong smell like the Missha. Oriental gold is more moisturizing, which I did not really need. I wore it during the winter when my skin was dryer. Would recommend the Oriental gold for mature skin or really dry skin. This was my first BB cream and it raised the bar in my book. All others I have tried have not quite lived up to the hype, but this one does! I will continue to try BB creams, but this is my staple cream and will used over and over again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and have ordered a few times. I introduced my friends to this product and they were very happy also. Leave your skin so smooth and make up goes on beautifully.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be on the dry side and this is very moisturizing. It gives a great natural appearance. I used to use Lancôme absolute makeup because I loved the moisturizing aspect. This has a similar consistency and for about a third the price. I am asian and I regularly receive compliments on my skin....great stuff. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I broke out like crazy after buying this - I think it was a fake, because I&#x27;ve used this product before with no breakouts. Overall the product is good, be wary of the sellers on Amazon and check the reviews first! I don&#x27;t think the seller I bought from originally is still selling the fake though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so moisturizing, and have an ok coverage. I am not saying it has the perfect coverage, after all this is a BB-CREAM NOT a foundation. I am kinda yello-white skin. And this color is perfect for me and make my skin look white and young. I have a dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product out of whim, and let me tell you, I am SO glad that I did. I have a pink undertone, which suprised me that it worked so well with my skin. The packaging was amazing, and it came about 4 days after I ordered it.  When I first squeezed it out, I was worried; it was a yellowish-grayish, blah-looking moisturizer. I have dry skin, so I was worried it would dry it out, but it didn&#x27;t. It ran on my face smoothly, brightening it up and evening out all the uneven and red parts of my skin. It feels like it isn&#x27;t even put on, extremely airy and moisturizing. My makeup glided on like a dream and looks lovely. Moral of this? BUY THE PRODUCT. Worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> This product is very well packaged, with an excellent pump. It is a tad thick and grey, but spreads out nicely and evenly and blends perfectly with my skin which is fair (I am white fair skin with pink undertones).  I am giving to my sister though. I did not quite understand the whitening.  I used for a few days and then tried my foundation, and my foundation now is 2 shades too dark !!  Bottom line, whitening is not good for my face so I will find another BB Cream without whitening.  I should mention I spread this on my neck, all exposed skin including arms, hands etc.  Those areas perhaps need whitening as I have some discoloration and sun spots due to lack of use of sunscreen.  But not on my face which is already too pale without any sunspots.  So, this one goes to my sister who has sunspots and discoloration on her face, and I am looking for a similar BB Cream without whitening. B SURE to understand what the product does and determine what U need before buying as if I used this everyday on my face I would look like a mime.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It is the first BB cream I have tried. The coverage is MUCH better than I expected. It is great alone, or with blush or other mineral powder on top of it. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing results from the other benefits over time. I ordered two brands, one for myself and one for my very fair skinned daughter (I&#x27;m medium, leaning more towards fair). Turns out the two creams were very close in color. This one is less expensive, so we are going to stick with this one when we need to reorder.</li>
            <li> This BB Cream was originally raved on youtube by Bubzbeauty. And because of her, i decided to check it out. It&#x27;s everything a BB cream should be. I have never... let me repeat.. never seen my skin so even out...!!! it tones and corrects! i love this product! a little goes a long way, so i know it&#x27;ll last me a long time. it&#x27;s wonderful, great under powder, easy to apply, fast and wonderful scent. Get it, you won&#x27;t be dissapointed!!</li>
            <li> This was my very first BB cream I purchased for myself. I got the Skin 79 Oriental Gold BB cream first but I let my mom use that so I got myself the cheaper, well reviewed one.   The packaging of this product is very cute and the pump is easy to use.   I like to pump a little on the back of my hand and use my fingers to spot my face with the product.   Then I go back with my hands and start blending.   It has a little gray cast for me but it oxidizes really quick and because the product gives light coverage but does quite a good job on blemishes, I still use my concealer to conceal my dark circles and uneven spots.   I then finish off with a powder foundation.   It&#x27;s light and nice for the summer although because I spent most of my summer in Taiwan and Japan which is very hot and humid, it melted off my face a bit.  This product gives a white cast when you take pictures in the dark with flash even after finished with powder foundation so I highly suggest not to use this if you plan to go out at night if you&#x27;re going to take pictures with flash. Mixing a bit of regular foundation with the BB cream did not work out for me and still gave me a white cast.  Overall great product and I&#x27;ll probably purchase this again along with trying out other BB creams ^^</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because of a review I watched by a beloved makeup guru . It said it was a really good BB cream so I decided to try it. When I received it I wore it to work the next day and realized that my face felt oily throughout the day. I later then learned that the Gold Label was meant for dry skin. I have slightly oily skin so the product did not work for me as well. Other than that it is a great product and I plan to purchase the Pink Label, which is for oily skin next.</li>
            <li> Through the years I&#x27;ve tried loads and loads of different foundations. I have extremely dry skin and cause of the dryness i get oily aswell.. (the skin tries to compensate for the dry skin and produces oil, etc etc ;)).  I had just given up on foundations and tinted moisturizers. Foundations always look too cakey on my skin and tinted moisturizers don&#x27;t give me the coverage I need.  This product was like heavensent! It&#x27;s as soft and light as a tinted moisturizer but it covers so well, and looks SO natural. I&#x27;m in love. Gonna throw away all my other products I&#x27;ve bought over the years.  The shipping was just a added bonus! It got delivered 10 (!) days before the estimated date. Didn&#x27;t even take one week to get this baby to Sweden :)  For those of you in doubt - just try it!</li>
            <li> This product works amazing. I have not tried any other bb creams yet but so far this one does the job perfectly. I do not even need a whole pump to cover my face and I always receive compliments about my make up now. It is almost like magic the way it just transforms your skin to give you a blemish free face. BB creams tend not to have that much coverage but if you just set it with powder or but a dab of concealer on a problem spot it will look marvelous. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to look their best!</li>
            <li> This was my first bb cream and I was concerned about fake products; I&#x27;m happy to report that this is the real deal. Great, build-able coverage and it feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have used the Skin 79 Diamond bb cream before and love it.  I got a sample of this line with my purchase and I love how it matches my skin better than the other line.  NEway, so I order this line next and used it for like two or three weeks.  What I like about it is the fact it matches my skin better and look more natural.  However, I found the staying power of this product to not be as good, it melted off my face half way thru the day.  Not only that, about two weeks into using the products, i started breaking out on my forehead and my chin.  Not sure what I did wrong, I&#x27;m still using my acne meds, same cleanser, moisturizer, etc...  NEway, I still continue to use it for another week or so before I was tire of having all my make up melt off my face by lunch time, and my skin right now is not the best shape it&#x27;s in anyway, I was breaking all over my face. So I went back to the diamond line bcuz I figure whatever is going on with my skin, at least the other line can cover it the whole day.  After switching back to the diamond line for about a week or two, my skin started clearing up again, nothing else has change in my skin routine except for using a different bb cream.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this product. However once i used it my face broke out in bumps all over. I waited a wekk for the skin to calm down before trying again but it still gave the same result. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and do not recommend this for people with similar skin types. I am not sure what caused me to break out :/</li>
            <li> So I received the BB Cream very early which was amazing to me. It was in supreme condition. I absolutely love the smell and texture. I absolutely enjoy it so far. I&#x27;m going to definitely order again from this particular seller. I can&#x27;t stop smelling my hands now. That&#x27;s the best part about it in my opinion. My last BB Cream from a much more expensive place smelled like old peanuts. I love how it works but the smell made me not want to buy from them. Not sure if it&#x27;s the cream or what. Either way, great BB Cream, great delivery, great price, and I&#x27;m very happy with my choice!</li>
            <li> This product definitely satisfies my day-to-day needs for a bb cream. Tinted moisturizers were too wimpy, and foundation gives me a face full of makeup that feels heavy and unnatural. This is light feeling, but offers pretty decent coverage. One pump and a few dabs of concealer and I&#x27;m good to go for the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very fair skinned (caucasian) and after oxidizing, the cream blends seamlessly into my complexion. It&#x27;s moisturizing qualities are very nice, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not greasy, heavy, or sticky, and doesn&#x27;t have a long-lasting fragrance. I do find that I get oily towards the end of the day, but setting this product with a loose powder seems to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> i bought the 4 pack skin79 sampler and of all the 4 items there, this is the one that worked best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me:  i am SE asian (about medium toned compared to most native SE Asians) with about NC30 skin minus the heavy yellow undertones.  i tan easily in summer and probably cannot use this product (maybe can if i have the right powder to put over it...will have to try)...though i would use it in winter/fall.  i have combo oily skin and rarely break out.  i am in my mid 30&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About this product:  This product oxidizes a bit when put on.  At first, it leaves somewhat of a greyish cast but i think this neutralizes yellowish asian undertones once product settles into skin.  Later skin79 gold adjusts a bit to my skin color though i think it is a tad light for me.  i think longevity is about 3-4 hours with primer so i put a finishing powder (drugstore brand) over it so it would last 6-8hrs?  Using a powder similar to your coloring will help make this skin79 product &#x27;match up&#x27; to ur skin coloring (IF you are about nc30 or more).  I really think powdering is a must for this product.  Honestly, i have to have powder for this or it wont last long and coloring looks  a bit off.  It isnt drying, and u dont become &#x27;oily&#x27; after several hours (not quite dewy but healthy moisturized skin).  You never feel u r wearing makeup with this on (even with primer + BB cream +powder).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other products:  i feel it does &#x27;brighten&#x27; the face a bit compared to the other skin79 sampler items.  I found oriental bb gold too oily at the end of day (though loved its initial dewiness),  pink one made my skin look dead and didnt last long and blemish diamond bb cream was too sparkly to use.  I have also used Sephora and laura merceir oil-less tinted moisturizer and found these too oily and &#x27;dead-looking&#x27; respectively on my skin.  Laura mercier brand oxidized way too much for me and made me feel like i was wearing a fake mask at end of the day (i even tried 2-3 different shades!).  Christian dior TM broke me out as well as the other skin79 items esp. oriental bb gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is a good product to be honest...despite of the minor negatives above esp. not matching to skin color and lack of longetivity without use of powder.  I really think this works great with powder atop of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if i get a chance will post comparable pics here in amazon.shades!).  Christian dior TM broke me out as well as the other skin79 items esp. oriental bb gold.    this is a good product to be honest...despite of the minor negatives above esp. not matching to skin color and lack of longetivity without use of powder.

            <li> Of all the BB creams so far this seemed to be the best coverage wise and also emanates a glow. Very good.</li>
            <li> I ordered super BB cream about two weeks ago, I am 20 years old Caucasian and have combination skin. My skin was always really clear and healthy until I started using bear minerals six months ago slowly my skin got worse and worse until I stopped ignoring it and realized that it was my make up causing the problem. I stopped using bear minerals and started using oatmeal for a facial cleanser then I heard about bb cream. I thought I would give it a try and its been amazing. my skin cleared up even more and my blemish scars have almost completely disappeared. The color matches my light olive tone very well. overall a great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this and the pink one by skin 79 and I love this one sooo much better.  Its goes on so easy and makes my skin look flawless. I have fallen in love with BB creams. It goes on a bit grayish but after a few mins looks amazing. I have a hard time finding foundations that match me because I&#x27;m very fair and seem to oxidize everything. It comes out of the bottle much darker then my skin but works amazing. I have pretty oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t really make me more or less oily. I have to blot about 2-3 hours in but I generally don&#x27;t have to blot again and I usually have it on for around 12-13 hours. I have been amazed at how long it does last though. My skin still looks amazing at night when I wash it off. I basically use it as a base then cover with powder. My blush looks more vibrant and stays in place all day with this. I will be buying again when I run out. On a side note I purchased from Pink Gelee and they are amazing and totally authentic products.</li>
            <li> I only use it several times, so far so good. It feels good and looks very nature. But it is not so good as I heard.</li>
            <li> great product - color is no where close to my skin, so I mix it with my foundation and it works well.  Love it</li>
            <li> This BB cream is fantastic. It gives great coverage, but it feels light enough to be a moisturizer. Most days I throw this on with some finishing powder, and I&#x27;m out of the door in 5 minutes. Mixing the BB cream with a little bit of concealer makes it thick enough to cover up and spots or darkness underneath the eyes. For lighter coverage simply thin it out with a moisturizer. The container functions as a simple pump which is easy to use and very hygienic. If you want a BB cream that gives a natural and dewy glow, this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li> I can say that this seller is VERY fast at shipping! Although I haven&#x27;t tried the bb cream out yet. Haven&#x27;t had time. But I&#x27;m a little worried about the real or fake factor. I&#x27;ve done a little bit of research and came across this website:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how accurate it will because this was posted in 2010 and that leaves quite time for enhancement of the fake products. But, the one I bought from this seller, seoulGlamour, doesn&#x27;t match the real or fake one. The link says that the probe, where the fondation comes out is .8mm from the bottom. I measured it. So it&#x27;s true. But, my probe isn&#x27;t 5mm in diameter, but 3mm like the fake one. So I don&#x27;t know if the design of the real one changed or the fake one just got a little better? The bottom of the container doesn&#x27;t have three holes. The numbers on the bottom are clear and don&#x27;t wear off like the fake ones. But the design on the bottom is different from the fake one too. It has a center hole thing. And then a circular bump below it towards the edge of the bottle. Then it has this rectanglular dent in which the clear plastic part of the bottom of the bottle dents in. It has a sticker that says natural science skin solution near the bottom. Another thing I should mention, when I opened my bb cream, there was no safety sticker to button you press to make the fondation come out. Everything else seems fine besides the things I mentioned above. This could be the real thing. Do your research. It has a pleasant smell, kinda like my old olay moisturizer. It has a great consistancy and blends well just like people&#x27;s reviews. I WILL do a follow up of how it is once I actually try this out and If i get more info if this is just a new design for the vip gold. But, the price is great, and it was super fast shipping, so thank you Seoul Glamour ^^</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I use it almost everyday.  It smooths my skin and also makes it feel moist. I have dry skin,  so I actually have to put on moisturizer before applying,  but other than that,  it have pretty good coverage,  tones down the redness, and gives me a clean smooth and dewy  look. Application is best with a sponge or a stippling brush. it can cake up in one spot and or wash out the whole face, making it look like the color is wrong. Tried to apply it like I do lotion,  bad mistake. I also like the fact that it has spf, and the pump to keep it from contaminating</li>
            <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t know quite what to expect with this BB Cream. It was my first time ever trying one, and after researching/ looking up Youtube reviews/ etc. I decided to go with the Skin79 VIP Gold Label one. And boy, was I glad I did. I was a little skeptical about the raves of this bb cream (and bb creams in general). Foundation, moisturizer, evens out skin-tone, etc... why haven&#x27;t we heard of this before if it was so great? But all my doubts vanished as soon as I pumped out the cream and blended it on my face. It evened out my face like a foundation, but wasn&#x27;t dry or cakey; it blended right in and felt amay-zing. And to top it off, my skin used to be full of acne scars and dark spots. Now they&#x27;ve faded! And so much so that I don&#x27;t even need to wear foundation at all sometimes (but this might also be due to other factors, like my new skincare regime as well).    Overall, a GREAT product. I highly highly highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I saw in a previous review that they are claiming that this is a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; product... It is not a fake product.  I have researched this product, and it is the exact same product that is being offered by a website called prettyandcute.com, where they sell all Korean beauty products.  This is in fact a legit product.  The difference between this item and the one listed on the Skin79 North America website, is that this one is the older version, whereas the New &amp; Improved version is listed on the official site.  If you are still skeptical then I strongly suggest buying this from the official website.      The only Fake Skin79 product I have encountered are being sold on Ebay, and the differences are very obvious.  From packaging to product - a fake product is a fake product.    I personally purchased this product and the Super Plus BB Triple Functions Hot Pink BB Cream, and have not had any problems.  I am going to purchase them on the official website as well and will report back any differences.</li>
            <li> Item came faster than shippers promised date from Korea. This is my first time ever using a BB cream product. It does look gray-ish on hand like another reviewer mentioned, but if you blend it in really good on your face, it looks better. It does make my face appear whiter after application which looks fake to me if worn alone which I don&#x27;t recommend...for me that is. I use my mineral hygienics foundation in medium golden over it and then contour with their warm kiss and then apply the rest of my makeup and it looks flawless. I have oily, acne prone skin and I don&#x27;t have to blot anymore and it lasts all day, I assume the mineral makeup helps to set it in otherwise, I can see it sliding off my face. It hasn&#x27;t cause me to break out as of yet. I&#x27;m exciting to see it help fade some hyperpigmentation from acne, but I also get glycolic peels and occasional microderms to help with that so none of the scars ever last long (1 year if left alone). I would definitely recommend this BB cream if you&#x27;re skin tone is light to a medium golden shade.</li>
            <li> I just got this yesterday but so far so good. It smells great and goes on smooth. I have dry skin and this BB makes my skin glow! I love it. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I got this today (four days earlier than promised!! Yay shipper!!) so I haven&#x27;t had time to see any benefits, but myths should be dispelled...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it comes out a greyish beige...but within 20 minutes (time I used to dry my hair) it matched my skin tone perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a medium to tan Caucasian. and I was really concerned it wouldn&#x27;t work on me due to other reviews. IT DOES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the scent is light, rosey floral but that dissipated in about ten minutes. I did set with bare minerals powder and it looks better than my usual tinted moisturizer (more coverage, but less color)so I&#x27;m STOKED I took a chance! I&#x27;ll update any change my skin has in a month. Try it ladies, don&#x27;t let the reviews scare you off.</li>
            <li> After reading and researching about this specific Skin 79 BB cream I decided then to purchase one. This is my first purchase of any sort of BB cream. First off I have to make notice that I am acne prone and I do have combination skin. I am consider to be fair to medium skin and my base skin tone is yellow. The cream may first appear to be sort of grayish when first apply; however, after an hour it blend in pretty well. I would say this a medium coverage for those with discoloration skin. For those that have acne scars like I do, it WILL NOT cover all of it! I have tried using this product for a week and notices that I have small break out here and there. It also causes my skin to look very oily and shiny after several hours of using it. I gave this to my sister who have dry skin and it work perfectly fine for her. I would recommend this product for people who have dry skin only. I would give this product a 3 stars instead of 4 but because do to its price I gave it a 4. For about 20$ this will last for a pretty long time because a little of it really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this BB cream.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of foundation, especially during the summer, so I tend to reach for BB creams more often.  This product provides a nice even coverage without the heavy makeup feel.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> IS AMAZING! I love it! I just got it today and am already in love with it. I only used it once but I love how light it is and how you can apply it with your hands if you want. This product does not take away real \\&quot;problem\\&quot; areas, but does cover up redness and evens the skin out. It is wonderful for a quick, light, fast, and easy on the go cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have talked about the product, let me just say...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product two days before it was suppose to come and I was already anxious to get it. The fast shipment really did make me love this product that much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product, AMAZING shipping.... if you&#x27;re looking into it, it is totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> SKIN79 Super+Beblesh Balm is in a word amazing. It only takes a little, and wow, what a difference.  I have coverage and even skin tone without the heavy feel of typical foundations.  The color is somehow a no-brainer, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it would match me when I pump it out or start to put it on, but seconds later when I&#x27;m done and patting, it matches!  I love that has SPF, looking forward to the lightening of some sun-freckles.  Wore just this and mascara in 106 degree weather(without melting!), and got some wonderful compliments.</li>
            <li> First off, in case I wasn&#x27;t clear, I love this BB cream.  It goes on smooth and makes my skin look wonderful, (45 y/o caucasian)  No foundation needed (bonus) and I don&#x27;t break out (double bonus). North Americans really need to try this cream.&lt;br /&gt; The shipping was the quickest out of the three items in my total order (not cosmetics) from other vendors.  I would definately order from this supplier again.</li>
            <li> Great bb cream. I used the SKIN79 pink bottle bb cream before and they are practically the same, except with this gold bottle bb cream I don&#x27;t have to blot as much (I have oily skin) so that&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I just came in the mail this morning! It got here 7 days earlier than promised! (yay!fast shipping!) I heard about this product from a youtube video, i was a little nervous about using it because of all the comments about it having a sickly greyish color and was unsure if it&#x27;d match my skin tone. I never had a BB cream before and there were more pros than cons about this BB cream, so i decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after applying it, it was extremely grey and light (as expected) but after a few minutes (20 min+) it started to match my skin color more! i&#x27;m very tan with red/yellow undertones so the grey color is still a bit noticeable in certain lighting, which is a little disappointing since i will be using it for cosplay makeup D: but i think with some foundation it&#x27;ll match perfectly! i also have really dry ichy sensitive skin, and after using the product, it made my skin feel very soft and smooth^^ I&#x27;m very impressed with this BB cream, it not only matches a majority of skin colors but is very moisturizing and conceals evenly! I really love it and highly recommend it! &lt;333</li>
            <li> I love how this lightens my freckles. I didn&#x27;t break out from it ether. It does lighten your skin up but only a little bit</li>
            <li> This was my first BB cream purchase ever and I am very happy with it! It took about four days to deliver and the product is 100% authentic and brand new. The size is larger than I thought but that means it holds more too, so I am happy. The price is worth it because my Loreal True Match Foundation costs just as much but it&#x27;s tinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It blends well to any skin tone and I noticed that it makes your skin look really smooth once you apply it. I see my dark spots fading away a bit too. The only con is that after four or more hours, it starts to get a little \\&quot;oily feeling\\&quot; but it&#x27;s nothing that powder can&#x27;t fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, It&#x27;s a great purchase and definitely worth the price. I would definitely buy again from neverprice &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This is my standard foundation, but I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s my HG - I wish for a little more coverage. I have, ahem, &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin and sun spots plus blemishes. Lovely. The color is fine for my NW 13 skin, although the Missha Signature Wrinkle Filler #21 was better (I just didn&#x27;t do well with the fragrance in Missha). The Skin 79 green is a bit paler and a better match, but sadly settles into wrinkles and pores, even with a good primer and moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a primer with this, and build it a bit for coverage, and am happy with that, more so after I began following a beauty blogger&#x27;s advice to pat-pat-pat upon application (previously I&#x27;d been using a foundation brush). It doesn&#x27;t cover my undereye circles but helps cut them down a bit if I don&#x27;t have time for other products.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! I almost finish my 1st container, and I decided to buy it again! it was more try-error while applying the product at the beginning! but now I just use a little bit over half pump and blend it with my fingers. It is more than enough to provide a mild coverage and make the face more bright and natural once it oxidizes! Also it moisturizes my skin really well, so far it doesn&#x27;t look dry at all on this Canadian &amp;#34;Fall-weather&amp;#34; ( -10ºC / 14ºF ). I just love it! It is my everyday go to product!</li>
            <li> I have read a lot about bb creams and was intrigued. I went with the Skin 79 brand based on very positive reviews. I bought this one over the pink one, because on youtube, the pink one was popular with the 20 somethings. I am 41 years old and thought this may be a better try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this is best and most surprising beauty purchase I have ever made. It went beyond my expectation. This bb cream keeps my skin moisturized and matte at the same time. I love the fact that it has spf 25 for some good protection. Since you need such a small amount of the bb cream to cover your face (one pump), I would use sunscreen underneath this in the summer just in case. It&#x27;s actually an ideal tinted moisturizer because it is so light and it offers a better (medium) coverage. I am able to cover my minor spider veins, but it feels like I am wearing nothing. I love that non makeup feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received compliments from friends who ask what I am using. I have always had great skin (very lucky), but this made it even better! One easy step and it replaced my moisturizer, makeup, concealer and primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One drawback is that it only comes in one tone. It suits me, goes on paler initially and blends in after a few minutes as I continue with brows and mascara. I am Chinese and have light medium skin and it works. My friend who is filipino and spanish can also use this. It freaked her out initially because it looked so light. But it adjusted to her chemistry and looks completely natural. This is not recommended for darker skin because it would look chalky.</li>
            <li> i love this product, been using it for the past year and its still the best from others that ive tried (BB l&#x27;egere is one of my fav too) ill be buying this again!</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT:   Well this was my first BB cream and I was impressed with it. I ordered another one from Missha as well since this shade is for my winter skin color. I would say the color is NC 20-25 and it is a sheer to build-able coverage. It looks grey/beige when it comes out, but doesn&#x27;t have the greyish cast when it goes on....it oxidized to a beautiful color within 5-10 minutes, matching me perfectly! The bottle is attractive and small, the pump is excellent and it&#x27;s easy to control how much product you want. The smell is light(powdery)and disappears quickly. This is a moisturizing BB so if you have oily skin, I would go with the Pink version instead as it is made for oily skin and this one is for dry skin. I wouldn&#x27;t say it last all day, maybe 6 hours? The finish is lovely! A light dewy finish with a soft feel to it. The coverage is smooth and natural looking~ I have VERY dry skin and this did not accentuate flakey skin, in fact it made my skin feel balanced and moisturized. I did not break out from this either(which is a miracle). I can almost never wear foundations as they always clog my pores and dry out my skin. I have tested so many foundations and this is by far my favorite alternative. I would recommend this to any girl with dry/problematic/sensitive skin. It feels so breathable and lightened my post-acne scares in about 2 weeks. Also, it contains SPF so might white cast with photography, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem with that. Over all, love it!!    THE COMPANY:  This was my first order on the Amazon site so I&#x27;m not sure what I expected. My order was supposed to arrive in about 3 weeks after I purchased it. A week later its in my mailbox!! I was so happy :) This was shipped straight from Korea and it was an authentic product(checked the sticker). It was in a small, hot pink plastic bag which I thought was cute. Inside the bag it was heavily wrapped in bubble wrap and I felt as though time was taken to make sure it arrived to me safely. I can&#x27;t say to much for now since I have only made the one order, but they definitely exceeded my expectation!!! I will def. order from them again in the future. Also, they had the best price. I didn&#x27;t contact them, so I also can&#x27;t vouch for how well/quickly they respond. Overall, very happy :)</li>
            <li> A Bb Cream... ABC, to rave about!  I have dehydrated but oily/combination skin and have not been able to use foundation to cover up my uneven skin tone and blemishes because I get so greasy. Normally I would just use a powder foundation but that made my dehydrated skin even more dry (especially in the winter). When I heard about BB Cream I started to use it and did not like the Boscia one because it didn&#x27;t offer enough coverage. I also tried the Smashbox BB Cream and thought I liked that, but then after trying the Skin79 brand I am in love. It&#x27;s a much thicker product, with moisturizing feel, great coverage but without the greasy look. In fact, I have that glowy/dewy finish without the grease! It&#x27;s amazing... If you feel that a tinted moisturizer doesn&#x27;t give enough coverage and that a liquid foundation adds too much grease go with this BB cream...</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I&#x27;m Vietnamese and have light...when I bought this product I was hoping to replace my moisturizer with this. I wanted to like this product as I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about from friends and on Asian website reviews, but it didn&#x27;t show the results I had hoped for. I have clear skin so I don&#x27;t know if this provides great coverage, but it made my skin have an awkward gray undertone. This product didn&#x27;t provide the moisture I needed, so I&#x27;m back to my Proactiv Green Tea Moisturizer \\&quot;</li>
            <li> I ordered this BB cream after all the press I noticed on youtube beauty hauls. My face is pretty taken over by rosacea and its flakey and red and mad everyday. I have tried so many different foundations and as someone who just a few years ago never even had to wear foundation and now has to -- I HATE makeup. BUT I love this stuff. I was wearing my usual moisturizer under it and noticed I was breaking out so now I just use this instead of wearing moisturizer and presto no more breakouts. The gold has enough moisturizing benefits that I need not worry about lines and wrinkles long term. Oh and for the price holy god don&#x27;t I wish I would have tried this sooner it would have saved me soooo much money! As for the validity of the fake factor from this seller. All seems to check out. I am happy and will be reordering as soon as I run out which I have no idea when that will be because you can&#x27;t check the levels of the product due to the packaging.</li>
            <li> I was a little iffy about buying this product because though I am asian, I definately don&#x27;t have the typical fair porcelain skin. So I was worried this product wouldn&#x27;t match my light-medium skin tone.     But I heard so many good things about BB cream in general so I just thought I&#x27;d give it a shot!    It is packaged in a really cute pump out bottle. My first impression of the BB cream itself was that it was a bit sticky and best to apply with your fingers. I applied it to my face and it evened out my skin tone and shine right away. The color looked a bit flat at first but after a minute or so it looked natural with my skin. No problem with the color at all.  It had a bit of a sunscreen smell but it goes away after a while. I actually really love the way it made my skin look.     This is only the second day I&#x27;m using it and I notice my skin condition has greatly improved. A lot of my usual redness is clearing, and I&#x27;m so impressed a \\&quot;concealer\\&quot; can also work to better your skin.  I am really excited I found this product and I wish I had knew about it sooner. It is now going to be a part of my daily beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I really, really, really love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very pale (Caucasian), somewhat dry, acne-prone skin. Every other foundation or BB cream I have ever used ended up looking chalky, thick, or dark/orangey. For years, I just went with a bare face. But, I&#x27;m getting to that age when I need some coverage (for dark spots, etc.). This stuff is exactly what I need. I still need to moisturize heavily before applying it, but it never, ever looks chalky or thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a makeup sponge to apply it thinly, with a little extra over the dark spots. It blurs everything nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all the SKIN79 BB creams. They&#x27;re all nice, but this one is the most invisible, in my experience.</li>
            <li> This BB cream was originally formulated for people who naturally have grayer undertones in their skin, so for someone with white undertones like me, it just doesn&#x27;t work. It looks better on me with powder, but I wish I could just wear the BB cream by itself without looking weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is only slightly more gray than Skin79&#x27;s hot pink BB cream, but I like its texture a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say Missha&#x27;s BB cream is better overall because its formula feels better and it has a better range of colors.</li>
            <li> I was very happy. When I opened the box and looked at the product, there was no authentication sticker on it like all my other BB creams. This makes me question whether the BB cream is genuine and I&#x27;ll just go back to ordering from my normal vendor.</li>
            <li> Within the last few years I have started to hone in on products that address wrinkle prevention, uneven skin tone, and dullness while continuing to fight acne and oily skin. I have tried everything from oil-controlling foundation (too drying) to mineral powder foundation (too cakey) to tinted moisturizer (doesn&#x27;t last long) which have all been mediocre at best. I recently started trying BB creams and paid $40 for a version from Boscia which was better than the aforementioned options but didn&#x27;t provide quite enough coverage for my tastes. This SKIN79 Super+ Beblish Balm has all the features I want for less than half the price. The formula applies evenly (a little goes a long way), and at first feels heavy, but lightens up when you smooth it out. It&#x27;s very moisturizing, but even with my acne-prone, oily skin, I see fewer breakouts, and my skin stays matte longer than when I use oil-control products. And the color really does adjust to light-to-medium skin tones nicely. I am light with yellow undertones, and even though it has a slight grayish cast upon initial application, it adjusts quickly and gives me a dewy finish.</li>
            <li> this makes your skin really flawless with a matte look. i love it ! blends naturally with your skin tone while also covering up little imperfections. Feels very light on skin. You don&#x27;t even have to use alot to get the coverage you need. Everybody should try this.</li>
            <li> this product gives you a light natural coverage with a lightening effect. I have had coworkers compliment my skin and asked if I have a new makeup up. So I am eager to brag about my new BB cream. It does not cover zits or pimples, it just evens out your skin tone. I do like it, but still feel like its still a little too light. The best thing about this product is that you don&#x27;t even feel like you have it on. VERY NATURAL! Perfect for the beach, work, daily activities. I don&#x27;t think I would use it for a night on the town, when I feel like I would need more coverage.</li>
            <li> Just received my first bottle of SKIN79 BB cream VIP Gold Collection.  I ordered this on Jan 4, 2012 and picked up from PO Jan 13..so was happy with that.  I ordered from Pink Gelee and have to tell you after looking on internet was hesitant to order from anywhere other than the official SKIN79 website. I did anyway and have to tell you that I am extremely happy with my cream.  It is definitely an authentic product!!!!!PHEW....I will order again from Pink Gelee.  I used the product today with great anticipation and love it. It wore great the whole day. When I washed my face at the end of the day my skin felt and looked good.  To have a cream that covers and helps your skin is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Okay, so this product is an awkward color (almost gray on my skin) and it tends to bleach or whiten my skin over time: two strikes. So why do I keep buying it? The texture and emollient quality are both amazing--and last for hours! I&#x27;ve finally started adding a dollop of this bb cream and a dollop of my (darkest) foundation and mixing them together in my palm. This application seems to work. For the price, I think this concoction works for me....</li>
            <li> love it. Good on any skin tone easy to use recommend it. Affordable. Last for quite a long time. Will purchase more</li>
            <li> I love BB cream. Skin79 is the only brand I will buy. I have bought knock offs from the drug store and they never work as good.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with BB cream. I got scared because of how grey it came out, but once you put on the cream and let it sit for a couple minutes it oxidizes extremely well and matches your skin tone. It is best applied with your finger tips. Use one pump onto your hand, then apply by using your finger to dab dots all over face. Do a mix of rubbing in lightly and patting on(this is the method I feel that is best for me) The texture is just like a lotion or moisturizer. I love how nice it makes my skin look as well, bright and well rested. My skin is pretty clear and smooth already but this product made my skin that much more healthy and radiant. I have only been using it a week and my skin had evened out a little already. Highly recommend this product! I apply it after I cleanse and moisturize in the morning. Even though this product is moisturizing, do not use in place of your daily moisturizer. The bottle is also VERY hygienic because it has a little pump. By the way, this product is not fake. At least not the one I received. You will know it&#x27;s fake if it doesn&#x27;t have the little white authenticity sticker on the back or has a plastic covering on the pump. Fakes will also have a date of manufacture on the back, the real has it on the bottom of the bottle. It also does not have a silver bottom like other fakes. Just pointing out a few things to know if it fake or real, this product that I bought was real and works so well! Will be using this for a very long time :)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what I was buying when I got this, I just viewed the highest ranking moisturizers and this came up.  I also didn&#x27;t want a foundation/makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 27, but feel \\&quot;old\\&quot;, I guess, so I bought this silver version, since some reviewers who were older said the pink label seemed more appropriate for younger skin.  I&#x27;ll probably try that one at some point, just to see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on this is very good, especially considering how long it lasts. I don&#x27;t suggest a full pump or it&#x27;s too oily. Received the package quickly with no hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this was just an ordinary moisturizer, and was seeking something that wouldn&#x27;t encourage blackheads or oil, as many ones I have tried do, and my skin is very, very sensitive.  The SPF was a bonus and important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits on thick, like a liquid foundation, even though it wasn&#x27;t advertised as such.  I have used Olay Total Effects (which is what this product is like) and hated how oily, shiny and clogged it got my face.  If I put this Cream on, nothing else, it&#x27;s nothing like the Olay.  For starters, it goes on so thick, it&#x27;s almost pasty and doesn&#x27;t appear wet and shiny.  It&#x27;ll stay dry and keep my face fine for a good 6+ hours before I need to worry about feeling/looking oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what makes it nice for someone who wears glasses.  Other products make my face oily and slippery, and it makes my glasses slippery, or the residue comes off on the nosepads (I wear plastic Vogue lenses, they don&#x27;t have those squishy nosepads).  I then end up wiping off the nosepads obsessively, pushing up my lenses, and wiping around my eyes constantly.  It drives me crazy!  So this cream was a huge relief with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a white woman, with very fair skin.  It does lighten my skin a little, and better yet, evens out everything and gracefully covers some of my red blotches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I docked a star off was that I don&#x27;t like how it makes my eyelids appear.  It seems to emphasize the fine lines and wrinkles (I have droopy eyelids), and they look dried-out.  Researching the ingredients is in order, and I&#x27;ll have to do what other users have suggested and use some sort of moisturizer underneath, then put this over it.  Additionally, it makes drawing/darkening my eyebrows a bit trickier since using the pencil on top of this stuff is almost like \\&quot;wet paint\\&quot; permanently- the pencil can easily be rubbed off, unlike if I darken my eyebrows with no makeup/cream on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does seem a bit challenging to wash off completely.  This could be positive in that it really stays on, even through sweat/water, but I worry it&#x27;ll clog my pores.  I have noticed, however, if I use it overnight rather than during the day, I wake up with a bit of a glow, even after I wash my face.. I believe this product really does improve skin to an extent overtime.appear.  It seems to emphasize the fine lines and wrinkles (I have droopy eyelids), and they look dried-out.

This could be positive in that it really stays on, even through sweat/water, but I worry it&#x27;ll clog my pores.  I have noticed, however, if I use it overnight rather than during the day, I wake up with a bit of a glow, even after I wash my face.. I believe this product really does improve skin to an extent overtime.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product I was skeptical on whether it was authentic, but after using it I realized its too great to be fake. I purchased the Skin79 Beblesh Balm in Gold and the product works great as an all-in-one sunscreen, foundation and even concealer. As with any beauty product, a little goes a long way; which makes it an even better investment. As for any anti-aging properties the product claims to have, I can&#x27;t vouch for that yet as I am 22 years old.</li>
            <li> this BB cream is very helpful for me,as it is light and fit to our skin.I hope very girl has a BB cream like that.</li>
            <li> Very light and natural on the skin. At it blended perfect even though I thought it wouldnt. AND IT DOES NOT RUB OFF. Loved it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Leaves the skin shiny, glowing and moisturized. Thoroughly loved it and would recommend it to my friends and family. Exactly what i was looking for!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product, and it offers great results!  I immediately noticed a difference in my skin.  I am dark complexioned, however, with a darker powder the final outcome is perfection.  There seem to be many comments on a grey undertone being seen on the skin.  I truly believe a darker powder would solve this.  My complexion is substantially darker than the friend who recommended it and we both enjoy it very much.  I have been using this product for several months now, and also have seen an improvement in the overall condition of my skin.  I will surely continue to order this product and strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Makes face look old and sallow</li>
            <li> I do find that the color is a bit grey but with a little powder it warms up. What I love is after taking it off my skin looks better with use. Looks great but more importantly feels great.</li>
            <li> Great product, does exactly what it promises. I am able to cover under eye circles and minor blemishes without looking or feeling like I&#x27;m wearing a mask. I would suggest this product for others!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this long enough to provide any review about how long it stays or the outcome in long term. But I love how my skin looks and feels with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 33, I have light skin with pink undertone (Diorskin Nude 010 or 020, I like neutral) dark eyes and hair. My skin is sooo thin (see through, I&#x27;m far from porcelain skin), prone to breakouts (no large pores), dry in winter (no wrinkles yet), normal/combination in summer. This cream is fantastic. It doesn&#x27;t look gray or yellow on me. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup, and there is no way someone can tell I&#x27;m wearing anything. My morning routine is so quick: regular moisturizer + single pump all over the face + additional touch on spots. My face is moisturized, and so bright. Not white, just bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have troubled skin with acne, acne scars or large pores, the coverage could be a little light for you. But it won&#x27;t hurt, it will still improve your look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pink Gelee sent me 3 samples (same brand) with this, one is hot pink, I&#x27;ll try them soon.</li>
            <li> Love this BB Cream. I have oily skin but this one is great for the winter when I need a little bit more moisturizing. BB Cream goes on so lovely and just leaves your face glowing. The first time I wore this, multiple people told me how beautiful I looked that day. I would highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Skin79 Super+ Beblesh Balm BB cream Vip Gold, after reading and watching reviews (on YouTube) and I&#x27;m super impressed.  I&#x27;m Caucasian with fair skin and a few freckles. This BB cream at first has a grayish tint (which at first is quite jarring!) but after a minute or two it oxidized and matched my skin tone perfectly. I really like the coverage, medium-light and it really was  great for my dry skin.  I had no flakey patches that I usually get with other foundations.  It also gives a pretty glow.  My lab partner in school asked me what I&#x27;m doing differently because my skin looks so smooth and dewy (made me feel so good!), I told her about the product and she went and ordered it that same day.  I have extremely sensitive skin and have had no reaction, I also have hyper-pigmentation and this covers the red!!! (whoooo!) Shipping was fast, great transaction I will order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mac nc 25 skin tone, and I bought this after seeing great reviews. I&#x27;ve worn revlon foundation for years, and was quite pleased with it, but I had to try this. I also spent $39 on Dr. Brandt&#x27;s bb cream. I wore each product on one side of my face one day. This provided more coverage with one application. I had to do 2 coats with Dr. Brandt&#x27;s, and this did appear lighter. I would consider this a medium coverage much like my revlon age defying. I wore it without primer or sunscreen like I usually do, and it stayed in place all day. No dry patches or streaks. So I am extremely impressed with this product, since it out performed a product more than twice the cost.</li>
            <li> I lost a lot of the foundation from packaging. Has a weird smell to it. Like the pick bottle much better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely swear by this BB Cream now. I have extremely dry skin and it is flaky on my forehead and cheeks, but this bb cream is very moisturizing and does not accentuate my flakiness at all! The color is a bit grey when you first squeeze it out on your hand, but once I blended it on my face it was no longer grey. I am a NC20-25 shade and it definitely matched my skin perfectly. It blends so easily and the formula is not too thick or too watery. The coverage is more than a tinted moisturizer but a little less than a foundation. It is not heavy at all and it does not \\&quot;look\\&quot; like you&#x27;re wearing makeup. It evened out my skin tone beautifully and covered some lighter blemishes. But what I loved the most is that for some reason my HUGE pores are not noticeable at all! My skin just looks like perfect skin! The finish is not completely matte, it&#x27;s more dewey but not shiny, it literally looks like normal skin. I completely love this product and it will definitely replace my moisturizer and tinted moisturizer (yes, I had to use two moisturizers because my skin is THAT dry). I recommend this to anyone who has dry skin or even normal skin. This is just an amazing product, and the price is really not expensive! It shipped the next day and arrived a week later (east coast) all the way from Korea!    The only thing negative I could say is that since it has SPF, it will have a white cast when you take pictures with flash. But, honestly, since I will be using this during the day, I prefer having the SPF in it to protect my face.</li>
            <li> I have fair, sensitive acne prone skin and normal foundation breaks me out. I heard about BB cream and got the sample pack of Skin79 creams. I loved this one the most! When it oxidizes it matches my skin tone perfect so it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing anything. Covers old acne scars, redness and makes my skin tone look even. I haven&#x27;t broken out once since using this and the appearance of old acne scars is beginning to fade away. I use 1 pump and apply it all over my face then i pat a bit more on my old acne scars and any blemishes i may have. I use another Skin79 bb cream as a lovely shimmer cheek highlighter then go over it with loose powder and voila done in less than 5 minutes! I will continue using this product!</li>
            <li> I have sun spots, large pores, redness &amp; all the age related marks on my face.  I have a few nice foundations already but BB cream is popular now so I gave it a try.  I like it.  I&#x27;m NC25 and I like this BB cream:  feels good, non-drying, evens skin tone &amp; gives me a happy glow almost.  I used it for a few weeks and I think my wrinkles deepened a bit and I even got a bit of skin irritation around the hairline.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s coincidence or what.  I also don&#x27;t like the medium heavy scent of it.  But even though it did not lessen my wrinkles nor clears up my skin, I still like how it looks/feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good buy &amp; good alternate makeup.  I&#x27;d buy it again after I use up this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;November 2012 update:  As much as I liked it, it caused breakouts.  So I still have 80% of it left.  Won&#x27;t repurchase either.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-- Light and airy and easy to apply and blend - I love he way this feels after applying&lt;br /&gt;-- Natural, slightly dewy look that I really like - great for a no-makeup look&lt;br /&gt;-- Like most other BB creams, brightens my skin very nicely although it does darken a little over time (oxidizes). I&#x27;ve heard that this helps it adjust to many other skin tones beyond those of us who are very fair but I&#x27;m not completely positive on this&lt;br /&gt;-- I really like the scent although it fades pretty fast so if it bothers you, I&#x27;m not sure if it would matter so much&lt;br /&gt;-- SPF 25 although I always put on an SPF 30 underneath it (and over my moisturizer) everyday anyway so this doesn&#x27;t matter so much to me personally. This is the face protectant I use --&gt; [[ASIN:B0009DY9JQ Jan Marini Antioxidant Face Protectant SPF 30]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-- Bottle - You can&#x27;t tell how much is left in the bottle at any given time&lt;br /&gt;-- Not as thick in feel and in coverage as others (particularly Dr. Jart+) which translates to not as nice of coverage. This will work nicely on normal skin but if you&#x27;re wanting to cover difficult acne or scars, you might want to go with a heavier one. I would say this is more of a medium coverage cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard some people complaining about oil control in the middle of the day and needing to reapply. The product doesn&#x27;t actually claim to have any oil control so I can easily see this occurring. This is made for people with normal to dry skin. This hasn&#x27;t happened to me though, and I have a slightly oily t-zone and I also never ever ever skip over any of my moisturizing steps. A solution I&#x27;ve heard (although don&#x27;t approve of) is to skip moisturizing completely before putting the BB cream on. I think it is very hit and miss with people with normal type skin. If you have oily skin, this isn&#x27;t the product for you but Skin79 does have others geared towards your type of skin (in fact I own it and it works just as well except instead of \\&quot;skin nourishment\\&quot; it has sebum control. --&gt; [[ASIN:B0020ZEA40 SKIN79 Super+ Beblesh Balm BB Cream Triple Function ( Pink Label ) SPF25 PA++ 40g]])&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought both kinds because I&#x27;m in the in between of skin types. I use this one in the winter since it has extra skin moisturizing and will start using the Pink label in earnest soon since it&#x27;s warming up and I&#x27;ll probably enjoy the sebum control more now.shment\\&quot; it has sebum control. --&gt; [[ASIN:B0020ZEA40 SKIN79 Super+ Beblesh Balm BB Cream Triple Function ( Pink Label ) SPF25 PA++ 40g]])&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought both kinds because I&#x27;m in the in between of skin types. I use this one in the winter since it has extra skin moisturizing and will start using the Pink label in earnest soon since it&#x27;s warming up and I&#x27;ll probably enjoy the sebum control more now.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome bb cream. This is my favorite bb cream of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried. Before I&#x27;ve tried this, I&#x27;ve tried missha, ihope, mammonde, laniege, rimmel London, and more but this VIP gold is my top pick! It doesn&#x27;t make me get pimples and that&#x27;s what I love about it most. It&#x27;s very light coverage but also buildable. I was using it alone for the longest until I ordered the bronze. The bronze was too dark for me so I use a tiny tiny bit of bronze and mix it with the gold for a little bit of color. I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am not asian and it works great. I have not been able to find a product to cover up my inperfections on my face and this one covers it 90%. Would definately reccommend!!</li>
            <li> I had the pleasure of using this bb cream as my first experience with bb cream, and ordering anything on amazon.  I was very pleased with price, shipping cost and speed but the product itself is very nice. I think the English translation could use some improvement, but the cream itself gives my skin a very very nice appearance. It is a very nice product, and works well. I have had acne for most of the last 2 decades and have scars from it, and this bb cream covers better then concealer and foundation. Thanks for the great product!</li>
            <li> This was my first BB cream and honestly, I was not impressed. I wanted to love it so much though! By the way, I have normal (not oily/dry) Asian skin but I was not very tan since I like to stay out of the sun. I first tried this product on my hand and I was already a little held back by how it just did not blend very well. The day I tried it on my face, someone at work made a comment on how my freckles were super apparent that day. LOL. I don&#x27;t know if that was a good thing or a bad thing.    The gray hue that the product created was not flattering at all. Even after 30 minutes to an hour, I still felt like I was ultra sickly and dull looking. I&#x27;ve tried using it as a concealer before putting on my foundation, but I felt like it stripped all of the moisture out of my face.    I kept on using the BB cream for about a month until I noticed that it made my skin really dry and patchy around my eyebrow (especially right above my nose, between the eyebrows), and mouth area. I decided to go back to the face cream I was using before and the patches disappeared within a few days.    Overall, the packaging was attractive, but it just did not do what I had expected. I wish I can figure out some way to take out the cream from the bottle and replace it with my non-bb cream, daily moisturizer. But for now... It&#x27;ll just be left in a box with my other failed products.    I&#x27;m not telling anyone not to buy, but this Skin79 product did not work for me. I may try another brand in the future.</li>
            <li> I have used the Skin79 hot pink BB cream before and decided to try this as I&#x27;ve heard that it is similar except with more anti-wrinkle properties. I have been using it for a few weeks now but I didn&#x27;t notice any anti-wrinkle results. This might be due to the fact that I am in my mid 20&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have that many wrinkles to begin with.    Great product over all. I highly recommend it.  Seller was fast with shipping. My package arrived sooner than expected. I would purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> this works soooooo great that i dont even know what to say except for buy it while you can ! now</li>
            <li> some people have trouble with the colour. just put half a pump and spread it between your four fingers and pat your face. if you have to rub it in you are using too much. great product for me because i need little to no coverage.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried when I bought this product. I was thinking it would be too light for my skin because I am in America and I&#x27;m darker than most Asians. But it still blended nicely with my skin and I don&#x27;t look ashy or grey at all. It smells nice, is super hypoallergenic and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> So, before I purchased this product, I have tried the Missha BB cream first and I loved that product except the only downside to it was that it left a residue at the end of the night cleaning up or after I apply and pat my face with a towel, there would be a lot of product that came off. Trying this gold vip by Skin 79, I did notice the coverage wasn&#x27;t full coverage like Missha&#x27;s. It is a more light to medium coverage which was the only thing that bothered me. I like the consistency of this a lot better. It goes on so much smoother than Missha&#x27;s and it melts in your skin so it feels like you aren&#x27;t wearing anything at all! I would repurchase!</li>
            <li> This BB cream is amazing, this is actually one of my top 5 favorite bb cream, i did buy the pink one and this one. And comparing them, i personally like this one better, because this is soo moisturizing and easy to apply with my fingers. And it blends in with my skin more. As for the pink one, i would only use that during summer well becuz..the pink is for oily skin and this one is for dry skin, and i myself have a combination.</li>
            <li> Great BB cream. Nice and even coverage!</li>
            <li> I really like its texture, since I did have a light tan it was light on my face but when I return to my natural color it will be perfect. It&#x27;s an amazing foundation, though in heat or humidity, it does get a little shiny for my taste. All in all, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> this is extremely natural looking unless you put powder on to minimize the shine (if you have oily skin) but for me, i had to wait around 1.5 to 2 hours for the gray tone to blend to my skin and I&#x27;m already pale as it is. i just have a yellow tone to my skin. anyway aside from the grayish undertone, its best for dry skin people since my skin is all dry.</li>
            <li> I love using this during the winter. It doesn&#x27;t make my face look dry and cakey. My foundations during the winter always make my face look dry and ashy. This bb cream is light to medium coverage so I usually put concelar and powder afterwards. But otherwise I love it!</li>
            <li> I made the rash decision to buy this last summer from World Buy 365. Inc because it seemed like a good deal. While it&#x27;s almost indistinguishable from the original and comes with all the markers of an original, (perforation, expiry date/lot #,no obvious misspellings, strange texture, etc. etc) do not be fooled. The holographic logo rubs off very easily which should be a clear warning that the product&#x27;s not genuine. The expiry date has faded considerably over the past few months, too. There&#x27;s really no telling what kind of concoction you&#x27;d be putting on your skin so be safe and buy from the manufacturer&#x27;s site.</li>
            <li> I tried this gold label after purchasing the pink label. The coverage of this bb cream is adequate. I still had to apply concealer to cover my blemishes. I didn&#x27;t like that it made my face shine because I prefer a matte look. Also, the bb cream was too white for my face.&lt;br /&gt;However, this bb cream provides the same effect it did for the pink label. I started having less acne.</li>
            <li> My skin is definitely on the dry side. I wash my face in the shower and five minutes after getting out, my face skin feels tight. If you have really dry skin, this may be the formula for you. The finish is very dewy, so I&#x27;d recommend setting with a powder if you prefer a less shiny look. It seems decent enough for pale skin, but is a twinge dark on my skin (for reference, I&#x27;m a W2-ish in L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s True Match foundation line). I personally prefer Skin79 Hot Pink for the more matte finish, but this formula is wonderful for me in the winter.</li>
            <li> A lot more sheer that what I was expecting. Prior to this one I was using the Maybelline BB cream, which I found offers better coverage.Love that it uses a natural (Titanium dioxide) sunscreen. I also like the light scent of this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some other BB Creams, the  [[ASIN:B002C1JEPM SKIN79 Oriental Gold BB Cream with Lip &amp; Cheek Tint]](too thick and a bit TOO dewy, [[ASIN:B003EPNWG2 MISSHA M Signature Real Complete B.B BB Cream SPF25 PA++ No. 21 Light Pink Beige]](nice) and the pink Skin 79 BB creams but this is my favorite.  I&#x27;m 36, Caucasian, and I have naturally pale skin with roseacea and freckles to boot. I want to be able to cover up the broken capillaries and redness but without looking like I&#x27;m wearing a mask and I could never achieve that with liquid foundation.  This has a pretty light coverage, but it&#x27;s buildable which is great, as I can add layers on my nose and cheeks without it looking thick or clumpy.  It blends in really well.  It does have a grayish tone when you first put it on but it apparently oxidizes and in 10 minutes or so it&#x27;s fine.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I was very much looking forward to trying out this product after reading so many positive reviews. The company \\&quot;SeoulGlamour\\&quot; seemed reputable based on the multiple reviews here on Amazon. The shipping was very fast but I was very disapointed &amp; somewhat shocked upon receiving the BB cream as the product was expired by a few months. I have contacted the company &amp; will update this post when I hear back from them.  My advice at this point, honestly is, if you want the real thing without any deception then order straight from the company that actually makes the product. The integrity of any company is that they stand behind the product they sell. We shall see if that is the case with \\&quot;SeoulGlamour\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is a nice bb cream with pretty good coverage. The color looks good on my fair skin tone because the product has more of a beige color that I usually like. I still moisturize before I put this on as it is not a substitute because it is a makeup product and not a face cream. I also use concealer after application and then powder. I will continue to use it as it is not too heavy like some bb creams. It also doesn&#x27;t take much to get good coverage. Would recommend this product instead of a heavy liquid makeup.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start by saying I am going to copy and paste this review onto the PINK version because I alternate between the two, the GOLD is more moisturizing for when I dry out. I purchased both my products from Tokyo Japan Outlet and they are BOTH legit, so I am not vouching for any other seller. I have had acne roseacea since i was eight years old (I&#x27;m 33). Caked on makeup to try to hide my skin. Been on Accutane, spent thousands on dermatologists and every product you can imagine from infomercials to Sephora. If you&#x27;ve been there, you know. I am also whiter than the whitest of white times infinity, almost see-through so redness is not something I can really easily hide. But this stuff?? Let me tell you. My skin has NEVER been this clear and smooth. I don&#x27;t care what&#x27;s in it! It works. Even when I have not used this for a few days, my skin still looks great. I use it daily for the most part, but I am admittedly lazy about it -- even not remembering to use it everyday, the results are STILL stunning. I put a LOT on, like you would a moisturizer and use it as a foundation. Maybe a little powder on top but no more hardcore foundation for me. I concur with other reviewers, it goes on a little grey, just let it oxidize it will blend in. It may not be for everyone, but at this price, after spending probably 10x as concoctions from department store brands, give it away if you don&#x27;t like it!</li>
            <li> What everyone says is true -- the product does at first look greyish when you put it on your skin. But then it blends into your natural skin color and makes you look radiant. I was amazed with the effect on my skin. I&#x27;ve never had great looking skin but with this product I get good coverage and my skin looks even and clear. I have tried it on at least 5 different people with various (caucasian) skin tones and found that it miraculously blends to their own skin as well. Recently I had a bout of psoriasis (extremely dry, flaky, and red patches) on my face, and this made it possible to leave the house looking normal. I recently purchased a very high quality, very expensive foundation, and honestly, this stuff works better than that. I am buying it again and again (it also makes a great gift) and probably won&#x27;t buy the other foundation again. Highly recommended. For best results, first wash the face with an oil-based cleanser (e.g. [...] then moisturize, then apply this to the skin. Only 1 pump is needed for the whole face and I find it is more effective to blend with fingers than with a sponge or brush.</li>
            <li> Working great, thanks.</li>
            <li> Update, May 1, 2015: Wow! I like this product and have ordered it before, but this time it was faster (a couple of days, instead of a couple of weeks); better packaged (a small box with packing popcorn vs. a padded envelope); and they included a handful of SAMPLES! Impressed in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously: I think Refinery29 had glowingly reviewed the [[ASIN:B00EC43CK0 Skin79 Hot Pink Super Plus Bb Cream 40g Spf25 Pa++_pump]], but as an over-50 minimalist with a rather ruddy Caucasian complexion, I too went with this Gold version instead, and have been SO pleased. It took a long time to arrive from overseas, but it has been a pleasure to use it. My husband cracked, &amp;#34;Oh, you get rid of wrinkles by spackling your face?&amp;#34; Indeed, it goes on looking rather caulky, but a few minutes later my skin tone is even and I have a deceptively deep-looking glow, making me appear elegant and enigmatic behind this cure-all facial balm. When I want a little extra boost, I use [[ASIN:B00G8QU4Q0 Trader Joe&#x27;s Nourish Antioxidant Facial Serum Two Pack]] first, which is also very reasonably priced and gives a nourished, matte look to my otherwise shiny face. I&#x27;m very pleased with this first foray into beblesh balm, and I&#x27;ve let my husband know that he can go spackle HIMSELF (heh!).</li>
            <li> I honestly love this make up! It&#x27;s the only make up that doesn&#x27;t give me a rash when I wear it .It makes my face look clean and healthy</li>
            <li> Researched online the various BB creams and found that these are the best the ones.  Was a bit apprehensive after reading some of the other ratings on this product because of the color.  I have deep golden tan skin color and although this is very light, when i apply make up it blends perfectly!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced me to this product, and I love it.  The coverage is natural, not cakey like other products.  It has evened out my skin tone and I hardley ever break out anymore.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth, natural looking. One of my most favorite BB cream I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the air tight container too.</li>
            <li> Fair coverage. Not too heavy and not too light. Good for daily sunscreen wear. Highly recommend it! If you&#x27;re looking for light coverage, Super+BB Cream will do the magic. However, this product does not act like a concealer.</li>
            <li> It is too thick and it doesn&#x27;t spread on the skin naturally. I used it only sometimes and I threw it away eventually.</li>
            <li> The product is authentic IF you buy it from WorldInc365, i dont know about the other sellers. The cream itself is good and moisturizes the skin, it also brightens it, It takes 5 mins before it oxedates to match your skintone. I just wished it covered imperfections a bit more but then i remembered that this is a bb cream and not foundation so it doesnt cover as much but it still hides many major flaws, its specially really good for the morning it removes all the black/dark areas under your eyes and nose, it makes your whole skin seem smoother</li>
            <li> Made my skin break out</li>
            <li> It blends easily and gives what it promises. I use it every day. The can is super cute and the smell is really good</li>
            <li> This works so well it makes my skin glow :) and on days when I need more coverage I mix it with my regular makeup and I don&#x27;t really brakeout. This makeup never gives me acne and I love it and it has improved my skin tremendously</li>
            <li> I use it daily. It works like magic. IT MAKES MY FACE LOOK LIKE A PRINCESS. I cannot describe exactly what it does, basically makes your face all one color, and clear. I usually do not leave reviews, but felt like this one deserved it.</li>
            <li> I have had adult acne (vulgaris) for 42+ years. Never wore foundation or had to worry about creams &#x27;til then. This BB cream is by far the BEST thing I have put on my face .......EVER.  I am not over dramatizing. My skin just loves it. I have waited a week to write a review just to be sure. I have oily skin. No problem. Scars and deep wrinkles (ugh!) are lessened -even after I wash my face. I am so glad I bought this product. I want to thank all those reviewers who led me to this purchase. They helped so much. I was quite leary of buying yet something new. So &amp;#34;Thank You&amp;#34;. And &amp;#34;Thank You&amp;#34; Skin79.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about this but I just absolutely adore it. I have the NARS Sheer Glow Foundation and the Makeup Forever Mat Velvet + and i prefer this 10x more than those. The color works great for me. I like the fact that it goes on kind of gray because it neutralizes my skin tone. It blends out to match your skin though, but it leaves your face looking so beautiful!</li>
            <li> My very first BB cream. I was trying to decide whether to get this one or the pink label one, but I ended up getting this one and some pink package samples (just in case, I wanted to try it) and the VIP Gold collection is pretty awesome!&lt;br /&gt;So it comes in a small (it fits entirely in your palm) cylinder bottle and a pump for easy access. Not messy at all, easy application, and very easy to blend!! Just a squeeze a bit on the palm of your hand and apply with your fingertips or a brush. When it first comes out I was really scared because it looked kind of grey...it looked like a medium tan/beige-ish gray and didn&#x27;t match my skin at all. But as I applied it it blended into my skin perfectly! (I&#x27;m asian and fair with definite yellow undertones, and I found that this bb cream has sort of a pink-ish tint to it. At least it makes my face slightly pinker). It looks nice indoors, but outdoors or under heavy lighting you can sort of tell a difference. This was 5-10 minutes after application. After about 30 minutes when the oxidizing is complete, it pretty much blends in perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;It brightened my skin and leaves a really soft, moisturizing glow (without looking oily). I&#x27;m so glad this also contains SPF even though I still wear it under my daily moisturizer with SPF 30. That&#x27;s probably why it looks lighter than it&#x27;s supposed to? I also don&#x27;t finish it with a powder and just wear it as my last step, but if it diverges too much from your natural skin tone I would definitely suggest a setting/finishing powder that matches your skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have combination skin. My T-zone gets really oily and my cheeks stay dry even in the summer after cleansing, and I found that this really didn&#x27;t give me any flakes like some makeup products do, but it also didn&#x27;t make my t-zone look oily! It covered up flawlessly and I&#x27;m so thankful for that. After wearing it for several hours it&#x27;s still in tact and honestly it feels like I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup. It doesn&#x27;t come off on your hand, it&#x27;s like it dissolved into my skin or something. But I know it&#x27;s there because of the coverage. I would say this is about light to medium coverage. One recommendation though is that a little goes a long way, you don&#x27;t need too much to get good coverage, just about a pump or two for your whole face + a bit of your neck. It does leave a white cast when taking flash photography, so be aware of that. Don&#x27;t want your face to be a completely different color than the rest of your skin!&lt;br /&gt;It visibly reduces redness for me, but I wouldn&#x27;t say you can conceal much with it. It also has a very faint scent that fades after you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the company that sells it (my shipping estimated time was supposed to be at least 4 weeks +, but it arrived in just 12 days! (not even two weeks)! The packaging was really cute, came in a plastic hot pink wrap - that was a nice touch. And it also came wrapped in bubble wrap and the outside container the bb cream container was in was a bit damaged but the product itself was in perfect condition. I will buy from them again once I run out. (:&#x27;s like it dissolved into my skin or something. But I know it&#x27;s there because of the coverage.

            <li> At first the bbcream does leave your skin looking greyish, but after a few minutes it disappears and your skin looks like if you just put a little of tinted moisturizer. My mom asked if she could try it and she absolutely loved it! My skin is mainly dry, and her skin is a little oily and she loved it because it mattified  her skin. worked for both of us.  Plus the packaging is amazing, so cute! :D absolutely love it and WILL purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This is second time to purchase this product. I put it on everyday like sunscreen protection, highly recommend to my friend, very good product!</li>
            <li> I will never be without this product again. I get compliments almost weekly about how &amp;#34;fresh faced&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;gorgeous&amp;#34; my skin looks- and let&#x27;s be honest how often do people even say that stuff? I apply with a foundation brush (makes ALL the difference) and gently dust a translucent powder over it with a fan brush to set. It&#x27;s buildable to an extent; I would describe it as light-medium to medium coverage depending on how it is applied. For example, it conceals my lighter freckles and a light in color scar on my nose, but if I have a beet-red angry zit, you&#x27;ll still see it through without concealer assistance. I have noticed an improvement in my skins&#x27; overall texture and tone since I started using this about seven months ago.</li>
            <li> I heard so much about how magic BB cream is. Before I bought it, I read a lot of review and it seems to be a good one. It works great for dry skin. I have to test it out for its anti-wrinkle function.  The coverage is not so dramatic though. However, it evens out the whole face and and gives you a glow look.</li>
            <li> I really love the Skin79 BB cream line. I got to try this Gold bottle and it&#x27;s great for my combination skin even if others have said it&#x27;s for oily skin. It&#x27;s a tad darker than the Hot Pink bottle. But coverage is medium and covers my freckles and redness just fine. This is best applied with your fingers.</li>
            <li> I have VERY oily/acne prone skin and putting any sort of make up or skin product that I haven&#x27;t heavily researched will make my skin look like I&#x27;m 14 again. My friend from Korea recommended this product and I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it. It made my oily/shiny skin matte for the whole day and it feels like I have nothing on. It&#x27;s not a heavy coverage, which I like, so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my skin down. I really love that it also has SPF and whitening (for my scars).     When I first tried the product it was a strange grey/brownish color and felt really funny. I did NOT want to put it on my face and was really scared to try it. But when I blended it in, it instantly felt like air and changed to my skin tone in a matter of minutes. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments all day!    The seller wrapped the product tight and securely and nothing was damaged. Not even a scratch! Also arrived way before I expected it. Thanks so much.    I really love this product and will be buying again! :)</li>
            <li> Medium to thick coverage thick consiatancy and great spf. I have used many BB creams this one and the pink one are my favorite they have no smell have good consistency and coverage and are a great price. I suggest trying this one there are many out there but this is a top contender!</li>
            <li> The cream works very well. Your skin will appear lighter than usual after using this cream. It also shipped 3 days ahead of scheduled delivery, so I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes my skin look brighter and give my face a healthy glow. I used it as a foundation everyday and It feel really nice and natural like i had nothing on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real product so don&#x27;t be afraid of getting a fake item. They also send you the newest packaging. Unfortunately, this BB cream is EXTREMELY gray. Even after oxidizing, it&#x27;s still too gray for me. If it was less gray and more yellow, it would&#x27;ve been perfect. If you have very cool toned skin and are pretty pale, it&#x27;s good and it&#x27;ll blend in better. But I have NC 30-35 skin and it looks like a mask on me. No matter what I do, I can&#x27;t make it work. I love the packaging and the feel of the product. The product feels very light and nice on the skin. It doesn&#x27;t feel like foundation. It&#x27;s pretty thick and does look cakey if you try to layer it. It provides medium coverage and it&#x27;s blendable. It&#x27;s a very good BB cream if your skin matches it. But it doesn&#x27;t match for me. It&#x27;s an awesome price as well.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product because a beauty guru I watch collects BB Creams and she strongly recommended this one. I went to the BB Cream website and all of the products are a pretty good chunk of money (around $40 for this particular BB Cream), so I came here. I got it for almost half the original price! And no wonder this BB Cream is so raved about! It blends like a dream, plus it acts both as a concealer AND a foundation AND SPF AND wrinkle improvement AND nourishes the skin AND lightens your dark spots! I absolutely LOVE this BB Cream!</li>
            <li> I like it it just makes me look a bit gray. Can&#x27;t use it alone but I know it will protect my face. Also, it kinda makes me look shinny. But I dont think Id get this BB cream again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes that it would do everything it says it will. I have very pale skin and it matches perfectly. A dot of it goes a very long way because it is so concentrated. I use it as a light foundation. I have heard that it gives some people a grey complexion. If you have even slightly tan skin it will probably do that since it is so light. I haven&#x27;t noticed it whitening my face, but it does even the tone like a light foundation should. Also, I haven&#x27;t noticed any anti-ageing effects. I have one fine smile line that appears when I&#x27;m dehydrated or tired. The product does nothing for it. I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you have oily skin. I have dry acne prone skin and it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.&lt;br /&gt;I let my mom give it a go and she thought it was good as a primer.  She liked that it gave her a dewy complexion and helped her makeup stay on longer. She has very dry skin and large pores. I didn&#x27;t help so much with the pores, but it got rid of the dryness without being greasy. Since the primers she usually likes tend to be in 40 dollar range this big deal for her since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not  sure if it&#x27;s just my skin color (I have light to medium skin tone, with yellow undertone), but this doesn&#x27;t match my skin tone at all. When first applied, it looks very gray, but then it oxidizes after a few minutes, at which point, it turns really white. I wouldn&#x27;t buy make up at all over the internet except from Sephora, or unless I have used the product before and know for sure that it will work on me.</li>
            <li> This BB cream works as well as the pink version. I love the look of the bottle. Very fancy.</li>
            <li> Used this BB cream for a long time. I mix with clinque tinted moisterizer because it has a gray white tone to it.</li>
            <li> The texture is kind of heavy and it&#x27;s not easy to apply</li>
            <li> I ordered my first bottle over a year ago and used it off and on. I used it alone, with concealer, as a primer, and set with powder. When I ran out I was hesitant to purchase another because the finish was very dewy and it smelled a little like plastic. After about a week of reaching for this bottle during my makeup routine I realized I missed it. Nothing seemed  to cover redness as well or provide an even canvas. I ordered a second bottle a couple weeks ago and I&#x27;m not sure if the formula changed or if one was a fake but the new bottle is much nicer. The color is more flesh toned, not gray at all. The scent is nonexistent. I have little to complain about the first bottle but the second one is much nicer. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Very good quality and good price. I will back again.</li>
            <li> I really am surprised this went with my tan skin tone. I was sure it&#x27;d look awful and fake but it doesn&#x27;t. It blends nicely and evenly. I still use this BB cream from time to time and would buy more when I run out. The packaging is a little strange since when you run out, you may have more sitting at the bottom so you&#x27;ll have to open it up and get your pennies&#x27; worth! Nothing wrong with that!</li>
            <li> Have sensitive skin, had bad zits and rash from using product.  I don&#x27;t usually have zits at all. It was&lt;br /&gt;all in cluster of zits-then my face developed bad red rash all over, totally inflamed and flaky, skin peeling.&lt;br /&gt;Dermatologist had to give me a double dose prescription to counter it, it has been over 2 wks already.&lt;br /&gt;She said the product is full of preservatives, bad things like TALC is carcinagin; not at all anti-aging, mineral oil is bad&lt;br /&gt;for pores, why whitening of skin.  Read the ingredients, shocking to read all the chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware. Should be 0 stars.</li>
            <li> Creamy, without the greasy feeling, can cover blemishes. Best to apply before foundation for full coverage. No break outs for me.</li>
            <li> I just received my BB creams in the mail, however, I tested all (I bought 4) and this definitely has a grey tone.  The Skin 79 VIP Gold is medium to heavy coverage and a little dark for my skin tone (I am Caucasian with pale pink skin that tans easily). I am sure once I have some color this will be my summer BB cream, I just have to figure out how to counter the grey tones.  Once I have prolonged usage of this product I will write another review.</li>
            <li> Good for an everyday look. Doesn&#x27;t really match darker skintones as well as other bb creams I have tried, but a little dark foundation will help with the coloring. Can look grey and ashy. If you are a beginner, this is a good starter bb cream.</li>
            <li> The color is too pale and grey for me</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this product, I use it everyday as my moisturizer/SPF/primer... So many things in one! So glad I found this product!</li>
            <li> What a nightmare over a $13 product that I never got to use.  Straight out of the box the authentication code was damaged so I questioned the validity.  PG said they get their items directly from Skin 79 and the code must&#x27;ve been damaged in transit (highly unlikely).  Skin79 says they have NO vendors on amazon or ebay and the items are counterfeit. At this point I was just annoyed and wanted to send the product back. PG said they would mail me a return label.  I never received it and contacted them AGAIN to which they emailed me a label.  Not sure why that couldn&#x27;t have been done that right away.  I immediately returned it unused and the bottle unopened.  They received it the 5th and now it&#x27;s the 20th and still no refund so here I am emailing them again and waiting for a response.  A plethora of back and forth emails and frustration over a product I never even used.  Pretty much the worst experience I&#x27;ve had to date.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve completely switched over from foundation to BB creams (Korean brands only since US BB creams are basically just tinted moisturizers which does not have the same consistency, coverage, or benefits of Korean BB creams).  Missha was the first BB cream I tried, and I thought it was okay but it made my face look too gray and ashy, and the coverage wasn&#x27;t great either.  It didn&#x27;t give off the natural matte look that I prefer for my skin.  I gave up on BB creams for a while because of it and went back to my MUFE HD Foundation.  Then I noticed the rave reviews that Skin79 was getting for their BB creams so I started using Skin79 hot pink BB cream, which I fell in love with.  It gave me a newfound hope for BB creams.  It made my skin look really matte and natural- the coloring is great.  The gray ashiness that you first get right after application oxidizes within 15 minutes to a beautiful finish that matches my skin tone really well.  I started using the gold version, which I equally love, for when I want a more dewy natural look since it&#x27;s more moisturizing than the hot pink version.  I wear all of my BB cream with Laura Geller Spackle Under Primer (clear) and I set my BB cream with Maybelline Dream Matte Powder for a super matte finish or Sonia Kashuk Bare Minimum Pressed Powder for a more skin-like natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Lioele Triple the Solution BB Cream out of curiosity, and after applying it on my skin I was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful my skin looks!  It is light and it doesn&#x27;t oxidize as much as Skin79, but the finish makes my skin look like my skin only muchmuch better.  I&#x27;m in love!  I am now awaiting the Lioele Beyond the Solution because I want a BB Cream with no SPF version for when I know I&#x27;m going to have my picture taken since SPF reflects light particles, making your face super white and glowy in photographs.  Also, I read that the Beyond the Solution has a more natural coloring since there&#x27;s no SPF (no white ashiness like most BB cream start out with) so no waiting to oxidize!&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion, I highly recommend these BB Creams: Skin79 Hot Pink, Skin79 Gold, Lioele Triple the Solution, and I am pretty sure I will love Lioele Beyond the Solution as well but if not I&#x27;ll update this review!  :)&lt;br /&gt;Forgot to mention that these above BB creams also lasts all day, and stays matte on my super oily skin without ever having to blot!</li>
            <li> I brought mine from Pink Gelee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could it be fake? First, the box and everything seem real even with an stick when u peel off you can see the word VOID that its been tampered. But the problem is that the word BB and the SKIN79 logo rubbed off after a few days. Also the bb cream is good, no break out or anything.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I like the texture and it&#x27;s light coverage looks very natural. This is great when you&#x27;re on the go. My skin tone isn&#x27;t fair but in between medium and fair so I have to use it sparingly otherwise I&#x27;ll look too pale. They say to let it set and it will blend in. Well obviously I did wait and I still looked ghost white so I knew I had to use this product sparingly but still appreciate it. Just wish they had a different range of colors to match different skin tones however it does stay on all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought the sample box. I prefer the Gold &amp; the Pink so I have bought those. Try the sample box if you are not sure on which to get from this line.</li>
            <li> This cream is very light with good coverage.  Have used this cream for a long time and no one would be able to pass off a fake with me.  I recommend buying this from Pink Gelee.  There are many fakes on here and Pink Gelee has authentic products.  I won&#x27;t buy bb cream on amazon from anyone else.</li>
            <li> I first heard about this product through a YouTube beauty guru who recommended it. I went on reading reviews online and heard a lot of positive feedback but, unfortunatly this product was no good for me. I have oily acne prone skin and was a little iffy - used the product for two weeks and it felt super cakey and thick. Aside from being cakey and thick it was also greasy - I applied my powder over it so try and tone it down since the color wasn&#x27;t for me either I tried to make it work however possible. I eventually gave up and tossed this product aside - I gave this product a two only because it did not break me out.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m no make-up artist and i don&#x27;t know if this is the BEST bb cream ever (because of my lack of past experience), but i can say that this was a very good first experience with bb cream. i have always wanted one ever since i found out that korean people use it (sorry. very stereotypical, i know), and so i bought it in hopes of it making my skin look more evened out and natural (oh, i was also introduced to this by bubzbeauty). when you first start to use it, it&#x27;ll take a few pumps for the bb cream to surface (you&#x27;ll start to feel the pressure), but what i didn&#x27;t like about the bottle was that each time i pressed down the top for a new bead, it would practically \\&quot;shoot\\&quot; the bb cream out of the nozzle. i think what happened was that every time after pressing the top down, air bubbles would get caught in the tube (or nozzle) and the next time i would use it, the air bubbles would pop out of the nozzle and cause the shooting... but i could be wrong ;)  and about the texture, it&#x27;s pretty thick and that&#x27;s why a little does go a long way (so don&#x27;t be like me and press the top all the way down!). it has good coverage but because i have redness around the t-zone and my nose (including dark circles), i still had to use concealer. my skin color is kind of a light medium tan but this was still a little too light for me. if you like having lighter skin or if you do have light skin, this&#x27;ll be it for your foundation, but because i like my face looking natural, i just put a light layer of foundation over it to even it out. yup. otherwise, the bottle is super cute, the packaging was good and came in prompt (even with the normal shipping option), and i got a free sample. yay!</li>
            <li> This is my first BB cream, and I like it better than any foundation I&#x27;ve used.  Item arrived very promptly considering where it is coming from.</li>
            <li> I absolutely fell in love with this product the first time I tried it. It instantly covered my blemishes and did a good job at concealing acne scars as well. It made my foundation and blush/bronzer last all day. It&#x27;s good for people with dry/combination skin like myself, although now that it&#x27;s getting colder I wear a moisturizer under because my chin gets very dry. I have sensitive acne prone skin and this did not break me out. I am very fair skinned, I almost always buy my foundations in Ivory or the next shade darker and this works well with my skin. This is easily set with a powder and definitely lasts all day. I highly recommend this if you&#x27;ve tried the drugstore bb creams and are ready for the real deal.</li>
            <li> I have very fair and sensitive skin, so I was skeptical on whether or not this will work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works like a charm -- great coverage with half a pump and I don&#x27;t look/feel like I&#x27;m wearing gobs of makeup.  For those with VERY sensitive skin like me, use a protective moisturizer before application of the BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up from this girl!</li>
            <li> This is a nice BB Cream.  The coverage is not as heavy as I would have liked, and I find the scent to be a little unpleasant, but it does dissipate after awhile. Other than that I have no complaints. I have medium-light, combination acne prone skin. The color looks grey when it comes out, but not at all once it&#x27;s applied. It definitely blends in with my skin tone as described. It has not made me break out, which is one of the most important things to me when buying these creams. It also did not make my skin oily...although I can see it being a possible issue in the summer time. I think with some mineral powder to set it in warmer weather, it will be fine. It covers some imperfections and helps my skin look all together healthier. It does not settle into pores or fine lines either. So all in all I like this product and would repurchase and recommend it, especially if you don&#x27;t have a whole lot of scars or spots to cover. If you&#x27;re looking for very heavy coverage, you won&#x27;t find it here.</li>
            <li> The VIP Gold and Oriental by skin79 are the only makeups I have used in a few years.&lt;br /&gt;They completely get rid of any acne and lighten dark spots and freckles, ntm anti aging, which is best to start young with not wait until you&#x27;re old, haha!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m white with a yellowish pale complexion and the VIP gold has just enough coverage to even out my skin and get rid of the yellow. It has a more matte finish than the Pink and isn&#x27;t as thick. But it&#x27;s a little thicker than the Oriental (pink/purplish bottle).&lt;br /&gt;As long as I can find it on amazon, skin79 will be the only makeup I buy for the rest of my life haha!&lt;br /&gt;I only need to buy maybe one bottle a year. 2 at the most, towards the end of the year.&lt;br /&gt;I really want to try the orange VIP but it&#x27;s too expensive most of the time.</li>
            <li> The color blends very well and does not look oily. I think it is a great product and worth a try</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is a knock off. It works well with me. I used this during winter as this has a very thick consistency. It is a bit ashy at first but after a while it gets close to my skin tone albeit lighter.</li>
            <li> Too gray and makes one look ashy. When used with enough powder and blush, this can serve as a nice canvas. But the pink Skin79 bb cream has a better finish. Liole triple action BB cream is even better.</li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly and covers fairly well. Not quite as nice as the pink version on my skin, but as advertised. These last a long time.</li>
            <li> its okay The textured is thick and heavy, didn&#x27;t like it much on my face.. makes me look darker than usual but maybe I ordered wrong shade. I gave it to my mother.</li>
            <li> I bought this item a year ago and I loved it, it was the real thing and worked well. I didn&#x27;t use it everyday so it lasted me awhile, but when I finally finished a bottle I ordered another one from the same seller (this one). This time, something was different. I compared the bottle to the last one I had and noticed they were about the same weight. It didn&#x27;t make sense to me since the older bottle was empty. Then I noticed the text was slightly off, and the sticker on the back was crooked. I should have known something was wrong then. With the older bottle, the cream was a thick consistency and smelled like sunscreen. With the new bottle, the cream wasn&#x27;t as thick, and it was lighter than the previous product. I used it anyway because I paid for it. Nothing bad happened with my skin, it covered well. With the last bottle I could feel the heaviness of the product, but it went away after awhile. With this stuff, I can still feel it on my skin. And it also doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen. I bought this maybe a little more than a month ago, and my bottle is almost empty now. I&#x27;m very upset because it didn&#x27;t last as long as my previous bottle. I love this product but I don&#x27;t think I will be buying it from here anymore.</li>
            <li> I plan to use this product for the rest of my life. Light, good for acne prone skin, gets rid of blemishes, makes skin soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> ran out of product after only 3 weeks of use.  a little bit goes a long way, but there&#x27;s not enough of it.</li>
            <li> I have a fair complexion that can get a bit sallow at times, especially during a winter like this one. I am also getting on a bit in age, but am holding out pretty well. This cream provides miraculous coverage, with none of the plastery, cakey effect that some regular foundations will sometimes give you. The pump delivery equates personalized dosage, so no messing about with pots or bottles. The opaque container protects the product from the light. They thought of everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on chalky and grey in color at first, but don&#x27;t panic! As you smooth the cream out, it blends into your own skin color, becoming invisible. A little goes a long way and one can always layer it for particular problem areas. I blend it with my fingers and use a foundation brush to polish the finish, which is quite dewy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It truly is the most effective cosmetic (make-up) I&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t know whether it has done anything FOR my skin, but I take good care of it so who knows? The make-up aspect alone and the price make this an absolute must-buy. Plus, the company sends you a few samples along with it. Like all cosmetic companies should, incidentally!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the cherry on the cake: it protects against UVA AND UVB! Definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I was afraid the color wouldn&#x27;t match my complexion, but it naturally blends right in. My skin has a healthier glow and more people compliment me on my skin. I definitely, plan on trying the other BB products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a foundation person, so this is a great alternative. It reminds me of a tinted moisturizer, but better! Makes my skin so soft, blends so well, good as a primer for foundation or alone!</li>
            <li> First off this product shipped and arrived a lot faster than the estimated delivery time.  I ordered this product along with the Skin 79 Hot Pink BB Cream.  Out of the two, I would have to say that I liked with one more because it had a bit more coverage.  I moisturized by skin before applying this product because I have really dry skin.  I loved how it gave me a natural look and last all day.  I will consider getting this product again, but I would also like to try other BB cream products too.  Overall this product was awesome.</li>
            <li> Light coverage. Made my skin feel great. Very natural look.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using BB cream and I love it. It is very moisturizing and last all day. It look so natural as if I don&#x27;t have any make up on.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product.</li>
            <li> I loved this so far the best of all the BB creams I&#x27;ve used.  It keeps my face moisturized and provides decent coverage.  I&#x27;ve tried the pink, orange, elisha coy, liz k color veil,  and hanskin control.  I am thinking of purchasing Dr. Jart&#x27;s as well, but I have to finish the pink bb cream and a plethora of others before I return to this one.</li>
            <li> I love Skin79&#x27;s BB Cream. It fits my Asian skin very well. I am a little paler at first, but then the cream oxidizes and matches my skin color and evens out my skin tone. The pump is very hygienic and the container has 40 g of product. The only thing that worried me was that my bottle lacked the sticker of authenticity (http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81Ug7UQvdaL._SL1500_.jpg). The product didn&#x27;t seem different from the pink Skin79 BB Cream that I got before which did have the authenticity label, besides being a little thicker formula, but that still makes me a little nervous.</li>
            <li> In college, I spent about 3 years working as a makeup artist for a few large beauty companies. That was about 10 years ago, but I have a love of all things beauty even as I have minimalized my morning routine to about 5 minutes when I&#x27;m stuck in traffic (bad, I know).  I read an article about BB creams and decided to try them- why not? I am pale (about a MAC NC 15), always need to wear sunscreen, and have relatively dry skin that tends to break out. I also have been undergoing IPL photofacial treatments and wanted a product that might help to maintain keeping away the sunspots I&#x27;ve gotten had zapped off.  This might be the best beauty product I have ever tried. I can&#x27;t get over how it oxidizes after application to totally match my skin tone. I can layer it on thicker in some areas for more coverage and barely use concealer over it.  It minimizes pores, redness, and other inperfections to leave skin looking flawless. I can&#x27;t say enough about it- BUY IT.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a 20 year old girl that usually doesn&#x27;t apply foundation because it feels so sticky and unnatural. This BB-cream is perfect for me. It gives me a even skintone without sticking and leaving my skin soft and smooth throughout the day. I really love it! But the only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t cover everything like a foundation does.</li>
            <li> I got my cream a few months ago, and am I still using it today. I rarely stay with the same products, due to breakouts or I get bored. With this cream, it feels so lightweight, and gives me just the right amount of coverage that I&#x27;m looking for. I am of Asian descent, but I have some acne scars along with larger pores in my t-zone. With this cream, I&#x27;ve noticed that it doesn&#x27;t break me out, and it glides on easily. It definitely does give you that weird tint at the beginning, but it does wear off eventually. I don&#x27;t put too much cream on, just about 1/2 a pump. It helps even out my skintone and cover up some of my acne scars. I would highly recommend this product for those looking for light/moderate coverage that is lightweight.</li>
            <li> Loved this product, does easily blend in and match skin tone, will be re-purchasing! My &amp;#34;tend to be dry&amp;#34; winter skin is loving this bb cream.</li>
            <li> I really like the texture and coverage but Im not sure if this is good for sensitive skin with acne. I started breaking out while wearing this product but I dont know if the BB cream triggered it or something else. Im taking a break from wearing it until my skin heals then I will try again to see if thats the cause. I will be disappointed if it is because it looks so good on and matches my pale skin perfectly. It actually changes color to a nice pale ivory on the skin, not grayish like it first appears. And it&#x27;s very moisturizing which is great for the windy winter weather that dries my skin so bad.</li>
            <li> Although this BB cream provided adequate coverage and blended in nicely with my skin tone, I had horrible breakouts with this product. I will not use this product again.</li>
            <li> Used this for quite a while before I pinpointed it as the source of my breakouts.</li>
            <li> I bought this product just to try.  It is too white for my skin (I am Asian) and does not blend well.  I don&#x27;t know about other effects this product claims yet, but I will not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love,love it! Ordered 3 more products,delivery was fantastic!!Am 83 yrs old,match was great on my fair skin. So glad I orderd 2! Can&#x27;t hardly wait till my last order arrives.</li>
            <li> This highlights around the dark areas of my lower lids, nose, and mouth which tend to darken with sun.  The cream seems to reduce the size of my pores and make my skin smooth and more refined.  I use it with a powder to even out my complexion - I do not have bumps or pimples - and it works beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because it does not seem to have the same effect over time - maybe I am just used to it? Not sure.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I prefer this BB cream over the pink bottle one. It has a better consistency and coverage. I love that it has SPF in it as well. I wear this under a foundation powder for more coverage and it holds all my make up in place! It is very affordable and I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> makes my skin very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;i got this on the 28th and it was expected to arrive from 28th to jan 2?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely in love for this product. Is one that will be always in my necessarie!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is the second that I buy and I don&#x27;t regret in nothing.</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot so far, my skin looks pretty good better then the Missha that i bought off of Amazon. I think it legit. i would recommend it</li>
            <li> i love this product, it gives me good coverge to my skin and is also suitable for everyday use. i dont have to wear foundation when i use this product. i will definitely purchase this product often and also recommend it to my relatives and friends</li>
            <li> Loving this so much! It&#x27;s perfect for my skin, love the texture, color and the finish.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a light/medium coverage very silky and leaves your skin looking very healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> just so good, best coverage, moisturizing, no breakout, not heavy. I do feel my skin itself become even better and whiter gradually</li>
            <li> I had been using Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream, but felt it was too heavy and didn&#x27;t do much. My skin is generally clear, with occasional blemishes,  so I do like coverage! I&#x27;m also fair skinned, thanks to being a redhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is fantastic! Comes out grey, but eventually evens out perfectly! If you&#x27;re looking for heavy coverage, this isn&#x27;t it. But I just apply concealer after this stuff. My skin glows after 5 minutes, and it feels like I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup! I achieve the look of illuminator without having to use any! My pores look tiny, and my skin is dewy! I will definitely reorder!</li>
            <li> I love this product :) I&#x27;ve purchased it several times and I love it :) shipping was good and pricing us good for this product. If you have deeper skin I would not recommend this for you, this product works best on pale or lighter skinned people :)</li>
            <li> This bb cream has an expiration date on the bottom of the bottle and it had expired in Feb 2013. Seriously, you are going to send expired BB cream to someone who obviously is trying to get something good for their skin? Tell me, would you put expired cream on your face? If not, then why sell it to people and get money from them when they think they are getting a good product? I do not recommend this product from this seller to anyone. Who knows what other products the seller sells that are already expired?</li>
            <li> Gorgeous coverage, hydrating formula. It settles into my smile lines and the fine lines around my eyes a little, but that may be because I have to super-moisturize that area. It covers my dark circles better than I would have expected, and it oxidizes within five minutes. The shipping (I used the advertised seller) was great, here in five days. The product itself is great, and the packaging is adorable! Great value for my money. Would repurchase.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is awesome! It doesn&#x27;t cling onto dry patches and it feels hydrating. It doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage, so if you&#x27;ll still need concealer to cover up spots. I wish that this BB cream came in more shades though. I know that BB creams &amp;#34;adjust&amp;#34; to your color, but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s true. It does adjust to some extent, but it&#x27;s definitely still a shade too light for me.</li>
            <li> I received my product along with the orange and pink SKIN79 from Pink Gelee and loveeee it! I bought the three to see which one I would like more, but I love them all! This one especially, and it matches my skin more than the others. I will continue to use the 3 kinds I have and when the time comes I&#x27;ll buy another one of this one. I was a bit reluctant to buying a SKIN79 product from amazon, did research to make sure I do not get a fake one, and when I received them I went and checked all of them. They each are all 100% real! I recommend this to anyone who wants BB Cream, especially a Real SKIN79 BB cream. :)</li>
            <li> While it does take quite a while to receive it, it is worth the wait! I love this product and it is by far better than much higher priced BB creams!</li>
            <li> I have light to medium skin tone with golden tones. This makeup matches well and gives pretty good coverage without being cakey looking. Its a very creamy texture and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Great coverage. A lot like dr. Jart&#x27;s bb. I mix this with a tiny bit of moisturizer because it is very thick. Makes my skin look flawless and dries well so that makeup application is not a problem.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this product.  It was shipped earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be ordering again soon.&lt;br /&gt;Product is very easy to apply, only takes a little and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  My skin looks clearer, it goes on very easily and looks super smooth on--doesn&#x27;t sink into wrinkles.  It doesn&#x27;t build well, so if you need a lot of coverage this is not the BB cream for you.  It looks super natural, yet covers small flaws and imperfections. But you do need to dust with light powder or bronzer or it seems to sort of melt off.  I have very fair skin.  Not sure how well it would be for those who are darker in complexion.  Goes on greyish, but quickly adjusts to your own skin tone once it warms up to body temp.  BTW I have compared it to Smashbox BB cream and this one is much better.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much - for the price it&#x27;s amazing. I have fair skin and when I first put it on it seems too dark but blends in and looks fine when I spread it around - it evens out my skin tone, doesn&#x27;t aggravate my Rosacea, in fact even seems to have tamed it.  I have gotten several compliments on my skin since using this which is a first for me.  I still have wrinkles but they seem less noticeable when one&#x27;s skin tone is nice and even.  I love that it has sunscreen which works very well - I recently hiked in Italy for hours in the sun and was never burned.  I never use my old makeup now, this just looks so much better. Also it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your whole face do I think it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the best BB cream I have ever used when you put it on it&#x27;s like being airbrushed it really is the Gold of creams</li>
            <li> I like this, but I have oily skin so it doesn&#x27;t work that well for me. My face is a bit oily half way through the day when using this, so I like the pink version much better for my skin type. If you have dry skin though, it will probably work better for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Skin79 BB Cream since may, 2012. I love the ease of use, the coverage, the price is inexpensive. Asian brand BB Creams are much better than their American counterparts (many US brands are just tinted moisturizers) and when you compare the ingredients and read up about what a BB Cream started out as and what it&#x27;s supposed to do you&#x27;ll see the huge differences.</li>
            <li> I liked the light feel of this cream for medium coverage.  It doesn&#x27;t cover everything and you have to have pretty good skin to start off.  I use a moisturizer underneath the cream because my skin tend to get dry in the winter.  I like to wear it without much of other makeup for a more natural look and feel like on weekends to do errands.  Overall a good cream for everyday use without breakouts or drying of the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an experienced BB cream user.  I&#x27;ve been using Missha for a very long time, love it.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try SKIN79 the VIP Gold label for the extra moisture and dewey-ness.&lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly as described.&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin.  It did not get oily on me.  Provides just right amount of moist needed for certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on a bit too white / ashy, and took a little longer to oxidize - but eventually blended beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;Will look best on very light skin.  People with olive skin like me will find that it makes you look lighter (if you like that then use it).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a keeper for me - I&#x27;ll use Missha on days I don&#x27;t need the extra moisture and will use this one when I&#x27;m a bit dried out and needs more moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Seller Pink Gelee sent an authentic item.  I would buy from this seller again!  Thank YOU.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried a lot....Dr. Jarts, Smashbox, Clinique, and even Garnier.  I&#x27;m caucasian with a medium-fair skin tone (fair but tan easily)  and even though I believe this brand is aimed at Asian skin tones (has &#x27;whitening&#x27; as one of its selling points) it works great for me!  Goes on light, spreads well and gives good coverage.  The price is very reasonable, actually costs less than the first three on my list here.  Love that is has the SPF too.</li>
            <li> SO all I can say is WOW. This came in the mail just yesterday, and I already feel confident enough to rate it 5 stars. This stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start by saying that I have sensitive, combination, acne-prone, acne-scarred, and very fair skin. Because my skin is so light, all of my blemishes and marks are bright red. All liquid and cream foundations, tinted moisturizers, etc. are either too dark, too pink, or too orange on me, and look very unnatural. I was always a fan of what tinted moisturizers do for evening out your skin tone, but they were ALL too dark for my skin. And I had wanted to try a BB Cream, but all of the American ones seem to also be too dark for me. So it&#x27;s a rare win to find something that looks natural on my face.. But I finally have! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BB cream manages to match my light skin tone perfectly. But let it be known that out of the bottle, it is grey. Like.. straight up clay face mask grey. I was a bit worried at first, but it worked out quite well. I blended it into my skin (with my fingers, which I normally wouldn&#x27;t do), and it seemed to adjust perfectly to my skin tone. It seriously melts into my skin and makes it look even and poreless.. but manages to look as if I have no makeup on at all. It gives me flawless glowing skin, and when I look into the mirror I feel kind of like I have the complexion of an elvish princess hahah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can build coverage, I&#x27;ve found. Just wait for the initial layer to dry, then blend a second layer into the areas that need additional coverage. Today I felt I wanted extra coverage, so I applied my bareminerals foundation after Putting on this BB cream. and WOW. what a great combination. My skin looks great, and My face isn&#x27;t shiny OR dry. (Usually I&#x27;m affected by one or the other on any given day.) It still looks as though I just applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So last night after I removed my makeup and washed my face, my skin still looked very even and refined. I have super sensitive skin, andit usually looks inflamed after my skincare regimen is complete. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s possible to see skin improvements after just one use, so it&#x27;s probably just a coincidence, but I still find it worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it, you won&#x27;t regret it. :)</li>
            <li> This covers redness really well and the coverage lasts a good time when it is set with powder. I&#x27;ve only been using it under a month now so I can&#x27;t really tell how it has improved my skin any but my face does seem brighter and my complexion looks a bit more evened out. This doesn&#x27;t emphasize dry patches as harshly as regular foundation. Gives a very natural finish even when you look at yourself upclose. The coverage is quite light but buildable. And this foundation feels like nothing on your face which is perfect especially for summer. I would recommend it if you&#x27;re starting out with BB cream.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed when I received this product from Pink Gelee, exactly when the package was said to arrive. I would not recommend purchasing bb creams from anywhere other than Pink Gelee, because upon doing some research there were many reports of fake bb creams from other sellers(on amazon and eBay). This bb cream is perfect for my skin (pale) and gives it a fresh, dewy and flawless appearance. The VIP gold is recommended for dry skin, however I will use it during the summer but mostly during the winter. Bb Creams will definitely give you the \\&quot;porcelain\\&quot;, flawless skin look. Also can&#x27;t wait to try the samples that came with my purchase, including the hot pink bb cream. :) Thank you!</li>
            <li> love this you must try it. This is the best BB cream i have come across it dose have a sort of Grey note to it in  color buy it self adjust to your tone and you  can add over it blush or bronzer to get the effect you  are looking  for</li>
            <li> This cream is great.  I use it instead of sunscreen every morning.  It does lighten my skin&lt;br /&gt;somewhat even though it comes out of the pump looking darker.</li>
            <li> NOTE!! If your pump stops working, the bottle is far from empty. PULL the top of the bottle up (grab onto the indent in the back and spout) to get to the inner canister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From there, TWIST the top of the canister off and you can see that you have 85-90% of product left. That is why the bottle feels so heavy. The pump may stop working early on, which is a major flaw in the packaging. I store and use mine upside down to help the pump work a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review: This product has replaced all my face makeup. It takes just a minute in the morning to pat and blend this in, focusing on under my eyes and T-zone, to look healthy and glowing. It doesn&#x27;t look like I have anything on my face, but it would be VERY obvious if I didn&#x27;t apply anything. To boost the coverage while avoiding a mask-like flat application, I apply the cream to the back of my left hand like a palette and dab my fingertips in. Then I pat this all over and lightly blend, repeating to add layers to specific areas as needed. I recommend this method instead of rubbing in large swathes like lotion.</li>
            <li> The Gold Skin79 BB Cream that I bought from this seller is NOT AUTHENTIC.  The label of authenticity was tampered when I received the product.  I am not saying this to harm the seller&#x27;s business.  I just want to inform and give a warning to those who are considering buying Skin79 products from Seoulglamor or any other sellers. If you want want any authentic Skin79 products than buy it directly from Skin79&#x27;s website.    In addition, I am not saying that the product I bought from Seoulglamor is not good.  I&#x27;ve only been using my purchase product for three days and seems to work well but three days is not enough time to tell me how good the product is for me.    Proof that my product is not authentic: [...]</li>
            <li> Okey. I&#x60;m in love! I watched several BB cream reviews videos in youtube. I notice many like this one a lot. So I decided buy it. Because I cannot have this one in my country. I ordered it from Amazon. It cost me 16  inc. postage. I think it was very fair price. And I certainly buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin and this is perfect for my skin. It&#x60;s thick, but it apply very easily and stayed whole day. I even didn&#x60;t need powder, because it left matte finish. I have little bit redness on my cheeks and it covered them well.&lt;br /&gt;Bottle is quite heavy, what I like. It feel more luxury than lighter ones. Also huge plus for pumpbottle, it so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x60;s now one of the top 5 products in my make up bag.</li>
            <li> My daughter used this for a year, and I finally tried it.  It&#x27;s great to use a product that actually feels good on my skin and has some healthy ingredients, not just like a mask or a &amp;#34;cover.&amp;#34;  I appreciate the light hue and SPF also.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Very hydrating without feeling greasy or oily, actually feels weightless.  I have melasma and it covers well, evens out my skin tone without hiding my skin.  The weird thing is when I tried it on the back of my hand, it looked really ashy and grey like what some of the reviewers said but when I put it on my face it was fine, and after about 30-45 minutes (after it oxidize) it looked great.  I also have Missha BB cream, I like this one better.  The Missha covers a tiny bit better but is not as hydrating as this formula and is harder to spread on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also 5 stars to the seller.  I got my product in 1 1/2 day with standard shipping, I don&#x27;t know how that&#x27;s possible.  Also, the most important thing is the product is authentic as the seller stated.  Great price, the store in my area sell it for $39.</li>
            <li> I bought this one and the pink one. I am medium skin tone and a bit pale. Both of these products leave my skin looking so grey that i decided to give them both away.  It could work for some people, it definitely doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is a new one for me, as I used to use the similar BB cream made by the same company, but in super hot pink color. I heard the Gold edition was more moist for winter time, so I tried it. It is great on Asian skin tone. I love it. The seller also shipped it so fast, it arrived a week before the estimated arrival date. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I usually never write reviews, but I definitely thought this product deserved one! This BB cream is amazing! It put all my expensive foundations to shame. When I first applied it, it didn&#x27;t seem to give a lot of coverage. I let it sit for a little and then applied another thin layer with my real techniques buffing brush. Within a few minutes my skin looked amazing. It looked so natural yet flawless. It did not look as if I was wearing a lot of makeup, and it definitely did not look cakey and it covered any imperfections on my skin. I have NC25 skin, and it matched my skin tone perfectly! I think this BB cream would work for skin tones up to NC30. I did use some concealer for my dark circles because I was going out for the night,  but for everyday I wouldn&#x27;t even need under eye concealer, and I usually use a corrector and concealer on a regular basis with my foundations because my dark circles are so bad. Overall, I would recommend this BB cream to anyone! I also forgot to mention that I have the driest skin of anyone I know, and most foundations cling to dry skin on my forehead and look terrible no matter how much I prime and moisturize. This BB felt moisturizing and did not look greasy on my skin, it gave an amazing finish. No dry skin flakes on my forehead for once! AMAZING! Buy this product and you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Good product, covers well but tends to have a greyish coverage, not good for my light skin.  I mix my foundation with this product (60 foundation/40 balm) and it works much better.</li>
            <li> Despite being a little wary of the color, this was great for my very pale, very pink skin.  It neutralizes the red without looking unnatural.  I was tired of how quickly my tinted moisturizer would wear off, I love how much longer this wears without feeling heavy or looking cake-y.  I will definitely be re-ordering it.</li>
            <li> I have always had perfect skin. Then about 10 years ago my skin got so dry I couldn&#x27;t even wear foundation. No mineral makeup ..nothing. I couldn&#x27;t find a moisturizer that worked. Everyone said you just need to exfoliate. This right after I walked out of the restroom from exfoliating. :( So, I had given up. This stuff works amazing. I still have a little dryness, but it is only my 2nd day and I am hoping it will repair my skin some overtime. I was also given a sample of Heynature BB Brown Jade with my order. It is pretty good also but feels a little heavy and itchy for me. However it covers a little better. For me though, it makes my unremovable dry skin show through. So SKIN79 GOLD is the only product for me. Keeping the faith.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have mild rosacea on my cheeks. This product smooths out my problem areas. I use this as a foundation, if I go out or to work I typically apply my concealers and what not. However, if I am just staying in or running errands, applying this only makes my face bright and even feels smooth. I am fairly light skinned and have not had any issues with my face and neck looking different colors :)</li>
            <li> I own three different Skin79 BB creams, and this one is by far the best. I&#x27;m 36 and have a fair complexion with very small pores, experience significant oiliness and, depending on the weather, severe dryness, and have a long history of cystic acne (read: anything will break me out). I haven&#x27;t so much as developed a whitehead since using any of the BB creams, and this particular one does the best job of hiding old acne scars, veins, and puffy, dark circles. The price is more than right, too. I&#x27;d easily pay twice as much for this kind of cosmetic excellence! Please: Do not fall prey to drugstore brands. They&#x27;re nowhere near as good, and most of them either cost as much or more than Skin79. I hope your experience with their line is as fabulous as mine has been!</li>
            <li> I do not usually wear a lot of make up so I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t like the feel of it on my face (too heavy - like foundation), but it is not!  It is so light and blends very well with my skin tone.  I am in love and I don&#x27;t think I would ever wear anything else.  I did hear the Pink one is good during the summer months when you are a little more darker.  I normally do not write reviews, but this product is too good to pass up!  LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> OMG!! when i got in the mail it was so nicely package and when i opened it, it was so pretty. I couldnt wait to use it, so when i used it in the morning before going to school. IT WAS FABULOUS AND MY FRIENDS ASK ME IF WHY AM I NOT WEARING FOUNDATION ( USUALLY I DO ) SO I TOLD THEM THAT I USED KOREAN BB CREAM. They were so surprise. they said i look like m not wearing any makeup. HOW AMAZING IS THAT PEOPLE! i recommend it for people who doesnt feel that confidence about there skin. You will love it. I will buy more SKIN79 products!! I LOVE BB CREAM!!</li>
            <li> always love this product. great on my skin and goes great with so many tones. Have all of my friends in love with this stuff</li>
            <li> My friend send me some of this bb cream from Korea...I&#x27;m not sure if this is a fake or real product but so far this product works fine on me</li>
            <li> This shipped quickly and is a genuine SKIN79 product, which I verified by doing a little homework. Excellent coverage for my fair skin with pink undertones. I would buy from this seller again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product...I don&#x27;t have to wear makeup anymore!  Goes on smoothly and evenly.  The moisturizing the SPF benefits helps keep my skin youthful and glowing.</li>
            <li> Wow, I was skeptical when reading SKIN79 BB Cream reviews online. Were those words true? Do these BB Creams actually do wonders to your skin? Holy, indeed they do. The VIP Gold Collection is really moisturizing, perfect during winter. I did not apply a moisturizer before applying this and my skin still feels hydrated! Definitely will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I thought this would make me look younger and cover well, just made me look white, still had to do all my normal makeup routine after so this just added a step</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of BB Creams, and this product was recommended by a few Asian women doing makeup tutorials on YouTube. So I knew that I had to try it, as well. I ordered this one and the Pink one. This one is definitely thicker and a little heavier than the Pink one, which provides more comprehensive coverage. I would use this one if my skin was being particularly uncooperative (redness, blemishes, etc.). It comes out really grey, which was shocking at first, but it oxidizes to a normal color about half an hour after putting it on. It goes on smoothly, and I&#x27;ve never felt like I had to re-apply it, even after a full day at work. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product is too thick and does not blend well with my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;And it makes my pores on my face feel clogged. Not happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Can I return it and get my money back?</li>
            <li> This left a white pasty film on my skin and looked as if I was wearing heavy makeup on my face.</li>
            <li> I really liked the coverage of this stuff.  It didn&#x27;t cover my dark marks from past pimples, but I didn&#x27;t expect it too.  It made a nice first layer for my concealer to stick to and didn&#x27;t look thick or like I was wearing five pounds of makeup.  The problem is that every time I have worn it, I have had a pimple or two pop up.  On days I don&#x27;t wear this, no problems, so I am positive that this is the cause.  I had finally gotten my acne under control and hadn&#x27;t gotten a new blemish in awhile. Then I started using this.  Now I have five or six new blemishes, so I am not impressed.  I doubt that this will happen to everyone.  I just have very acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> This BB cream works really well and hides the pores on my nose which are pretty large and noticeable. I like this BB cream more than the Garnier one which was terrible. I&#x27;ve also tried the Lumene BB cream which works well but you have to use a lot of the product for coverage - not so with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that the container I received states that the product expired in August of 2012. This didn&#x27;t affect how the product worked (as far as I can tell) nor did my skin have an adverse reaction to it but be forewarned if you have super sensitive skin and are wary of expiration dates!</li>
            <li> This BB cream is better than the ones they sale at retail stores, I&#x27;m hooked! It moisturizes, makes your skin look flawless better than regular foundation.</li>
            <li> This works great, but it&#x27;s a tad light. I actually use it as concealer.. will use properly during the summer. It had pretty good coverage.. not as sheer as some BB creams</li>
            <li> i like it it feels light on my skin , and it&#x27;s not that white so it&#x27;s great , and it has a nice coverage</li>
            <li> Tried this cream because my sister got it.  I naturally have clear skin but was looking for something to smooth it out a little.  My skin can get dry and I don&#x27;t use any foundation or anything.  I love this because it has SPF in it too.  It makes my skin feel soft and gives it the moisture it needs throughout the day.  I can imagine that it would make a great primer for makeup too.  The cream itself looks like it is white and when you apply it it brightens your face a little.  That quickly blends in and disappears though.  My skin is really tan and after blending the cream in, it sinks perfectly onto my skin.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging it&#x27;s in. I have just gotten into BB cream. I don&#x27;t have too much experience with all the other brands but I have tried three others. This is more of a tinted moisturizer and is buildable.</li>
            <li> Wish it lasts a bit longer but overall, it is a nice product.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time! Great value and great for your skin! It really helps keep my skin hydrated and relaxed throughout the day! It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky like alot of makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just worn the product one time after recieving it...so as for quality over time I can&#x27;t say. I love what it&#x27;s done for me today though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m most impressed with was speed of shipping. I ordered it from Beauty Works and recieved it the SAME day that it shipped...or at least the same day that Amazon displayed that it had shipped in my orders log.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And unlike several of the reviews that I&#x27;ve read here, it is an authentic product. Could NOT be more pleased.</li>
            <li> As I said in my cleanser review I just recently discovered BB Cream and chose SKIN79 due to reviews I had seen.  I originally ordered a sample pack to see which version worked the best for me.  I have very, very pale skin and several of the colours were either too dark for me or didn&#x27;t give enough coverage.  This one did the trick and I am happy I discovered BB Cream!</li>
            <li> I like this, It makes me look whiter. And the price is OK as well.&lt;br /&gt;Use it before the foundation, or only use this.</li>
            <li> muy buen producto&lt;br /&gt;todos debirian de comprar esto&lt;br /&gt;se los recomiendo, es completamente excelente en tama&amp;ntilde;o y calidad&lt;br /&gt;envi&amp;oacute; r&amp;aacute;pido....</li>
            <li> After trying many higher end (UD, josie maran, tarte, most things in sephora) and lower end (loreal, CG, etc) foundations/tinted moisturizers/ bb creams (i just want my skin to look normal! I&#x27;ll try anything!) I finally caved to the reviews and gave this oft touted asian bb a try.&lt;br /&gt;It is absolutely everything i wanted that others couldn&#x27;t provide. Doesn&#x27;t break me out (I&#x27;m on differin and quite acne prone), is light enough and DOESN&#x27;T oxidize!, doesn&#x27;t show my dry skin flakes or cause dry flakes, can be light or full coverage depending on how much you want&lt;br /&gt;Warning: it really is grey-ish at first like most other reviews say, but evens out to a normal neutral skin look. However, i think my skin has minimal yellow undertones so this works well for me and i don&#x27;t look like a corpse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 4 skin79 sampler pack first and this gold version is def the best for me. I recommend the sampler before buying in full.</li>
