            <li>It offers the perfect glide for deeper, slower, fascia-focused work, allows me to glide easily over my hairier clients without any pulling, and is sooo good for the skin!  </li>

            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>hands look AMAZING when I use this stuff, after about 60 seconds it absorbs into my hands and</li>
            <li>this is a nice shea butter,white and creamy,i like it</li>
            <li>It also gives my skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li>And it was a kind of oily that didn&#x27;t even wash away with soap and water.</li>
            <li>I rub it into my hands and apply it to my skin at the beginning I feel kind of grease</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Loving it.</li>
            <li>This + Coconut oil has kind of become our go-to​ for everything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I made my own body butter</li>
            <li>NIce quality Shea butter.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell, texture...</li>
            <li>You have to warm it up in your hands</li>
            <li>Love love love this shea butter and its so many great uses!!!</li>
            <li>When the shea butter starts to warm</li>
            <li>Packed nicely.</li>
            <li>Instead of letting my hairline,and hair continue to disappear on its own and run the risk of looking like George Jefferson, I gave in to Mother Nature and shaved my head.  </li>
            <li>Really nice shea butter.</li>
            <li>I used it to make my own lotion.</li>
            <li>I have used AAA SheaButter, Mountain Rose Herbs, Shea ScentSations by Synergistic living and this one.</li>
            <li>I have not needed to warm the butter either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The container is fairly nice, so there&#x27;s no need to repot the product.</li>
            <li>THIS SHEA BUTTER HAS A NICE SMELL, ISN&#x27;T</li>
            <li>Nice packaging and product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to the quality of shea butter from Mountain Rose Herbs.</li>
            <li>I make my own whipped Shea butter mix and</li>
            <li>this kind just didn&#x27;t have the consistency.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this kind.</li>
            <li>My wife loves it, she has gotten nice compliments about her skin glowing.</li>
            <li>I use a spoon to get it out of the container, and then warm it in my hands and put it on my face and body.</li>
            <li>I think it can be good to pause and let your clients integrate the work between strokes while you warm more butter in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really makes my skin feel great &amp; has helped with my eczema!</li>
            <li>I add organic coconut oil, organic argon oil, and jojoba oil to make my own body lotion.</li>
            <li>I honestly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that this was organic and contained no additives.</li>
            <li>When you warm this butter in your hands it softens and then you can apply it to the skin.</li>
            <li>Companies that follow through like that give me the warm and fuzzies.</li>
            <li>but the clumps kind of get everywhere.  </li>
            <li>and I can tell its great quality, nice and ivory, smooth with a nice nutty scent.</li>
            <li>Even better, it&#x27;s an organic and fair trade product.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to find something that is organic to use.</li>
            <li>I use it on its own.</li>
            <li>I loved how hydrating it is, but there has to be a better way!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also gives me a nice glow as well.</li>
            <li>the shea butter was when I got it - the trick is to let it warm up in your hand before rubbing it in.</li>
            <li>Now, after two weeks I have a glow and softness to my skin that my wife really finds wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nicely packaged and not chunky.  </li>
            <li>I plan on using this to make my own deodorant but haven&#x27;t done it yet.</li>
            <li>So, I just kind of let it go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am just thrilled to have an alternative to chemical - laden lotions.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>This shea butter whipped up so nicely (without softening with heat).  </li>
            <li>Really nice quality.</li>
            <li>It comes nicely packaged, too.</li>
            <li>I make my own lotions, etc.</li>
            <li>It is a bit grainy, so I just warm it up a bit on the rest of my hand before I  put it on the incision site.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own on my hands</li>
            <li>Works nice as a hand cream too.</li>
            <li>I plan on making my own body butters with it.</li>
            <li>You have to take a bit and warm it up in your hands to get it to a spreading consistency, then rub it in where you need it.</li>
            <li>to warm / spread</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent product and very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li>the shea butter is wonderful &amp; now my whole family is using it</li>
            <li>I put it everywhere just on its own-- legs/arms/face.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>but if you mix it with a nice scent it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li>Honestly again.</li>
            <li>Have been using it to make lotion w/ coconut oil, and loving it.</li>
            <li>It softed up some in room temper, just had to run it under warm water to thaw it.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell, and</li>
            <li>But after a while, I  just used this on its own.  </li>
            <li>thank you again I am loving it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging for this particular product is excellent, also</li>
            <li>I love Shea butter for all sorts of home remedies and this one is excellent thanks, in large part, to the superb customer service.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product really high quality.</li>
            <li>It is high quality and smells great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for dry elbows and makes an awesome hand lotion.</li>
            <li>I know that shea butter is full of great benefits and looking foward to some of the changes I know we will see in our skin hair and nails</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product and will order more.</li>
            <li>#60;3 Is so perfect, my skin love this product so pure.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product and very fair price.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something natural and without chemicals, I&#x27;ve found an excellent mosturizer that absorbs and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and in great shape.  </li>
            <li>Great product and arrived quickly.  </li>

            <li>Love, love it!</li>
            <li>love this stuff and plan on ordering more!</li>
            <li>I especially love that it is in its natural form!  </li>
            <li>Great Shea butter for use right out of the jar or making your own skin care products.</li>
            <li>It has a nice pleasant smell and it melts quickly in you</li>
            <li>This is the real deal, seems to be of very good quality.  </li>
            <li>thank you so much Molivera Organics for a very superior product.</li>
            <li>This Shea butter works much much better at the fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;The nutty smell is amazing</li>
            <li>This is, so far, the best shea butter I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>but this is the best by far.</li>
            <li>The stuff was amazing and work&#x27;s better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried and one tin lasted me years.</li>
            <li>Love the feel and consistency; keep it handy for moisturizing face and body.</li>
            <li>So far, very happy with this purchase!!!</li>
            <li>This is as good, at a lower price, and with the option of free shipping and handling.</li>
            <li>Feels smooth and luxurious, and smells good too.</li>
            <li>Love this amazing butter.  </li>
            <li>I just scrape some off of the top with my fingers and rub it in between my hands for 5 seconds and it becomes warm and spreadable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this product it is amazing</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel after nice bath.</li>
            <li>and I think making this into a lotion might penetrate the layers of the skin more effectively.  </li>
            <li>so far I&#x27;m loving it!!!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li>The twists come out nice and shiny and most of all when you run your hand through the twists it&#x27;s not greasy.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best.</li>
            <li>very happy with this natural solution.</li>
            <li>Molivera&#x27;s shea butter is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s amazing, I love it</li>
            <li>When applied, it gives your skin a nice glossy look (like how Beyonce&#x27;s skin looks during a sexy dance routine).</li>
            <li>Like most shea butters, you have to rub it between your fingers to warm it up</li>
            <li>It came as promised, wrapped up nice, love the label and jar.</li>
            <li>My hands, lips and nails look and feel great after using it right out of the jar.</li>

            <li>Thanks for the good work!</li>
            <li>Great authentic product, and the container is so pretty!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to have good skin again and have a feeling</li>
            <li>The shea butter by itself works great, but smells great when mixed with essentials oils.</li>
            <li>Happy feet, happy me!f daily use to transform the driest skin on the tops of my feet.</li>
            <li>Just received my order and this is by far the most best Shea butter</li>
            <li>This is great quality shea butter--and such a great price.</li>
            <li>Great job guys, you really hit the nail on the head with this product!</li>
            <li>I just make sure to wear a tank under my nice shirts to be sure not to ruin them :)</li>
            <li>my first jar review was great (below), but I&#x27;ve now downgraded this product to one star.</li>
            <li>I experienced this as well when I first received it.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought this, it was great.</li>
            <li>The Molivera shea butter has done wonders to soften the fine wrinkles on my face and arms!</li>
            <li>This Shea butter has made my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and not grainy.</li>
            <li>It has a very smooth texture.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and soothing.</li>
            <li>This Shea butter goes on very smooth, and it stretches well.</li>
            <li>In fact, it&#x27;s probably great stuff, but I confess to being spoiled by a first world &amp;#34;corruption&amp;#34; of shea butter which nonetheless worked better than anything I have ever tried onmy hands.  </li>
            <li>but once it gets warm it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and is definitely a superior product.</li>
            <li>This is easy to warm in palms and apply to hands but effect  </li>
            <li>wonderful, so fantastic, pure and clean, inexpensive, cost effective, wrinkle reducing, moisturizing butter.</li>
            <li>It is pure &amp; has a great color &amp; texture.</li>
            <li>Great product - truly pure and organic.</li>

            <li>I gave this product a 5 because this company knows how to keep customers satisfied.</li>

            <li>it right after the shower when it is warm because the product is not creamy.</li>
            <li>This particular brand is especially wonderful because they give you amazing suggestions about numerous uses for this product!</li>
            <li>Nice product and easy to use right out of the jar.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t pleasant but seems to fade pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>This hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me since it softens nicely though from the warmth of your hand and spreads evenly over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Based on the product description and many of the reviews I read prior to making my selection and purchase I am very satisfied with my decision.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and easy!</li>
            <li>I used it in combination with other ingredients to make body butter, and it came out great!</li>
            <li>Other than that its best to melt the product on your finger tips and then pat onto your face.</li>
            <li>Molivera Organics has been wonderful with emails remind me of the benefits of this product and give me other ideas for how to use it.</li>
            <li>Compare to other Shea butter , this is the best.</li>
            <li>I am very happy I chose this product over the multitue of other shea butters out there.  </li>
            <li>So far so good easy to warm up by rubbing hands together super easy to apply on skin smell</li>
            <li>Warms in hands to spread easily.</li>
            <li>Easily melts as you apply it to your skin.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t spread easily either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the consistency and color of putty--not greasy, but still easy to rub into the skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>So easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Easy application.</li>
            <li>but I  can honestly say that I LOVE this product so much.</li>
            <li>so it scoops out easily.</li>
            <li>For one, it&#x27;s not emollient so don&#x27;t expect a creamy body butter that spreads easily over the skin.</li>
            <li>Believe me, for all the benefits it confers this is something that&#x27;s easily overcome.</li>
            <li>They do a great job in following up and offering instructions on how to get the most value from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered easy recipes to whip the shea butter into a body lotion.  </li>
            <li>My wife mixes the butter with olive oil to make it easy to rub on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Easy on and off lid.  </li>
            <li>Washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>This shea butter does not melt in my palm as easily as the L&#x27;O did and the texture is grainier.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a shea butter that is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to melt in my hands.</li>
            <li>Seems like a good quality product, will be using it by itself &amp; as a main ingredient in lotion making</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good product and gives your skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a rancid smell (it even has a bit of a chocolate aroma to it), and I think this is the way it&#x27;s supposed to smell, but it&#x27;s strong</li>
            <li>Its something that may not affect others as strongly as it did me, but</li>
            <li>Since using Molivera Shea Butter, my face has a vibrant, healthy, again not oily but HEALTHY glow to it!  </li>
            <li>My Wife Liked it very much</li>
            <li>I just rub the very top, I can&#x27;t get much because it&#x27;s hard.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I swear by the amazing properties of Shea Butter, this is my first time getting this brand.</li>
            <li>O well, still, good stuff for normal skin care, then.</li>
            <li>an excellent help for eczema and the dark pigmentation that can come with it.</li>
            <li>When I use coconut oil, I smell divine, natural, luxurious with a light coconut scent…and my skin is off-the-charts gorgeous with a healthy glow after I apply it</li>
            <li>It instead feels like a very rich, smooth, layering the lightly sits on top of my hair and scalp until being absorbed by my skin.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy, and smells fine.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the product itself is wonderful, however I can not get past the smell.  </li>
            <li>Smells fine</li>
            <li>I have replaced all my jack black products for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I have found a keeper with Molivera but will also continue with Shea ScentSations because of the added essential oils which smell amazing!</li>
            <li>This product has excellent packaging, dark to keep light out.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use in the recipe I had and has been fantastic.</li>
            <li>Well packaged, fine product.</li>
            <li>It melts so easily on my hands and so smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li>For my peace of mind, I wish it came with a protective seal but looked and smelled fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, the texture of this shea butter is fine.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping!</li>
            <li>I like the mild earthy smell to it, as opposed to the more fragrant moisturizers out there.  </li>
            <li>Love the texture and it absorbs on my skin quickly.</li>
            <li>This came so quick!  </li>
            <li>I loved how my hands felt, very soft.</li>
            <li>Plus I have so much of this that I can make more things!</li>
            <li>Amazing pure Shea butter.</li>
            <li>If you have a little kid with eczema, this is the BEST.</li>
            <li>It is definitely a different kind of body moisturizer, VERY rich!</li>
            <li>I have a huge tub of it just sitting under my counter</li>
            <li>Also want to note the container is huge, 16 oz.</li>
            <li>but this is the most effective so far.  </li>
            <li>Its smooth, I like the convenience of the jar it comes in, and its worked great in the different formulations I have used it for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough great things about this.</li>
            <li>Aloe Vera wait 5 minutes remove the excess with a damp cloth and enjoy your suppled, refreshed skin.</li>
            <li>It is light and smooth to apply.</li>
            <li>and I have felt comfortable applying on my lips.</li>
            <li>but then I enjoy the moist.</li>
            <li>Even after a nice shower, I can feel that my skin is so much snother.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my hands so well and the skin feels so smooth after the shea butter absorbs.  </li>
            <li>Says it works great but needed to actually use something from doc for the eczema he has.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non gritty and adds great moisture without the build-up.</li>
            <li>So silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Great overall transaction experience.</li>
            <li>The price for the size is fantastic too.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I will never be without for any future pregnancy.</li>
            <li>primarily I make a Paw Wax cream for my dogs</li>
            <li>I have no issue with the scent of Shea Butter, this one has a light scent.</li>
            <li>This Shea Butter is so smooth.</li>
            <li>this shea butter has a nice nutty smell and is really creamy.</li>
            <li>Yes, you have to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; it in but the results are more than worth the effort.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light scent but not offensive.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quite smooth.</li>
            <li>so that I can smooth it over my arms and legs after my shower.</li>
            <li>believe that what you put on the body is really important, as skin is the largest organ of our bodies.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s many uses, having fun experimenting with it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>So happy I finally found a cream that works.</li>
            <li>Smooth and creamy in texture.</li>
            <li>I researched I can only find great things about this product.</li>
            <li>its a fabulous product...just what i needed for my DIY projects</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t as smoothly spreadable as coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I cook and bake with the coconut oil and was wondering if shea nut butter can be used in this way also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li>and I can already see results in the texture of my skin, it looks and feels smooth.</li>
            <li>Just a light shea butter scent,</li>
            <li>This shea butter is absolutely fantastic.</li>

            <li>I enjoy the communication with the seller.</li>

            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>After much research and costly sampling of different company&#x27;s&#x27; Shea butters, this is probably the best.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>

            <li>So far, so good.</li>

            <li>Really good so far as my wife bought this for herself after reading the benefits of shea butter from Stacy Kiebler in some pregnancy magazine.</li>
            <li>This is really good on my natural African-American hair.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The company really put a lot of thought into providing the best product possible.</li>
            <li>Very good quality and very useful in a rough winter.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice creamy texture and pleasant odor, and comes in a dark container to protect it from sunlight.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sticking my fingers into it, but a friend of mine dips right in and hasn&#x27;t seen any spoilage or anything, so if you aren&#x27;t a super-jerm-a-phobe that can be an option too :)&lt;</li>
            <li>Not heavy at all and really does a good job!</li>
            <li>The smell of this butter is very mild, sweet nutty.</li>
            <li>Like Franks hot sauce I put that ish on everything!!</li>
            <li>It moisturized it, allowed the dead cells to peel away with new skin , the the best part is its scar free!!  </li>
            <li>All of the on-line products were a bit gritty (otherwise very nice).  </li>
            <li>very useful oil</li>
            <li>Very fresh.  </li>
            <li>it has avery pleasant , mild -natural smell.</li>
            <li>Best raw, unrefined shea butter I&#x27;ve bought yet.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such an amazing product!</li>

            <li>I originally bought it to combine with coconut oil, olive oil, and lavender oil for a shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>This stuff lasts a long time and feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the wait!  </li>
            <li>excited to make creams out of this</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replenish my original Shea Butter that I received as a gift.</li>
            <li>and so this can be a problem for most people however since i was aware of this before hand</li>
            <li>It definitely worth my money!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited about having found the quality shea butter made by Molivera Organics.</li>
            <li>arrive fresh !</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>Perfect for winter on the Midwest, no more chapping or cracking of my skin.</li>
            <li>My first experience with Shea Butter, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product in all of my homemade beauty products to add rich, creamy texture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to use it as a skin protectant during winter.</li>
            <li>After about two weeks, I have already noticed significant growth in my daughter&#x27;s hair and my husband even commented on how his hair is no longer spiking up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to use this product and make some homemade vapor rub for the family.  </li>
            <li>Love this product so much!</li>
            <li>Truly worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I was expecting this product to be a little more smoother in consistency, however it delivers great moisture without being overly oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product and can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding it a great, versatile product for extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>SUPER MOISTURIZING/USE LIGHTLY...</li>
            <li>Wow, did not expect such excellent results.  </li>
            <li>It has helped clean my skin up in a way nothing else has.</li>
            <li>Texture is amazing, makes my skin and hair feel very soft.</li>
            <li>The consistency is buttery smooth, and there is no unpleasant smell to it whatsoever.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and feel so nourished and healthy!</li>
            <li>So far I love this product!</li>
            <li>Melts beautifully with other butters, oils and beeswax.</li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST 100% PURE natural shea butter I&#x27;ve bought to date!  </li>
            <li>First shea butter purchase, and I&#x27;m not disappointed!</li>
            <li>Very clean smell, great value and arrived here in Florida still firm even thou</li>
            <li>Great for face, baby&#x27;s bottom, dry skin you name it!</li>
            <li>Works great on dry skin, blemishes and sun burn!</li>
            <li>I liked them all but found Mountain Rose Herbs to be extremely grainy and timely to use, but will make a body butter with organic coconut oil out of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to manipulate (a solid that melts nicely in your hands and goes on smoothly).  </li>
            <li>is just right will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried something new!!</li>
            <li>This is incredible, I hesitate a little bit when I ordered it</li>
            <li>Best thing its organic and raw!</li>
            <li>It is so rich yet absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>That butter is the perfect solution for dry and sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I have just now discovered this amazing butter, and nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried before has made my skin so soft, nourished and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I first experienced this product 14 years ago when I had my hair put in braids by African women.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and goes a long way when you mix with your favorite oil and whip it</li>
            <li>I started using it myself, great for lips and rough patches.  </li>
            <li>The price is great, and my order here on Amazon was fulfilled as expected.</li>
            <li>The lip balm was a huge success--</li>
            <li>I will finish this jug and write an update about how it does after a full month.</li>
            <li>Good quality..would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li>she says feel better and its really working on her face.  </li>
            <li>It is true as others say and this product lasts a while.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been putting the shea butter on my hands with socks at night and it&#x27;s as effective as burts bees cuticle cream and lush&#x27;s</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is 100% true shea butter.  </li>
            <li>I do not know if it is because of the cool temperature or the nature of shea butter.</li>
            <li>This is true Shea butter</li>
            <li>All comments below about how amesome this stuff is completely true.</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice soft feel to your skin.</li>
            <li>My allergist told me that I am highly sensitive to \\&quot;unnatural\\&quot; creams, body washes, soaps, shampoos, detergents (I have never used make up in my life)- anything of that kind that could come in contact with my face and irritate it.</li>
            <li>My hair loves it, my skin loves it, these are the benefits true, quality, shea butter promises and delivers.</li>
            <li>but no where near as effective as shea butter.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely 100% love it.</li>
            <li>And the more than reasonable price is a bonus.</li>
            <li>But, I have really grown to love it.  </li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t if is true or</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin nice and soft with a glow in the morning.</li>
            <li>let cool (but not completely)&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>I make my own natural body products and I am going to purchase my Shea Butter from Molivera Organics from now on.</li>
            <li>love the quality use it all the time , all the family , will buy again ,thanks</li>
            <li>and we have been loving it so far.  </li>
            <li>I have added this to my own recipe for natural hair products as well as skin care.</li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t seem to absorb the sweet almond oil as I would have wished and I was going to give the oil to my massage therapist.</li>
            <li>This stuff is good quality, starts to melt in your hand but solid at room temperature.  </li>
            <li>Even though I used it in a double boiler, I found that it &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; in your hand fairly well, too, so using it on your skin and hair isn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of lotions and this seems to really help maintain a healthy balance of moisture.</li>
            <li>cool</li>
            <li>The company seems to really stand by their product and has sent me a couple of emails asking if I am satisfied while providing tips for storage.</li>
            <li>I had to throw away a nearly full jar.  </li>
            <li>Doing a good job rejuvenating her face, she&#x27;ll try it in her hair next!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really loving this shea butter so far.</li>
            <li>Good stuff- didn&#x27;t feel gritty as some reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li>And then, when it dries, it leaves your skin feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad as some commented.</li>
            <li>Especially great for dry or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great so far, will almost certainly purchase more although we use it frequently, there is a substantial amount.  </li>
            <li>This Shea butter is so light and creamy and the price is definitely right.  </li>
            <li>Shea butter does not liquefy as easily as coconut oil, so it doesn&#x27;t exactly glide onto the skin.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty strong</li>
            <li>-- this is not a bad thing -- it means its super</li>
            <li>after reading the reviews of the other products on quality of product and packaging, I am extremely happy with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried other brands to compare, but this product is really great.</li>
            <li>Works great at moisturizing toddler skin that seems not to do well with other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great used alone or as an additive to other things.</li>
            <li>It takes a little rubbing together in my hands to warm the compound and then spreads nicely over my face.  </li>
            <li>it is super official</li>
            <li>This item arrived quickly and is just as described.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly as well.</li>
            <li>but it quickly melts and absorbs into the skin with body temperature.</li>
            <li>If I need more, I just take a tiny bit more as required.  </li>
            <li>When I need more I will most definitely purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s super hydrating &amp; no problems with clogging my skin.  </li>
            <li>My batch still has an earthy smokey smell but it evaporates quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been putting it on my pregnant tummy to help with stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>I received it quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super moisturizing</li>
            <li>I will purchase more Shea Butter from Molivera in the future! :)</li>
            <li>Smell is vey mild (no added perfumes).</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly but leaves my hands feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li>recipe can be used for body or face, make sure essential oil is ok for face use</li>
            <li>I saw no difference in my stretch marks, the smell is a bit overwhelming, however it leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>So far it has been the best money I have spent.</li>
            <li>i am pregnant and use this stuff to combat hormonal acne and stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Even better is that it&#x27;s all natural and free from chemicals</li>
            <li>We love it and will be buying more regularly.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t mind the mild smell.</li>
            <li>This is helping with my sons eczema tremendously.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 5 months pregnant</li>
            <li>I use it as a lotion for my skin everyday and it is very soothing and smells wonderfully!</li>
            <li>This particular brand (Molivera) was lovely.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into my skin and hair and leaves it moisturized for days.</li>
            <li>It warms quickly in my hands and dissolves into a salve-like cream that absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It does seem a bit grainy at the beginning, but all of that melts out quickly when I rub it into the palm of my hands.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used several brands and have decided that Molivera is the most satisfying.</li>
            <li>This is a Super Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It spread quickly with the warmth of my hands and the texture became smoother.  </li>
            <li>Came in mail quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer for my newly developed locs and I also started applying it to my face and have been surprised by the results.</li>
            <li>I love it, and will definitely purchase again when I need more.</li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s feet have eczema, I have used coconut oil on them for more than one month, they&#x27;re getting better but not totally recovered.</li>
            <li>I researched several different companies, and found this to be the best one for me.</li>
            <li>In about 1 week of using this my sons akin has softened and healed tremendously.</li>
            <li>Mine is a little grainy, but as others have noted, once you put some in your hand and rub it between your hands it melts beautifully and the grainy quality disappears.</li>
            <li>highly recommended and I will be purchasing more as soon as I run out.</li>
            <li>Love this, it&#x27;s a high quality, orangic and non-gmo.  </li>
            <li>Goes on very smooth and leaves the skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but I don&#x27;t want to be overpowered by it</li>
            <li>This was an exciting find for me and has proven true to its word.</li>
            <li>It has a &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; smell to it (not unpleasant at all)</li>
            <li>I prefer unscented pure shea butter, and this spreads easily at room temperature.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s real and raw and is wonderfully nourishing for skin!!!!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for good raw shea butter, you will be pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It melts very easy in your palms when rubbed together and does not clump up, glides on smoothly, jar will last forever.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so happy that it&#x27;s actually worked, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Love my new products, and I will order again.</li>
            <li>My hands get irritated easily and this really helps.  </li>
            <li>It melts easy and it leaves my skin very hydrated .I</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to many perfumes and lotions.  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to many perfumes and lotions have not had any problems with this product.</li>
            <li>I will definitely get some more when I run out!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I needed to make my lotions!</li>
            <li>I love this product so far!</li>
            <li>I will be back to buy more!</li>
            <li>Once it runs out, I will definitely be getting more!</li>
            <li>Thanks again Molivera!!</li>
            <li>I felt when it is first applied to wanting to use it again!  </li>
            <li>Seller was exemplary and shipping was prompt, thanks!!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>I used to use coconut oil and vit E oils at night to help hydrate and breath new life into my skin and although they were great, the hydration seemed very short term.</li>
            <li>So far, I am super pleased with this shea butter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought some shea butters in the past that were grainy and smelled a tad bit strong, but this is amazing!</li>
            <li>my 72 year old skin felt very smooth.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, ivory raw shea butter.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is attractive enough to leave out for easy access and I&#x27;ve found myself using it several times a day - for hands, body, feet, face and hair.</li>
            <li>Perfect creamy raw shea butter, normally I end up with some grit in my unrefined shea butter</li>
            <li>Great texture, it takes a little bit to get used to the smell, but the benefits worth it.</li>
            <li>If you want an amazing facial mask  mix the Shea butter with the 99% percent</li>
            <li>Also, the company has great customer service and emailed me in reference to see how I felt about the product a few weeks after I received it.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of natural beauty and cruelty free items.  </li>
            <li>I have a love/hate relationship with ingredient labels as most things marked &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; include many ingredients that I can&#x27;t pronounce and appear to be anything but natural.</li>
            <li>This product from Molivera has been amazing its simple and nourishing.  </li>
            <li>One of the most amazing products I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon and the only product I&#x27;ve written about thus far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hydrating, soothing, and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I blended mine with coconut oil and lavender essential oil in my food processor and it made an amazing body butter.</li>
            <li>and you can always add your own fragrance if you want with essential oils.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of using natural ingredients for my skin care products.</li>
            <li>Fresh.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>well worth the purchase</li>
            <li>Received product promptly and I love how soft my skin feels.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using this product so far.</li>
            <li>I seems to melt into your skin better than my old product.</li>
            <li>I love how it is all natural as I don&#x27;t use any products with petroleum.</li>
            <li>i had also ordered some rose oil that i mixed into my butter and this helped alot</li>
            <li>I bought this to make my own lotions, mixing with coconut oil and essential oils.</li>
            <li>I love to put it on at night and then early in the morning.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It may take awhile to put on but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I put it on after taking a warm shower which open up the pores.</li>
            <li>However at the end of the day from using it in the morning.....my skin is so soft :)</li>
            <li>I was told by a fellow co-worker that it is one of the best remedies for tired, aching, and cracked feet.</li>
            <li>Fantastic moisturizer - well worth the money and highly recommended!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not much smell with this brand brand either, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>I actually ordered it to make my own deodorant, but also tried it on my hands.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes the skin feel soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li>I wish you much success and God&#x27;s Blessings.</li>
            <li>For those looking for a natural alternative to oils/lotions/cremes for massage, something that is healing for the skin and offers therapeutic benefits, and is great to work with in terms of glide-ability, I highly recommend this shea butter!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many others in the market and none compares to the quality this one offers.</li>
            <li>So far I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff nothing like a natural product that does what it says plus some.</li>
            <li>Love it so far.</li>
            <li>but Ivory Shea Butter is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>Everyone knows what a fresh burn looks like.</li>
            <li>I have just started using it, but I am pleased so far.</li>
            <li>I love the natural smell and feel of this product.  </li>
            <li>I prefer to put olive oil on my legs, it leaves my skin soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I plan on mixing with coconut oil and an essential oil and make my own fragrances.  </li>
            <li>will be ordering more soon.hands and feet leaving them soft.  </li>
            <li>I plan on mixing with coconut oil and an essential oil and make my own fragrances.  </li>
            <li>I put this on my CHEST AND BACK, two areas I&#x27;ve suffered with breakouts during my teens and as an adult and it has greatly improved my skin to the point I rarely ever have one breakout ANYWHERE on my body.  </li>
            <li>Works great as an essential all natural ingredient for making my homemade deodorant which I found on Dr. Josh Axe&#x27;s webpage.  </li>
            <li>I love body butter with shea butter in it, so I thought why not use the natural Shea butter instead of the added extras in the body butter.</li>
            <li>The tips are useful.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>Love the natural smell and feel.</li>
            <li>excellent product the lid was broken in shipping but the jar stayed sealed ...</li>
            <li>So far, I love it.</li>
            <li>So far I have purchased 2 tubs, and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>My processed version is many years old, and now it has a stickier consistency and &amp;#34;dead&amp;#34; scent (like petroleum jelly with particles).  </li>
            <li>It works great on dry skin and better yet on stretch marks (new AND old ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They were very interested in know if I was happy with my purchase and if they could help in any way if I was not satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several other brands before but this one is the best.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see myself going back to regular lotion, this makes my skin feel so good!</li>
            <li>I love this product, it&#x27;s pure high quality unrefined shea butter</li>
            <li>Like most original butters its a bit hard but easily melts in your palms for easy application on body or hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Either the price went way up, or I got the original tin as a gift as I couldn&#x27;t imagine paying that much again.)</li>
            <li>Really good for chapped hands this winter, among other things.</li>
            <li>Using this to treat babies Excema.... Seems good so far...like the texture as it is softer than some other brands.</li>
            <li>Feels just right.  </li>
            <li>Smoothed them right out.</li>
            <li>but it soaks right into the skin.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is just the right consistency.</li>
            <li>I also use a bit after I wash my hair and right before blowdrying as a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It arrived right away.</li>
            <li>Just right for skin.  </li>
            <li>So you damn right its a product that works.</li>
            <li>You can literally feel the healing right away.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because the price was right</li>
            <li>I have only had this product two full weeks, but I love it and have gotten my sister</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like lotion where it comes out really easily, but it&#x27;s soft enough that if you rub your fingers in it to warm it up you&#x27;ll get what you need.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very subtle and the texture is perfect.</li>
            <li>Very pure shea butter</li>
            <li>It seems very pure.  </li>
            <li>The best thing I have found is that it really helps seal the moisture into my skin, especially on my feet which get very dry and cracked during Rocky Mountain winters.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower as a skin conditioner and it works incredibly well not only for dry skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is still getting better and better and less bumpy.</li>
            <li>and you can tell nothing was added due to the scent being light and mild unlike so many others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent so much money on designer creams that work, but this really does a surprisingly great job at moisturizing and evening skin tone.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different brands of shea butter, and by far this is the best one I have found!</li>
            <li>Let me say Molivera and Amazon were fantastic about resolving the problem and following up with communication, and by the third time, I received my shea butter in good condition.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure about the &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; properties, but it seems to be a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>There are no bad chemicals added so I don&#x27;t have to worry about absorbing anything toxic.  </li>
            <li>Smells very earthy but not bad.</li>
            <li>only problem is its original smell, as its a product derived from nuts it has a strong nutty smell</li>
            <li>It smells like Shea Butter again comparing it to the other ones I have tried but this one its much softer and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Will certainly be a repeat customer!  </li>
            <li>After buying this from Molivera Organics, I received an email thanking me for my order, but also giving me tips and tricks on the use and expectations of pure Shea Butter!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing moisturizing for dry skin in the winter and sun parched skin in the summer.</li>
            <li>Super hydrating, not sticky at all, absorbs very well.</li>
            <li>She appreciated my inquisitiveness and kind words pertaining to the item and gave me a coupon for my next order of the Shea butter.</li>
            <li>Thick, smooth consistency seems like good stuff.</li>
            <li>Shea Butter is really good makes your skin smooth and moisturized, but it is really thick.</li>
            <li>Delivery was super fast and the product is legit.</li>
            <li>This product is excellent although much harder than I expected.  </li>
            <li>so far ive used it a couple days and love how much it has moisturized the skin on my face.</li>
            <li>so far the product is great and came exactly as expected.</li>
            <li>Molivera has sent me a few emails  to check in to make sure I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I have suffer sensitive skin all my entire life and nothing has felt as good as this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It goes on very shiny and almost greasy (it absorbs quickly though)</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many more complicated recipes, but I used a very easy one.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>These amazing healing properties have shown great success in treating various skin problems such as wrinkles, blemishes, skin allergies, eczema, and other skin conditions.</li>
            <li>This really helps keep the incision site flexible and I very much appreciate that!</li>
            <li>It is far SUPERIOR in quality to the top selling &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; brand of Shea Butter from L&#x27;Occitane, which I have used for the past 15 years.</li>
            <li>This is the first thing I&#x27;ve found that works super fast.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>The shipping on this was very fast.  </li>
            <li>and so it is very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>really any other good body oil&lt;</li>
            <li>I have used it as a face moisturizer and my face is super, super soft.</li>
            <li>Spreads fairly easily and the smell is gently, not too strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little oily feeling at first, but once it absorbs into your skin, it really feels amazing!</li>
            <li>and so far I am very satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend it if you are looking for an all natural moisturizer</li>
            <li>I have tried other Shea butters which were good, but this brand has soothed my super sensitive skin like nothing I have tried before (I have tried a plethora of products).</li>
            <li>I rather smell pure natural Shea butter than lotion full of synthetic fragrance!</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t worry about that when you first try it.</li>
            <li>AND if you find you just cant stand it, add a pinch of your favorite essential oil to it and that is all</li>
            <li>I will certainly be back for more.</li>
            <li>Has worked well for us,and have been able to find several uses for it.</li>
            <li>The representative promptly answered my questions and was very polite!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I used this on my whole body including my hair and it has works wonders for split ends!</li>
            <li>To be the first week of usage</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever purchased something like this.</li>
            <li>It truly is the BEST way to moisturize and a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li>Consistent product - I&#x27;ve ordered several times :)</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed using this product with my essential oils.  </li>
            <li>but I realized If I rub my  hands together till they are hot then place the Shea butter in my hands</li>
            <li>Can feel the difference as soon as I apply the first time.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely order it again.</li>
            <li>Plus it helped to fade marks from my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li>This was my first shea butter product</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I mixed some of this with some Lavender essential oil and it makes a nice salve!</li>
            <li>I put it on my face the first time I used it and had to wipe it off around my nose</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>What I love about this stuff is that not only does it moisturize but it helps provide vitamins and omegas to my skin</li>
            <li>I recently went through my vanity and gave away most of my face and body moisturizers and creams....</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Mixing with other oils (Jojoba and Coconut oils) to make a healthy lotion!</li>
            <li>My head feels so soft and smooth to the touch, just like a baby’s bottom…</li>
            <li>This shea butter is much easier to use!</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve used Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I didnt think I was going to like this at first.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what the label says.  </li>
            <li>I lucked up and made my first choice in a Molivera product which will now be my go to place for Shea Butter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So glad I ordered this product and the size of it will last me awhile.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Natural hair and skin care are so important to me.</li>
            <li>Customer service really concerned about your satisfaction!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I love Shea butter and use it regularly.</li>
            <li>There is a lot of product but so far smooth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended !!</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of shea butter.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>I would definitely  recommend this product. :)</li>
            <li>Overall, I love it and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it is unrefined and has no additives, it is in more of a solid state.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more once I run out.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t help but do review on this product because it was instant love for it.</li>
            <li>Better then any liquid eye makeup remover I used, and moisturizes at the same time.</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying shea.</li>
            <li>My first introduction to Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think anything exists that truly erases stretch marks, but this makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use it consistently after I shower.  </li>
            <li>it makes your skin sooo soft &amp; smooth...</li>
            <li>It is a personal favorite.</li>
            <li>It actually penetrates into the skin and doesn&#x27;t just sit on the top layer of your skin.</li>
            <li>but I stopped at my calves once I realized it wasn&#x27;t going to absorb into my skin like the first jar.</li>
            <li>My first time with this brand</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had experience with refined Shea Butter and you can for sure tell that this is actually organic.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is the first time we tried shea butter</li>
            <li>We have been applying shea butter mixed with olive oil to his skin and we are pleased with its effects.  </li>
            <li>From the first application I could tell there was a difference.</li>
            <li>I have used this several times and I love it.</li>
            <li>As a first time buyer of Molivera Organics Ivory Shea Butter, my apprehensiveness was muted as I smelled and felt the goodness of this product.</li>
            <li>but there absolutely is!</li>
            <li>I bought it to try on my 9 year olds exzema and after the first use I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I love how it stays moist on your face the entire day.</li>
            <li>First off there is the smell.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using Shea Butter</li>
            <li>I really appreciate them!</li>
            <li>Many months later,  I have to say this is a gift that keeps on giving.</li>
            <li>I have tried different brands of Shea Butter and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Company also follows up nicely, I am sure if things weren&#x27;t just as they should be they would go above and beyond to fix things.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and literally melts in your hands when you put it on your body!</li>
            <li>And, it is very obvious that Molivera Organics values their customers and views customer satisfaction as a top priority.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>I use it with my scented creams and it goes on smooth and keeps my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have tried this product.  </li>
            <li>Overall, for the price, the product is ok.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t care for the smell, but I wanted something without added scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizes my skin really well, and since I have eczema, I&#x27;m sensitive to many products.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of this brand of Shea Butter from this vendor.  </li>
            <li>since I got two jars on the first order.  </li>
            <li>First, I received a product that appeared used.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m left with the softest, smoothest, most glorious skin ever.  </li>
            <li>I have already used most of the container, I&#x27;ll definitely be re-ordering.</li>
            <li>And i felt like I was going to get stretch marks even though I did not get any with my first child (born in september).  </li>
            <li>Thanks Molivera!</li>
            <li>It has made my skin incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I had a problem with my first order.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be busying more when I run out.</li>
            <li>A tiny bit in your hair can help give it a healthy shine, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nourishing and it makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Shea Butter and did my research on what to look for</li>
            <li>Though the top of the shea butter jar had been closed, ants  had completely covered the top of the contents.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m definitely planning on purchasing more in the future :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better if you melt it and add carrier oil and essential oils.</li>
            <li>This was my first go at buying Shea butter</li>
            <li>I find that I like to put this on first (lips, elbows, feet) and</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I use it to make lotions and this is my first time using this brand.</li>
            <li>My first time using shea butter to help moisturize and treat my excema ridden hands</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the computer for a large part of the day and really appreciate having a product that dries so quickly (and works so well).</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of using a single, pure ingredient moisturizer (just like food..</li>
            <li>/&gt;For those of you used to using the higher end French brands, I&#x27;ll warn you that the raw and unrefined products have a more gritty feeling to them at first, but as soon as they make contact with your warm skin, they melt 100% without any kind of residual particles.</li>
            <li>The dry winter has really worked my hands and feet over, but I think this product will help ease me in to summer quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>Great service, as usual!</li>
            <li>I mixed the Shea Butter with other oils to make my own body butter, and my skin has never felt better.  </li>
            <li>I live in a climate that is on the cool side and the temperature is often in the 60&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>But, my favorite thing about this product is by far the fact that it has completely cleared up my skin!</li>
            <li>Have been using it on my face and it hasn&#x27;t been greasy at all which is a pleasant surprise since I usually have oily skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft and full of body.</li>
            <li>i am also impressed by the company-they keep me informed about he product, and they were extremely helpful and quick to solve a small problem with my order.  </li>
            <li>This is very pure product, and very comforting for my skin.</li>
            <li>Using this with my essential oils for more pure products for my body.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get any more pure or simple than this Ivory Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I purchased this for my girlfriend due to her pregnancy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m waiting on other products to use this to make my own soap, shaving cream, etc...</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a super rich moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, because I am constantly cleaning</li>
            <li>I am currently stationed overseas, but I ordered this and sent it home for when I come back--I&#x27;m excited to use it in my chapsticks and lotions!</li>
            <li>This is the REAL Deal, it is pure and unrefined, therefore it contains all of the &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; healing properties of Shea!  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Occitane product feels more refined as it has a smoother texture out of the jar than the Molivera, but the skin care results are much the same.</li>
            <li>I have used this in many different ways, to make lotion, hair treatments, medicinal ointments and creams, and just straight out of the jar.</li>
            <li>It is much thicker than most processed, mixed ingredient body butters</li>
            <li>It takes a tiny bit of effort to create a smooth &#x27;paste&#x27; for lathering but its worth it.</li>
            <li>A very itchy rash on my arm felt better and the redness is already disappearing on the second day.  </li>
            <li>then like to layer something else (lotion, lip balm) on top to really moisturize deep.</li>
            <li>I purchased a different brand that was certified pure by the American Shea Butter Institute and had remarkable results, so much so, that my sister-in-law with chronic eczema also bought some.</li>
            <li>First time to use pure Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>Its so pure and easy to mix with so many other carrier/ essential oils and make your own facial products.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin including some mild eczema on the side of my face.</li>
            <li>Smooth, and Creamy... a little struggle to lotion in and take out the jar but overall a good product.</li>
            <li>For my hair, I rub a little in my hands and warm it first, then I just rub it on the fluffiest parts of my hair first, and then work to the ends and then the scalp.</li>
            <li>It took about a week to start see the positive effects.  </li>
            <li>Wanted to try it out because of all of the benefits and positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Maybe its benefits are great, but the smell is not good.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, helps heal skin and gets rid of dark spots.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much a pain to apply.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at the quality and though it seems very buttery on skin at first it melts into your skin and</li>
            <li>Its a GREAT product to experiment with by adding other oils ( essential oils, organic grapeseed oil ect )</li>
            <li>While I had used many other products that contained shea butter (refined) and knew that I liked it in general, I was looking for something that was all natural.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I truly love this product and foresee using it perpetually.</li>
            <li>All you need to do is put some of this in the palm of your hand, place your other hand over it and gently rub your hands together, and it turns into a nice spreadable liquid within 15 to 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Pretty much a lifetime supply of shea butter.  </li>
            <li>I bought some all natural essential oils (tea tree, lavender, rosemary, mint, rose, eucalyptus) to mix in as I feel every morning after I shower and these work really well.</li>
            <li>And who wouldn&#x27;t want to use all natural products on their kids over the chemical full lotions sold in the store.</li>
            <li>Very good product and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for dry hair and scalp and it&#x27;s so soothing for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I also melted some down to make my own deodorant.</li>
            <li>Usually, the pure Shea butter doesn&#x27;t smell all that good.</li>
            <li>Also trying on my baby stretch marks, maybe it can work a little magic there too!</li>
            <li>this product is amazing, I have been using it for less than a week</li>
            <li>It has a mild nutty scent and leaves me feeling soft all day.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin super soft.  </li>
            <li>The skin feels super soft.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, and I can&#x27;t believe this keeps my skin hydrated for 8 hours or more.</li>
            <li>Makes skin super soft.</li>
            <li>Melted easily and smell was not detectable after heating, mixing and adding essential oils.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep looking for better dry skin solution.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product, made my baby&#x27;s diaper rash disappear in 48 hours and the dry skin in my hands gone over night..</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my lips because they get so dry at night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought white, ultra-processed shea butter, and I&#x27;ve had grainy cream-colored product that had a strong smell.</li>
            <li>do let my clients know that it can feel a bit greasy on the skin and takes a little while to soak in, so for those who don&#x27;t want that, I use an oil or creme that soaks in more quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;coating&amp;#34; on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I use more before turning in for the night, right after showers or after gardening, scrubbing pots/pans, or any other task that really does a number on my hands.</li>
            <li>It is certainly the pure Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>so I like knowing that this product is pure Shea butter &amp; has no chemicals added.</li>
            <li>Seems like quite a liberal amount for the price, and I like that it is pure Shea butter without anything added.</li>
            <li>I have used pure shea butter before but nothing of this quality.</li>
            <li>The pure form heals without itching.</li>
            <li>I believe that this one is pure.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try pure shea butter even though it&#x27;s a bit greasy.</li>
            <li>I use it with the Life-Flo Oil, Pure Almond, 16 Ounce.</li>
            <li>This is mine after two weeks on the pure Shea butter.  </li>
            <li>Obviously pure unrefined Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>I chose this brand because it was the cheapest pure shea butter that I could find that was eligible for prime, and I do not regret it.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try PURE, unrefined Shea butter</li>
            <li>Because of its purity it doesn&#x27;t contain any certain added fragrance.</li>
            <li>Also, I think it&#x27;s makIng a large brown spot on my face fade.</li>
            <li>just pure shea butter&lt;</li>
            <li>Decided to order the Shea Butter based on the positive reviews and very grateful that I did.  </li>
            <li>trying it now for a few weeks, I am in love!  </li>
            <li>like rubbing cream mixed with fine bits of sand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>definitely coming back to get more when its over!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used shea butter before, but this product seems to be very high quality.</li>
            <li>I wanted the real deal and got it; pure, unrefined, not-messed-about-with shea butter.</li>
            <li>This pure shea butter is really concentrated.  </li>
            <li>It is pure Shea Butter and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Absorbs fast and keeps our skin looking fresh &amp; healthy, soft, helping w/ dry skin &amp; wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Some shea butter come gritty, so far this product is very smooth.</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d found the very product I needed for dry hair until the morning I went into my bathroom and was greeted by a vanity top filled with tiny ants.  </li>
            <li>Imagine baby soft, well pedicured, pretty feet every day!</li>
            <li>Thanks for keeping it so simple and natural, so I can experiment adding my own natural ingredients or use it alone!</li>
            <li>I like the smokey nutty scent, not a heavy smell, just a  pure and fresh.</li>
            <li>I put a little on a saucer and put it in the toaster oven on 115 to warm while I am getting ready.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality and reasonable price for quantity.  </li>
            <li>texture is very thick, and it takes a minute or so on your skin to warm up and smooth out.</li>
            <li>mixed up an ounce of this butter with a little almond oil from the same company (seems to be wonderful stuff)</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>It definitely makes a huge difference in it.</li>
            <li>This is such a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It really stays on your skin and doesn&#x27;t evaporate, so my thirsty skin really gets the treatment it needs.</li>
            <li>Perhaps those reviewers haven&#x27;t really purchased something like this before</li>
            <li>Bought it hopes that it&#x27;d help my psoriasis, it didn&#x27;t really.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I really like this organic shea butter.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to worry about absorbing chemicals through your skin.  </li>
            <li>I use on whole body after shower.</li>
            <li>They are really helpful.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent service and helpful tips.</li>
            <li>but it seemed to heal much faster with the butter.  </li>
            <li>Very nutty.</li>
            <li>It really does work wonders.</li>
            <li>it really is.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel it leaves as much of a residue on my clothes, either.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really used it that much.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied.product was just as advertised.</li>
            <li>the real deal.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell either.  </li>
            <li>With that being said not on to the product, I really like it.  </li>
            <li>My whole family loves it.</li>
            <li>Ivory Shae cream is the real thing.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It is nothing like a coconut butter which is much smoother.  </li>
            <li>A real value.</li>
            <li>The packaging is of high quality too!  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li>very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Although it works as advertised, it has a much stronger nutty smell than the ivory shea butter.</li>
            <li>I have not broken out at all-</li>
            <li>This shea butter was better than expected.</li>
            <li>Received this amazingly fast.</li>
            <li>so I scrape out a a lot and place it on my skin to smooth out and the texture is gritty....</li>
            <li>I really like this shea butter</li>
            <li>and I can tell it works very well.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, not gritty.</li>
            <li>Just give it extra time to sink into the skin, makeup will go on smooth.</li>
            <li>I just purchased the product, there isn&#x27;t much at this time to say about it.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely convinced by this butter.</li>
            <li>, that is very itchy.</li>
            <li>I love,love,love it so much</li>
            <li>and it was delivered so fast i will be ordering from this company again</li>
            <li>It really softens them.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My belly seldom itched thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>Firat time I can say real Shea butter.</li>
            <li>you molivera  for selling real Shea butter</li>
            <li>Just as advertised, and living in the desert, I have to say it really is a pleasure to use after a day hike.</li>
            <li>I just got the shea butter, in a very timely manner for living overseas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unusual</li>
            <li>and it has made a real difference.</li>
            <li>I use it on my whole body and face.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>

            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I was concerned the shea butter will make my face breakout, I have very oily and acne prone skin and using this product has not caused any pimples...</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>packaging too, and it&#x27;s a plastic jar, which makes it easier when transporting haha.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Molivera Organics Shea Butter!</li>
            <li>Lied it so much</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s VERY GRAINY and doesn&#x27;t melt into the skin at all.</li>
            <li>that really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but this is just so much</li>
            <li>You just have to rub it together in your hand really well before putting it in your hair</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>nothing was really helping.</li>
            <li>(I have very oily skin) before bed as an evening cream.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for myself and everyone In the family household is using it and its going so fast</li>
            <li>Absorbs very well into the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very grainy...</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think there was going to b a difference between products</li>
            <li>I have moisturized my whole life but age is age.</li>
            <li>This Shea butter came highly recommended to me and it has been life changing!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>, I put it every \5 days straight......</li>
            <li>His skin is so much softer.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really use it.</li>
            <li>I believe that coconut and olive oil is much easier to apply than the shea butter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very disapointed.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t smell it nearly as much.</li>
            <li>Item arrived fast from seller.  </li>
            <li>I applied it to my skin, and because it was so much softer</li>
            <li>I have been using, and this product has really been helping.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast</li>
            <li>I had a delivery issue, and they took care of it really fast and courteously.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend buying from this company.</li>
            <li>The sender also provided information on this product via e-mail, which is much appreciated.  </li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing, but not overly greasy.  </li>
            <li>It really is the smoothest, creamiest shea butter I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>This is real shea butter.</li>
            <li>I really like that the seller sent me some tips on using it too.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten so much use out of this product it blows my mind.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Molivera Organics also checked-in with me to see how I was doing with the product, a level of customer care and concern that I appreciated.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>However, the item works very well for the purpose for which it was purchased.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for any skeptics!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It works very well, but is greasy</li>
            <li>My skin is very acne-prone and this does not make me break out at all.  </li>
            <li>This shea butter works really well as an aftershave balm.</li>
            <li>I used it in a recipe for lip balm with my niece and nephew and son, and also for very cracked/chapped feet and hands.  </li>
            <li>skin is much softer and smoother!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>It was purchased for my hair and skin, but it&#x27;s too much of a hassle.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>I tend to forget to use it with my EO recipes and use it straight out of the jar.</li>
            <li>Absolutely adore this product.</li>
            <li>and I have not broken out once</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>and it is not greasy, absorbs well, odorless and does not wash out fast.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and soothing.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using this on my hair and definitely recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>I used it in a hair mask and it left my hair incredibly soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to get it soft enough to use, I want to like it more..</li>
            <li>Overall the seller is good, item arrived sooner than I expected, and item was as described.</li>
            <li>Keeps in solid form, but heat from your hands is enough to warm it up.</li>
            <li>The skin near my nails is quite sensitive to chemicals in most hand moisturizers, and have found only a couple or so brands that are made for sensitive skin and that i liked enough to keep using.</li>
            <li>I have asian skin that is used to warm, humid, tropical environments, so living in Michigan with the heater constantly on dries the heck out of me.</li>
            <li>So I used it to make my own lotion which i added essential oils, and coconut oil, and a tiny bit of bee wax.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only started using this (about 2 days now) and have whipped it up with coconut oil and an essential oil to make my own body butter.</li>
            <li>i have very sensitive skin and eczema, and this raw shea butter seems to be good for my skin.</li>
            <li>It is sooooooooo soft!!!</li>
            <li>Butter has a very high &amp;#34;healing fraction&amp;#34;, up to 12% of the butter’s make-up (more than any other type of seed oil).</li>
            <li>I live in the Caribbean where it&#x27;s hot ALL the time</li>
            <li>A little really does does a long way and the sellers really go above and beyond to ensure you receive, store and get the best results from their product.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and my skin has never felt better, I also use it on my nails and they&#x27;ve gotten stronger and are looking lovely.</li>
            <li>Yellow butter is from a different type of an African tree which has very similar qualities of Shea, but is not the same.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, as I love natural cosmetics that smell natural and are not perfumed.</li>
            <li>I Love this stuff , Amazing is not good enough to describe it</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, which is great if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
            <li>After researching the benefits of Shea butter I have found it replaces so many other products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands of shea butter but have not been as pleased w/ their performance.</li>
            <li>Make sure you rub it in well by putting a blob on your palm and rub in circular motion with your fingers on the other hand.</li>
            <li>I bought it to mix it with other oils so for now it&#x27;s in the jar, as soon as I use more of this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using other brands of shea butter for years and love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found some other organic Shea Butter I like better now.</li>
            <li>It is a bit grainy, as other reviewers have said, but most of it melts as soon as you put it on your skin.</li>
            <li>Have used other forms of the &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; shea butter and really love this one.  </li>
            <li>Ordered many Shea butter products from other companies.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes better than all the other lotions I ever brought.</li>
            <li>i usually mix it with honey and scented essential oils to make it more appealing.</li>
            <li>can mix it with other oils to mask that and make it more viscous.  </li>
            <li>Better than the other shea butter brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>other Reviewers had better luck.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought Shea butter from other companies and it was much better.</li>
            <li>So I highly recommend this product to many with dry skin eczema or normal skin.</li>
            <li>do like Shea butter, but not liking the texture of this raw unrefined kind....</li>
            <li>For a few dollars more I get 3 times as much!</li>
            <li>First, this was a hassle free purchase and arrived exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizes all day long, legs look amazing the next day!</li>
            <li>I use it daily on my head, face, and body, and it&#x27;s given my skin a clean, radiant glow.</li>
            <li>If you leave it in warm water long enough it will even liquefy.</li>
            <li>While it is thick and can be greasy at first, my skin nicely absorbs it.</li>
            <li>and i was happy when i saw it was ivory in color and not white or yellow as this is proof its pure and unprocessed.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s a great buy because a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>I love coconut oil and use it daily on my girls and I, but needed something a little more creamier and thicker that was all natural that wouldn&#x27;t break out my two-month-old and my 2 1/2 year-old skin</li>
            <li>wish I could get back the wasted money I spent on subpar skin products that probably did more harm than good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see anything special about this product yet especially for my sun spots or damage etc</li>
            <li>My skin has been dry and flaky since we&#x27;ve had the heater on and this works better to keep my skin soft than any creams or lotions I have tried.</li>
            <li>I have been trying natural products for over two years to test what works to heal my super cracked, inflamed and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The other thing that I love is that is sourced responsibly, that was one of the major selling points for me on my first purchase.  </li>
            <li>I am very new to this Shea Butter thing.....</li>
            <li>I love how this makes my biracial daughters skin feel and it works great on her hair, it&#x27;s just so thick and hard to put on.</li>
            <li>Great product use it everyday in my hair because it is so dry it keeps it soft and moisturized from the hot sun</li>
            <li>It goes on pretty smoothly and melts easier than other brands.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use it in my daughter&#x27;s extra dry hair for moisture, but it is also amazing to use on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it comes in a dark jar with a lid.</li>
            <li>I love the way shea softens my skin, makes it glow,  and it seems to be fading dark spots on my hands and ankles.</li>
            <li>: I should mention that it took one full month of daily use to transform the driest skin on the tops of my feet.</li>
            <li>Or just warm a small scoop in your hands and slather all over.</li>
            <li>While the promises of healing minor scrapes and scratches hasn&#x27;t really panned out for me, I do think it is a great product that keeps skin tight and soft with continued use.</li>
            <li>I had found some local shea butter in smaller amounts that was very smooth on my lips, so thought I would buy some online.  </li>
            <li>The sad part about it was that when I dug underneath the grainy top surface, (because it melted in the mailer), the rest of it was soft, clean, and smooth.</li>
            <li>Down through the years, I have purchased MANY Shea Butters.  </li>
            <li>and I live it!</li>
            <li>I will be having to buy a new one soon!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that it would be useful for other things, but it left my skin feeling so oily!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s made a huge difference with my chronic dry skin and assisting in the reduction of scare discoloration.</li>
            <li>The smell and texture are much better than the previous brand I bought from a  well known source to people who buy health products.  </li>
            <li>however I absolutely love this product and will only use this on my face and body especially my feet...</li>
            <li>have kids, so I&#x27;m last on the list for many things, which is really no big deal!  </li>
            <li>My questions were mainly about the purity of the product.</li>
            <li>It is solid but melts quickly between your hands when rubbed together.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t particularly like the smell of shea butter, so</li>
            <li>Second, I&#x27;d gladly trade all the fancy creamy lotions that I&#x27;ve used over the years for this one product as it&#x27;s the only one</li>
            <li>I love that this comes in a MASSIVE amount, so I know it&#x27;s going to last for a while.</li>
            <li>Use mainly on hands and body after showering and plan on using it with conditioner when I shampoo my hair.</li>
            <li>I debated whether to purchase shea butter from this particular company.</li>
            <li>As compared the butter that I used before, it is definitely more grainy, however very similar in overall consistency and nutty smell.</li>
            <li>I will get much more out of a product that I will use regularly, even though it might not meet a purist&#x27;s standards, than I will out of a product that I will likely avoid because of its scent.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li>This product actually helped clear up my skin and has kept it looking dewy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this, and even though this jar will last me several more months I am purchasing another for when/if I run out</li>
            <li>As I am getting older</li>
            <li>I use this on my face (mainly at night), lips, body, and hair.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating and, so far, not irritating</li>
            <li>Thank you folks for finally making a product I have known all my life but thought it was just for pregnant women etc</li>
            <li>I personally am not bothered by its mild scent at all.</li>
            <li>job requires me to wash my hands again and again, and then on top of weight lifting ripping my hands up I also work a second job at a car wash which my hands are constantly getting wet.&lt;br /&gt;*Most</li>
            <li>This seller follows up with emails, so direct contact information is available if necessary.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to moisturize decently but I purchased this to help treat my infant&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick - not eligible for prime two day shipping but as soon as I got the email notification I received product the same day!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very surprised of how well and fast it works.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and thanks to this product</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very soft!</li>
            <li>Should last a long time as you only need to use sparingly for good results.</li>
            <li>The local one I bought (much more expensive) was very smooth right aways</li>
            <li>The texture is so nice and smooth (unlike some other organic raw shea butter brands I&#x27;ve used).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>High quality product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone needing shea butter</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you try this.</li>
            <li>I highly recomment the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my go to for now, and based on my experience I can highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: highly recommended... &#x60;</li>
            <li>but it is undeniably high quality shea butter.</li>
            <li>and I decided to try this brand since it packaged the product in a jar and had high ratings.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have used high end products and serums from high end dept. stores</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li>High quality, even if it is unrefined.  </li>
            <li>high quality shea butter.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this Shea Butter to any and everyone, no matter the skin type.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Having some first-hand knowledge of the cocoa plant and it&#x27;s fruit, I can highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Quality of butter feels high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>But for those with dry skin, most of them really like the shea butter, and will actually leave it on the rest of the day to let it soak in and &amp;#34;do its thing&amp;#34; before showering it off.and &amp;#34;do its thing&amp;#34; before showering it off.</li>
            <li>There is no fragrant odor just pure and natural</li>
            <li>I love this shea butter...feels a little grainy but its doing wonders on my sons ezcema</li>
            <li>And I can even put it on my face which is usually sensitive to everything!!</li>
            <li>I am still a little shiny, but I haven&#x27;t discovered a better way to apply.  </li>
            <li>Also great when mixed with other natural ingredients to make lotions and such.</li>
            <li>First of all, I enjoyed how the company emailed me as soon as I ordered the product with tips about using natural raw shea butter.</li>
            <li>I use half the amount of product and the results are better, last longer, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s pure, second, it&#x27;s natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It can be hard to dig out of the jar and you have to warm it up in your hands before applying to the body.  </li>
            <li>It starts off hard but melts nicely in my hands.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and am very picky with what I put on my face..</li>
            <li>Lasts long, non-greasy, leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>You know how cleansing products make your skin clean but so dry ?</li>
            <li>Great quality, just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use much, but so far it is as advertised.</li>
            <li>I bought this after much research on how to alleviate my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s eczema.  </li>
            <li>After using my skins stays soft for the whole day.</li>
            <li>So far it is keeping my baby&#x27;s legs, face and arms much softer than lotions that I did not want to put on her, but felt compelled to - ones that had had all sorts of toxic, cancer causing ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use clean dry hands to scoop the cream out.  </li>
            <li>Use clean dry hands to scoop the cream out.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, its extremely difficult to apply so use a plastic butter knife or something.</li>
            <li>I think this is an amazing product based on touch, smell, moisturizing and even the slow healing properties.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d normally have chapped lips by now!&lt;br</li>
            <li>OK so I bought this a few months ago and have not gotten around to writing a review till now.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally do reviews, but I had to with this product.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;ve had success with restoring my hands was with an overnight treatment of L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s 100% Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>the butter might absorb well, but I have normal</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more in the near future.</li>
            <li>The market is quite competitive and everyone pretty much has the same quality butter.</li>
            <li>I think the company should make sure that the seal is firmly attached so that the customer has to peel it off before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that I haven&#x27;t used it more than a few times.</li>
            <li>Is this normal?</li>
            <li>I purchased this shea butter because the brand I normally used was sold out.</li>
            <li>It does moisturize my skin, but I have to use more of the product than I would normally use other creams because it is quite hard even if I melt it in my hand, still need more product.</li>
            <li>I will buy again when we need more - it will be a while because this goes such a long way!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to deal with</li>
            <li>Well, my skin did not feel irritated at all, and the rash seems to be disappearing gradually, i.e. turning more pale in color.</li>
            <li>It must be stored properly and make sure your hands are dry when using this as you dont want to get water into the container.</li>
            <li>have pretty dry skin, in some areas keratosis pilaris, and this has me feeling pretty</li>
            <li>It melts easily on the skin and can be mixed with moisturizer for extra hydration.</li>
            <li>+ year old face and neck looks less wrinkled and more youthful as a result.</li>
            <li>so if you don&#x27;t like it it would likely be easy to cover up with essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I have tried others previously, but this had been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>It is a bit greasy going on, but it really provides a deep, rich, and lasting moisturization.  </li>
            <li>I also struggled to find the right moisturizer with out all of the extra ingredients.</li>
            <li>Right out of the jar, it&#x27;s a bit gritty, but after warming it up in my hand, the &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; melts away.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it, right out of the jar.  </li>
            <li>It blends really well with other oils like coconut, sweet almond and jojoba.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and dry skin, and so far this is fantastic.</li>
            <li>this product is  very light colored with only a minimal aroma</li>
            <li>I’ve had a couple of people say things like, “...beyond the bald head you look so different now, like younger”, “…if it wasn’t for biology, I’d think you’re pregnant because you’re glowing!”  </li>
            <li>Product is very beneficial and I love the fact it is raw!</li>
            <li>this new product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels like a new skin&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>Seller, get a new package for delivery.</li>
            <li>I use it on my hands, elbow area and legs which always seem to be the driest during New England winters.  </li>
            <li>We live the way that it feels on our skin and hair</li>
            <li>I would love to know if the company has a recipe for making a smoother, body butter type concoction using the raw shea butter</li>
            <li>I love raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li>My hair use to be really dry prior to application of this amazing African Shea butter</li>
            <li>This Shea butter is smooth and thick in texture with a fresh nutty scent.</li>
            <li>It helped heal my dry hands quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a nice subtle scent</li>
            <li>Not only did it seem to help keep her skin supple and free of radiation burns, but at the conclusion of her three week daily radiation regimen my hands felt like silk.  </li>
            <li>I have seen a dramatic increase in moisture in my hair and skin from use and it always gets to me right on time and well wrapped!!!!</li>
            <li>It is a little oily at first but soaks in quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very professional company</li>
            <li>skin feels very soft ..</li>
            <li>In any event, it is very soft and I like it.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to perfume and odors.  </li>
            <li>but it makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I use this as a nighttime moisturizer and it makes my skin very soft, and it doesn&#x27;t make me breakout, as 95% of creams do.</li>
            <li>We have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It has the distinctive color and smell of raw shea butter, which definitely threw me off at first, but after like five minutes I realized that I love the smell.</li>
            <li>This product in particular is so smooth and a little goes a while.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought 3 tubs of it over the past couple years, same brand - the first and third were really grainy right from the start, and the 2nd was very smooth.</li>
            <li>It feels sticky at first, so I only do this at night.</li>
            <li>I use it in our homeade deodorant, as well as directly on skin and lips!</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many expensive creams but it stops here!  </li>
            <li>I was not sure this before I ordered, but I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just wow!</li>
            <li>The only other thing I use regularly (more as a cleanser) is unrefined organic coconut oil</li>
            <li>First off, I don&#x27;t like the yellow shea butter (by Plant Guru).  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s soft and it leaves my skin feeling like it has penetrated it!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It is a bit gritty to touch at first, but once your begin rubbing it into your skin</li>
            <li>However, this kind is not good for whipping.</li>
            <li>The butter looks off-white like natural shea butter normally looks like  </li>
            <li>purchased this item for my 4 month old son-baby acne, cradle cap, ezcema, rashes, etc!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other ones but they do not have the same quality.</li>
            <li>Love to mix this with other oils and essential oils to create lotion or use alone.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin so soft without that greasy feeling!</li>
            <li>This made my skin soooo soft!</li>
            <li>Everything from the delivery, packaging, and actual product is stellar.</li>
            <li>I just started using this for the last 4 weeks (morning and night - especially after a bath) and it has made an enormous difference for the better.  </li>
            <li>Ahhhmazing product!!!!!!! I had second degree burns from hot grease on my arm.</li>
            <li>The scabs, cracking, and pain are all gone; The redness is almost completely gone!</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft!</li>
            <li>The greasiness level is about the same initially, but the L&#x27;O absorbed into my skin and my daughter&#x27;s skin much quicker.  </li>
            <li>No stretch marks so far!</li>
            <li>I use this on my LIPS in place of chap stick and they are so soft!  </li>
            <li>My skin has never been smoother, and it conditions my hair as well, leaving it so soft!</li>
            <li>I also appreciate the dark amber jar which protects the butter from light.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>My first jar lasted about 6 months and we use it several times a day.  </li>
            <li>I received my item before the scheduled date without a doubt they are true to their description absolutely no additives.</li>
            <li>So far, this is better than any Shea I have used,  If you like the really raw formulation, you should try this one.  </li>
            <li>The product shipped very quickly and the generous amount will last very long.</li>
            <li>butter has a nice subtle scent, which I like, and I like the fact that it is all natural.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to those looking for natural hair conditioners and for those looking for natural alternatives to chemical-ridden lotions.</li>
            <li>The next time you have a special on this product I will purchase several jars, my daughter loves it too.</li>
            <li>I have not made it in a recipe for body butter since I am new to essential oils and pure butters.</li>
            <li>So, i usually mix it with another oil that smells nice, such as coconut oil, lavendar oil, or cocoa oil.</li>
            <li>I usually mix this butter w my favorite lotion because I don&#x27;t like the Shea butter natural smell.</li>
            <li>Has all the qualities I&#x27;ve come to expect from a high quality, organic, unrefined, raw, shea butter; beige-yellow proof the product was not bleached, the slight nutty aroma of a nutrient-rich butter, consistency in texture and firmness throughout, no signs of any rancidity or contamination, good packaging.</li>
            <li>It goes on a little dry and crumbly, but softens as you warm it up with your hands.  </li>
            <li>Unrefined raw shea butter, this product is markedly superior than any other I have used to treat inflammed chapped skin.  </li>
            <li>Also, the dark container that it ships in is very useful for longer term storage, since it won&#x27;t let light in like typical clear containers would.</li>
            <li>I bought this because my hands get super dry from work and Shea butter seems to be the only thing that helps more then a few hours.</li>
            <li>This is my second time ordering this product, the first order was a firm smooth compound</li>
            <li>Works amazing on my harsh dry hands ...</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t bad either - kind of nutty, not too strong at all.</li>
            <li>I can get so much more for less via Amazon than my local health food store.</li>
            <li>Smooth and nourishing for my red, dry skin.</li>
            <li>However, as many have stated, this dry, grainy texture goes part and parcel with its unprocessed purity.</li>
            <li>My shea butter had slight discoloration on the top in the middle, but I&#x27;m using it anyway.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin extremely moisturized and my skin feels super soft!</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller because I had a several questions about the product and the seller emailed back quickly.</li>
            <li>but this winter, no matter how hydrated I was or how much of this I put on, I still dried out, quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes on very easily and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The grainy quality may just be due to the fact that I live in Florida, and by the time things get here, and sit in mail truck all day, they are usually hot!</li>
            <li>This product is pure and unrefined which is crucial for me.</li>
            <li>In addition, it is not necessary to use a large amount.</li>
            <li>Pure unrefined ivory african shea butter from Ghana....</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s raw!</li>
            <li>Love Molivera Raw Shea Butter!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and creamy, not hard and gritty, like some of the other brands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this Shea butter for a little over a week but have noticed it lasts the better part of a day.  </li>
            <li>You have to rub it in hard and until those crumbs dissolve which will take more time than you expect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s hard and grainy like most.</li>
            <li>I like that it is a bit heavier than my other go-to hand and foot cream, coconut oil, yet soaks in quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li>I just recently purchased this product, but so far, I really like it.</li>
            <li>Smells clean and slightly nutty.</li>
            <li>TEN years of looking like complete scrap and within just 3 months a very noticeable change.</li>
            <li>I need all the help I can get to keep my skin looking clear and radiant.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my face to combat the drying effects of retin-a for acne and it has helped clear up post acne marks.</li>
            <li>I wake up with soft supple skin.</li>
            <li>This butter makes your skin so soft, and supple.</li>
            <li>- the production date is clearly marked on the seal.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Amazin&amp;#34; there&#x27;s no need to second guess yourself this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>It is also natural</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re now so soft, even in this weather where the heater is running nonstop.</li>
            <li>My mom is around the 55 yrs old.  </li>
            <li>This has been so helpful for my 6 yr old daughter and myself.</li>
            <li>I also made an all natural hair mouse with Shea butter</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural - no harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>He is 1 years old</li>
            <li>It has a thickness to it leaving both our skin soft without feeling greasy.</li>

            <li>I have been searching for a truly natural hair and skin moisturizer for my family with no fragrances, no synthetics, no added</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s the only product that I&#x27;ve tried on my natural hair that really seals in moisture.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I&#x27;m natural and wanted to use it for my hair, instead I use it for my skin</li>
            <li>This has helped prevent my skin from dryness during the winter months and it is all natural.</li>
            <li>I have never written an amazon review and I shop here quite frequently</li>
            <li>Thanks again for such an organic product!</li>
            <li>The ones on my fore arm have completely gone away, but where my muscles are suppose to be they&#x27;re just a bit</li>
            <li>I was up with soft, supple skin and like rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li>Leaves the skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the smoothest product I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>No problem with sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>I have never tried real unrefined shea butter before, and after a week of using it I have to say I&#x27;m a big</li>
            <li>It does not need to say ivory, as real Shea butter suppose to be ivory and not yellow.</li>
            <li>I have a year old surgery scar that still causes me discomfort.</li>
            <li>I use it to mix with my young living oils to make lotions.</li>
            <li>Better late than never.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin looks 23 years old and not 80 anymore.</li>
            <li>I also  use it  on my kid&#x27;s  hair and it  makes their hair soft.</li>
            <li>They both have the smell but the yellow one has a much stronger odor than the ivory one.</li>
            <li>use this on my naturally curly hair and my scalp.</li>
            <li>but so far no improvement.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;VE USED IT ON MY SON&#x27;S ECZEMA FLARE UP (4 YEARS OLD).</li>
            <li>I appreciate the natural shea fragrance and brown plastic container.</li>
            <li>So far, I like the Molivera Organics cream.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday on my feet, and I could feel how smooth they are.</li>
            <li>It also seemed to help soothe a rash I developed from a medicine.</li>
            <li>My face looks so much brighter, smoother, and even younger.</li>
            <li>so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it so far</li>
            <li>,it makes my natural curls so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Tried so many products that just were not effective.  </li>
            <li>Soft and moldable.</li>
            <li>I decided to change the natural aroma and added some scented oil.</li>
            <li>So far this seems to be working.  </li>
            <li>It becomes soft again after you rub it through your hands a bit</li>
            <li>As far as the smell goes, I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>Also a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff is no joke.</li>
            <li>The smell is totally natural</li>
            <li>, there are nearly none in the city</li>
            <li>As far as effectiveness, I&#x27;ve been using it as a moisturizer (in which capacity it works wonders), but I also put it on a cut that I got, and it noticeably soothed the redness and swelling.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>When I wake up my skin is like renewed, soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>And you get so much Shea Butter for low price - it will be enough for the whole year.</li>

            <li>I am also using it on my skin which looks and feels soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable enough for me to buy as gifts</li>
            <li>I use it every night and my skin is baby soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>This is truly a completely natural product.  </li>

            <li>It makes my skin soft and moisturized.</li>

            <li>The rashes are completely gone.</li>
            <li>I also appreciated that the seller contacted me prior to let me know it was on its way.</li>
            <li>My order was received in a timely manner, I have only been using the product for a couple of days, but so for, I really like it.</li>
            <li>, I was hoping for something pleasent to use as a natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who has skin problems or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes so far.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen any old scars disappear yet.  </li>
            <li>And leaves me feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>and it was gone completely.  </li>
            <li>On my hands and feet leaving them soft.  </li>
            <li>: There was one unexpected issue when I got the shea butter.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I mix this shea butter with oils and use it as a moisturizer on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft for days.</li>
            <li>100% natural so it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>It does however make my skin soft</li>
            <li>Unrefined organic and natural unrefined Shea Butter, and</li>
            <li>And there isn&#x27;t a really loud smell like some others carry.</li>
            <li>But all I know is if it makes the skin soft, it must be nourishing it with natural goodness.  </li>
            <li>The moisture lasts, leaving my face and hands feeling soft all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have eczema and a sensitive skin problem.</li>
            <li>Even some products specifically for sensitive skins give me a burning and itchy feeling.</li>
            <li>I use this shea butter directly on my skin</li>
            <li>I recently started using it and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something natural for my and my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>My skin is nearly 100%.</li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned, I have no intention in pursuing prescription strength lotions (for eczema or KP) now that I have this on my side.</li>
            <li>I am using it to make a natural products like deodorant and foot cream.  </li>
            <li>It made my hands feel incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and moist.</li>
            <li>i put in on early in the morning all over my body and it leaves me feeling soft and non greasy.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product I could use to keep my hair soft and manageable and after using this on my hair</li>
            <li>We have used it for lip balm so far</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I bought this product that I realized that my old shea butter was processed.  </li>
            <li>and when I wake up my face is as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom, it surprised me every time.</li>
            <li>I slather this stuff on at night and really rub it into the bleeding knuckles, I literally noticed a difference the next day.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using my shea butter for a few weeks and really love the way it is making my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Within 3 months there has been such noticeable difference in my skin, the complements have been coming left and right.</li>
            <li>Wow my skin love Molivera Organics Raw African Ivory Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>It has very mild smell that is usually a deal breaker me.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;+I emailed them about one of the tubs that I ordered that smelled a little bit different, and they QUICKLY replied and sent me a new tub at no charge, and after that they even explained that the old tub was not bad but simply smells different because of the cultivation product.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT</li>
            <li>So far, with using this product on my back, the rash is pretty much gone, and minimal itching.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this Raw African Shea Butter!!!</li>
            <li>It does have a mild smell to it, which my family does not like, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long once you apply it to your skin.</li>
            <li>Excellent product that I used in combination with beeswax and other raw butters to make hard lotion bars.</li>
            <li>The results encouraged me to start using the shea butter as a general moisturizer, and wow, what a difference!</li>
            <li>Anyway I read reviews on this product, some customer said not real shea butter, some other said rancid, and other people said  Good, so I got for my mom</li>
            <li>But it did not mess up any of my clothes.</li>
            <li>I have taken a brake from using it for a bit to try other products but over all this is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it alone and in combination with other ingredients to make my own lip balm, body butter, facial moisturizer, and deodorant, among other things.</li>
            <li>Other brands dissolve pretty easy, this one leaves some sandy texture when mixed and my skin does not get well mosturized as when used other brand.</li>
            <li>I was nervous to use this product initially because of some of the negative reviews i&#x27;ve read, however this is a new favorite of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I figured before I&#x27;d plunk down the dough on the fancy stuff, I&#x27;d try some other 100% shea butter brands to see if I could get the same results at a more reasonable price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went back and purchase a second one the day after I received the first.  </li>
            <li>However, neither could I find I find a moisturizer, particularly for my hands and feet, that was penetrating enough to make a difference.  </li>
            <li>I normally purchase shea butter from beauty supply stores in the clear plastic containers (you know the ones I&#x27;m talking about) but wanted to try something different.</li>
            <li>It comes in a generous size jar, the consistency is pretty solid and this makes it last longer.</li>
            <li>I love this product it was creamy, and a lot softer than some of the other shea butter&#x27;s I&#x27;ve purchased( from other merchants)</li>
            <li>Found a similar small jar at a Quilt Expo but ran out and was searching for more.</li>
            <li>only takes a small amount and it lasts all most all day&lt;</li>
            <li>I am a long time user of pure shea butter.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it and will purchase again in the future.  </li>
            <li>I am highly acne prone been on several pills and creams bc of acne.</li>
            <li>Exactly what it looks like -- it is pure raw shea butter.</li>
            <li>So far I really like the way this butter feels on my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I am pregnant in the winter (who ever said that was better than summer was crazy)</li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly, and while it does have a bit of an off smell, its not as bad as other shea butters, and its healing powers are great.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses it and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I have roots growing out so a third of my hair is normal, and the rest is bleached and VERY damaged and dry.</li>
            <li>My normally dry hands are so well moisturized after using this at night, mixed with sweet almond oil, beeswax, and some essential oils.</li>
            <li>it does get absorbed but small tiny pieces will remain on my skin but with further rubbing will get absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li>I still have some left for me to make another batch of something new.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the new brand I will be buying.</li>
            <li>My hair has been chronically dry due to extensive use of shampoos and anti-dandruff shampoos and it wasn&#x27;t until I started using this that I was able to get my hair back to it&#x27;s natural softness.</li>
            <li>Compared to raw unrefined coconut oil, it feels more &amp;#34;dense&amp;#34; when rubbing it on…it&#x27;s more difficult to spread and rub into the skin...</li>
            <li>I prefer this raw (unprocessed) product because it&#x27;s smoother and feels more natural.  </li>
            <li>Straight out of the jar and onto my dry heels , whip it into body and face creams.</li>
            <li>it melts easily and loses whatever grittiness that may have been there.</li>
            <li>and it really helps my dry, chapped skin.</li>
            <li>I use daily on my 3 year old and 1 year old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and moisturizing to saturate his skin and makes it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I slather this all over my body at night (such that it is very greasy and goopy) and when i wake up in the morning, it has totally sunk in</li>
            <li>Skin absorbs it quickly and does not leave a greasy feeling at all; but then, I don&#x27;t put it on heavily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s thick, but goes on easily.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this over any other because of its value and high quality.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and my back breaks out in a rash</li>
            <li>this is the first brand of shea butter I have tried, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other shea butters...</li>
            <li>and I saw major improvements after just applying it one night.</li>
            <li>I have used many different moisturizers in the past, but is definitely a keeper.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably not a good idea to leave it in the bathroom where the steam could affect this all natural product, so I leave it in my bedside table where it&#x27;s easy to apply at bedtime.</li>
            <li>I put a small spoonful in my baths and my skin and hair are super soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re very slowly but surely going away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what is described and it&#x27;s very raw and pure.  </li>
            <li>I does smell nutty and is hard to spread, but after about 1 minute is goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought it because I had dark marks from insect bites, but now those dark marks are lightening back up to my natural skin color, my skin is soft and clear and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been switching to products that are as pure as possible, with a simple and short ingredient list.  </li>
            <li>At first there seemed to be a raw like smell, maybe being new...</li>
            <li>Raw shea butter has what I would term as a mild to medium earthy smell that I wasn&#x27;t expecting.  </li>
            <li>In general shea butter has an earthy scent.</li>
            <li>I have got to say that I am a newcomer to shea butter in general and this product specifically.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients on this product (which is only one thing) by far beat what you&#x27;re letting your skin absorb through drug store</li>
            <li>I  have been using it to seal my in the winter hair and it has left my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>It will keep your skin moisturized and get it back to natural glow,health and plus some.</li>
            <li>but I only use it at night so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every remedy possible for my 18 month old and nothing was working.</li>
            <li>and it barely softens up</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase this product in the near future (or sooner as everyone in my family of 6 has gotten in on the action)</li>
            <li>It does feel greasy especially when it comes in contact with my naturally oily skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and the scent is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>It smelled like old petroleum oil mixed with stink root.</li>
            <li>My method involves scraping some butter directly into my palms and rubbing it together (with solid pressure) until is turns into a dense, but liquid-y texture.</li>
            <li>You could turn this jar into 20 different natural beauty items like lip balms, scrubs, creams, etc.</li>
            <li>One of two things would happen, the product would evaporate on my skin because there was too much water in it OR balm type products would simply sit on top and fail to absorb.</li>
            <li>I recently just received this and the Sweet Almond oil; I have used the Ivory Shea Butter a few times since I have received it.</li>
            <li>I have had this jar for approximately 2 months, and it looks like I barely scraped the top.</li>
            <li>and it completely absorbed in a few days.</li>
            <li>This is very much in a &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; state...not like your typical lotion...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone with dry skin or eczema.</li>
            <li>I have always had skin issues including acne, scarring from the acne, sun spots, overall, not a smooth flawless face, hidden behind coverup makeup.</li>
            <li>Organic Shea Butter was highly recommended by my naturopath to relieve patches of extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>this however does not, and it works must better than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;*I usually apply lotion 6 or so times a day, I only have to apply this 2 times in the morning and at night, and my hands don&#x27;t dry out.&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Not only is the smell of this new jar kinda gross (like rubber)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Contents: Creamy, off-white (not yellow or grey)&lt;br /&gt;Texture: Smooth, not grainy (though this just means I lucked out and the bottle didn&#x27;t go through any warm storage or transit and the oil did not have a chance to partially melt and crystallize; I suppose it wouldn&#x27;t have mattered, as I melt it first anyway), slightly crumbly after scraping with a spoon.&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Like shea butter, a little earthy/nutty and similar to other raw shea</li>
            <li>It would have sucked to live with a sunburn for that long while I was there.  </li>
            <li>The smell is neither pleasant nor unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>When you first rub it in it is slightly grainy, however, that disappears once it warms up.</li>
            <li>Not only is it non-greasy (when added in small layers), it helps significantly with scarring over time.</li>
            <li>no dry cracking noses in this house!  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that it is not as easy to apply as other conventional creams, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard as a rock, I try to get a little out with a spoon and warm it between my hands</li>
            <li>I have been interested in using natural products for my face and body, so I decided to try raw shea butter as a body</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much smoother and goes on thinner than other brands.</li>
            <li>Granted, I did sometimes wear cotton and other absorbent materials, and maybe my skin is a bit uncooperative when it wants to be.</li>
            <li>The shopping was late but it was worth it!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much nicer than the other shea butter I have purchased.</li>
            <li>but this one has really helped my skin look smoother and also my breakouts and scars due to hyper-pigmentation from cystic acne are clearing up.  </li>
            <li>Shea butter, like other nut butters, can sometimes be too firm to easily spread on the skin.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry desert area and this helps keep my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing to my skin and especially my dry hands.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly solid in the jar, but I just keep an old spoon next to it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 43 year old male who likes to spend time outside in the sun.  </li>
            <li>And of course, this is the first thing I go to for minor burns, bruises, rashes, and closed healing</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>Well, I finally ran out and when I went to buy it again, I had major sticker shock.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to put anything on because my skin is very sensitive that turns red right away.</li>
            <li>The product is quite hard here and it takes a bit of time to get it soft enough to be absorbed.  </li>
            <li>I generally buy a different brand and thought I would try this brand.</li>
            <li>Received in a timely manner and the dark jar is an absolute plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There were other shea butter in larger quantity and much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>This product SUCKS, I was so excited because I read extensively .</li>
            <li>MUCH cheaper than other brands while retaining the same quality and effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as long term results time will tell.</li>
            <li>and my daughter has some tiny, red bumps on her upper arms that were making her feel self conscious in her sleeveless summer tops.</li>
            <li>Feels sticky at first, then after working it into the skin for a few minutes it absorbs without any stickiness.</li>
            <li>No more fuzz clinging in his hair, his tight curls are much more manageable, and he isn&#x27;t itching his scalp.</li>
            <li>Mine doesn&#x27;t look my the usual shea butter - with the yellowish color, mine is more whitish and not easily spreadable (you know how usual shea butter melts quickly in your hands).  </li>
            <li>Not sure I could use this stuff straight out of the jar with it being so thick and the strong smell.</li>
            <li>Container should last a very long time, consistency is smooth and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The other thing is it takes a moment to warm up in your hands, and can make that annoying &amp;#34;lathering-up&amp;#34; sound, but I don&#x27;t mind that.  </li>
            <li>We have tried everything for my 16 month old&#x27;s son&#x27;s dry cracking skin.</li>
            <li>I ordered Molivera&#x27;s Ivory Shea Butter because the product I used previously cost way too much to ship.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive dry skin that hasn&#x27;t been helped by the dermatologist but cleared up in 3 days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s winter and so dry my skin craved for something natural and hydrating..</li>
            <li>We are using this for my 11 month old dry and eczema skin.</li>
            <li>, eczema prone skin much smoother and less itchy.</li>
            <li>In a league of its own, first class compared to all the crap you find in the drug store.</li>
            <li>I blend it with a little black castor oil to fit my needs.</li>
            <li>The jar makes it easy to scoop out and is small enough to store with my other hair and body products.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing effects last longer than any other body butter, and it is clearly high quality.</li>
            <li>product is raw so it does feel crumbly at first</li>
            <li>This is first time buying and using raw Shea.</li>
            <li>Being my first time ordering raw Shea butter, I was nervous.</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing raw shea butter.</li>
            <li>This butter is exactly the way raw shea butter should be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 68 years old and have very dry skin</li>
            <li>I use it all over and use it on my six year old son because he has very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I have very dry combo skin in the winter months and also adult acne which makes for a nightmare of situation when you are trying to pick out a moisturizer that wont break you out.  </li>
            <li>she develop a very dry skin only on the face, her cheeks and near to the mouth area, the skin always peel.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is you really have to rub it in to get the little butter grains into your skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strange at first, but you get used to it, plus it dissipates after about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I find myself continuously having to clean up residue that I leave behind, but it&#x27;s worth the trouble!</li>
            <li>After years of using false shea butter (that yellow stuff they sell at every beauty supply store and even here on amazon), I switched to the pure bulk shea butter sold by whole foods.</li>
            <li>Its really thick kind of hard to get out .</li>
    </ol>

            <li> this is a nice shea butter,white and creamy,i like it</li>
            <li> It also gives my skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li> And it was a kind of oily that didn&#x27;t even wash away with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I rub it into my hands and apply it to my skin at the beginning I feel kind of grease</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Loving it.</li>
            <li> This + Coconut oil has kind of become our go-to​ for everything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I made my own body butter</li>
            <li> NIce quality Shea butter.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell, texture...</li>
            <li> You have to warm it up in your hands</li>
            <li> Love love love this shea butter and its so many great uses!!!</li>
            <li> When the shea butter starts to warm</li>
            <li> Packed nicely.</li>
            <li> Instead of letting my hairline,and hair continue to disappear on its own and run the risk of looking like George Jefferson, I gave in to Mother Nature and shaved my head.  </li>
            <li> Really nice shea butter.</li>
            <li> I used it to make my own lotion.</li>
            <li> I have used AAA SheaButter, Mountain Rose Herbs, Shea ScentSations by Synergistic living and this one.</li>
            <li> I have not needed to warm the butter either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The container is fairly nice, so there&#x27;s no need to repot the product.</li>
            <li> THIS SHEA BUTTER HAS A NICE SMELL, ISN&#x27;T</li>
            <li> Nice packaging and product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the quality of shea butter from Mountain Rose Herbs.</li>
            <li> I make my own whipped Shea butter mix and</li>
            <li> this kind just didn&#x27;t have the consistency.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this kind.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, she has gotten nice compliments about her skin glowing.</li>
            <li> I use a spoon to get it out of the container, and then warm it in my hands and put it on my face and body.</li>
            <li> I think it can be good to pause and let your clients integrate the work between strokes while you warm more butter in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really makes my skin feel great &amp; has helped with my eczema!</li>
            <li> I add organic coconut oil, organic argon oil, and jojoba oil to make my own body lotion.</li>
            <li> I honestly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that this was organic and contained no additives.</li>
            <li> When you warm this butter in your hands it softens and then you can apply it to the skin.</li>
            <li> Companies that follow through like that give me the warm and fuzzies.</li>
            <li> but the clumps kind of get everywhere.  </li>
            <li> and I can tell its great quality, nice and ivory, smooth with a nice nutty scent.</li>
            <li> Even better, it&#x27;s an organic and fair trade product.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to find something that is organic to use.</li>
            <li> I use it on its own.</li>
            <li> I loved how hydrating it is, but there has to be a better way!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also gives me a nice glow as well.</li>
            <li> the shea butter was when I got it - the trick is to let it warm up in your hand before rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> Now, after two weeks I have a glow and softness to my skin that my wife really finds wonderful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nicely packaged and not chunky.  </li>
            <li> I plan on using this to make my own deodorant but haven&#x27;t done it yet.</li>
            <li> So, I just kind of let it go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am just thrilled to have an alternative to chemical - laden lotions.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li> This shea butter whipped up so nicely (without softening with heat).  </li>
            <li> Really nice quality.</li>
            <li> It comes nicely packaged, too.</li>
            <li> I make my own lotions, etc.</li>
            <li> It is a bit grainy, so I just warm it up a bit on the rest of my hand before I  put it on the incision site.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own on my hands</li>
            <li> Works nice as a hand cream too.</li>
            <li> I plan on making my own body butters with it.</li>
            <li> You have to take a bit and warm it up in your hands to get it to a spreading consistency, then rub it in where you need it.</li>
            <li> to warm / spread</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product and very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li> the shea butter is wonderful &amp; now my whole family is using it</li>
            <li> I put it everywhere just on its own-- legs/arms/face.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> but if you mix it with a nice scent it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li> Honestly again.</li>
            <li> Have been using it to make lotion w/ coconut oil, and loving it.</li>
            <li> It softed up some in room temper, just had to run it under warm water to thaw it.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell, and</li>
            <li> But after a while, I  just used this on its own.  </li>
            <li> thank you again I am loving it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging for this particular product is excellent, also</li>
            <li> I love Shea butter for all sorts of home remedies and this one is excellent thanks, in large part, to the superb customer service.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product really high quality.</li>
            <li> It is high quality and smells great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for dry elbows and makes an awesome hand lotion.</li>
            <li> I know that shea butter is full of great benefits and looking foward to some of the changes I know we will see in our skin hair and nails</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product and will order more.</li>
            <li> #60;3 Is so perfect, my skin love this product so pure.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product and very fair price.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something natural and without chemicals, I&#x27;ve found an excellent mosturizer that absorbs and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and in great shape.  </li>
            <li> Great product and arrived quickly.  </li>

            <li> It applies very easy as a body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The product is very easy to use and apply.</li>

            <li> so now I have more reasons to love this product!</li>
            <li> Love, love it!</li>
            <li> love this stuff and plan on ordering more!</li>
            <li> I especially love that it is in its natural form!  </li>
            <li> Great Shea butter for use right out of the jar or making your own skin care products.</li>
            <li> It has a nice pleasant smell and it melts quickly in you</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, seems to be of very good quality.  </li>
            <li> thank you so much Molivera Organics for a very superior product.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter works much much better at the fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;The nutty smell is amazing</li>
            <li> This is, so far, the best shea butter I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> but this is the best by far.</li>
            <li> The stuff was amazing and work&#x27;s better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried and one tin lasted me years.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and consistency; keep it handy for moisturizing face and body.</li>
            <li> So far, very happy with this purchase!!!</li>
            <li> This is as good, at a lower price, and with the option of free shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> Feels smooth and luxurious, and smells good too.</li>
            <li> Love this amazing butter.  </li>
            <li> I just scrape some off of the top with my fingers and rub it in between my hands for 5 seconds and it becomes warm and spreadable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this product it is amazing</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel after nice bath.</li>
            <li> and I think making this into a lotion might penetrate the layers of the skin more effectively.  </li>
            <li> so far I&#x27;m loving it!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li> The twists come out nice and shiny and most of all when you run your hand through the twists it&#x27;s not greasy.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best.</li>
            <li> very happy with this natural solution.</li>
            <li> Molivera&#x27;s shea butter is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s amazing, I love it</li>
            <li> When applied, it gives your skin a nice glossy look (like how Beyonce&#x27;s skin looks during a sexy dance routine).</li>
            <li> Like most shea butters, you have to rub it between your fingers to warm it up</li>
            <li> It came as promised, wrapped up nice, love the label and jar.</li>
            <li> My hands, lips and nails look and feel great after using it right out of the jar.</li>
            <li> would I recommend, I strongly do!  </li>
            <li> Love it love it love it!  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love,  this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used before and this is really a fine quality exceptional product.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> Thanks for the good work!</li>
            <li> Great authentic product, and the container is so pretty!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to have good skin again and have a feeling</li>
            <li> The shea butter by itself works great, but smells great when mixed with essentials oils.</li>
            <li> Happy feet, happy me!f daily use to transform the driest skin on the tops of my feet.</li>
            <li> Just received my order and this is by far the most best Shea butter</li>
            <li> This is great quality shea butter--and such a great price.</li>
            <li> Great job guys, you really hit the nail on the head with this product!</li>
            <li> I just make sure to wear a tank under my nice shirts to be sure not to ruin them :)</li>
            <li> my first jar review was great (below), but I&#x27;ve now downgraded this product to one star.</li>
            <li> I experienced this as well when I first received it.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this, it was great.</li>
            <li> The Molivera shea butter has done wonders to soften the fine wrinkles on my face and arms!</li>
            <li> This Shea butter has made my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and not grainy.</li>
            <li> It has a very smooth texture.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and soothing.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter goes on very smooth, and it stretches well.</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s probably great stuff, but I confess to being spoiled by a first world &amp;#34;corruption&amp;#34; of shea butter which nonetheless worked better than anything I have ever tried onmy hands.  </li>
            <li> but once it gets warm it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and is definitely a superior product.</li>
            <li> This is easy to warm in palms and apply to hands but effect  </li>
            <li> wonderful, so fantastic, pure and clean, inexpensive, cost effective, wrinkle reducing, moisturizing butter.</li>
            <li> It is pure &amp; has a great color &amp; texture.</li>
            <li> Great product - truly pure and organic.</li>

            <li> Hi there, I absolutely love my shea butter</li>
            <li> and I would love to have more information about any hair restoration products you may have.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a more whipped</li>
            <li> I love using it on my lips too.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixing it with coconut oil and the combination is lovely.</li>
            <li> I worked many years as customer service rep and never like to do surveys.</li>

            <li> I gave this product a 5 because this company knows how to keep customers satisfied.</li>
            <li> (but then again lotion is mostly water anyway)</li>

            <li> It is a great natural conditioner.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic, I think I am hooked on the elaborate process of exfoliating, bathing and then slathering this all over my body.</li>
            <li> It was really looking forward to using this after all the good reviews I read.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rare trait to have that kind of customer service these days.</li>
            <li> Love love  this product, smooth, light nutty smell, just what you would want shea butter to be.</li>
            <li> Second of all, the seller emails you to make sure you received it, tells you how to use it effectively, &amp; follows up to make sure you are satisfied!</li>
            <li> it right after the shower when it is warm because the product is not creamy.</li>
            <li> This particular brand is especially wonderful because they give you amazing suggestions about numerous uses for this product!</li>
            <li> Nice product and easy to use right out of the jar.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t pleasant but seems to fade pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me since it softens nicely though from the warmth of your hand and spreads evenly over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Based on the product description and many of the reviews I read prior to making my selection and purchase I am very satisfied with my decision.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and easy!</li>
            <li> I used it in combination with other ingredients to make body butter, and it came out great!</li>
            <li> Other than that its best to melt the product on your finger tips and then pat onto your face.</li>
            <li> Molivera Organics has been wonderful with emails remind me of the benefits of this product and give me other ideas for how to use it.</li>
            <li> Compare to other Shea butter , this is the best.</li>
            <li> I am very happy I chose this product over the multitue of other shea butters out there.  </li>
            <li> So far so good easy to warm up by rubbing hands together super easy to apply on skin smell</li>
            <li> Warms in hands to spread easily.</li>
            <li> Easily melts as you apply it to your skin.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t spread easily either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the consistency and color of putty--not greasy, but still easy to rub into the skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> So easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Easy application.</li>
            <li> but I  can honestly say that I LOVE this product so much.</li>
            <li> so it scoops out easily.</li>
            <li> For one, it&#x27;s not emollient so don&#x27;t expect a creamy body butter that spreads easily over the skin.</li>
            <li> Believe me, for all the benefits it confers this is something that&#x27;s easily overcome.</li>
            <li> They do a great job in following up and offering instructions on how to get the most value from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered easy recipes to whip the shea butter into a body lotion.  </li>
            <li> My wife mixes the butter with olive oil to make it easy to rub on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Easy on and off lid.  </li>
            <li> Washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> This shea butter does not melt in my palm as easily as the L&#x27;O did and the texture is grainier.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a shea butter that is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy to melt in my hands.</li>
            <li> Seems like a good quality product, will be using it by itself &amp; as a main ingredient in lotion making</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good product and gives your skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a rancid smell (it even has a bit of a chocolate aroma to it), and I think this is the way it&#x27;s supposed to smell, but it&#x27;s strong</li>
            <li> Its something that may not affect others as strongly as it did me, but</li>
            <li> Since using Molivera Shea Butter, my face has a vibrant, healthy, again not oily but HEALTHY glow to it!  </li>
            <li> My Wife Liked it very much</li>
            <li> I just rub the very top, I can&#x27;t get much because it&#x27;s hard.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I swear by the amazing properties of Shea Butter, this is my first time getting this brand.</li>
            <li> O well, still, good stuff for normal skin care, then.</li>
            <li> an excellent help for eczema and the dark pigmentation that can come with it.</li>
            <li> When I use coconut oil, I smell divine, natural, luxurious with a light coconut scent…and my skin is off-the-charts gorgeous with a healthy glow after I apply it</li>
            <li> It instead feels like a very rich, smooth, layering the lightly sits on top of my hair and scalp until being absorbed by my skin.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy, and smells fine.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product itself is wonderful, however I can not get past the smell.  </li>
            <li> Smells fine</li>
            <li> I have replaced all my jack black products for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I have found a keeper with Molivera but will also continue with Shea ScentSations because of the added essential oils which smell amazing!</li>
            <li> This product has excellent packaging, dark to keep light out.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to use in the recipe I had and has been fantastic.</li>
            <li> Well packaged, fine product.</li>
            <li> It melts so easily on my hands and so smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li> For my peace of mind, I wish it came with a protective seal but looked and smelled fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, the texture of this shea butter is fine.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> I like the mild earthy smell to it, as opposed to the more fragrant moisturizers out there.  </li>
            <li> Love the texture and it absorbs on my skin quickly.</li>
            <li> This came so quick!  </li>
            <li> I loved how my hands felt, very soft.</li>
            <li> Plus I have so much of this that I can make more things!</li>
            <li> Amazing pure Shea butter.</li>
            <li> If you have a little kid with eczema, this is the BEST.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a different kind of body moisturizer, VERY rich!</li>
            <li> I have a huge tub of it just sitting under my counter</li>
            <li> Also want to note the container is huge, 16 oz.</li>
            <li> but this is the most effective so far.  </li>
            <li> Its smooth, I like the convenience of the jar it comes in, and its worked great in the different formulations I have used it for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough great things about this.</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera wait 5 minutes remove the excess with a damp cloth and enjoy your suppled, refreshed skin.</li>
            <li> It is light and smooth to apply.</li>
            <li> and I have felt comfortable applying on my lips.</li>
            <li> but then I enjoy the moist.</li>
            <li> Even after a nice shower, I can feel that my skin is so much snother.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my hands so well and the skin feels so smooth after the shea butter absorbs.  </li>
            <li> Says it works great but needed to actually use something from doc for the eczema he has.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non gritty and adds great moisture without the build-up.</li>
            <li> So silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Great overall transaction experience.</li>
            <li> The price for the size is fantastic too.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I will never be without for any future pregnancy.</li>
            <li> primarily I make a Paw Wax cream for my dogs</li>
            <li> I have no issue with the scent of Shea Butter, this one has a light scent.</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is so smooth.</li>
            <li> this shea butter has a nice nutty smell and is really creamy.</li>
            <li> Yes, you have to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; it in but the results are more than worth the effort.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Light scent but not offensive.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quite smooth.</li>
            <li> so that I can smooth it over my arms and legs after my shower.</li>
            <li> believe that what you put on the body is really important, as skin is the largest organ of our bodies.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s many uses, having fun experimenting with it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> So happy I finally found a cream that works.</li>

            <li> I enjoy the communication with the seller.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth your money:)</li>

            <li> love this product and will be purchasing more, there is so much you can use this for.</li>
            <li> But so far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> After much research and costly sampling of different company&#x27;s&#x27; Shea butters, this is probably the best.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to feel young.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer as far as Shea butter goes, but</li>
            <li> Really good so far as my wife bought this for herself after reading the benefits of shea butter from Stacy Kiebler in some pregnancy magazine.</li>
            <li> This is really good on my natural African-American hair.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The company really put a lot of thought into providing the best product possible.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and very useful in a rough winter.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice creamy texture and pleasant odor, and comes in a dark container to protect it from sunlight.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sticking my fingers into it, but a friend of mine dips right in and hasn&#x27;t seen any spoilage or anything, so if you aren&#x27;t a super-jerm-a-phobe that can be an option too :)&lt;</li>
            <li> Not heavy at all and really does a good job!</li>
            <li> The smell of this butter is very mild, sweet nutty.</li>
            <li> Like Franks hot sauce I put that ish on everything!!</li>
            <li> It moisturized it, allowed the dead cells to peel away with new skin , the the best part is its scar free!!  </li>
            <li> All of the on-line products were a bit gritty (otherwise very nice).  </li>
            <li> very useful oil</li>
            <li> Very fresh.  </li>
            <li> it has avery pleasant , mild -natural smell.</li>
            <li> Best raw, unrefined shea butter I&#x27;ve bought yet.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> This is so rich, so creamy --</li>
            <li> It is a great moisturizing I use it every day to moisturize my face and body, it keeps the moist all day long.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought it to combine with coconut oil, olive oil, and lavender oil for a shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> This stuff lasts a long time and feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the wait!  </li>
            <li> excited to make creams out of this</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replenish my original Shea Butter that I received as a gift.</li>
            <li> and so this can be a problem for most people however since i was aware of this before hand</li>
            <li> It definitely worth my money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited about having found the quality shea butter made by Molivera Organics.</li>
            <li> arrive fresh !</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> Perfect for winter on the Midwest, no more chapping or cracking of my skin.</li>
            <li> My first experience with Shea Butter, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product in all of my homemade beauty products to add rich, creamy texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to use it as a skin protectant during winter.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks, I have already noticed significant growth in my daughter&#x27;s hair and my husband even commented on how his hair is no longer spiking up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to use this product and make some homemade vapor rub for the family.  </li>
            <li> Love this product so much!</li>
            <li> Truly worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I was expecting this product to be a little more smoother in consistency, however it delivers great moisture without being overly oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product and can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding it a great, versatile product for extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> SUPER MOISTURIZING/USE LIGHTLY...</li>
            <li> Wow, did not expect such excellent results.  </li>
            <li> It has helped clean my skin up in a way nothing else has.</li>
            <li> Texture is amazing, makes my skin and hair feel very soft.</li>
            <li> The consistency is buttery smooth, and there is no unpleasant smell to it whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and feel so nourished and healthy!</li>
            <li> So far I love this product!</li>
            <li> Melts beautifully with other butters, oils and beeswax.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST 100% PURE natural shea butter I&#x27;ve bought to date!  </li>
            <li> First shea butter purchase, and I&#x27;m not disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very clean smell, great value and arrived here in Florida still firm even thou</li>
            <li> Great for face, baby&#x27;s bottom, dry skin you name it!</li>
            <li> Works great on dry skin, blemishes and sun burn!</li>
            <li> I liked them all but found Mountain Rose Herbs to be extremely grainy and timely to use, but will make a body butter with organic coconut oil out of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to manipulate (a solid that melts nicely in your hands and goes on smoothly).  </li>
            <li> is just right will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried something new!!</li>
            <li> This is incredible, I hesitate a little bit when I ordered it</li>
            <li> Best thing its organic and raw!</li>
            <li> It is so rich yet absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> That butter is the perfect solution for dry and sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I have just now discovered this amazing butter, and nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried before has made my skin so soft, nourished and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I first experienced this product 14 years ago when I had my hair put in braids by African women.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and goes a long way when you mix with your favorite oil and whip it</li>
            <li> I started using it myself, great for lips and rough patches.  </li>
            <li> The price is great, and my order here on Amazon was fulfilled as expected.</li>
            <li> The lip balm was a huge success--</li>
            <li> I will finish this jug and write an update about how it does after a full month.</li>
            <li> Good quality..would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> she says feel better and its really working on her face.  </li>
            <li> It is true as others say and this product lasts a while.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting the shea butter on my hands with socks at night and it&#x27;s as effective as burts bees cuticle cream and lush&#x27;s</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is 100% true shea butter.  </li>
            <li> I do not know if it is because of the cool temperature or the nature of shea butter.</li>
            <li> This is true Shea butter</li>
            <li> All comments below about how amesome this stuff is completely true.</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice soft feel to your skin.</li>
            <li> My allergist told me that I am highly sensitive to \\&quot;unnatural\\&quot; creams, body washes, soaps, shampoos, detergents (I have never used make up in my life)- anything of that kind that could come in contact with my face and irritate it.</li>
            <li> My hair loves it, my skin loves it, these are the benefits true, quality, shea butter promises and delivers.</li>
            <li> but no where near as effective as shea butter.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely 100% love it.</li>
            <li> And the more than reasonable price is a bonus.</li>
            <li> But, I have really grown to love it.  </li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t if is true or</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin nice and soft with a glow in the morning.</li>
            <li> let cool (but not completely)&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> I make my own natural body products and I am going to purchase my Shea Butter from Molivera Organics from now on.</li>
            <li> love the quality use it all the time , all the family , will buy again ,thanks</li>
            <li> and we have been loving it so far.  </li>
            <li> I have added this to my own recipe for natural hair products as well as skin care.</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t seem to absorb the sweet almond oil as I would have wished and I was going to give the oil to my massage therapist.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good quality, starts to melt in your hand but solid at room temperature.  </li>
            <li> Even though I used it in a double boiler, I found that it &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; in your hand fairly well, too, so using it on your skin and hair isn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of lotions and this seems to really help maintain a healthy balance of moisture.</li>
            <li> cool</li>
            <li> The company seems to really stand by their product and has sent me a couple of emails asking if I am satisfied while providing tips for storage.</li>
            <li> I had to throw away a nearly full jar.  </li>
            <li> Doing a good job rejuvenating her face, she&#x27;ll try it in her hair next!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving this shea butter so far.</li>
            <li> Good stuff- didn&#x27;t feel gritty as some reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> And then, when it dries, it leaves your skin feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad as some commented.</li>
            <li> Especially great for dry or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great so far, will almost certainly purchase more although we use it frequently, there is a substantial amount.  </li>
            <li> This Shea butter is so light and creamy and the price is definitely right.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter does not liquefy as easily as coconut oil, so it doesn&#x27;t exactly glide onto the skin.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty strong</li>
            <li> -- this is not a bad thing -- it means its super</li>
            <li> after reading the reviews of the other products on quality of product and packaging, I am extremely happy with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other brands to compare, but this product is really great.</li>
            <li> Works great at moisturizing toddler skin that seems not to do well with other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great used alone or as an additive to other things.</li>
            <li> It takes a little rubbing together in my hands to warm the compound and then spreads nicely over my face.  </li>
            <li> it is super official</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly and is just as described.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly as well.</li>
            <li> but it quickly melts and absorbs into the skin with body temperature.</li>
            <li> If I need more, I just take a tiny bit more as required.  </li>
            <li> When I need more I will most definitely purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s super hydrating &amp; no problems with clogging my skin.  </li>
            <li> My batch still has an earthy smokey smell but it evaporates quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting it on my pregnant tummy to help with stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> I received it quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super moisturizing</li>
            <li> I will purchase more Shea Butter from Molivera in the future! :)</li>
            <li> Smell is vey mild (no added perfumes).</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly but leaves my hands feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> recipe can be used for body or face, make sure essential oil is ok for face use</li>
            <li> I saw no difference in my stretch marks, the smell is a bit overwhelming, however it leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> So far it has been the best money I have spent.</li>
            <li> i am pregnant and use this stuff to combat hormonal acne and stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Even better is that it&#x27;s all natural and free from chemicals</li>
            <li> We love it and will be buying more regularly.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t mind the mild smell.</li>
            <li> This is helping with my sons eczema tremendously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5 months pregnant</li>
            <li> I use it as a lotion for my skin everyday and it is very soothing and smells wonderfully!</li>
            <li> This particular brand (Molivera) was lovely.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into my skin and hair and leaves it moisturized for days.</li>
            <li> It warms quickly in my hands and dissolves into a salve-like cream that absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It does seem a bit grainy at the beginning, but all of that melts out quickly when I rub it into the palm of my hands.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used several brands and have decided that Molivera is the most satisfying.</li>
            <li> This is a Super Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It spread quickly with the warmth of my hands and the texture became smoother.  </li>
            <li> Came in mail quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for my newly developed locs and I also started applying it to my face and have been surprised by the results.</li>
            <li> I love it, and will definitely purchase again when I need more.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s feet have eczema, I have used coconut oil on them for more than one month, they&#x27;re getting better but not totally recovered.</li>
            <li> I researched several different companies, and found this to be the best one for me.</li>
            <li> In about 1 week of using this my sons akin has softened and healed tremendously.</li>
            <li> Mine is a little grainy, but as others have noted, once you put some in your hand and rub it between your hands it melts beautifully and the grainy quality disappears.</li>
            <li> highly recommended and I will be purchasing more as soon as I run out.</li>
            <li> Love this, it&#x27;s a high quality, orangic and non-gmo.  </li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth and leaves the skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but I don&#x27;t want to be overpowered by it</li>
            <li> This was an exciting find for me and has proven true to its word.</li>
            <li> It has a &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; smell to it (not unpleasant at all)</li>
            <li> I prefer unscented pure shea butter, and this spreads easily at room temperature.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s real and raw and is wonderfully nourishing for skin!!!!  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for good raw shea butter, you will be pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It melts very easy in your palms when rubbed together and does not clump up, glides on smoothly, jar will last forever.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so happy that it&#x27;s actually worked, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love my new products, and I will order again.</li>
            <li> My hands get irritated easily and this really helps.  </li>
            <li> It melts easy and it leaves my skin very hydrated .I</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to many perfumes and lotions.  </li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to many perfumes and lotions have not had any problems with this product.</li>
            <li> I will definitely get some more when I run out!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed to make my lotions!</li>
            <li> I love this product so far!</li>
            <li> I will be back to buy more!</li>
            <li> Once it runs out, I will definitely be getting more!</li>
            <li> Thanks again Molivera!!</li>
            <li> I felt when it is first applied to wanting to use it again!  </li>
            <li> Seller was exemplary and shipping was prompt, thanks!!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li> I used to use coconut oil and vit E oils at night to help hydrate and breath new life into my skin and although they were great, the hydration seemed very short term.</li>
            <li> So far, I am super pleased with this shea butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought some shea butters in the past that were grainy and smelled a tad bit strong, but this is amazing!</li>
            <li> my 72 year old skin felt very smooth.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, ivory raw shea butter.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is attractive enough to leave out for easy access and I&#x27;ve found myself using it several times a day - for hands, body, feet, face and hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect creamy raw shea butter, normally I end up with some grit in my unrefined shea butter</li>
            <li> Great texture, it takes a little bit to get used to the smell, but the benefits worth it.</li>
            <li> If you want an amazing facial mask  mix the Shea butter with the 99% percent</li>
            <li> Also, the company has great customer service and emailed me in reference to see how I felt about the product a few weeks after I received it.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of natural beauty and cruelty free items.  </li>
            <li> I have a love/hate relationship with ingredient labels as most things marked &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; include many ingredients that I can&#x27;t pronounce and appear to be anything but natural.</li>
            <li> This product from Molivera has been amazing its simple and nourishing.  </li>
            <li> One of the most amazing products I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon and the only product I&#x27;ve written about thus far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hydrating, soothing, and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I blended mine with coconut oil and lavender essential oil in my food processor and it made an amazing body butter.</li>
            <li> and you can always add your own fragrance if you want with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of using natural ingredients for my skin care products.</li>
            <li> Fresh.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> well worth the purchase</li>
            <li> Received product promptly and I love how soft my skin feels.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this product so far.</li>
            <li> I seems to melt into your skin better than my old product.</li>
            <li> I love how it is all natural as I don&#x27;t use any products with petroleum.</li>
            <li> i had also ordered some rose oil that i mixed into my butter and this helped alot</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own lotions, mixing with coconut oil and essential oils.</li>
            <li> I love to put it on at night and then early in the morning.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It may take awhile to put on but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I put it on after taking a warm shower which open up the pores.</li>
            <li> However at the end of the day from using it in the morning.....my skin is so soft :)</li>
            <li> I was told by a fellow co-worker that it is one of the best remedies for tired, aching, and cracked feet.</li>
            <li> Fantastic moisturizer - well worth the money and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much smell with this brand brand either, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered it to make my own deodorant, but also tried it on my hands.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes the skin feel soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li> I wish you much success and God&#x27;s Blessings.</li>
            <li> For those looking for a natural alternative to oils/lotions/cremes for massage, something that is healing for the skin and offers therapeutic benefits, and is great to work with in terms of glide-ability, I highly recommend this shea butter!  </li>
            <li> I have tried many others in the market and none compares to the quality this one offers.</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff nothing like a natural product that does what it says plus some.</li>
            <li> Love it so far.</li>
            <li> but Ivory Shea Butter is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows what a fresh burn looks like.</li>
            <li> I have just started using it, but I am pleased so far.</li>
            <li> I love the natural smell and feel of this product.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to put olive oil on my legs, it leaves my skin soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I plan on mixing with coconut oil and an essential oil and make my own fragrances.  </li>
            <li> will be ordering more soon.hands and feet leaving them soft.  </li>
            <li> I plan on mixing with coconut oil and an essential oil and make my own fragrances.  </li>
            <li> I put this on my CHEST AND BACK, two areas I&#x27;ve suffered with breakouts during my teens and as an adult and it has greatly improved my skin to the point I rarely ever have one breakout ANYWHERE on my body.  </li>
            <li> Works great as an essential all natural ingredient for making my homemade deodorant which I found on Dr. Josh Axe&#x27;s webpage.  </li>
            <li> I love body butter with shea butter in it, so I thought why not use the natural Shea butter instead of the added extras in the body butter.</li>
            <li> The tips are useful.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> Love the natural smell and feel.</li>
            <li> excellent product the lid was broken in shipping but the jar stayed sealed ...</li>
            <li> So far, I love it.</li>
            <li> So far I have purchased 2 tubs, and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> My processed version is many years old, and now it has a stickier consistency and &amp;#34;dead&amp;#34; scent (like petroleum jelly with particles).  </li>
            <li> It works great on dry skin and better yet on stretch marks (new AND old ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They were very interested in know if I was happy with my purchase and if they could help in any way if I was not satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several other brands before but this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see myself going back to regular lotion, this makes my skin feel so good!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s pure high quality unrefined shea butter</li>
            <li> Like most original butters its a bit hard but easily melts in your palms for easy application on body or hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Either the price went way up, or I got the original tin as a gift as I couldn&#x27;t imagine paying that much again.)</li>
            <li> Really good for chapped hands this winter, among other things.</li>
            <li> Using this to treat babies Excema.... Seems good so far...like the texture as it is softer than some other brands.</li>
            <li> Feels just right.  </li>
            <li> Smoothed them right out.</li>
            <li> but it soaks right into the skin.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is just the right consistency.</li>
            <li> I also use a bit after I wash my hair and right before blowdrying as a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It arrived right away.</li>
            <li> Just right for skin.  </li>
            <li> So you damn right its a product that works.</li>
            <li> You can literally feel the healing right away.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because the price was right</li>
            <li> I have only had this product two full weeks, but I love it and have gotten my sister</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like lotion where it comes out really easily, but it&#x27;s soft enough that if you rub your fingers in it to warm it up you&#x27;ll get what you need.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very subtle and the texture is perfect.</li>
            <li> Very pure shea butter</li>
            <li> It seems very pure.  </li>
            <li> The best thing I have found is that it really helps seal the moisture into my skin, especially on my feet which get very dry and cracked during Rocky Mountain winters.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower as a skin conditioner and it works incredibly well not only for dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is still getting better and better and less bumpy.</li>
            <li> and you can tell nothing was added due to the scent being light and mild unlike so many others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent so much money on designer creams that work, but this really does a surprisingly great job at moisturizing and evening skin tone.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different brands of shea butter, and by far this is the best one I have found!</li>
            <li> Let me say Molivera and Amazon were fantastic about resolving the problem and following up with communication, and by the third time, I received my shea butter in good condition.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure about the &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; properties, but it seems to be a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> There are no bad chemicals added so I don&#x27;t have to worry about absorbing anything toxic.  </li>
            <li> Smells very earthy but not bad.</li>
            <li> only problem is its original smell, as its a product derived from nuts it has a strong nutty smell</li>
            <li> It smells like Shea Butter again comparing it to the other ones I have tried but this one its much softer and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Will certainly be a repeat customer!  </li>
            <li> After buying this from Molivera Organics, I received an email thanking me for my order, but also giving me tips and tricks on the use and expectations of pure Shea Butter!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing moisturizing for dry skin in the winter and sun parched skin in the summer.</li>
            <li> Super hydrating, not sticky at all, absorbs very well.</li>
            <li> She appreciated my inquisitiveness and kind words pertaining to the item and gave me a coupon for my next order of the Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Thick, smooth consistency seems like good stuff.</li>
            <li> Shea Butter is really good makes your skin smooth and moisturized, but it is really thick.</li>
            <li> Delivery was super fast and the product is legit.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent although much harder than I expected.  </li>
            <li> so far ive used it a couple days and love how much it has moisturized the skin on my face.</li>
            <li> so far the product is great and came exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Molivera has sent me a few emails  to check in to make sure I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have suffer sensitive skin all my entire life and nothing has felt as good as this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It goes on very shiny and almost greasy (it absorbs quickly though)</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are many more complicated recipes, but I used a very easy one.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> These amazing healing properties have shown great success in treating various skin problems such as wrinkles, blemishes, skin allergies, eczema, and other skin conditions.</li>
            <li> This really helps keep the incision site flexible and I very much appreciate that!</li>
            <li> It is far SUPERIOR in quality to the top selling &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; brand of Shea Butter from L&#x27;Occitane, which I have used for the past 15 years.</li>
            <li> This is the first thing I&#x27;ve found that works super fast.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> The shipping on this was very fast.  </li>
            <li> and so it is very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> really any other good body oil&lt;</li>
            <li> I have used it as a face moisturizer and my face is super, super soft.</li>
            <li> Spreads fairly easily and the smell is gently, not too strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little oily feeling at first, but once it absorbs into your skin, it really feels amazing!</li>
            <li> and so far I am very satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend it if you are looking for an all natural moisturizer</li>
            <li> I have tried other Shea butters which were good, but this brand has soothed my super sensitive skin like nothing I have tried before (I have tried a plethora of products).</li>
            <li> I rather smell pure natural Shea butter than lotion full of synthetic fragrance!</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t worry about that when you first try it.</li>
            <li> AND if you find you just cant stand it, add a pinch of your favorite essential oil to it and that is all</li>
            <li> I will certainly be back for more.</li>
            <li> Has worked well for us,and have been able to find several uses for it.</li>
            <li> The representative promptly answered my questions and was very polite!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I used this on my whole body including my hair and it has works wonders for split ends!</li>
            <li> To be the first week of usage</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever purchased something like this.</li>
            <li> It truly is the BEST way to moisturize and a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> Consistent product - I&#x27;ve ordered several times :)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed using this product with my essential oils.  </li>
            <li> but I realized If I rub my  hands together till they are hot then place the Shea butter in my hands</li>
            <li> Can feel the difference as soon as I apply the first time.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> Plus it helped to fade marks from my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li> This was my first shea butter product</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I mixed some of this with some Lavender essential oil and it makes a nice salve!</li>
            <li> I put it on my face the first time I used it and had to wipe it off around my nose</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> What I love about this stuff is that not only does it moisturize but it helps provide vitamins and omegas to my skin</li>
            <li> I recently went through my vanity and gave away most of my face and body moisturizers and creams....</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Mixing with other oils (Jojoba and Coconut oils) to make a healthy lotion!</li>
            <li> My head feels so soft and smooth to the touch, just like a baby’s bottom…</li>
            <li> This shea butter is much easier to use!</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I didnt think I was going to like this at first.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what the label says.  </li>
            <li> I lucked up and made my first choice in a Molivera product which will now be my go to place for Shea Butter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So glad I ordered this product and the size of it will last me awhile.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Natural hair and skin care are so important to me.</li>
            <li> Customer service really concerned about your satisfaction!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I love Shea butter and use it regularly.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of product but so far smooth.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended !!</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of shea butter.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I would definitely  recommend this product. :)</li>
            <li> Overall, I love it and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it is unrefined and has no additives, it is in more of a solid state.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more once I run out.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t help but do review on this product because it was instant love for it.</li>
            <li> Better then any liquid eye makeup remover I used, and moisturizes at the same time.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying shea.</li>
            <li> My first introduction to Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think anything exists that truly erases stretch marks, but this makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use it consistently after I shower.  </li>
            <li> it makes your skin sooo soft &amp; smooth...</li>
            <li> It is a personal favorite.</li>
            <li> It actually penetrates into the skin and doesn&#x27;t just sit on the top layer of your skin.</li>
            <li> but I stopped at my calves once I realized it wasn&#x27;t going to absorb into my skin like the first jar.</li>
            <li> My first time with this brand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had experience with refined Shea Butter and you can for sure tell that this is actually organic.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is the first time we tried shea butter</li>
            <li> We have been applying shea butter mixed with olive oil to his skin and we are pleased with its effects.  </li>
            <li> From the first application I could tell there was a difference.</li>
            <li> I have used this several times and I love it.</li>
            <li> As a first time buyer of Molivera Organics Ivory Shea Butter, my apprehensiveness was muted as I smelled and felt the goodness of this product.</li>
            <li> but there absolutely is!</li>
            <li> I bought it to try on my 9 year olds exzema and after the first use I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I love how it stays moist on your face the entire day.</li>
            <li> First off there is the smell.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using Shea Butter</li>
            <li> I really appreciate them!</li>
            <li> Many months later,  I have to say this is a gift that keeps on giving.</li>
            <li> I have tried different brands of Shea Butter and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Company also follows up nicely, I am sure if things weren&#x27;t just as they should be they would go above and beyond to fix things.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and literally melts in your hands when you put it on your body!</li>
            <li> And, it is very obvious that Molivera Organics values their customers and views customer satisfaction as a top priority.</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> I use it with my scented creams and it goes on smooth and keeps my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have tried this product.  </li>
            <li> Overall, for the price, the product is ok.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t care for the smell, but I wanted something without added scent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizes my skin really well, and since I have eczema, I&#x27;m sensitive to many products.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of this brand of Shea Butter from this vendor.  </li>
            <li> since I got two jars on the first order.  </li>
            <li> First, I received a product that appeared used.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m left with the softest, smoothest, most glorious skin ever.  </li>
            <li> I have already used most of the container, I&#x27;ll definitely be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> And i felt like I was going to get stretch marks even though I did not get any with my first child (born in september).  </li>
            <li> Thanks Molivera!</li>
            <li> It has made my skin incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with my first order.  </li>
            <li> Smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be busying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit in your hair can help give it a healthy shine, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nourishing and it makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Shea Butter and did my research on what to look for</li>
            <li> Though the top of the shea butter jar had been closed, ants  had completely covered the top of the contents.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m definitely planning on purchasing more in the future :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even better if you melt it and add carrier oil and essential oils.</li>
            <li> This was my first go at buying Shea butter</li>
            <li> I find that I like to put this on first (lips, elbows, feet) and</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I use it to make lotions and this is my first time using this brand.</li>
            <li> My first time using shea butter to help moisturize and treat my excema ridden hands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the computer for a large part of the day and really appreciate having a product that dries so quickly (and works so well).</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of using a single, pure ingredient moisturizer (just like food..</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those of you used to using the higher end French brands, I&#x27;ll warn you that the raw and unrefined products have a more gritty feeling to them at first, but as soon as they make contact with your warm skin, they melt 100% without any kind of residual particles.</li>
            <li> The dry winter has really worked my hands and feet over, but I think this product will help ease me in to summer quite nicely.  </li>
            <li> Great service, as usual!</li>
            <li> I mixed the Shea Butter with other oils to make my own body butter, and my skin has never felt better.  </li>
            <li> I live in a climate that is on the cool side and the temperature is often in the 60&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> But, my favorite thing about this product is by far the fact that it has completely cleared up my skin!</li>
            <li> Have been using it on my face and it hasn&#x27;t been greasy at all which is a pleasant surprise since I usually have oily skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very soft and full of body.</li>
            <li> i am also impressed by the company-they keep me informed about he product, and they were extremely helpful and quick to solve a small problem with my order.  </li>
            <li> This is very pure product, and very comforting for my skin.</li>
            <li> Using this with my essential oils for more pure products for my body.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get any more pure or simple than this Ivory Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> Honestly I purchased this for my girlfriend due to her pregnancy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m waiting on other products to use this to make my own soap, shaving cream, etc...</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a super rich moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, because I am constantly cleaning</li>
            <li> I am currently stationed overseas, but I ordered this and sent it home for when I come back--I&#x27;m excited to use it in my chapsticks and lotions!</li>
            <li> This is the REAL Deal, it is pure and unrefined, therefore it contains all of the &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; healing properties of Shea!  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;Occitane product feels more refined as it has a smoother texture out of the jar than the Molivera, but the skin care results are much the same.</li>
            <li> I have used this in many different ways, to make lotion, hair treatments, medicinal ointments and creams, and just straight out of the jar.</li>
            <li> It is much thicker than most processed, mixed ingredient body butters</li>
            <li> It takes a tiny bit of effort to create a smooth &#x27;paste&#x27; for lathering but its worth it.</li>
            <li> A very itchy rash on my arm felt better and the redness is already disappearing on the second day.  </li>
            <li> then like to layer something else (lotion, lip balm) on top to really moisturize deep.</li>
            <li> I purchased a different brand that was certified pure by the American Shea Butter Institute and had remarkable results, so much so, that my sister-in-law with chronic eczema also bought some.</li>
            <li> First time to use pure Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> Its so pure and easy to mix with so many other carrier/ essential oils and make your own facial products.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin including some mild eczema on the side of my face.</li>
            <li> Smooth, and Creamy... a little struggle to lotion in and take out the jar but overall a good product.</li>
            <li> For my hair, I rub a little in my hands and warm it first, then I just rub it on the fluffiest parts of my hair first, and then work to the ends and then the scalp.</li>
            <li> It took about a week to start see the positive effects.  </li>
            <li> Wanted to try it out because of all of the benefits and positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Maybe its benefits are great, but the smell is not good.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, helps heal skin and gets rid of dark spots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much a pain to apply.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the quality and though it seems very buttery on skin at first it melts into your skin and</li>
            <li> Its a GREAT product to experiment with by adding other oils ( essential oils, organic grapeseed oil ect )</li>
            <li> While I had used many other products that contained shea butter (refined) and knew that I liked it in general, I was looking for something that was all natural.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I truly love this product and foresee using it perpetually.</li>
            <li> All you need to do is put some of this in the palm of your hand, place your other hand over it and gently rub your hands together, and it turns into a nice spreadable liquid within 15 to 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Pretty much a lifetime supply of shea butter.  </li>
            <li> I bought some all natural essential oils (tea tree, lavender, rosemary, mint, rose, eucalyptus) to mix in as I feel every morning after I shower and these work really well.</li>
            <li> And who wouldn&#x27;t want to use all natural products on their kids over the chemical full lotions sold in the store.</li>
            <li> Very good product and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for dry hair and scalp and it&#x27;s so soothing for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I also melted some down to make my own deodorant.</li>
            <li> Usually, the pure Shea butter doesn&#x27;t smell all that good.</li>
            <li> Also trying on my baby stretch marks, maybe it can work a little magic there too!</li>
            <li> this product is amazing, I have been using it for less than a week</li>
            <li> It has a mild nutty scent and leaves me feeling soft all day.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin super soft.  </li>
            <li> The skin feels super soft.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and I can&#x27;t believe this keeps my skin hydrated for 8 hours or more.</li>
            <li> Makes skin super soft.</li>
            <li> Melted easily and smell was not detectable after heating, mixing and adding essential oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep looking for better dry skin solution.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, made my baby&#x27;s diaper rash disappear in 48 hours and the dry skin in my hands gone over night..</li>
            <li> I use it mostly on my lips because they get so dry at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought white, ultra-processed shea butter, and I&#x27;ve had grainy cream-colored product that had a strong smell.</li>
            <li> do let my clients know that it can feel a bit greasy on the skin and takes a little while to soak in, so for those who don&#x27;t want that, I use an oil or creme that soaks in more quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;coating&amp;#34; on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I use more before turning in for the night, right after showers or after gardening, scrubbing pots/pans, or any other task that really does a number on my hands.</li>
            <li> It is certainly the pure Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> so I like knowing that this product is pure Shea butter &amp; has no chemicals added.</li>
            <li> Seems like quite a liberal amount for the price, and I like that it is pure Shea butter without anything added.</li>
            <li> I have used pure shea butter before but nothing of this quality.</li>
            <li> The pure form heals without itching.</li>
            <li> I believe that this one is pure.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try pure shea butter even though it&#x27;s a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> I use it with the Life-Flo Oil, Pure Almond, 16 Ounce.</li>
            <li> This is mine after two weeks on the pure Shea butter.  </li>
            <li> Obviously pure unrefined Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I chose this brand because it was the cheapest pure shea butter that I could find that was eligible for prime, and I do not regret it.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try PURE, unrefined Shea butter</li>
            <li> Because of its purity it doesn&#x27;t contain any certain added fragrance.</li>
            <li> Also, I think it&#x27;s makIng a large brown spot on my face fade.</li>
            <li> just pure shea butter&lt;</li>
            <li> Decided to order the Shea Butter based on the positive reviews and very grateful that I did.  </li>
            <li> trying it now for a few weeks, I am in love!  </li>
            <li> like rubbing cream mixed with fine bits of sand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> definitely coming back to get more when its over!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used shea butter before, but this product seems to be very high quality.</li>
            <li> I wanted the real deal and got it; pure, unrefined, not-messed-about-with shea butter.</li>
            <li> This pure shea butter is really concentrated.  </li>
            <li> It is pure Shea Butter and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Absorbs fast and keeps our skin looking fresh &amp; healthy, soft, helping w/ dry skin &amp; wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Some shea butter come gritty, so far this product is very smooth.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d found the very product I needed for dry hair until the morning I went into my bathroom and was greeted by a vanity top filled with tiny ants.  </li>
            <li> Imagine baby soft, well pedicured, pretty feet every day!</li>
            <li> Thanks for keeping it so simple and natural, so I can experiment adding my own natural ingredients or use it alone!</li>
            <li> I like the smokey nutty scent, not a heavy smell, just a  pure and fresh.</li>
            <li> I put a little on a saucer and put it in the toaster oven on 115 to warm while I am getting ready.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality and reasonable price for quantity.  </li>
            <li> texture is very thick, and it takes a minute or so on your skin to warm up and smooth out.</li>
            <li> mixed up an ounce of this butter with a little almond oil from the same company (seems to be wonderful stuff)</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> It definitely makes a huge difference in it.</li>
            <li> This is such a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> It really stays on your skin and doesn&#x27;t evaporate, so my thirsty skin really gets the treatment it needs.</li>
            <li> Perhaps those reviewers haven&#x27;t really purchased something like this before</li>
            <li> Bought it hopes that it&#x27;d help my psoriasis, it didn&#x27;t really.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I really like this organic shea butter.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to worry about absorbing chemicals through your skin.  </li>
            <li> I use on whole body after shower.</li>
            <li> They are really helpful.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent service and helpful tips.</li>
            <li> but it seemed to heal much faster with the butter.  </li>
            <li> Very nutty.</li>
            <li> It really does work wonders.</li>
            <li> it really is.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel it leaves as much of a residue on my clothes, either.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really used it that much.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied.product was just as advertised.</li>
            <li> the real deal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell either.  </li>
            <li> With that being said not on to the product, I really like it.  </li>
            <li> My whole family loves it.</li>
            <li> Ivory Shae cream is the real thing.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It is nothing like a coconut butter which is much smoother.  </li>
            <li> A real value.</li>
            <li> The packaging is of high quality too!  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Although it works as advertised, it has a much stronger nutty smell than the ivory shea butter.</li>
            <li> I have not broken out at all-</li>
            <li> This shea butter was better than expected.</li>
            <li> Received this amazingly fast.</li>
            <li> so I scrape out a a lot and place it on my skin to smooth out and the texture is gritty....</li>
            <li> I really like this shea butter</li>
            <li> and I can tell it works very well.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, not gritty.</li>
            <li> Just give it extra time to sink into the skin, makeup will go on smooth.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the product, there isn&#x27;t much at this time to say about it.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely convinced by this butter.</li>
            <li> , that is very itchy.</li>
            <li> I love,love,love it so much</li>
            <li> and it was delivered so fast i will be ordering from this company again</li>
            <li> It really softens them.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My belly seldom itched thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> Firat time I can say real Shea butter.</li>
            <li> you molivera  for selling real Shea butter</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, and living in the desert, I have to say it really is a pleasure to use after a day hike.</li>
            <li> I just got the shea butter, in a very timely manner for living overseas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unusual</li>
            <li> and it has made a real difference.</li>
            <li> I use it on my whole body and face.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Very noticeable difference.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I put it on my whole body before I go to bed - face and hair included.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> High quality Shea butter!</li>
            <li> I will absolutely order this product again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was concerned the shea butter will make my face breakout, I have very oily and acne prone skin and using this product has not caused any pimples...</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> packaging too, and it&#x27;s a plastic jar, which makes it easier when transporting haha.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Molivera Organics Shea Butter!</li>
            <li> Lied it so much</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s VERY GRAINY and doesn&#x27;t melt into the skin at all.</li>
            <li> that really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> but this is just so much</li>
            <li> You just have to rub it together in your hand really well before putting it in your hair</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> nothing was really helping.</li>
            <li> (I have very oily skin) before bed as an evening cream.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for myself and everyone In the family household is using it and its going so fast</li>
            <li> Absorbs very well into the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very grainy...</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think there was going to b a difference between products</li>
            <li> I have moisturized my whole life but age is age.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter came highly recommended to me and it has been life changing!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> , I put it every \5 days straight......</li>
            <li> His skin is so much softer.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really use it.</li>
            <li> I believe that coconut and olive oil is much easier to apply than the shea butter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disapointed.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t smell it nearly as much.</li>
            <li> Item arrived fast from seller.  </li>
            <li> I applied it to my skin, and because it was so much softer</li>
            <li> I have been using, and this product has really been helping.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast</li>
            <li> I had a delivery issue, and they took care of it really fast and courteously.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend buying from this company.</li>
            <li> The sender also provided information on this product via e-mail, which is much appreciated.  </li>
            <li> and it works very well.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing, but not overly greasy.  </li>
            <li> It really is the smoothest, creamiest shea butter I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This is real shea butter.</li>
            <li> I really like that the seller sent me some tips on using it too.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten so much use out of this product it blows my mind.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> Molivera Organics also checked-in with me to see how I was doing with the product, a level of customer care and concern that I appreciated.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> However, the item works very well for the purpose for which it was purchased.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for any skeptics!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It works very well, but is greasy</li>
            <li> My skin is very acne-prone and this does not make me break out at all.  </li>
            <li> This shea butter works really well as an aftershave balm.</li>
            <li> I used it in a recipe for lip balm with my niece and nephew and son, and also for very cracked/chapped feet and hands.  </li>
            <li> skin is much softer and smoother!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> It was purchased for my hair and skin, but it&#x27;s too much of a hassle.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I tend to forget to use it with my EO recipes and use it straight out of the jar.</li>
            <li> Absolutely adore this product.</li>
            <li> and I have not broken out once</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> and it is not greasy, absorbs well, odorless and does not wash out fast.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and soothing.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy using this on my hair and definitely recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I used it in a hair mask and it left my hair incredibly soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get it soft enough to use, I want to like it more..</li>
            <li> Overall the seller is good, item arrived sooner than I expected, and item was as described.</li>
            <li> Keeps in solid form, but heat from your hands is enough to warm it up.</li>
            <li> The skin near my nails is quite sensitive to chemicals in most hand moisturizers, and have found only a couple or so brands that are made for sensitive skin and that i liked enough to keep using.</li>
            <li> I have asian skin that is used to warm, humid, tropical environments, so living in Michigan with the heater constantly on dries the heck out of me.</li>
            <li> So I used it to make my own lotion which i added essential oils, and coconut oil, and a tiny bit of bee wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only started using this (about 2 days now) and have whipped it up with coconut oil and an essential oil to make my own body butter.</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive skin and eczema, and this raw shea butter seems to be good for my skin.</li>
            <li> It is sooooooooo soft!!!</li>
            <li> Butter has a very high &amp;#34;healing fraction&amp;#34;, up to 12% of the butter’s make-up (more than any other type of seed oil).</li>
            <li> I live in the Caribbean where it&#x27;s hot ALL the time</li>
            <li> A little really does does a long way and the sellers really go above and beyond to ensure you receive, store and get the best results from their product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and my skin has never felt better, I also use it on my nails and they&#x27;ve gotten stronger and are looking lovely.</li>
            <li> Yellow butter is from a different type of an African tree which has very similar qualities of Shea, but is not the same.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, as I love natural cosmetics that smell natural and are not perfumed.</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff , Amazing is not good enough to describe it</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, which is great if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
            <li> After researching the benefits of Shea butter I have found it replaces so many other products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of shea butter but have not been as pleased w/ their performance.</li>
            <li> Make sure you rub it in well by putting a blob on your palm and rub in circular motion with your fingers on the other hand.</li>
            <li> I bought it to mix it with other oils so for now it&#x27;s in the jar, as soon as I use more of this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using other brands of shea butter for years and love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found some other organic Shea Butter I like better now.</li>
            <li> It is a bit grainy, as other reviewers have said, but most of it melts as soon as you put it on your skin.</li>
            <li> Have used other forms of the &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; shea butter and really love this one.  </li>
            <li> Ordered many Shea butter products from other companies.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes better than all the other lotions I ever brought.</li>
            <li> i usually mix it with honey and scented essential oils to make it more appealing.</li>
            <li> can mix it with other oils to mask that and make it more viscous.  </li>
            <li> Better than the other shea butter brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> other Reviewers had better luck.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought Shea butter from other companies and it was much better.</li>
            <li> So I highly recommend this product to many with dry skin eczema or normal skin.</li>
            <li> do like Shea butter, but not liking the texture of this raw unrefined kind....</li>
            <li> For a few dollars more I get 3 times as much!</li>
            <li> First, this was a hassle free purchase and arrived exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizes all day long, legs look amazing the next day!</li>
            <li> I use it daily on my head, face, and body, and it&#x27;s given my skin a clean, radiant glow.</li>
            <li> If you leave it in warm water long enough it will even liquefy.</li>
            <li> While it is thick and can be greasy at first, my skin nicely absorbs it.</li>
            <li> and i was happy when i saw it was ivory in color and not white or yellow as this is proof its pure and unprocessed.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s a great buy because a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I love coconut oil and use it daily on my girls and I, but needed something a little more creamier and thicker that was all natural that wouldn&#x27;t break out my two-month-old and my 2 1/2 year-old skin</li>
            <li> wish I could get back the wasted money I spent on subpar skin products that probably did more harm than good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything special about this product yet especially for my sun spots or damage etc</li>
            <li> My skin has been dry and flaky since we&#x27;ve had the heater on and this works better to keep my skin soft than any creams or lotions I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have been trying natural products for over two years to test what works to heal my super cracked, inflamed and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The other thing that I love is that is sourced responsibly, that was one of the major selling points for me on my first purchase.  </li>
            <li> I am very new to this Shea Butter thing.....</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my biracial daughters skin feel and it works great on her hair, it&#x27;s just so thick and hard to put on.</li>
            <li> Great product use it everyday in my hair because it is so dry it keeps it soft and moisturized from the hot sun</li>
            <li> It goes on pretty smoothly and melts easier than other brands.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use it in my daughter&#x27;s extra dry hair for moisture, but it is also amazing to use on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it comes in a dark jar with a lid.</li>
            <li> I love the way shea softens my skin, makes it glow,  and it seems to be fading dark spots on my hands and ankles.</li>
            <li> : I should mention that it took one full month of daily use to transform the driest skin on the tops of my feet.</li>
            <li> Or just warm a small scoop in your hands and slather all over.</li>
            <li> While the promises of healing minor scrapes and scratches hasn&#x27;t really panned out for me, I do think it is a great product that keeps skin tight and soft with continued use.</li>
            <li> I had found some local shea butter in smaller amounts that was very smooth on my lips, so thought I would buy some online.  </li>
            <li> The sad part about it was that when I dug underneath the grainy top surface, (because it melted in the mailer), the rest of it was soft, clean, and smooth.</li>
            <li> Down through the years, I have purchased MANY Shea Butters.  </li>
            <li> and I live it!</li>
            <li> I will be having to buy a new one soon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that it would be useful for other things, but it left my skin feeling so oily!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s made a huge difference with my chronic dry skin and assisting in the reduction of scare discoloration.</li>
            <li> The smell and texture are much better than the previous brand I bought from a  well known source to people who buy health products.  </li>
            <li> however I absolutely love this product and will only use this on my face and body especially my feet...</li>
            <li> have kids, so I&#x27;m last on the list for many things, which is really no big deal!  </li>
            <li> My questions were mainly about the purity of the product.</li>
            <li> It is solid but melts quickly between your hands when rubbed together.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t particularly like the smell of shea butter, so</li>
            <li> Second, I&#x27;d gladly trade all the fancy creamy lotions that I&#x27;ve used over the years for this one product as it&#x27;s the only one</li>
            <li> I love that this comes in a MASSIVE amount, so I know it&#x27;s going to last for a while.</li>
            <li> Use mainly on hands and body after showering and plan on using it with conditioner when I shampoo my hair.</li>
            <li> I debated whether to purchase shea butter from this particular company.</li>
            <li> As compared the butter that I used before, it is definitely more grainy, however very similar in overall consistency and nutty smell.</li>
            <li> I will get much more out of a product that I will use regularly, even though it might not meet a purist&#x27;s standards, than I will out of a product that I will likely avoid because of its scent.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li> This product actually helped clear up my skin and has kept it looking dewy and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this, and even though this jar will last me several more months I am purchasing another for when/if I run out</li>
            <li> As I am getting older</li>
            <li> I use this on my face (mainly at night), lips, body, and hair.</li>
            <li> It is very hydrating and, so far, not irritating</li>
            <li> Thank you folks for finally making a product I have known all my life but thought it was just for pregnant women etc</li>
            <li> I personally am not bothered by its mild scent at all.</li>
            <li> job requires me to wash my hands again and again, and then on top of weight lifting ripping my hands up I also work a second job at a car wash which my hands are constantly getting wet.&lt;br /&gt;*Most</li>
            <li> This seller follows up with emails, so direct contact information is available if necessary.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to moisturize decently but I purchased this to help treat my infant&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick - not eligible for prime two day shipping but as soon as I got the email notification I received product the same day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very surprised of how well and fast it works.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and thanks to this product</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very soft!</li>
            <li> Should last a long time as you only need to use sparingly for good results.</li>
            <li> The local one I bought (much more expensive) was very smooth right aways</li>
            <li> The texture is so nice and smooth (unlike some other organic raw shea butter brands I&#x27;ve used).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> High quality product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to anyone needing shea butter</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you try this.</li>
            <li> I highly recomment the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my go to for now, and based on my experience I can highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: highly recommended... &#x60;</li>
            <li> but it is undeniably high quality shea butter.</li>
            <li> and I decided to try this brand since it packaged the product in a jar and had high ratings.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used high end products and serums from high end dept. stores</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> High quality, even if it is unrefined.  </li>
            <li> high quality shea butter.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this Shea Butter to any and everyone, no matter the skin type.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Having some first-hand knowledge of the cocoa plant and it&#x27;s fruit, I can highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Quality of butter feels high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> But for those with dry skin, most of them really like the shea butter, and will actually leave it on the rest of the day to let it soak in and &amp;#34;do its thing&amp;#34; before showering it off.and &amp;#34;do its thing&amp;#34; before showering it off.</li>
            <li> There is no fragrant odor just pure and natural</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter...feels a little grainy but its doing wonders on my sons ezcema</li>
            <li> And I can even put it on my face which is usually sensitive to everything!!</li>
            <li> I am still a little shiny, but I haven&#x27;t discovered a better way to apply.  </li>
            <li> Also great when mixed with other natural ingredients to make lotions and such.</li>
            <li> First of all, I enjoyed how the company emailed me as soon as I ordered the product with tips about using natural raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> I use half the amount of product and the results are better, last longer, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s pure, second, it&#x27;s natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can be hard to dig out of the jar and you have to warm it up in your hands before applying to the body.  </li>
            <li> It starts off hard but melts nicely in my hands.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am very picky with what I put on my face..</li>
            <li> Lasts long, non-greasy, leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> You know how cleansing products make your skin clean but so dry ?</li>
            <li> Great quality, just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use much, but so far it is as advertised.</li>
            <li> I bought this after much research on how to alleviate my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s eczema.  </li>
            <li> After using my skins stays soft for the whole day.</li>
            <li> So far it is keeping my baby&#x27;s legs, face and arms much softer than lotions that I did not want to put on her, but felt compelled to - ones that had had all sorts of toxic, cancer causing ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use clean dry hands to scoop the cream out.  </li>
            <li> Use clean dry hands to scoop the cream out.  </li>
            <li> It smells great, its extremely difficult to apply so use a plastic butter knife or something.</li>
            <li> I think this is an amazing product based on touch, smell, moisturizing and even the slow healing properties.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d normally have chapped lips by now!&lt;br</li>
            <li> OK so I bought this a few months ago and have not gotten around to writing a review till now.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally do reviews, but I had to with this product.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve had success with restoring my hands was with an overnight treatment of L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s 100% Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> the butter might absorb well, but I have normal</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more in the near future.</li>
            <li> The market is quite competitive and everyone pretty much has the same quality butter.</li>
            <li> I think the company should make sure that the seal is firmly attached so that the customer has to peel it off before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that I haven&#x27;t used it more than a few times.</li>
            <li> Is this normal?</li>
            <li> I purchased this shea butter because the brand I normally used was sold out.</li>
            <li> It does moisturize my skin, but I have to use more of the product than I would normally use other creams because it is quite hard even if I melt it in my hand, still need more product.</li>
            <li> I will buy again when we need more - it will be a while because this goes such a long way!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to deal with</li>
            <li> Well, my skin did not feel irritated at all, and the rash seems to be disappearing gradually, i.e. turning more pale in color.</li>
            <li> It must be stored properly and make sure your hands are dry when using this as you dont want to get water into the container.</li>
            <li> have pretty dry skin, in some areas keratosis pilaris, and this has me feeling pretty</li>
            <li> It melts easily on the skin and can be mixed with moisturizer for extra hydration.</li>
            <li> + year old face and neck looks less wrinkled and more youthful as a result.</li>
            <li> so if you don&#x27;t like it it would likely be easy to cover up with essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I have tried others previously, but this had been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy going on, but it really provides a deep, rich, and lasting moisturization.  </li>
            <li> I also struggled to find the right moisturizer with out all of the extra ingredients.</li>
            <li> Right out of the jar, it&#x27;s a bit gritty, but after warming it up in my hand, the &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; melts away.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it, right out of the jar.  </li>
            <li> It blends really well with other oils like coconut, sweet almond and jojoba.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin, and so far this is fantastic.</li>
            <li> this product is  very light colored with only a minimal aroma</li>
            <li> I’ve had a couple of people say things like, “...beyond the bald head you look so different now, like younger”, “…if it wasn’t for biology, I’d think you’re pregnant because you’re glowing!”  </li>
            <li> Product is very beneficial and I love the fact it is raw!</li>
            <li> this new product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels like a new skin&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Seller, get a new package for delivery.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hands, elbow area and legs which always seem to be the driest during New England winters.  </li>
            <li> We live the way that it feels on our skin and hair</li>
            <li> I would love to know if the company has a recipe for making a smoother, body butter type concoction using the raw shea butter</li>
            <li> I love raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li> My hair use to be really dry prior to application of this amazing African Shea butter</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is smooth and thick in texture with a fresh nutty scent.</li>
            <li> It helped heal my dry hands quickly.</li>
            <li> It has a nice subtle scent</li>
            <li> Not only did it seem to help keep her skin supple and free of radiation burns, but at the conclusion of her three week daily radiation regimen my hands felt like silk.  </li>
            <li> I have seen a dramatic increase in moisture in my hair and skin from use and it always gets to me right on time and well wrapped!!!!</li>
            <li> It is a little oily at first but soaks in quickly.  </li>
            <li> Very professional company</li>
            <li> skin feels very soft ..</li>
            <li> In any event, it is very soft and I like it.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to perfume and odors.  </li>
            <li> but it makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I use this as a nighttime moisturizer and it makes my skin very soft, and it doesn&#x27;t make me breakout, as 95% of creams do.</li>
            <li> We have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It has the distinctive color and smell of raw shea butter, which definitely threw me off at first, but after like five minutes I realized that I love the smell.</li>
            <li> This product in particular is so smooth and a little goes a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 tubs of it over the past couple years, same brand - the first and third were really grainy right from the start, and the 2nd was very smooth.</li>
            <li> It feels sticky at first, so I only do this at night.</li>
            <li> I use it in our homeade deodorant, as well as directly on skin and lips!</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many expensive creams but it stops here!  </li>
            <li> I was not sure this before I ordered, but I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just wow!</li>
            <li> The only other thing I use regularly (more as a cleanser) is unrefined organic coconut oil</li>
            <li> First off, I don&#x27;t like the yellow shea butter (by Plant Guru).  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s soft and it leaves my skin feeling like it has penetrated it!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It is a bit gritty to touch at first, but once your begin rubbing it into your skin</li>
            <li> However, this kind is not good for whipping.</li>
            <li> The butter looks off-white like natural shea butter normally looks like  </li>
            <li> purchased this item for my 4 month old son-baby acne, cradle cap, ezcema, rashes, etc!  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other ones but they do not have the same quality.</li>
            <li> Love to mix this with other oils and essential oils to create lotion or use alone.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin so soft without that greasy feeling!</li>
            <li> This made my skin soooo soft!</li>
            <li> Everything from the delivery, packaging, and actual product is stellar.</li>
            <li> I just started using this for the last 4 weeks (morning and night - especially after a bath) and it has made an enormous difference for the better.  </li>
            <li> Ahhhmazing product!!!!!!! I had second degree burns from hot grease on my arm.</li>
            <li> The scabs, cracking, and pain are all gone; The redness is almost completely gone!</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft!</li>
            <li> The greasiness level is about the same initially, but the L&#x27;O absorbed into my skin and my daughter&#x27;s skin much quicker.  </li>
            <li> No stretch marks so far!</li>
            <li> I use this on my LIPS in place of chap stick and they are so soft!  </li>
            <li> My skin has never been smoother, and it conditions my hair as well, leaving it so soft!</li>
            <li> I also appreciate the dark amber jar which protects the butter from light.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> My first jar lasted about 6 months and we use it several times a day.  </li>
            <li> I received my item before the scheduled date without a doubt they are true to their description absolutely no additives.</li>
            <li> So far, this is better than any Shea I have used,  If you like the really raw formulation, you should try this one.  </li>
            <li> The product shipped very quickly and the generous amount will last very long.</li>
            <li> butter has a nice subtle scent, which I like, and I like the fact that it is all natural.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to those looking for natural hair conditioners and for those looking for natural alternatives to chemical-ridden lotions.</li>
            <li> The next time you have a special on this product I will purchase several jars, my daughter loves it too.</li>
            <li> I have not made it in a recipe for body butter since I am new to essential oils and pure butters.</li>
            <li> So, i usually mix it with another oil that smells nice, such as coconut oil, lavendar oil, or cocoa oil.</li>
            <li> I usually mix this butter w my favorite lotion because I don&#x27;t like the Shea butter natural smell.</li>
            <li> Has all the qualities I&#x27;ve come to expect from a high quality, organic, unrefined, raw, shea butter; beige-yellow proof the product was not bleached, the slight nutty aroma of a nutrient-rich butter, consistency in texture and firmness throughout, no signs of any rancidity or contamination, good packaging.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little dry and crumbly, but softens as you warm it up with your hands.  </li>
            <li> Unrefined raw shea butter, this product is markedly superior than any other I have used to treat inflammed chapped skin.  </li>
            <li> Also, the dark container that it ships in is very useful for longer term storage, since it won&#x27;t let light in like typical clear containers would.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my hands get super dry from work and Shea butter seems to be the only thing that helps more then a few hours.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this product, the first order was a firm smooth compound</li>
            <li> Works amazing on my harsh dry hands ...</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad either - kind of nutty, not too strong at all.</li>
            <li> I can get so much more for less via Amazon than my local health food store.</li>
            <li> Smooth and nourishing for my red, dry skin.</li>
            <li> However, as many have stated, this dry, grainy texture goes part and parcel with its unprocessed purity.</li>
            <li> My shea butter had slight discoloration on the top in the middle, but I&#x27;m using it anyway.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin extremely moisturized and my skin feels super soft!</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller because I had a several questions about the product and the seller emailed back quickly.</li>
            <li> but this winter, no matter how hydrated I was or how much of this I put on, I still dried out, quickly.</li>
            <li> It goes on very easily and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The grainy quality may just be due to the fact that I live in Florida, and by the time things get here, and sit in mail truck all day, they are usually hot!</li>
            <li> This product is pure and unrefined which is crucial for me.</li>
            <li> In addition, it is not necessary to use a large amount.</li>
            <li> Pure unrefined ivory african shea butter from Ghana....</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s raw!</li>
            <li> Love Molivera Raw Shea Butter!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and creamy, not hard and gritty, like some of the other brands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this Shea butter for a little over a week but have noticed it lasts the better part of a day.  </li>
            <li> You have to rub it in hard and until those crumbs dissolve which will take more time than you expect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard and grainy like most.</li>
            <li> I like that it is a bit heavier than my other go-to hand and foot cream, coconut oil, yet soaks in quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li> I just recently purchased this product, but so far, I really like it.</li>
            <li> Smells clean and slightly nutty.</li>
            <li> TEN years of looking like complete scrap and within just 3 months a very noticeable change.</li>
            <li> I need all the help I can get to keep my skin looking clear and radiant.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my face to combat the drying effects of retin-a for acne and it has helped clear up post acne marks.</li>
            <li> I wake up with soft supple skin.</li>
            <li> This butter makes your skin so soft, and supple.</li>
            <li> - the production date is clearly marked on the seal.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Amazin&amp;#34; there&#x27;s no need to second guess yourself this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> It is also natural</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re now so soft, even in this weather where the heater is running nonstop.</li>
            <li> My mom is around the 55 yrs old.  </li>
            <li> This has been so helpful for my 6 yr old daughter and myself.</li>
            <li> I also made an all natural hair mouse with Shea butter</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all natural - no harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> He is 1 years old</li>
            <li> It has a thickness to it leaving both our skin soft without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s quite please with the results this far...</li>
            <li> Purchased in order to make natural eczema salve for my grandson...</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a truly natural hair and skin moisturizer for my family with no fragrances, no synthetics, no added</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s the only product that I&#x27;ve tried on my natural hair that really seals in moisture.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I&#x27;m natural and wanted to use it for my hair, instead I use it for my skin</li>
            <li> This has helped prevent my skin from dryness during the winter months and it is all natural.</li>
            <li> I have never written an amazon review and I shop here quite frequently</li>
            <li> Thanks again for such an organic product!</li>
            <li> The ones on my fore arm have completely gone away, but where my muscles are suppose to be they&#x27;re just a bit</li>
            <li> I was up with soft, supple skin and like rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li> Leaves the skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the smoothest product I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> No problem with sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> I have never tried real unrefined shea butter before, and after a week of using it I have to say I&#x27;m a big</li>
            <li> It does not need to say ivory, as real Shea butter suppose to be ivory and not yellow.</li>
            <li> I have a year old surgery scar that still causes me discomfort.</li>
            <li> I use it to mix with my young living oils to make lotions.</li>
            <li> Better late than never.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin looks 23 years old and not 80 anymore.</li>
            <li> I also  use it  on my kid&#x27;s  hair and it  makes their hair soft.</li>
            <li> They both have the smell but the yellow one has a much stronger odor than the ivory one.</li>
            <li> use this on my naturally curly hair and my scalp.</li>
            <li> but so far no improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE USED IT ON MY SON&#x27;S ECZEMA FLARE UP (4 YEARS OLD).</li>
            <li> I appreciate the natural shea fragrance and brown plastic container.</li>
            <li> So far, I like the Molivera Organics cream.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my feet, and I could feel how smooth they are.</li>
            <li> It also seemed to help soothe a rash I developed from a medicine.</li>
            <li> My face looks so much brighter, smoother, and even younger.</li>
            <li> so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it so far</li>
            <li> ,it makes my natural curls so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Tried so many products that just were not effective.  </li>
            <li> Soft and moldable.</li>
            <li> I decided to change the natural aroma and added some scented oil.</li>
            <li> So far this seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> It becomes soft again after you rub it through your hands a bit</li>
            <li> As far as the smell goes, I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> Also a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is no joke.</li>
            <li> The smell is totally natural</li>
            <li> , there are nearly none in the city</li>
            <li> As far as effectiveness, I&#x27;ve been using it as a moisturizer (in which capacity it works wonders), but I also put it on a cut that I got, and it noticeably soothed the redness and swelling.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> When I wake up my skin is like renewed, soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> And you get so much Shea Butter for low price - it will be enough for the whole year.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my hair for just a week and it looks soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I am also using it on my skin which looks and feels soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> The price is reasonable enough for me to buy as gifts</li>
            <li> I use it every night and my skin is baby soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> This is truly a completely natural product.  </li>

            <li> It leaves your skin feel soft and moisturized literally all day.</li>
            <li> It melts really well and actually smells on the side of coco butter.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how firm/hard</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Even makes my feet soft</li>
            <li> My feet have never been so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on both my skin and naturally curly 3c hair.</li>
            <li> my face felt soft.</li>
            <li> Will repurchase frequently.</li>
            <li> I only wish I used it much sooner.</li>
            <li> my skin tone out, and it has natural uv protection.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is just wow.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft and my hair manageable.  </li>
            <li> The rashes are completely gone.</li>
            <li> I also appreciated that the seller contacted me prior to let me know it was on its way.</li>
            <li> My order was received in a timely manner, I have only been using the product for a couple of days, but so for, I really like it.</li>
            <li> , I was hoping for something pleasent to use as a natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who has skin problems or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes so far.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any old scars disappear yet.  </li>
            <li> And leaves me feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> and it was gone completely.  </li>
            <li> On my hands and feet leaving them soft.  </li>
            <li> : There was one unexpected issue when I got the shea butter.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I mix this shea butter with oils and use it as a moisturizer on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft for days.</li>
            <li> 100% natural so it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> It does however make my skin soft</li>
            <li> Unrefined organic and natural unrefined Shea Butter, and</li>
            <li> And there isn&#x27;t a really loud smell like some others carry.</li>
            <li> But all I know is if it makes the skin soft, it must be nourishing it with natural goodness.  </li>
            <li> The moisture lasts, leaving my face and hands feeling soft all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have eczema and a sensitive skin problem.</li>
            <li> Even some products specifically for sensitive skins give me a burning and itchy feeling.</li>
            <li> I use this shea butter directly on my skin</li>
            <li> I recently started using it and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something natural for my and my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> My skin is nearly 100%.</li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned, I have no intention in pursuing prescription strength lotions (for eczema or KP) now that I have this on my side.</li>
            <li> I am using it to make a natural products like deodorant and foot cream.  </li>
            <li> It made my hands feel incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft and moist.</li>
            <li> i put in on early in the morning all over my body and it leaves me feeling soft and non greasy.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product I could use to keep my hair soft and manageable and after using this on my hair</li>
            <li> We have used it for lip balm so far</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I bought this product that I realized that my old shea butter was processed.  </li>
            <li> and when I wake up my face is as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom, it surprised me every time.</li>
            <li> I slather this stuff on at night and really rub it into the bleeding knuckles, I literally noticed a difference the next day.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using my shea butter for a few weeks and really love the way it is making my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Within 3 months there has been such noticeable difference in my skin, the complements have been coming left and right.</li>
            <li> Wow my skin love Molivera Organics Raw African Ivory Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> It has very mild smell that is usually a deal breaker me.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;+I emailed them about one of the tubs that I ordered that smelled a little bit different, and they QUICKLY replied and sent me a new tub at no charge, and after that they even explained that the old tub was not bad but simply smells different because of the cultivation product.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT</li>
            <li> So far, with using this product on my back, the rash is pretty much gone, and minimal itching.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Raw African Shea Butter!!!</li>
            <li> It does have a mild smell to it, which my family does not like, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long once you apply it to your skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that I used in combination with beeswax and other raw butters to make hard lotion bars.</li>
            <li> The results encouraged me to start using the shea butter as a general moisturizer, and wow, what a difference!</li>
            <li> Anyway I read reviews on this product, some customer said not real shea butter, some other said rancid, and other people said  Good, so I got for my mom</li>
            <li> But it did not mess up any of my clothes.</li>
            <li> I have taken a brake from using it for a bit to try other products but over all this is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it alone and in combination with other ingredients to make my own lip balm, body butter, facial moisturizer, and deodorant, among other things.</li>
            <li> Other brands dissolve pretty easy, this one leaves some sandy texture when mixed and my skin does not get well mosturized as when used other brand.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to use this product initially because of some of the negative reviews i&#x27;ve read, however this is a new favorite of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I figured before I&#x27;d plunk down the dough on the fancy stuff, I&#x27;d try some other 100% shea butter brands to see if I could get the same results at a more reasonable price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went back and purchase a second one the day after I received the first.  </li>
            <li> However, neither could I find I find a moisturizer, particularly for my hands and feet, that was penetrating enough to make a difference.  </li>
            <li> I normally purchase shea butter from beauty supply stores in the clear plastic containers (you know the ones I&#x27;m talking about) but wanted to try something different.</li>
            <li> It comes in a generous size jar, the consistency is pretty solid and this makes it last longer.</li>
            <li> I love this product it was creamy, and a lot softer than some of the other shea butter&#x27;s I&#x27;ve purchased( from other merchants)</li>
            <li> Found a similar small jar at a Quilt Expo but ran out and was searching for more.</li>
            <li> only takes a small amount and it lasts all most all day&lt;</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of pure shea butter.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it and will purchase again in the future.  </li>
            <li> I am highly acne prone been on several pills and creams bc of acne.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it looks like -- it is pure raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> So far I really like the way this butter feels on my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I am pregnant in the winter (who ever said that was better than summer was crazy)</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly, and while it does have a bit of an off smell, its not as bad as other shea butters, and its healing powers are great.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses it and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have roots growing out so a third of my hair is normal, and the rest is bleached and VERY damaged and dry.</li>
            <li> My normally dry hands are so well moisturized after using this at night, mixed with sweet almond oil, beeswax, and some essential oils.</li>
            <li> it does get absorbed but small tiny pieces will remain on my skin but with further rubbing will get absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li> I still have some left for me to make another batch of something new.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the new brand I will be buying.</li>
            <li> My hair has been chronically dry due to extensive use of shampoos and anti-dandruff shampoos and it wasn&#x27;t until I started using this that I was able to get my hair back to it&#x27;s natural softness.</li>
            <li> Compared to raw unrefined coconut oil, it feels more &amp;#34;dense&amp;#34; when rubbing it on…it&#x27;s more difficult to spread and rub into the skin...</li>
            <li> I prefer this raw (unprocessed) product because it&#x27;s smoother and feels more natural.  </li>
            <li> Straight out of the jar and onto my dry heels , whip it into body and face creams.</li>
            <li> it melts easily and loses whatever grittiness that may have been there.</li>
            <li> and it really helps my dry, chapped skin.</li>
            <li> I use daily on my 3 year old and 1 year old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and moisturizing to saturate his skin and makes it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I slather this all over my body at night (such that it is very greasy and goopy) and when i wake up in the morning, it has totally sunk in</li>
            <li> Skin absorbs it quickly and does not leave a greasy feeling at all; but then, I don&#x27;t put it on heavily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s thick, but goes on easily.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this over any other because of its value and high quality.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and my back breaks out in a rash</li>
            <li> this is the first brand of shea butter I have tried, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other shea butters...</li>
            <li> and I saw major improvements after just applying it one night.</li>
            <li> I have used many different moisturizers in the past, but is definitely a keeper.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably not a good idea to leave it in the bathroom where the steam could affect this all natural product, so I leave it in my bedside table where it&#x27;s easy to apply at bedtime.</li>
            <li> I put a small spoonful in my baths and my skin and hair are super soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re very slowly but surely going away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what is described and it&#x27;s very raw and pure.  </li>
            <li> I does smell nutty and is hard to spread, but after about 1 minute is goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought it because I had dark marks from insect bites, but now those dark marks are lightening back up to my natural skin color, my skin is soft and clear and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been switching to products that are as pure as possible, with a simple and short ingredient list.  </li>
            <li> At first there seemed to be a raw like smell, maybe being new...</li>
            <li> Raw shea butter has what I would term as a mild to medium earthy smell that I wasn&#x27;t expecting.  </li>
            <li> In general shea butter has an earthy scent.</li>
            <li> I have got to say that I am a newcomer to shea butter in general and this product specifically.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients on this product (which is only one thing) by far beat what you&#x27;re letting your skin absorb through drug store</li>
            <li> I  have been using it to seal my in the winter hair and it has left my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> It will keep your skin moisturized and get it back to natural glow,health and plus some.</li>
            <li> but I only use it at night so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every remedy possible for my 18 month old and nothing was working.</li>
            <li> and it barely softens up</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase this product in the near future (or sooner as everyone in my family of 6 has gotten in on the action)</li>
            <li> It does feel greasy especially when it comes in contact with my naturally oily skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and the scent is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> It smelled like old petroleum oil mixed with stink root.</li>
            <li> My method involves scraping some butter directly into my palms and rubbing it together (with solid pressure) until is turns into a dense, but liquid-y texture.</li>
            <li> You could turn this jar into 20 different natural beauty items like lip balms, scrubs, creams, etc.</li>
            <li> One of two things would happen, the product would evaporate on my skin because there was too much water in it OR balm type products would simply sit on top and fail to absorb.</li>
            <li> I recently just received this and the Sweet Almond oil; I have used the Ivory Shea Butter a few times since I have received it.</li>
            <li> I have had this jar for approximately 2 months, and it looks like I barely scraped the top.</li>
            <li> and it completely absorbed in a few days.</li>
            <li> This is very much in a &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; state...not like your typical lotion...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone with dry skin or eczema.</li>
            <li> I have always had skin issues including acne, scarring from the acne, sun spots, overall, not a smooth flawless face, hidden behind coverup makeup.</li>
            <li> Organic Shea Butter was highly recommended by my naturopath to relieve patches of extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> this however does not, and it works must better than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;*I usually apply lotion 6 or so times a day, I only have to apply this 2 times in the morning and at night, and my hands don&#x27;t dry out.&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Not only is the smell of this new jar kinda gross (like rubber)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Contents: Creamy, off-white (not yellow or grey)&lt;br /&gt;Texture: Smooth, not grainy (though this just means I lucked out and the bottle didn&#x27;t go through any warm storage or transit and the oil did not have a chance to partially melt and crystallize; I suppose it wouldn&#x27;t have mattered, as I melt it first anyway), slightly crumbly after scraping with a spoon.&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Like shea butter, a little earthy/nutty and similar to other raw shea</li>
            <li> It would have sucked to live with a sunburn for that long while I was there.  </li>
            <li> The smell is neither pleasant nor unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> When you first rub it in it is slightly grainy, however, that disappears once it warms up.</li>
            <li> Not only is it non-greasy (when added in small layers), it helps significantly with scarring over time.</li>
            <li> no dry cracking noses in this house!  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it is not as easy to apply as other conventional creams, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard as a rock, I try to get a little out with a spoon and warm it between my hands</li>
            <li> I have been interested in using natural products for my face and body, so I decided to try raw shea butter as a body</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much smoother and goes on thinner than other brands.</li>
            <li> Granted, I did sometimes wear cotton and other absorbent materials, and maybe my skin is a bit uncooperative when it wants to be.</li>
            <li> The shopping was late but it was worth it!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much nicer than the other shea butter I have purchased.</li>
            <li> but this one has really helped my skin look smoother and also my breakouts and scars due to hyper-pigmentation from cystic acne are clearing up.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter, like other nut butters, can sometimes be too firm to easily spread on the skin.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry desert area and this helps keep my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing to my skin and especially my dry hands.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly solid in the jar, but I just keep an old spoon next to it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 43 year old male who likes to spend time outside in the sun.  </li>
            <li> And of course, this is the first thing I go to for minor burns, bruises, rashes, and closed healing</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Well, I finally ran out and when I went to buy it again, I had major sticker shock.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to put anything on because my skin is very sensitive that turns red right away.</li>
            <li> The product is quite hard here and it takes a bit of time to get it soft enough to be absorbed.  </li>
            <li> I generally buy a different brand and thought I would try this brand.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner and the dark jar is an absolute plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There were other shea butter in larger quantity and much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> This product SUCKS, I was so excited because I read extensively .</li>
            <li> MUCH cheaper than other brands while retaining the same quality and effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as long term results time will tell.</li>
            <li> and my daughter has some tiny, red bumps on her upper arms that were making her feel self conscious in her sleeveless summer tops.</li>
            <li> Feels sticky at first, then after working it into the skin for a few minutes it absorbs without any stickiness.</li>
            <li> No more fuzz clinging in his hair, his tight curls are much more manageable, and he isn&#x27;t itching his scalp.</li>
            <li> Mine doesn&#x27;t look my the usual shea butter - with the yellowish color, mine is more whitish and not easily spreadable (you know how usual shea butter melts quickly in your hands).  </li>
            <li> Not sure I could use this stuff straight out of the jar with it being so thick and the strong smell.</li>
            <li> Container should last a very long time, consistency is smooth and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The other thing is it takes a moment to warm up in your hands, and can make that annoying &amp;#34;lathering-up&amp;#34; sound, but I don&#x27;t mind that.  </li>
            <li> We have tried everything for my 16 month old&#x27;s son&#x27;s dry cracking skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered Molivera&#x27;s Ivory Shea Butter because the product I used previously cost way too much to ship.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive dry skin that hasn&#x27;t been helped by the dermatologist but cleared up in 3 days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s winter and so dry my skin craved for something natural and hydrating..</li>
            <li> We are using this for my 11 month old dry and eczema skin.</li>
            <li> , eczema prone skin much smoother and less itchy.</li>
            <li> In a league of its own, first class compared to all the crap you find in the drug store.</li>
            <li> I blend it with a little black castor oil to fit my needs.</li>
            <li> The jar makes it easy to scoop out and is small enough to store with my other hair and body products.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing effects last longer than any other body butter, and it is clearly high quality.</li>
            <li> product is raw so it does feel crumbly at first</li>
            <li> This is first time buying and using raw Shea.</li>
            <li> Being my first time ordering raw Shea butter, I was nervous.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> This butter is exactly the way raw shea butter should be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 68 years old and have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I use it all over and use it on my six year old son because he has very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have very dry combo skin in the winter months and also adult acne which makes for a nightmare of situation when you are trying to pick out a moisturizer that wont break you out.  </li>
            <li> she develop a very dry skin only on the face, her cheeks and near to the mouth area, the skin always peel.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is you really have to rub it in to get the little butter grains into your skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strange at first, but you get used to it, plus it dissipates after about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I find myself continuously having to clean up residue that I leave behind, but it&#x27;s worth the trouble!</li>
            <li> After years of using false shea butter (that yellow stuff they sell at every beauty supply store and even here on amazon), I switched to the pure bulk shea butter sold by whole foods.</li>
            <li> Its really thick kind of hard to get out .</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad like other shea butters and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Before using this 100% Pure Raw African Ivory Shea Butter my hands were red, severely cracked, and scabbed over from bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I spent 10 days in Jamaica and had a slight sunburn after the first day; I used it that night</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality raw, unrefined shea butter but isn&#x27;t gritty and will melt with the heat from you hand.</li>
            <li> Pure, raw Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> Pure &amp; raw.</li>
            <li> how parts of the burnt black sections are now healed to my normal skin color.</li>
            <li> But after a day and a half of using this product, my hands feel normal again.</li>
            <li> It has an oddly musky smell, but, having never used a product like this before I have no idea if this is normal or not.  </li>
            <li> I used it over the last couple weeks for keeping a small spot psoriasis moisturized for long periods of time, but it didn&#x27;t heal it up any more than usual.  </li>
            <li> i use it on my hair because it is so dry and super thick</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t squeeze this out of a bottle like any old lotion with lots of additives - it&#x27;s nice and thick and is made for tough, dry skin.</li>
            <li> Not even coconut oil or other recommended natural oils.</li>
            <li> moisturizing, a bit hard when you first open it, but if you leave it inside the bathroom while you&#x27;re showering, the steam from the bath will make it easier to apply.</li>
            <li> and it is all thanks to Raw Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> and I really appreciate the quality and the price, it is what it says it is, raw and unrefined.</li>
            <li> Since it is raw it doesn&#x27;t really have a smell</li>
            <li> this is raw and is very helpfull.</li>
            <li> I started making my own lotion and body cream for winter last year and shea butter is a must have in the cold, dry Wisconsin winter.  </li>
            <li> I had a black n blue on my arm from giving blood and normally it takes me a long time to heal..</li>
            <li> I use this on my FACE as a moisturizer and as a result my face has virtually no breakouts, decreased dark circles, and more even tones.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so this large jar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It is hard at first but once</li>
            <li> It is pretty hard</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a big jar, so it will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> This is organic with very little odor and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this one for a few months now and it works very well on my extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I liked the butter but sadly, I found black specks in my jar</li>
            <li> The scent is not that bad but not that great too, so I bought lavender oil and mix a few drops with some butter I transferred in a smaller cointainer, mixing them well makes the shea butter softer and easier to apply.</li>
            <li> By the time I have my coffee, I&#x27;m ready to put on my makeup; by that time the Shea butter has soaked into my skin with no more oily residue.</li>
            <li> I began using shea butter because I developed an unusual red, itchy, peppered rash on my neck and chest which I never experienced before.</li>
            <li> When I mixed the two products it was quite a mess as both products are very emollient, but just one application of this mixture to my body relieved the dryness I had been feeling with all other products.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face it leaves my skin so soft, fades dark spots and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my face it leaves my skin so soft, fades dark spots and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It has helped me so much with skin problems I have been trying to resolve for over the past year now.</li>
            <li> It almost scared my away but trust me, it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> Also, the cracks on my heals are much softer, and not as rough, only after a few days.</li>
            <li> this jar will last me a long time too.  </li>
            <li> once I use it long enough  for a review.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same lotion without the Shea for quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many expensive creams, ointments, and other sheas, but yours is the only one that has actually worked.</li>
            <li> The jar will definitely last a long time</li>
            <li> However, I anticipate that this jar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It seems thick at first</li>
            <li> I have to get past the smell and process of acquiring the right texture, but it almost instantly took care of my dry legs and rough skin patches.</li>
            <li> So far I have used it everywhere from the neck down.</li>
            <li> but this second shipment is very grainy, hard to rub on the body.</li>
            <li> The other major difference is that the L&#x27;Occitane product is scented and this one is not</li>
            <li> I consulted a few fellow baldies and asked them how to care for my new baldy.  </li>
            <li> I have never felt true raw shea butter before, the ones I have used in the past were creamy this one is gritty and needs to be warmed up in your hands to rub on the body.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my hair, skin, and on my husband who is diabetic and his skin is dry and ichy, this makes a big difference and keeps him moisturized.</li>
            <li> Also has an odd, nearly burnt nut smell to it.</li>
            <li> I have severely dry skin and shea butter has been the only thing to help it.</li>
            <li> I melt this in a double boiler &amp; add emu oil &amp; argan oil for a triple whammy on dry skin &amp; wrinkles.</li>
            <li> it has especially helped my extremely dry, sometimes cracked, hands.</li>
            <li> My dry skin feels instantly nourished  and moisturized.</li>
            <li> We have dry skin, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> I also use it as a lip moisturizer at night, on my elbows, and any body part that feels too dry (especially in the winters).</li>
            <li> and then the shea butter on extra dry spots, and the combination makes the shea butter easier to massage into my skin.  </li>
            <li> My son has a dry skin and during winters, his skin breaks and gets red.  </li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that works for my extremely dry hands.</li>
            <li> - I wish I had not spayed her, maybe that&#x27;s why her skin is so easily irritated, poor girl!</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t get rid of my eczema completely, it does make it less itchy and dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and a half and my skin is much smoother and less red.</li>
            <li> Is a miracle for extra dry skin and lips.</li>
            <li> The second purchase caused dry skin/eczema to appear on my chest and decolletage.</li>
            <li> I developed a facial rash about a few years ago.</li>
            <li> this jar will last a long, long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin has been broken out ever since I became pregnant with my 1st child 4 years ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to other commercial brands you can find at your drug store, this Shea butter can last hours, were as the drug store lotions don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It was weird at first because the fabric clings a little due to the oil but by the end of the first week my skin had become so hydrated and soft</li>
            <li> It really calms my skin down and the feeling last throughout the day, its just a little oily after application</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American female and have a lot of dark spots</li>
            <li> At first I was thrown off by the smell and consistency (which is gritty and hard) but after whipping it up with some jojoba oil, no lotion can compare!</li>
            <li> This was not what I expected but like it say PURE RAW.</li>
            <li> By the second or third night the cracks appear to be healed and am now left with the chapped skin, which appears to be getting smoothed out in the areas that we&#x27;re not as severely dried out initially.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had such a soothing cream for my dry skin!</li>
            <li> I use as a daily moisturizer as well after dry brushing and my skin feels the softest it ever has!</li>
            <li> I mix it with coconut oil and other essential oils and use it daily.  </li>
            <li> However, daily use of numerous other products (multiplied by years) didn&#x27;t do anything to resolve the issue.</li>
            <li> However, daily use of numerous other products (multiplied by years) didn&#x27;t do anything to resolve the issue.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of commercial products such as Burt&#x27;s Bees, Aveeno, Cerave, Petroleum Jelly, Aquaphor, and a variety of other things that have been recommended for eczema and nothing</li>
            <li> I think it is a terrific value compared to other similar products.</li>
            <li> Thick organic pure shea butter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I also have very dry hands from nursing school and being a barista: the constant hand washing KILLS my skin and nails.</li>
            <li> My feet get very dry, especially during the winter, and this shea butter works wonders.</li>
            <li> it created white patches on skin and made it very dry..</li>
            <li> I use Raw African Ivory Shea Butter to stretch my natural hair.</li>
            <li> Some people who are used to perfumed products or completely unscented ones might take a little while getting used to it.</li>
            <li> Product is a little coarse (think tiny tiny sand particles) but when heated it melts.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell weirdly how some other reviews stated, and most of all it does help heal my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> Seems to last me a long time too!!!</li>
            <li> and I like the fact that its white not that glow in the dark yellow</li>
            <li> put this on every night for weeks, and now, I can barely see the dark rings.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li> and  my skin head to toe is hydrated and nourished all day long.</li>
            <li> It did reduce some of the redness, but not for long.</li>
            <li> so I cannot attest to the long term affect.  </li>
            <li> Just rub it vigoursly between your fingers for a few seconds and its soft and workable.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took this long for this product to be on my radar.</li>
            <li> and it caused an itchy rash across the entire stretch of my upper chest (that disappeared a few days after discontinued use), but I appreciate shea, and recommend it if you&#x27;ve had a similarly iffy experience with cocoa products.</li>
            <li> Noticed an improvement in my complexion in a matter of a few weeks and like the fact that it is natural.  </li>
            <li> I will keep buying it as long as you sell it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything about the long term results of using this product.</li>
            <li> Also, this tub lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Was put off by the coarseness and stayed greasy for a long time after application..Would not order again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a body butter stick to my skin for so long - I put it on my hands before bed and its still there when I was my hands in the morning.</li>
            <li> I will have this for a long time.</li>
            <li> Shea Butter can be used when treating minor cuts, scrapes, and soothing sunburns.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s there all day long.  </li>
            <li> This shea butter stays tacky to the touch for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when I use this shea butter my skin stay moisturized all day long.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter is not ivory in color but grey and and grainy as well.</li>
            <li> My skin is the softest it has been in a long time.</li>
            <li> I can tell it&#x27;s unprocessed by the slightly gritty texture.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face looking fresh and I haven&#x27;t broken out from it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be a little bit hard to get out and spread, because it hardens, but its not inconvenient or and issue or anything.</li>
            <li> : if the smell does put you off, I find that lavender or peppermint essential oils really cover up the earthiness (not too bad once you get used to it ;]  )</li>
            <li> Also the texture was very gritty and oilier than other shea butter products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Comes out of the jar a little grainy, but with a few warmup smears, it&#x27;s very silky on the skin.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about this long ago!  </li>
            <li> I am on my second tub now and will be a lifelong fan of this shea butter!  </li>
            <li> Ever so slightly gritty like other reviewers say, but it blends in and is no problem as soon as you rub it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s always mixed with other ingredients and scents in my products</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened up the jar, I noticed the texture looked different than the ones I bought  from other merchants.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, too!</li>
            <li> The gritty parts of it also absorb so I don&#x27;t have white little specks in my hair and on my skin.</li>
            <li> It melts well in bain marie when mixed with other ingredients and helps heal the skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any drastic results, however my skin is overall smoother and the other day I just started to notice the fading of stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as an ingredient when making solid lotion, lip balms and other spa DIY items.</li>
            <li> Why pay for those products that make such a big deal about containing shea butter, when they actually contain a small percentage of this ingredient.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong - sort of like faint licorice mixed with tobacco.</li>
            <li> I use this on my lips, as I have an occasional outbreak of eczema on my lips due to the weather, allergies and dry skin.</li>
            <li> so one tub should last for months while other creams marketed to help aid dry skin or eczema</li>
            <li> product - RAW refined but soft and creamy.</li>
            <li> but it is a natural raw product.</li>
            <li> Keep in a dry place.  </li>
            <li> I have horrid dry skin</li>
            <li> Even with Almond, Coconut, Castor or Grape Seed Oil,  for some reason on my mother&#x27;s face will work for just for couple hours, once the oil penetrate the skin the surface will dry a lot</li>
            <li> have dry skin with blackheads on my nose and pimples that will form on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Also, my heels get all cracked and dry from wearing sandals.</li>

            <li> my hair would feel dry.</li>
            <li> It helps with my eczema and severe dry skin i have.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get rid of this dry skin.</li>

            <li> I have extremely dry skin, and the Shea butter made it feel smoother.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and exzema on my face</li>
            <li> My dry skin is responding well to this combination.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to anyone with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Because My face is a bit oily and dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it on my hands, dry patches on my face, elbows, and eczema spots.</li>
            <li> or when I feel like my hair is getting dry and it works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Helps with dry skin,wrinkles, cuts you name it.  </li>

            <li> I have dry hair and it keeps my hair moisturized and hydrated.</li>
            <li> use this product if you have dry hands.</li>
            <li> I will be throwing this in the trash and looking for another treatment for my dry skin patches.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my husband, but I like to use it for myself as well as on my toddler&#x27;s dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> However, I have noticed that my legs and thighs still appear dry after application.  </li>
            <li> Besides soothing dry lips, dry skin, feet, hands, softening hair, it also protects leather, you can even cook with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Texture is a bit \\&quot;crumbly\\&quot; and dry and</li>
            <li> it HAS improved my dry skin.</li>
            <li> and it makes my sons dry</li>
            <li> It starts off dry and warms with your body heat to a creamier consistency.</li>
            <li> I use it for dry skin, both on myself and my cat (her paw pads tend to get dried-out and cracked).  </li>
            <li> and my hands get SO dry.  </li>
            <li> I have used it on my face, neck and even my feet because they get dry from working out and wearing flip flops.  </li>
            <li> Got it for my mom who&#x27;s been taking swimming lessons and noticed that the chlorine has made her skin dry.</li>
            <li> an aside, I started using this Shea Butter in late November on a stubborn brown spot on my face and six weeks later it&#x27;s almost completely faded.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different body butters from various drugstores...</li>
            <li> I have tried few different (Shea Butter Ivory and yellow)</li>
            <li> Day by day I notice how its slowly improving my skin back to its natural youth.</li>
            <li> I made a whipped shea butter recipe with some other natural oils and it has little bits in it.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine told me about how she does not have a single stretch mark from pregnancy</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so this jar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work faster at clearing up old scars than others I&#x27;ve tried in past.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and this is the first product I have used on it that has not made it worse.</li>
            <li> and when I finally ran out I ordered Molivera Organics raw African shea butter</li>
            <li> Seems that some people look down their nose at &amp;#34;L&#x27;O&amp;#34;  because it&#x27;s too white and doesn&#x27;t stink.  </li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I both use for different reason and I haven&#x27;t been happier with any other cream !</li>
            <li> I cant find any other moisturizer that will get that and other dry patches on my body moisturized as well as last all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick, but I use coconut oil first</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin and it&#x27;s hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t irritate or gives me a reaction of some sort.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s a good or bad thing.  </li>
            <li> When I first tried it, i was shocked by how much like butter</li>
            <li> After a couple uses, my dry skin was healed and I no longer feel itchy!</li>
            <li> I really take the time to massage it in on the trouble areas and then while still slick, no kidding, I put on a pair of fleece jammies that I have designated as my &amp;#34;oil pair&amp;#34; so that I don&#x27;t ruin anything else.</li>
            <li> I oiled and covered up with coconut oil too and only got half of the benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells like black licorice mixed with dirt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just about got this used up now and over the past few months, it seemed to get really clumpy.  </li>
            <li> Plus the odd smell dissipates in a very short time.</li>
            <li> I had previously bought from essential depot</li>
            <li> It smells slightly nutty like it should and the color is a creamy yellowish white like it should be.</li>
            <li> Using on my hard feet and they are now soft!</li>
            <li> Extremely healing for sun damaged skin and eczema, hydrating for dry skin, dry hair, and I use this in a home made organic sunscreen.</li>
            <li> it keeps my VERY dry and itchy skin moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are using it for split skin around their fingers, very dry ezema, someone</li>
            <li> My sister loves this product so I&#x27;m giving it a shot as a relief from very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I also have very dry hands, and though I am not claiming that they are miraculously cured, I do see and feel a difference.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have very dry skin</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never used anything that worked so well on my very dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I suffer from hand and foot syndrome, so my feet and hands are very dry, this works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grand-daughter who has very dry skin on her arms and legs and her scalp--she loves it as she is also a child of 2 ethnic backgrounds.</li>
            <li> I use this at night on my very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and a friend recommended to me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for my dry feet and my face a few times.</li>
            <li> One of the few things that actually cures dry cracked skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I am 43 and starting to show the effects of &amp;#34;gravity&amp;#34; and the little tell tell signs of aging I needed to start to combat the loss of collagen and adipose.</li>
            <li> It is only called ivory because of the color of the Shea butter due to the usual yellow color of Shea butter.</li>
            <li> And I only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> It does however leave little chunks if you don&#x27;t rub it into your skin well enough.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little different</li>
            <li> It is dry and flaky and grainy as reviewed by other 1-star reviews.</li>
            <li> Thick and firm, but causes me to take out just the little I need--about a dime&#x27;s size worth.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is very sticky and hard to apply to your skin,I wasted 20.00 on it would never buy it again</li>
            <li> However, my particular jar is so hard I have to use a spoon to get it out!  </li>
            <li> I actually returned some Shea Butter I had previously purchased because it&#x27;s quality was inferior to the Raw African Ivory Shea Butter I purchased from Molivera Organics.</li>
            <li> But I will buy one more time because I don&#x27;t know if I had a bad jar.</li>
            <li> my heels get real dry) and it was soooo slippery and caused me to slide and fall out of my sandals</li>
            <li> Several people have complained about an occasional graininess of the shea butter, and yes it does have some of that-</li>
            <li> My only negative is that it&#x27;s a bit gritty.</li>
            <li> is minimal...</li>
            <li> Just as I expected.</li>
            <li> I got it before I even expected it.</li>
            <li> It arrived ahead of schedule and carefully packaged.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using the shea butter a few days now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it alone a few times and plan to mix it with oils for different creams/lotions.</li>
            <li> It gets into my skin and lasts through washing and getting it wet.</li>
            <li> Arrived quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> I like products with glycolic acid as well, but you need to be careful not to apply before spending any time in the sun.  </li>
            <li> Be careful with nut allergy patients.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using Molivera Shea Butter daily for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The benefit is the rest of my skin is benefiting as well, rough elbows and calloused feet are disappearing.  </li>
            <li> Realistically speaking will last probably 4 months if I used it everyday.</li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;ve gone through a pound in roughly 3 months, to provide an idea of the longevity of its usage.</li>
            <li> I already expected this after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is water solulable, so you can use it on wet skin or as you get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> I use it in my homemade &amp;#34;lotions&amp;#34; or when I haven&#x27;t had time to make any, I just take a scoop add a few drops of essential oil, mix in my hand until it softens and rub on face/body.</li>
            <li> I have used at least half the container already, but  there is no reason this can&#x27;t last the average body two winters (especially if used out of the shower while still wet enough to seal in moisture).</li>
            <li> I use it along with African black soap!</li>
            <li> (that stuff is not pure shea butter).</li>
            <li> All previous products has it as a minor ingredient.  </li>
            <li> Getting it out of the jar and distributing it is a little more time consuming than an ordinary moisturizer, but not too difficult.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t apply this to your face before going outside as you may look ridiculously shiny and such.</li>
            <li> I think its probably really good,but I am having a hard time coming past the smell of it</li>
            <li> After doing some research and reading reviews, I decided to try Molivera Organics Raw Unrefined African Shea butter.  </li>
            <li> So I was a bit unsure of this Shea butter just because it&#x27;s not a lotion per day but actual raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li> The next morning, I felt as moisturized as I did with my raw unrefined coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> and my skin is MUCH less dry (</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sooth the itching, but it helps make the skin less dry.</li>
            <li> I actually like having a little slight grit because it helps exfoliate and invigorate your skin.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that it is hard to actually apply to your face, because it is a solid, not a liquid.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Little goes long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> For the past ten years I have had health problems due to unknown food allergies and hormone imbalances.</li>
            <li> You do not have to use a lot; a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit melts a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> This shea butter is extremely moisturizing, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My face always felt tight and dry.</li>
            <li> That hasn&#x27;t been the case for any other oil/cream I&#x27;ve tried....</li>
            <li> rx&#x27;s, other Shea butters</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use it with other ingredients as well.  </li>
            <li> some other&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li> I also mix this with other oils for my face, i am 59 and find this to help with softening wrinkles, soothing dryness in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For the past two years I have been battling severe eczema and recently purchased this item to see how it works.</li>
            <li> REALLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m also reaping benefits in other areas that I had not planned.  </li>
            <li> NOTHING I used seemed to penetrate my skin and heal the extreme dryness.</li>
            <li> I mix it with other butters/oils and use it after the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other brands of Shea butter from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use this to mix with other oils for my hair and face care.</li>
            <li> It also melts easier and smoother than other brands.  </li>
            <li> Only suggestion is to keep a small spatula like tool with the jar to scoop it out.</li>
            <li> I put it on during the day the first time I used it, and unfortunately it ended up on the dress I was planning on wearing</li>
            <li> Seeing reviews on other brands, it seems like there&#x27;s a batch of grainy product in other brands also</li>
            <li> and I am also using it on a sunburn from the other day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a shea butter lover since I do not like any other cream on my skin with bunch of added chemicals that God knows what they are.</li>
            <li> I no longer use any other night cream or serums, and I believe my 50</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days!</li>
            <li> I am anxious to see what several weeks will show.</li>
            <li> would literally cry at night from the pain and stiffness due to dryness.</li>
            <li> I may also try using it for other things.</li>
            <li> She is now going to be recommending this to other parents.</li>
            <li> The other shea butter I used does not do this.</li>
            <li> I bought this after comparing prices of other shea butter offerings on amazon.  </li>
            <li> This one I can use exclusively on my face, and will finish up the other jar on my elbows, knees, etc.</li>
            <li> It is the only moisturizer I use, no more fancy creams and misleading products.</li>
            <li> Just want I expected!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t  have to heat it like some other Shea butters.</li>
            <li> is lip balms I plan to make and other products when I get around to it.</li>
            <li> + for 8-10oz in other brands?</li>
            <li> It leaked in transit due to the heat.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> As for the smell you see other reviewers reporting...</li>
            <li> Skip the other shea butters in a bag and get this one.</li>
            <li> The uses for shea butter are endless - heels, face, body, and also as a chap stick when at home.  </li>
            <li> With other shea butters I hadn&#x27;t encountered grittiness.)</li>
            <li> There was a plasticky scent to this shea butter (as opposed to the cocoa-like smell from other shea butters I&#x27;ve used).</li>
            <li> It helped heal my cracking/bleedy knuckles due to over washing my hands during this cold/flu season.  </li>
            <li> It was very hard to melt it by rubbing my hands, so I would place a small amount on the lid and set it over my hot rollers so it would melt and it was a lot easier for me to use.</li>
            <li> I even used a little on my cats dry skin</li>
            <li> My youngest son&#x27;s scalp gets really dry and started to flake (could be due to the anti-histamine he takes year round).</li>
            <li> In addition, the butter appears to sit on my skin, it is not really absorbent at all although other reviewers mentioned that it absorbs quickly, not the case.  </li>
            <li> but it has dried up the pustules of my acne as long as I don&#x27;t pick my skin the place where they cyst was now is getting smoother and clearer.!</li>
            <li> After I cleanse my face with raw African black soap .  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> I used some on my cracked, dry heels and after a few nights it cleared up the dryness.  </li>
            <li> LOVE, fixed my sons horrible eczema in just two applications!  </li>
            <li> I has used almost half of the jar and will continue using until its empty.  </li>
            <li> I have tried it on myself for a few days now as a moisturizer for dry areas of my body and yessss</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Molivera&#x27;s brand was very gritty (and the grittiness didn&#x27;t completely disappear as I warmed the butter in my hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black female, late 30&#x27;s w no history of skin problems but ended up with some damage after having a chemical peel done a few months back.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter has been a boon to my skin, and this brand seems to be less expensive and higher quality than others.</li>
            <li> This shea was firm enough to allow me to stretch it with added oils if I chose to, but not too firm that I couldn&#x27;t use it immediately as is, trading off the inconvenience of the slight crumbly texture for its unbeatable skin nourishment and protection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different products to help my dry skin, from the expensive to the organic type</li>
            <li> Leaves your  skin super soft especially in harsh, cold weather.</li>
            <li> As mentioned in some other reviews, the texture takes a few tries to get used to.</li>
            <li> Harsh winter this year in NH and very dry hands.  </li>
            <li> I melted it in s double boiler and added a few spoonfuls of coconut oil (hopefully to make it less stiff) and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less greasy than other brands of shae butter</li>
            <li> Also, I have a hard time getting it to melt enough in my hands to rub onto skin.  </li>
            <li> only problem is that&#x27;s it&#x27;s lumpy and hard....</li>
            <li> Its hard to keep from putting my hands in my hair constantly.</li>
            <li> I keep small amounts in small jars, take out a little bit of it, let my natural body/skin heat start to break it down, then rub it in.</li>
            <li> I bought this 16 oz raw unrefined Shea butter hopping to make a use of it for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> purchased it based on reviews ,, but it produced such a bad results,, buyers be aware..</li>
            <li> Container: Sealed on the inside, dark jar, in-tact and pleasing packaging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A small bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It has a strange odor but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped my eczema patients, keratosis piliaris, stretch marks on teenagers and some dark pigmentation associated with healing.</li>
            <li> And By Saturday I started to notice the dark spots fading.</li>
            <li> I never thought this dark spots would go away.  </li>
            <li> I have always had dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> This has evened out my skin tone dramatically and helps a lot with my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I love shea butter, and this one gets the job done, but crumbles in hand, making it really annoying to apply.</li>
            <li> it is just a theory, but it is so thick that I can only imagine it would clog the pores).</li>
            <li> It is a little to heavy for my very thin hair so only as a very occasional deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> The fleece holds the oils on my skin and I can sit or lay down without spreading the oil on everything.</li>
            <li> I use it every day not just on my head, but all over my face &amp; down my neck.  </li>
            <li> No grease running down on my forehead breaking me out either.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands - NO COMPARISON!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using any of my other lotions at all!</li>
            <li> We have issues with excessive dry skin and eczema.</li>
            <li> No more dry, cracked heels or elbows.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and I probably use less than the average user each day.</li>
            <li> For the past eight or nine years I&#x27;ve been a regular user of organic raw coconut oil.</li>
            <li> The process is a little inconvenient but worth its weight in gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received it in a bubble mailer so naturally the lid was broken and when the shea butter melted from being stuffed into my mailbox all day, it leaked out a little.</li>
            <li> (I tried Shea Butter (16 OZ) with Pure Healing Lemongrass Essential Oil - Raw, Ivory, Organic from Africa, Moisturizing Face Cream that dried my skin also, so disappointing )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve likely tried some 30-plus highly rated and often very expensive products and nothing has worked to help soften these stubborn patches.</li>
            <li> ,  I had rough patches and my skin was just dull, aged.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used raw Shea butter before so my review is not very educated.</li>
            <li> and seems slightly whipped)</li>
            <li> Not only is there seriously, honest-to-goodness ONE ingredient in the container; it does wonders for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This brand is slightly granier but no difference except that and the price.</li>
            <li> Does have a slight smoky smell, but smell seems to &amp;#34;evaporate&amp;#34; after being smoothed in.  </li>
            <li> the typical T-Zone skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was having serious allergy reactions (rash &amp; itching) to whatever they put in my body and back during surgery.</li>
            <li> i realized what i had previously bought wasn&#x27;t a grade A butter.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and black soap after a friend recomemded it.</li>
            <li> I used this to make a shea butter cream (shea butter, aloe vera gel, black jamaican castor oil, vitamin e oil, and coconut oil).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it on my face, body, and feet; and it definitely helped my seriously cracked heels within days like nothing else I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li> I like mixing this with black castor oil to apply to my nail cuticle, hands and feet</li>
            <li> Any disclorations I had previously were darkened</li>
            <li> Slight nutty taste, if you use it on your lips, and you should.  </li>
            <li> I use it plain or mixed with fractionated coconut oil for my skin and hair and also on my poodle&#x27;s delicate skin and hair.</li>
            <li> A little gritty but nothing bad it goes away fast.</li>
            <li> raw shea butter comes in a solid, hard form.  </li>
            <li> You have to keep wet hands out of the product, but just put some in another small container and use it as a lip balm.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is 100% shea butter as it should be a harder if I am not mistaken.</li>
            <li> It is thick, though, so would be difficult to moisturize an entire adult body</li>
            <li> and I have not experienced any gritty feeling as I had seen mentioned in comments on other products.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands in the past but this one beats them hands down.</li>
            <li> Raw unrefined shea butter is very dense and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little less than a week</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It can smell a little funky if your not used to it, almost slightly like off</li>
            <li> Ooh, I forgot to mention that I put this on my heel of my feet everyday, no more cracked and dry skin there too!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used raw organic Shea butter before from other companies.</li>
            <li> Its Raw so it has no smell other than maybe a putty type smell.</li>
            <li> The shea butter is really thick and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t live up to my experience with L&#x27;O.  </li>
            <li> Over time, my hands were always itchy and scratching then caused a thick patch of dry skin.</li>
            <li> If you need help with dry or rough or tough skin, this will help.</li>
            <li> so I was a little weary of the texture.</li>
            <li> It is a little on the greasy side but that is what its supposed to feel like.  </li>
            <li> Just got this yesterday and used in myself and two little ones...</li>
            <li> You have to rub it in a little</li>
            <li> It is little grainy but once it make contact with your skin it melts away.</li>
            <li> I started by using this as a face moisturizer, but it was a little to greasy/shiny for my liking underneath my makeup...  </li>
            <li> I use it at night because it is a little greasy</li>
            <li> So, now when I use it I add a little Vaseline to it.</li>
            <li> I purchased it to replace my cocunut oil to use as moisturizer / lip balm for myself and my little ones for our cold/dry northwest winters.</li>
            <li> My daughter is prone to getting a little winter eczema</li>
            <li> So I changed my mind about the little bit of greasiness</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> A little grainy, but I like it.</li>
            <li> When I got it and immediately opened it to smell and feel, I was a little put off.  </li>
            <li> They email you with little tips on how to use the shea butter.</li>
            <li> (I heat it a little and then apply it to the inside of nostrils).  </li>
            <li> The smell is nutty and a little smoky.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I put a little on my face around my eye area.</li>
            <li> This product was gritty and had a very hard consistency.  </li>
            <li> I tried using it on my hair, but I found it to be a little heavy.</li>
            <li> I only use at night because it&#x27;s very thick and does make me face look shiny.</li>
            <li> While it works, it is very thick, even after rubbing it in your hands, several times.  </li>
            <li> I guess that I am accustom to using creams because this butter is really thick, similar to a soap bar, so I can hardly take some out of the jar.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard gritty and thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used shea butter before, so it has taken me a few days to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> my dried, cracked, peeling heels&lt;br</li>
            <li> She has been using it for about a few wks now</li>
            <li> I was using pre de provence for a few years.</li>
            <li> It feels so soft n silly on the skin.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product a few days.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using it on my oily face, wow</li>
            <li> Well, after seeing how the skin of my hands improved dramatically after using the shea butter just a few times, I decided to give it a try and apply the shea butter to my face.</li>
            <li> I purchased Shea Butter to help with a few mosquito bite scars on my ankles from scratching, which I got over the summer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it in areas of chronic skin dryness, and within a few uses those problems became non-existent.</li>
            <li> I mix it with coconut oil, Olive oil, johoba oil, vitamin e oil with a few drops of lavender oil and I have my body butter.</li>
            <li> She had to have radiation treatment and a friend gave me a tin of L&#x27;Occitane shea butter to rub on her skin after each round of radiation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few weeks and my skin feels softer than ever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few reviewers who mention that it has a grainy feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of the few people who like putting oils on my skin.  </li>
            <li> After trying this a few times, it has become a holy grail product for me.  </li>
            <li> I was trying to find a natural moisturizer for my face, but they were all quite expensive and required a lot of research to see if they still contained badies.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try again since I don&#x27;t want to waste it.</li>
            <li> I use it on my feet knees, elbows, everyday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $$.</li>
            <li> Now, with that being said, I am not a huge fan of the immediate scent it has.</li>
            <li> I use it on dry patches all over my body, dry ends of my hair, my baby&#x27;s delicate skin and has helped with her eczema!!</li>
            <li> When I got it it was very stiff and felt grainy, but I think that might be partially due to the sub freezing temperatures it was transported</li>
            <li> And I use a very small amount on my hands and rub it through my HAIR to help style, tame, and moisturize my hair after I dry it.  </li>
            <li> and I take about a coin size (a little goes along way) and melt it between my hands, and apply to my tight curls!</li>
            <li> The quality of Molivera Organics exceeds my previous Shea Butter purchases!  </li>
            <li> Usually Shea butter has a slight grittiness that melts once you handle it.</li>
            <li> (I like the smell actually because I was skeptical reading some other reviews before I was introduce to this product.</li>
            <li> (I also Iike to use a little raw aloe vera with a couple drops of vegetable glycerine for her</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways as it is very thick and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I put a thin layer of Molivera Raw African Ivory Shea butter on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is a little hard and has a slight nutty smell that dissipates after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> It is a little hard and has a slight nutty smell that dissipates after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll read in other reviews (&amp; some come across negative on this point)</li>
            <li> I like it that it is just plain</li>
            <li> No strong smell.</li>
            <li> It was crumby and felt like little small pebbles.</li>
            <li> I have chronic dry skin so the skin on my face is very dull.  </li>
            <li> i put it all over my body and face (i add a little bit of Jojoba oil too, consistancy is a little bit thick)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy for a few minutes and then my skin sucks it up.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how raw Shea smells like though.</li>
            <li> I never used raw shea butter before</li>
            <li> it is truly unrefined raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend anyone looking for raw shea butter to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s raw and organic, don&#x27;t expect it to smell like a perfume.</li>
            <li> However, I received an e-mail from you with a suggestion to mix it with the Raw Shea Butter-Molivera Organics.</li>
            <li> son has eczema and I apply the raw Shea butter all over his body.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize what raw unrefined shea butter was.</li>
            <li> After my shower tonight I baby my skin with this Raw Organic Shea Butter from Molivera Organics.</li>
            <li> my skin felt like it was raw all over.  </li>
            <li> This is raw which is grainy</li>
            <li> but honestly, raw to your face (areas around the eye, mouth etc.) is all I need.  </li>
            <li> a little more&lt;br /&gt;7.add to container!  </li>
            <li> This is a little thick, that is to say, not like like store bought lotions.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this product.</li>
            <li> It has a very earthy scent, which isn&#x27;t bad, but if you&#x27;re not a fan, you could add some fragrance oils.</li>
            <li> No magic, some products work on some people skin,</li>
            <li> I apply it in small sections after applying my leave in conditioner and water and coconut oil</li>
            <li> then shea butters I&#x27;ve used in the past, again probably because it&#x27;s organic/unrefined.</li>
            <li> I scoop out a small amount with my finger and rub into my palm to melt.</li>
            <li> I HAVE APPLIED IT TO MY HANDS EVERY NIGHT FOR THE PAST WEEK,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought shea butter in the past and just couldn&#x27;t get past having to dig it out of the jar and rub it between my palms in order to apply.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> Not sure why I never heard about shea butter sooner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was because it was a holiday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to those expensive, chemical lotions since finding this product.</li>
            <li> and sometimes I get small allergy rashes on my face.</li>
            <li> I even put small amounts in my hair after I condition it.</li>
            <li> soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always used lotions with shea butter in them in the past (jergens, etc.)</li>
            <li> No more dryness.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t that fake yellow stuff you find in the stores that makes you itch.  </li>
            <li> Not really satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Not much more to say than that.  </li>
            <li> I keep a small tin in my purse to use in place of HAND LOTION and chap stick.  </li>
            <li> I usually need to mix shea butter with oil to reach a texture that I can rub into my skin.  </li>
            <li> and she usually hates everything.  </li>
            <li> This shea butter is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this products for a few weeks, and now I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it!</li>
            <li> My kids have been using it for the past weekend</li>
            <li> My skin became DRY !!!!!!</li>
            <li> it does&#x27;t smell like many of the other brand lotions that have artificial and chemical crap fragrances added to this.</li>
            <li> Other reviews mention an unpleasant gritty quality--I did not experience this at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy and makes skin look shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The very faint smell of this raw product goes away in minutes and becomes completely transparent.</li>
            <li> The seal was broken which I think is due to the heat.</li>
            <li> My son has horrible eczema and Shea butter seems to be the only thing that helps him....and fast.</li>
            <li> I have been breaking out for years and was getting super frustrated with it!</li>
            <li> The shea butter is pale ivory with a subtle nutty scent.</li>
            <li> this raw shea butter is very thick and firm.</li>
            <li> It is quite bad even if, as other reviewers have said, it is not especially persistent.</li>
            <li> This has a very faint natural smell to it.  </li>
            <li> Between the dry cold winters and all the painting I do, my hands are always a mess.  </li>
            <li> and I plan on using it as a face cream as well as for my granddaughter who is troubled with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It is very thick and takes a little while to set into the skin.</li>
            <li> Too hard to put on.</li>
            <li> The butter is literally just that, rock hard butter.</li>
            <li> I use to have these little bumps on around my arm which I use to be  a little insecure about.</li>
            <li> It was hard, felt sticky (even though it is not)  </li>
            <li> The Shea butter is hard packed and crumbly in texture.</li>
            <li> Since shea butter is hard, I find it easier to get out</li>
            <li> The grainy texture makes it somewhat hard to use.</li>
            <li> although kinda hard to melt like everyone claims</li>
            <li> which was main reason th@ I purchased it besides it being Organic .....  :(</li>
            <li> and I heard grainy and hard but never</li>
            <li> this is so hard I can&#x27;t scoop it out of jar and spreading on my  body</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to lather it all over the body because it&#x27;s a cream</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my face at all--not even under the delicate eye area.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smell was tolerable , at least for me .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands and developed a nasty itchy rash on my hands.</li>
            <li> I ordered in hopes that at least I&#x27;d be getting a moisturizer with no petroleum and bonus</li>
            <li> When I gave my 3/4 used container to a friend whose child suffers from skin disorders, I decided to try a different brand.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers on here have complained about grittiness, but if you take the time to melt the shea butter by rubbing it in the palm of your hands</li>
            <li> This product does not remedy the breakouts, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t add to them the way I was afraid it might.</li>
            <li> This butter sits on your skin and slowly absorbs all day to keep your tummy, hips etc well moisturized.</li>
            <li> So thick that it is difficulty to apply.  </li>
            <li> Its a thick product so just patting onto will keep you from tugging at your face.</li>
            <li> Thick but not oily.</li>
            <li> I like the thick layer of moisture it puts on.</li>
            <li> It is thick</li>
            <li> I will never use any other moisturizer on my face again!!!!</li>
            <li> I have abandoned all the other expensive products at the department store.</li>
            <li> I will be using this everyday!!</li>
            <li> I mean I&#x27;ve been using this thing for like 3 months</li>
            <li> Unbelievable product!  </li>
            <li> I bought this to use for my baby, but I cannot get past the smell!</li>
            <li> A friend introduced me to Shea butter, and I thought it was weird since how thick it was and how the smell was a bit odd.</li>
            <li> Seems a little to hard to work with because of texture, may have ordered wrong</li>
            <li> It is a difficult smell to pin down.</li>
            <li> My sister suffers from really dry skin</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s so cold and dry.</li>
            <li> less expensive brands than the Molivera organics.</li>
            <li> I am using this shea butter on my face now that the cold, dry weather is here.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in bed for over two years from back surgery gone bad.</li>
            <li> I had some bad acne and this shea butter has cleared it up faster than any topical prescription I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This can be a pro or con depending on what you&#x27;re looking for (i.e. its not good for legs, since it sits on the surface of your skin like a glaze and fuzz/dog hair sticks to it)</li>
            <li> My introduction to shea butter came a few years ago when my daughter was ill.  </li>
            <li> OMG, the smell is NOT good.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not very pleasant, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin, so don&#x27;t worry!</li>
            <li> so so when it came it was frozen (sat out in extreme cold).  </li>
            <li> The product arrived hard as a brick!</li>
            <li> this was hard as a brick !</li>
            <li> It smells a bit like raw hazelnuts but slightly stale.</li>
            <li> My skin was just awful, acne scars , rough scaly skin, and stretch marks everywhere (the white ones).</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my terribly dry,cracking hands needed!</li>
            <li> No more spending hundreds of dollars on complicated skin products.</li>
            <li> But it turns out it is very hard to get out of the container,</li>
            <li> It is very thick, but once applied, leaves your skin moisturized for hours.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick</li>
            <li> Very thick.</li>
            <li> The material in the jar is quite hard and difficult to spread.  </li>
            <li> This stuff moisturizers really well and isn&#x27;t greasy, but it smells awful.</li>
            <li> Her poor knees are always inflamed and it looks like the eczema was moving to her cheeks.  </li>
            <li> lid was broken, but that did not bother me.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this one.</li>
            <li> have read plenty of bad reviews of other brands.</li>
            <li> I am an older woman &amp; i hate the way my skin is changing!</li>
            <li> but only before bed Bc it smells so bad!</li>
            <li> I put it on the ends of my hair, makes it real thick.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s a bad jar or if this is how it always is.</li>
            <li> I mean everything about the product and company says QUALITY!!  </li>
            <li> Quality of this Shea Butter is unbelievable!!!</li>
            <li> I could be wrong.</li>
            <li> It will make it worse!</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I tried homemade sugar scrubs, coconut oil, and expensive organic lotions.</li>
            <li> However, I failed to notice the ring that formed around my calves because of them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s difficult to get it to a spreadable consistency.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this shea butter dries my skin.</li>
            <li> and I have tried all products in the market, expensive and not so expensive and they would not work on my combination skin.</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because it seems unfair to take any off for features (texture and smell) that did not come as a surprise.</li>
            <li> You can ditch any expensive eye creams and use this instead.</li>
            <li> Smells, weird to me, but I don&#x27;t know what shea butter should smell like.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with it if it&#x27;s your cup of tea.  </li>
            <li> I am looking forward to using this on my hair; I have used it as makeup remover and moisturizer and my face have not even broken out!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so difficult</li>
            <li> Not impressed!  </li>
            <li> What added to my frustration is how difficult it was to apply it on your skin.</li>
            <li> The odor smells really weird.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really awful and near impossible to use.  </li>
            <li> Every other ointment, lotion or concoction on my eczema has made it miserably itchy.</li>
            <li> , i.e., mix it with other oils to mask that awful smell.</li>
            <li> Coming from a family that suffers from skin rashes.</li>
            <li> Protects from the cold weather as well.  </li>
            <li> We were using coconut oil for lotion but that just wasn&#x27;t cutting it now</li>
            <li> It was colder weather when I received it, and it had a grainy feeling, much to my disappointment.</li>
            <li> Needless to say,  I&#x27;m returning it ASAP!</li>
            <li> Make the purchase, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad batch, but the one I received was rancid, dried up, and smelled awful.  </li>
            <li> Does not have an overpowering unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I canceled an order for a very expensive brand of hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li> or it was a bad seal.</li>
            <li> Got this for a friend with bad skin issues.</li>
            <li> and I must say, she haven&#x27;t made any bad comments or remarks about the product.</li>
            <li> Not too bad I guess.</li>
            <li> This smelled so bad, I threw it away.</li>
            <li> and I am not as frustrated trying to dig it out of the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its so moisturizing i was shocked.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed, just follow the instructions on how to store</li>
            <li> If u decide to try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 days and my stretch marks are disappearing like crazy!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> SO DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> It has been a brutal winter and this Shea butter has helped maintain my skin moisture.</li>
            <li> I also made a bug repellent salve (from the Body Unburdened website).</li>
            <li> very disappointed</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed!!!!!</li>
            <li> It smells HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> The horrible flakiness on my torso and legs is gone.</li>
            <li> I have the worst hair in the world.  </li>
            <li> I have terrible eczema</li>
            <li> Horrible!!...</li>
            <li> Sun screen is supposed to be terrible for you</li>
            <li> I am 36 and my skin is the worst it has ever been.</li>
            <li> The worst part was when I took the rest of the lid off to smell it...</li>
            <li> and then just threw it away because the scent was so awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is AMAZING. I used to use coconut oil and vit E oils at night to help hydrate and breath new life into my skin and although they were great, the hydration seemed very short term. I have been using this for 2weeks and not only FEEL the difference but see it too. The process is a little inconvenient but worth its weight in gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am 43 and starting to show the effects of &amp;#34;gravity&amp;#34; and the little tell tell signs of aging I needed to start to combat the loss of collagen and adipose. With any body oil, to include the Shea Butter, once it is slathered on (not wiping off the excess) you are oily and everything sticks to you. And if you apply it all the way up your neck the ends of your hair gets greasy too. In order to keep the benefits without having to minimize the effects of the oils I have mastered the art of my night time routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soooooo......at night after I shower and shave I do indeed slather this oil all over my body to include up my neck all the way underneath my chin. I really take the time to massage it in on the trouble areas and then while still slick, no kidding, I put on a pair of fleece jammies that I have designated as my &amp;#34;oil pair&amp;#34; so that I don&#x27;t ruin anything else. The fleece holds the oils on my skin and I can sit or lay down without spreading the oil on everything. It was weird at first because the fabric clings a little due to the oil but by the end of the first week my skin had become so hydrated and soft that I didn&#x27;t need to do it every night like I did with coconut oil. I oiled and covered up with coconut oil too and only got half of the benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying this product has been a godsend. I use half the amount of product and the results are better, last longer, and the price is right. Now, with that being said, I am not a huge fan of the immediate scent it has. It smells a bit like raw hazelnuts but slightly stale. It is a difficult smell to pin down. It does dissipate once it soaks intoyour skin though so don&#x27;t worry about that when you first try it. It almost scared my away but trust me, it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. AND if you find you just cant stand it, add a pinch of your favorite essential oil to it and that is all you will smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this. If you have the time to oil up and wrap up.......you will not be disappointed!!!!! I will finish this jug and write an update about how it does after a full month.</li>
            <li> Feels just right.  Keep in a dry place.  Think this product will last for a longtime.</li>
            <li> This is such a fantastic product. I use it in the shower as a skin conditioner and it works incredibly well not only for dry skin. This is a staple in my beauty regiment and since I discovered how essential is for my mid forty skin I have abandoned all the other expensive products at the department store. This Shea butter works much much better at the fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;The nutty smell is amazing and  my skin head to toe is hydrated and nourished all day long. I am a fan for life. What a marvelous product. If you want an amazing facial mask  mix the Shea butter with the 99% percent Aloe Vera wait 5 minutes remove the excess with a damp cloth and enjoy your suppled, refreshed skin.</li>
            <li> OMG Shea Butter, where have you been all my life? I have just now discovered this amazing butter, and nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried before has made my skin so soft, nourished and moisturized. Not even coconut oil or other recommended natural oils. This is so rich, so creamy -- it is heavenly. I put this on my face, hands, and entire body. It feels sticky at first, so I only do this at night. It really stays on your skin and doesn&#x27;t evaporate, so my thirsty skin really gets the treatment it needs. I wake up with soft supple skin. This product is pure and unrefined which is crucial for me. I even love the packaging, it makes me happy to see this jar in my bathroom. I use a wooden crafts stick to get the butter out so I don&#x27;t leave bacteria from my fingers in the jar. Thank you for this beautiful product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!!! Beyond my expectations! Super hydrating, not sticky at all, absorbs very well. This butter makes your skin so soft, and supple. I feel my skin tighter on my arms and hands, and my brown spots are getting lighter. It also to great care on my cracked heals, I&#x27;m always in fli-flops.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used shea butter before, so it has taken me a few days to get used to it. I&#x27;m finding it a great, versatile product for extremely dry skin. It also makes a great lip balm. I like how this company packages the product - the production date is clearly marked on the seal. That was impressive. Plus it&#x27;s a great buy because a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Amazin&amp;#34; there&#x27;s no need to second guess yourself this is the real deal. I absolutely love this product it is super official I use it for both my hair an body. highly recommended and I will be purchasing more as soon as I run out.</li>
            <li> Excellent shea butter by Molivera Organics it keeps my skin &amp; hair feeling smooth, soft, &amp; beautiful plus I LOVE it&#x27;s smell! Great job guys, you really hit the nail on the head with this product! -Signed a more than satisfied customer :)</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer. It is light and smooth to apply. There is no oily residue after use.</li>
            <li> I had found some local shea butter in smaller amounts that was very smooth on my lips, so thought I would buy some online.  All of the on-line products were a bit gritty (otherwise very nice).  The local one I bought (much more expensive) was very smooth right aways and I have felt comfortable applying on my lips.</li>
            <li> Did not see any changes but did not caused allergic reaction</li>
            <li> I got this for my lip balm making adventures and it&#x27;s great. I read some reviews about smell... don&#x27;t hesitate the smeil is perfect. The consitancy is as well. Perhaps those reviewers haven&#x27;t really purchased something like this before or it was a bad seal. I will certainly be back for more.</li>
            <li> It is certainly the pure Shea Butter. I can tell from the color and texture. Usually, the pure Shea butter doesn&#x27;t smell all that good. So, i usually mix it with another oil that smells nice, such as coconut oil, lavendar oil, or cocoa oil. When i mix this Shea Butter with any of these oils, the smell is absolutely nice and it works perfectly on your skin, making it softer and smoother like baby&#x27;s skin. Great stuff. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My skin has been dry and flaky since we&#x27;ve had the heater on and this works better to keep my skin soft than any creams or lotions I have tried.</li>
            <li> this is a nice shea butter,white and creamy,i like it but i dont like the gritty bits,i suppose because all shea butter has that quality(i think), i melted it and sieved the oil,then i whipped it with some oil,it works much better for me now,will repurchase this brand as it was fresh and good quality.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.  It&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my skin supple and not crepe.  This is a very high quality raw, unrefined shea butter but isn&#x27;t gritty and will melt with the heat from you hand.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is smooth and thick in texture with a fresh nutty scent. It applies very easy as a body moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little less than a week and so far I am very satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend it if you are looking for an all natural moisturizer and you can always add your own fragrance if you want with essential oils. It also gives my skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li> Bought it hopes that it&#x27;d help my psoriasis, it didn&#x27;t really. I&#x27;m sure that it would be useful for other things, but it left my skin feeling so oily! And it was a kind of oily that didn&#x27;t even wash away with soap and water. It did reduce some of the redness, but not for long. I have a huge tub of it just sitting under my counter, maybe I can find a use for it, better start searching.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is the best I&#x27;ve ever used!  A great product for healing and making your skin look its best.  I will definitely be restocking this one.</li>
            <li> good service, great product....</li>
            <li> Has worked well for us,and have been able to find several uses for it. A little goes a long way, which is great if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! The smell others have talked about is minimal...it keeps my VERY dry and itchy skin moisturized all day. That hasn&#x27;t been the case for any other oil/cream I&#x27;ve tried.... Coconut, emu, argan, rx&#x27;s, other Shea butters, nothing has worked like this!  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product.</li>
            <li> It is a great moisturizing I use it every day to moisturize my face and body, it keeps the moist all day long.  I rub it into my hands and apply it to my skin at the beginning I feel kind of grease but then I enjoy the moist.</li>
            <li> I love the Shea Butter!  I originally bought it to combine with coconut oil, olive oil, and lavender oil for a shaving cream.  I have found that this combination is also a great body lotion.  So smooth and creamy!  I can&#x27;t wait to use it with other ingredients as well.  My husband is a beekeeper and I think it would also be great combined with honey and beeswax. I love the idea of using natural ingredients for my skin care products. Let the healing begin!</li>
            <li> Pure, raw Shea Butter. Fresh. Warms in hands to spread easily. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> People I work with love it!  I ended up getting it for me and several people.&lt;br /&gt;They are using it for split skin around their fingers, very dry ezema, someone&lt;br /&gt;is even using it for her diabetic husband&#x27;s foot.</li>
            <li> Love it! It leaves my skin extremely moisturized and my skin feels super soft! Also, the company has great customer service and emailed me in reference to see how I felt about the product a few weeks after I received it. The representative promptly answered my questions and was very polite! She appreciated my inquisitiveness and kind words pertaining to the item and gave me a coupon for my next order of the Shea butter. Awesome right?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps: no Elephant ivory was used in the making of this product. It is only called ivory because of the color of the Shea butter due to the usual yellow color of Shea butter. (This was the question I emailed the rep considering how elephants are endangered) no elephants were harmed in the making of this product! :)</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> This shea butter is amazing! It&#x27;s so soft and smooth and you can tell nothing was added due to the scent being light and mild unlike so many others. I used this on my whole body including my hair and it has works wonders for split ends! A little really does does a long way and the sellers really go above and beyond to ensure you receive, store and get the best results from their product. Overall will definitely be buying again</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter. Makes my skin feel great and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> My 2nd jar. This stuff lasts a long time and feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this organic shea butter. I will be buying more. Great service.</li>
            <li> I used this to make homemade whipped body lotion and love it.  Just as I expected.</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly and is just as described.</li>
            <li> My sister suffers from really dry skin and she said that it is the best cream she ever tried.  It is also natural so you don&#x27;t have to worry about absorbing chemicals through your skin.  The only downside is that it is not as easy to apply as other conventional creams, but it does the job.  I would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I definitely would not buy this again.  This is grainy and sticky.  It&#x27;s really awful and near impossible to use.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great she butter. Grainy but amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Would totally recommend it and the seller is terrific!</li>
            <li> Used it to make pomade, it&#x27;s pretty good quality</li>
            <li> Use for hair and skin</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to make DIY lotions and lip balms that I&#x27;ve seen all over pinterest. I&#x27;m pleased to say that my first batch of lip balm came out amazing. I gave some to my sister in law and she asked &amp;#34;Where did you get this magical stuff?&amp;#34; It gave a luciouse feel to my lips and they&#x27;re now so soft, even in this weather where the heater is running nonstop. I&#x27;d normally have chapped lips by now!&lt;br /&gt;As you&#x27;ll read in other reviews (&amp; some come across negative on this point) this raw shea butter is very thick and firm. This hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me since it softens nicely though from the warmth of your hand and spreads evenly over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Based on the product description and many of the reviews I read prior to making my selection and purchase I am very satisfied with my decision. I&#x27;d recommend this product!</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I have horrid dry skin and this is great... Smell is yuck but fades after a bit, so not too horrid. Good stuff, great brand</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!! Used a tiny pea sized amount on my face, after a shower. A little goes a long way!! Rub between your fingers or in the palm of your hand, to melt it. It isn&#x27;t greasy, and smells fine. I will be using this everyday!!</li>
            <li> Good quality..would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Unrefined raw shea butter, this product is markedly superior than any other I have used to treat inflammed chapped skin.  I would highly recommend this over any other because of its value and high quality.  This will replace my visits to the local store.  Cannot get this size and quality product elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter!!  Great price too!! Will refer and buy again, and again!!</li>
            <li> First of all, this stuff is great!  Second of all, the seller emails you to make sure you received it, tells you how to use it effectively, &amp; follows up to make sure you are satisfied! I will be buying this product for years to come! Love it!</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is amazing, and has a very pleasant texture and smell. I use it in our homeade deodorant, as well as directly on skin and lips!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I make homemade body lotions by mixing in coconut oil and this shea butter, with some essential oil for fragrance. It feels wonderful on my skin and is easy to smooth on once it&#x27;s blended with some coconut oil - Natalie</li>
            <li> I use to make whipped Shea butter with additional oils and scents. No problems. High quality product. Will order again once item has ran out.</li>
            <li> Very high quality and reasonable price for quantity.  Nothing else helps like shea butter does.  Molivera will be my brand of choice from now on.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I use on whole body after shower. Truly hydrating, wonderful product</li>
            <li> My mom is around the 55 yrs old.  In the winter season along with the wind  she develop a very dry skin only on the face, her cheeks and near to the mouth area, the skin always peel.  Even with Almond, Coconut, Castor or Grape Seed Oil,  for some reason on my mother&#x27;s face will work for just for couple hours, once the oil penetrate the skin the surface will dry a lot, you can even see a white peel skin.  Anyway I read reviews on this product, some customer said not real shea butter, some other said rancid, and other people said  Good, so I got for my mom, she tried and just a week her face feeling and also the appearence look better.  To be the first week of usage she says feel better and its really working on her face.  No magic, some products work on some people skin, some other&#x27;s not.  My mom is happy and that&#x27;s all what it matter to me.</li>
            <li> This has been so helpful for my 6 yr old daughter and myself. We have issues with excessive dry skin and eczema. It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever purchased something like this. Just be sure to follow the directions on taking care of it. The company sends an email about how to do this as well as how to use it. They are really helpful. It is not like putting on lotion, because it is only ONE wonderful ingredient. I keep small amounts in small jars, take out a little bit of it, let my natural body/skin heat start to break it down, then rub it in. It&#x27;s nice to find a great moisturizer with only one ingredient. Not only do I use it on our hands/dry skin, but also as a facial moisturizer day and night. I feel like my skin is looking better.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST 100% PURE natural shea butter I&#x27;ve bought to date!  It truly is the BEST way to moisturize and a little goes a long way!  Will certainly be a repeat customer!  I&#x27;ve tried other brands - NO COMPARISON!  Molivera IS TOP quality. Consistent product - I&#x27;ve ordered several times :)</li>
            <li> I first experienced this product 14 years ago when I had my hair put in braids by African women. Currently I have been using it to moisturized my scalp while wearing Senegalese twists.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and wonderful after i tried it on. Even after a nice shower, I can feel that my skin is so much snother. I will definitely get some more when I run out!</li>
            <li> excellent quality. i tried another brand and like this one much more.</li>
            <li> We have tried everything for my 16 month old&#x27;s son&#x27;s dry cracking skin. This definitely does the trick. He has started asking for it after bath time and before bed!</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter.  It moisturizes my hands so well and the skin feels so smooth after the shea butter absorbs.  It absorbs within a minute or two.....it&#x27;s worth the wait!  Molivera Organics sent me a follow-up e-mail with tips and information about their product.  Very professional company and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product use it everyday in my hair because it is so dry it keeps it soft and moisturized from the hot sun</li>
            <li> Just started using product. Very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent service and helpful tips.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Great service and love this product.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love it :) I have used this butter on my face every day since I got it.</li>
            <li> This is very much in a &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; state...not like your typical lotion...however I love it.  At first there seemed to be a raw like smell, maybe being new...but it dissipates and it doesn&#x27;t have that smell after using it.  I have sensitive skin and am very picky with what I put on my face..however I absolutely love this product and will only use this on my face and body especially my feet...its that great.  I had a black n blue on my arm from giving blood and normally it takes me a long time to heal..but it seemed to heal much faster with the butter.  It is true as others say and this product lasts a while.  Totally worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Got this for a friend with bad skin issues. I checked it out seems really good quality &amp; smells better than the oil, still has that bizarre light smell. Thick, smooth consistency seems like good stuff. Says it works great but needed to actually use something from doc for the eczema he has. O well, still, good stuff for normal skin care, then.</li>
            <li> Easily melts as you apply it to your skin.  It has a mild nutty scent and leaves me feeling soft all day.</li>
            <li> I am always pleased with this product! This is my second time ordering it and it won&#x27;t be my last!!!! I have seen a dramatic increase in moisture in my hair and skin from use and it always gets to me right on time and well wrapped!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and goes a long way when you mix with your favorite oil and whip it I got to fill this jar up plus another container well worth the purchase and I will be purchasing again as soon as I run out</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the scent. Very nutty. That&#x27;s how raw Shea smells like though. I will in the future go back to the &amp;#34;now Shea&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s smoother and unscented.</li>
            <li> First shea butter purchase, and I&#x27;m not disappointed! Will buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> Seems a little to hard to work with because of texture, may have ordered wrong</li>
            <li> Wear this butter overnight .. skin feels very soft ..</li>
            <li> excited to make creams out of this</li>
            <li> Amazing shea butter. Great for face, baby&#x27;s bottom, dry skin you name it! Amazing!</li>
            <li> Received product promptly and I love how soft my skin feels. Using on my hard feet and they are now soft!</li>
            <li> Best product ever!!! Keeps skin nice and smooth</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of natural beauty and cruelty free items.  I was nervous to use this product initially because of some of the negative reviews i&#x27;ve read, however this is a new favorite of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin with blackheads on my nose and pimples that will form on my forehead. shea butter is not a miracle salve, but i&#x27;ve been using it with tea tree oil and my skin is MUCH less dry (used to use yes to blueberries line), and my pores are not any worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have very dry hands from nursing school and being a barista: the constant hand washing KILLS my skin and nails. I&#x27;ve been putting the shea butter on my hands with socks at night and it&#x27;s as effective as burts bees cuticle cream and lush&#x27;s ultra balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a last thing I have used this for is my hair. I have roots growing out so a third of my hair is normal, and the rest is bleached and VERY damaged and dry. I have tried everything from Ion&#x27;s repairing treatment, it&#x27;s a 10 mask, and the organix brand.  the only thing that have worked for me are the Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Mask as daily conditioner, and weekly coconut oil (roots) and sheabutter (ends) both with lavender essential oil.  I have only had this product two full weeks, but I love it and have gotten my sister hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: if the smell does put you off, I find that lavender or peppermint essential oils really cover up the earthiness (not too bad once you get used to it ;]  )</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE!!!! This is an amazing product!! A little goes a long way. My skin has never felt or looked better!</li>
            <li> I got it before I even expected it. It is the skin product that everybody needs if you want to have Beautiful skin. I&#x27;m Loving it. I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing pure Shea butter. My wife loves it!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful natural seed oil at a very reasonable price. It arrived quickly as well.</li>
            <li> This is amazing!! I used it in a hair mask and it left my hair incredibly soft and smooth! Great for curly hair! I also made an all natural hair mouse with Shea butter and it was amazing as well! The product arrived in time and they followed up with an email on information about how to use your Shea butter! Very nice!</li>
            <li> Molivera&#x27;s Ivory Shea butter is your skins bestfriend!  Try some all over.  It&#x27;s a great product.  I will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> I use this on my lips, as I have an occasional outbreak of eczema on my lips due to the weather, allergies and dry skin. It really does work wonders. It&#x27;s non gritty and adds great moisture without the build-up. I highly recommend it for anyone with dry skin or eczema.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed using this product with my essential oils.  It take a minute to loosen up but I realized If I rub my  hands together till they are hot then place the Shea butter in my hands it melts much more rapidly:) I have used it on my body skin  with no reactions and my skin feels smoother...</li>
            <li> My son has eczema on his face. This worked wonders. Also, my heels get all cracked and dry from wearing sandals. Smoothed them right out. My wife has started to use this all over the place for lots of things. I think she was using it in her hair from something she read... I could be wrong. This + Coconut oil has kind of become our go-to​ for everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* eczema on my son&#x27;s face&lt;br /&gt;* my dried, cracked, peeling heels&lt;br /&gt;* mosquito bites</li>
            <li> Works amazing on my harsh dry hands ... Can feel the difference as soon as I apply the first time.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.  Works way better than coconut oil, which dries out my skin</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many expensive creams but it stops here!  This Shea butter feels so luxurious on my skin and it&#x27;s all natural - no harsh chemicals.  It arrived ahead of schedule and carefully packaged.  I will most definitely order it again. Thank you Molivera.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!  I received it the next day. The container was packed to the rim. The smell somewhat reminds me of Palmer cocoa butter.  It seems thick at first but it soaks right into the skin.  You just have to rub it together between your palms to help heat it up before applying to the skin.  My son&#x27;s pediatrician recommended this product for his eczema. He is 1 years old so I like knowing that this product is pure Shea butter &amp; has no chemicals added. I sometimes use unrefined coconut oil but this product provides better moisture than the coconut oil. It has a thickness to it leaving both our skin soft without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Great Service and Quality</li>
            <li> Brown spots gone...strech marks vanishing.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this product so far. When I first tried it, i was shocked by how much like butter it really is. The product is very easy to use and apply. In addition, it is not necessary to use a large amount. I find that a great benefit also. Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Too hard to put on. It is so dry it crumbles as you try to apply it.</li>
            <li> So silky smooth. I made my own body butter and I live it!</li>
            <li> NIce quality Shea butter.  Love the container and doesn&#x27;t smell like some others.  Also very good customer service.  Have already recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It helped heal my dry hands quickly.</li>
            <li> Great!  Be sure to buy a scoop or something to get the product out of the tub!</li>
            <li> I use this product for my hair, skin, and on my husband who is diabetic and his skin is dry and ichy, this makes a big difference and keeps him moisturized. You have to keep wet hands out of the product, but just put some in another small container and use it as a lip balm. I also mix this with other oils for my face, i am 59 and find this to help with softening wrinkles, soothing dryness in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and will be purchasing more, there is so much you can use this for.</li>
            <li> I have been using The Body Shop for 10 years, and after trying this product I am switching over to Molivera for life. The moisturizing effects last longer than any other body butter, and it is clearly high quality. This is the softest my skin has been</li>
            <li> Honestly I purchased this for my girlfriend due to her pregnancy. She wanted something that has great reviews so I stumbled upon this brand and I must say, she haven&#x27;t made any bad comments or remarks about the product. She has been using it for about a few wks now and she&#x27;s quite please with the results this far...would I recommend, I strongly do!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed, just follow the instructions on how to store and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replenish my original Shea Butter that I received as a gift. Although it is different&lt;br /&gt;(softer and seems slightly whipped) I like it very much. I seems to melt into your skin better than my old product. The price was great and the customer service was amazing. Great overall transaction experience.</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is amazing. The shipping was fast. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Shipping was quick and easy! Will order again. Great quality!</li>
            <li> This Shea butter has made my skin very smooth. The reason for 3 stars? It smells HORRIBLE. I would not go out in public wearing this. It smells like black licorice mixed with dirt. I may have to send it back. I can always get another product that smells good and is just as good of quality.</li>
            <li> Purchased in order to make natural eczema salve for my grandson...successful results with one application. Price, delivery and results cause me to keep this as a future supplier.</li>
            <li> It is very thick, but once applied, leaves your skin moisturized for hours.  I love how it is all natural as I don&#x27;t use any products with petroleum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product itself is wonderful, however I can not get past the smell.  Also, I have a hard time getting it to melt enough in my hands to rub onto skin.  It&#x27;s pretty much a pain to apply.</li>
            <li> I used this during my second pregnancy. No stretch marks this time! Plus it helped to fade marks from my first pregnancy. It was the only thing I could put on that kept my belly from getting itchy.</li>
            <li> Great product, no complaints whatsoever! Doesn&#x27;t smell weirdly how some other reviews stated, and most of all it does help heal my extremely dry skin. Thank you Molivera!</li>
            <li> I have a love/hate relationship with ingredient labels as most things marked &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; include many ingredients that I can&#x27;t pronounce and appear to be anything but natural. I have been searching for a truly natural hair and skin moisturizer for my family with no fragrances, no synthetics, no added anything.&lt;br /&gt;I happened to come across this product in a generic search for &amp;#34;pure shea butter.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;After trying it now for a few weeks, I am in love!  Not only is there seriously, honest-to-goodness ONE ingredient in the container; it does wonders for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I have kids, so I&#x27;m last on the list for many things, which is really no big deal!  I haven&#x27;t had a pedicure in years, and my feet used to show it. Not anymore!  I use it religiously for my hair, body, and feet specifically.&lt;br /&gt;Also works wonders for a barrier when cloth diapering!&lt;br /&gt;On top of all that, this wonderful company acknowledged my content with their product and gifted me a $2 coupon on my next order.&lt;br /&gt;You know where/what I&#x27;ll be ordering when I run out of this bottle!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.. 👍</li>
            <li> Great stuff, with great delivery time</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it!  Very pure shea butter and we use it for everything!  Face, body, lips (I even make lip balm with it).  Especially good for dry winter skin.  Highly recommend it and will purchase again in the future.  Fair price too compared to stores in my town. Took an extra day for shipping (3 days vs. 2 day prime) but thats not a big deal to me.</li>
            <li> I love this. So far it&#x27;s the only product that I&#x27;ve tried on my natural hair that really seals in moisture. And days later my hair is still moisturized but not greasy. A little goes a long way. I never used raw shea butter before so I was a little weary of the texture. Just rub a tiny bit on fingers and then it melts. I apply it in small sections after applying my leave in conditioner and water and coconut oil it seals it in. My hair doesn&#x27;t absorb moisture easily so without the shea butter on top of the coconut oil and water my hair would feel dry.</li>
            <li> I love it !!! thank You! Great Job</li>
            <li> This was my first shea butter product and i was happy when i saw it was ivory in color and not white or yellow as this is proof its pure and unprocessed. Like most original butters its a bit hard but easily melts in your palms for easy application on body or hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is its original smell, as its a product derived from nuts it has a strong nutty smell and so this can be a problem for most people however since i was aware of this before hand i had also ordered some rose oil that i mixed into my butter and this helped alot</li>
            <li> I love this product but would like suggestions as to how to soften it for use. I have googled it but I think it would be helpful if you included this with your product.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great Stuff! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own lotions, mixing with coconut oil and essential oils. Smells fine and I like consistency.</li>
            <li> This is, so far, the best shea butter I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s much smoother and goes on thinner than other brands. I don&#x27;t feel it leaves as much of a residue on my clothes, either. Nice smell, texture...it&#x27;s a great product. Thank you, Molivera!</li>
            <li> I love it but I will have to tell you on May 13 on how it worked for me.</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with this! It&#x27;s great!!! I received it two days after they packaged it. Very happy with company and product</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is excellent. It is far SUPERIOR in quality to the top selling &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; brand of Shea Butter from L&#x27;Occitane, which I have used for the past 15 years. I am pleased with this brand and plan to order more for my family members.</li>
            <li> Do NOT put this on your face if you have hormonal/cystic acne! It will make it worse!</li>
            <li> Best Shea Butter ever, love it.</li>
            <li> I was using pre de provence for a few years. This brand is slightly granier but no difference except that and the price. For a few dollars more I get 3 times as much! Thank you.</li>
            <li> very useful oil and I love it how it feels.</li>
            <li> Great product! It was exactly what I needed to make my lotions! Customer service from Molivera sent me an email check to make sure I received the package on time and also included a description of uses, I was really impressed.</li>
            <li> We are in love with this product. We use it to mix it with coconut oil plus essential oils.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, GREAT quality.  I will be re-ordering this. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really used it that much.  But so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.product was just as advertised. Seems like quite a liberal amount for the price, and I like that it is pure Shea butter without anything added.</li>
            <li> Just as described.  Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> good product. I used it to produce a homemade doedorant and much more</li>
            <li> I mixed some of this with some Lavender essential oil and it makes a nice salve!</li>
            <li> Great shea butter! It arrived quickly and in great shape.  The price for the size is fantastic too. I can get so much more for less via Amazon than my local health food store. I use it to make lotions with or just slap it on!!!  Very happy with this product!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like leftover grease that&#x27;s been sitting in a frying pan!! It doesn&#x27;t spread easily either. I read reviews and I&#x27;m still gonna use it but only before bed Bc it smells so bad! I put it on my face the first time I used it and had to wipe it off around my nose so I couldn&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li> I was not sure this before I ordered, but I love it. I mostly use it for my hair, but I feel the difference each and every time I use it. I would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Use this as an ingredient to a homemade cuticle cream and am loving it!  Plus I have so much of this that I can make more things!</li>
            <li> Pure unrefined ivory african shea butter from Ghana....the real deal. Exactly what I expected. Recommend and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Very nice for making body butters that you can customize.  I will also try using this as a hair conditioner from time to time.</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite thing ever!! I love coconut oil and use it daily on my girls and I, but needed something a little more creamier and thicker that was all natural that wouldn&#x27;t break out my two-month-old and my 2 1/2 year-old skin and I found it😃 I will be buying more over and over again. So so happy I found this company</li>
            <li> Received in excellent condition. Nice a smooth texture. Thanks!</li>
            <li> My shea butter arrived on time,  I love the packaging,  and the jar.  It works well and I plan on using it as a face cream as well as for my granddaughter who is troubled with dry skin.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> The texture in the jar looks like a dense scrub, but when you carve it out and rub it between your palms, it&#x27;s almost like a melted wax texture. I swear this substance is magic. It is very thick and takes a little while to set into the skin. Also has an odd, nearly burnt nut smell to it. Overall, the product works. I have to get past the smell and process of acquiring the right texture, but it almost instantly took care of my dry legs and rough skin patches. I&#x27;ve spent so much money on designer creams that work, but this really does a surprisingly great job at moisturizing and evening skin tone.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Just as described and what I needed for my DIY beauty products.</li>
            <li> this work very good on my skin i love it and i well use in all</li>
            <li> Mine doesn&#x27;t look my the usual shea butter - with the yellowish color, mine is more whitish and not easily spreadable (you know how usual shea butter melts quickly in your hands).  I don&#x27;t really like the smell either.  I bought it because I&#x27;m natural and wanted to use it for my hair, instead I use it for my skin</li>
            <li> This has helped prevent my skin from dryness during the winter months and it is all natural. I have replaced all my jack black products for this wonderful product. I also use it as a replacement for my hair gel. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I have never written an amazon review and I shop here quite frequently but every expectant mom should know about this stuff. A friend of mine told me about how she does not have a single stretch mark from pregnancy and it is all thanks to Raw Shea Butter. I do know that stretch marks are genetic but I truly feel this stuff will lessen your stretch marks even if you are prone. The butter is literally just that, rock hard butter. You have to warm it up in your hands but when you do it turns to liquid wax. You will feel greasy after you apply this so be forewarned. But it did not mess up any of my clothes. This butter sits on your skin and slowly absorbs all day to keep your tummy, hips etc well moisturized. I never have issues with itching skin when I apply the Shea Butter. This is a great product and I will never be without for any future pregnancy.</li>
            <li> This product is the best moisturizer I have ever purchased.  I use it in many ways -- primarily I make a Paw Wax cream for my dogs paws - keeps them from cracking and protects them the elements. ice pavement and such.  I also use it for my dogs nose.... no dry cracking noses in this house!  Thanks again for such an organic product!</li>
            <li> Does not break out my skin.  Very good for wrinkles and smoothing out the fine lines.  It takes a little rubbing together in my hands to warm the compound and then spreads nicely over my face.  It is a little oily at first but soaks in quickly.  All and all, I love it.  It does not irritate my face at all--not even under the delicate eye area.  I&#x27;m 68 years old and have very dry skin but so many cosmetics still irritate/break out my face.  I love that it has so many vitamins in it.  I know I&#x27;m doing something good for my skin.  I love to put it on at night and then early in the morning.  By the time I have my coffee, I&#x27;m ready to put on my makeup; by that time the Shea butter has soaked into my skin with no more oily residue.</li>
            <li> I have been trying natural products for over two years to test what works to heal my super cracked, inflamed and sensitive skin. For the past two years I have been battling severe eczema and recently purchased this item to see how it works. I have used oil based products because I have felt I find that it keep things moisturize. What I love about this stuff is that not only does it moisturize but it helps provide vitamins and omegas to my skin so it helps rejuvenate it. It has been a healing experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is raw so it does feel crumbly at first but it quickly melts and absorbs into the skin with body temperature. I absolutely love this stuff and plan to use this product for life.</li>
            <li> Love this product...smell, quality, packaging etc!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product really high quality. I wanted to get one of  the best shea butter products on the&lt;br /&gt;market and it took me some time to find it. The product smells great and the texture is outstanding,&lt;br /&gt;this is 100% true shea butter.  I contacted the seller because I had a several questions about the product and the seller emailed back quickly.My questions were mainly about the purity of the product.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this Shea butter is the best on Amazon. I&#x27;ve bought this about 4 times as a college student, and I don&#x27;t regret spending my money. I use to have these little bumps on around my arm which I use to be  a little insecure about. A friend introduced me to Shea butter, and I thought it was weird since how thick it was and how the smell was a bit odd. Weeks into applying the Shea butter on my skin I noticed the redness of the bumps went away and they&#x27;re very slowly but surely going away. The ones on my fore arm have completely gone away, but where my muscles are suppose to be they&#x27;re just a bit there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other commercial brands you can find at your drug store, this Shea butter can last hours, were as the drug store lotions don&#x27;t last long. The ingredients on this product (which is only one thing) by far beat what you&#x27;re letting your skin absorb through drug store lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may take awhile to put on but it is definitely worth it. I put it on after taking a warm shower which open up the pores. I also apply it after I wash my face when I&#x27;m about to sleep to let your face absorb the shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love love love this shea butter and its so many great uses!!! Straight out of the jar and onto my dry heels , whip it into body and face creams. And will try it as a hair mask soon. Its so pure and easy to mix with so many other carrier/ essential oils and make your own facial products. It must be stored properly and make sure your hands are dry when using this as you dont want to get water into the container. The smell is not bad as some commented. In general shea butter has an earthy scent. Im extremely happy with my choice and will reorder.</li>
            <li> OK so I bought this a few months ago and have not gotten around to writing a review till now.  Let me start off by saying the costumer service I received was really great.  They were very interested in know if I was happy with my purchase and if they could help in any way if I was not satisfied.  With that being said not on to the product, I really like it.  I like to use it especially on my face at night before bed.  I was up with soft, supple skin and like rejuvenated.  It is a little on the greasy side but that is what its supposed to feel like.  It has a nice subtle scent and I like the fact that its white not that glow in the dark yellow (what&#x27;s that about).  I do use it all over not just my face and I am liking the results.</li>
            <li> I was amazed by the quality of this Shea Butter compared to the cheapy brand I used before. In 24 hours I have already noticed an improvement with my daughter&#x27;s eczema. My daughter didn&#x27;t enjoy the scent but was so happy about not being itchy she asked for it again at night.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and was as described.  I plan to use it in lotion bars.</li>
            <li> Container: Sealed on the inside, dark jar, in-tact and pleasing packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Contents: Creamy, off-white (not yellow or grey)&lt;br /&gt;Texture: Smooth, not grainy (though this just means I lucked out and the bottle didn&#x27;t go through any warm storage or transit and the oil did not have a chance to partially melt and crystallize; I suppose it wouldn&#x27;t have mattered, as I melt it first anyway), slightly crumbly after scraping with a spoon.&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Like shea butter, a little earthy/nutty and similar to other raw shea I have worked with.&lt;br /&gt;Ethics: I am happy to be contributing to ecological and economic sustainability by purchasing this fair-trade and organic ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I mix it with coconut oil and other essential oils and use it daily.  My whole family loves it.</li>
            <li> great on your skin and hands.  Get some.</li>
            <li> Ivory Shae cream is the real thing. Leaves the skin so soft.  It helps with my eczema and severe dry skin i have. It&#x27;s an amazing product and can&#x27;t live without it. Thanks it&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li> love this stuff, my hair, skin and nails look lovely!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great!!!</li>
            <li> I have only been using the shea butter a few days now so I cannot attest to the long term affect.  It seems very pure.  I live in a climate that is on the cool side and the temperature is often in the 60&#x27;s.  The product is quite hard here and it takes a bit of time to get it soft enough to be absorbed.  It is nothing like a coconut butter which is much smoother.  When the shea butter starts to warm it does get absorbed but small tiny pieces will remain on my skin but with further rubbing will get absorbed into my skin.  I do not know if it is because of the cool temperature or the nature of shea butter. Once on my skin feels well moisturized and not greasy. As far as long term results time will tell.</li>
            <li> Received it in a timely fashion and use it periodically after showers.  Thick and firm, but causes me to take out just the little I need--about a dime&#x27;s size worth.  I rub it between my palms and it melts and I spread it on my arms and legs.  Does have a slight smoky smell, but smell seems to &amp;#34;evaporate&amp;#34; after being smoothed in.  Can tell this jar will last me a while.  Skin absorbs it quickly and does not leave a greasy feeling at all; but then, I don&#x27;t put it on heavily.  A small bit goes a long way.  If I need more, I just take a tiny bit more as required.  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using any of my other lotions at all!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff!!!  I recently went through my vanity and gave away most of my face and body moisturizers and creams....all for just one jar of Shea butter.  After researching the benefits of Shea butter I have found it replaces so many other products.  Molivera Organics Shea butter is great quality.  I have my kids using it now on their families.  It&#x27;s amazing moisturizing for dry skin in the winter and sun parched skin in the summer. You will find countless uses for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Love this Shea butter! I have tried several other brands before but this one is the best. I also like the price, especially for an organic product.</li>
            <li> Love love love this Shea Butter for everything hair, skin, nails</li>
            <li> Just received it last night! Fast shipping! Packed nicely. Little goes long way. It definitely worth my money! I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color, texture, and earthy scent! This is exactly what my terribly dry,cracking hands needed! I saw results immediately. I have used pure shea butter before but nothing of this quality. And this jar is a generous amount! When I need more I will most definitely purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used unrefined shea butter for years.  This is by far the smoothest product I&#x27;ve found.  It applies very easily after your shower and leaves your skin feeling like velvet all day.</li>
            <li> Great Products, Thank you.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality! Mixing with other oils (Jojoba and Coconut oils) to make a healthy lotion!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I bought this because my hands get super dry from work and Shea butter seems to be the only thing that helps more then a few hours. I was looking for something organic as well. I&#x27;d rather not have to slather a bunch of harmful chemicals on my skin if I don&#x27;t have to. This Shea butter doesn&#x27;t smell great (because it&#x27;s not pumped with fragrance) and is a lot more dense then shea butters I&#x27;ve used in the past, again probably because it&#x27;s organic/unrefined. I&#x27;ve added coconut oil and lavender&amp;peppermint to make it a bit easier to use and smell a bit better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of shea butter but have not been as pleased w/ their performance. I&#x27;m excited about having found the quality shea butter made by Molivera Organics. It feels so soft n silly on the skin. It&#x27;s great on lips, feet, hands &amp; around cuticles. I&#x27;ll be using this product for all my diy beauty products. If u decide to try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hair and skin.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> This shea butter was packaged well, looked and smelled fresh, and worked perfectly for making lotions. I would order it again!</li>
            <li> I mixed the Shea Butter with other oils to make my own body butter, and my skin has never felt better.  No more dry, cracked heels or elbows.  The shea butter by itself works great, but smells great when mixed with essentials oils.</li>
            <li> This Shae butter is the best out there. It&#x27;s unrefined which means it doesn&#x27;t go through a chemical process. It&#x27;s very good for your skin it helps with wrinkles, eczema, skin irritation, blemishes, and much more. The customer service is the best as well they check up on you to see how you&#x27;re liking the product and if their were any problems great service and fast too.</li>
            <li> I love what this butter is doing for my face.  Was concerned about clogging but it&#x27;s super hydrating &amp; no problems with clogging my skin.  Also maybe a deodorant using this butter and it is luxurious.  Not going back to store bought.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It makes your skin feel great. Gor in a timely manner.. Would order again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get it soft enough to use, I want to like it more..I know it will be great!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love,  this product! It works great for women of color as a lip moisturizer, foot balm, hair oil, and as a day or night creme on the face. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter! I mixed it with raspberry seed oil &amp; carrot seed oil and use it as sunscreen. I lifeguard so that means 8 hours in the sun &amp; pool. I just reapply 1-2 times per day. I use it on face and body &amp; as a lotion after showering as well. Also works at. Chapstick/lipbalm! The only downside is you really have to rub it in to get the little butter grains into your skin.</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter! No problem with sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shea butter to use in DIY frankincense and myrrh lotion recipe I got from DrAxe.com. It smells nice and worked wonderfully in the recipe. The lotion is just the right consistency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought white, ultra-processed shea butter, and I&#x27;ve had grainy cream-colored product that had a strong smell. This item had the smoothness without the smell. It&#x27;s the consistency and color of putty--not greasy, but still easy to rub into the skin. A real value.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase.  Consistency requires some getting use to but it holds up well and stays on even after washing your hands.  Fragrance could be better but I guess for the benefits received I&#x27;ll get use to the fragrance. My wish is that they add a more fragrant smell</li>
            <li> Instead of letting my hairline,and hair continue to disappear on its own and run the risk of looking like George Jefferson, I gave in to Mother Nature and shaved my head.  I consulted a few fellow baldies and asked them how to care for my new baldy.  One of them raved about the benefits of using shea butter after each shave.  After doing some research and reading reviews, I decided to try Molivera Organics Raw Unrefined African Shea butter.  So I ordered a jar to give it try.  I use it every day not just on my head, but all over my face &amp; down my neck.  It’s been over 2 months now, and all I can say is this stuff is “da BOMB!”  It has been PERFECT on my shaved head giving it a nice, clean, not oily, and a very healthy appearance.  My head feels so soft and smooth to the touch, just like a baby’s bottom…REALLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m also reaping benefits in other areas that I had not planned.  I have chronic dry skin so the skin on my face is very dull.  Since using Molivera Shea Butter, my face has a vibrant, healthy, again not oily but HEALTHY glow to it!  I’ve had a couple of people say things like, “...beyond the bald head you look so different now, like younger”, “…if it wasn’t for biology, I’d think you’re pregnant because you’re glowing!”  It&#x27;s da BOMB!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right away you can tell that Molivera Shea Butter is a quality product.  The packaging is of high quality too!  Customer service is superb! I mean everything about the product and company says QUALITY!!  Ooh, I forgot to mention that I put this on my heel of my feet everyday, no more cracked and dry skin there too!  Again this stuff is DA BOMB!!</li>
            <li> I have used many types of shea butter but this is the best by far. My skin and hair looks so much better. As soon as this product is gone, I will reorder.</li>
            <li> I bought this 16 oz raw unrefined Shea butter hopping to make a use of it for my dry skin. It came as in the photo , in a&lt;br /&gt;nice container . It&#x27;s smell was tolerable , at least for me . I tried it on my hand and it gave me a better looking skin .</li>
            <li> Down through the years, I have purchased MANY Shea Butters.  The quality of Molivera Organics exceeds my previous Shea Butter purchases!  I&#x27;ve been using this one for a few months now and it works very well on my extremely dry skin.  I have no issue with the scent of Shea Butter, this one has a light scent.</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is so smooth. I really love it and I have made hair butter cream and body butter with it.</li>
            <li> Ok I want to rant about this stuff. IT&#x27;S SO AMAZING! I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 days and my stretch marks are disappearing like crazy! My skin also feels soooo amazing! Only using this stuff from now on! It&#x27;s just wow! I HIGHLY recommend this stuff! I&#x27;m so happy</li>
            <li> I have never tried real unrefined shea butter before, and after a week of using it I have to say I&#x27;m a big fan.&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty dry skin, in some areas keratosis pilaris, and this has me feeling pretty soft.&lt;br /&gt;the company sent a follow up email with some good tips and FAQs which was really nice actually.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have severely dry skin and shea butter has been the only thing to help it. I ordered Molivera&#x27;s Ivory Shea Butter because the product I used previously cost way too much to ship. I am so glad I tried something new!! This shea butter is much easier to use! I don&#x27;t have to microwave it before use and my skin is still moisturizer even after my next shower. I bought some for my mom and will surely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is too greasy, makes your skin oily and sticky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally do reviews, but I had to with this product.  I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad batch, but the one I received was rancid, dried up, and smelled awful.  Needless to say,  I&#x27;m returning it ASAP!</li>
            <li> Is a good skin cream.</li>
            <li> Was interesting to use it. First time I&#x27;ve used Shea butter. However at the end of the day from using it in the morning.....my skin is so soft :)</li>
            <li> I didnt think I was going to like this at first.  It was hard, felt sticky (even though it is not)  and I thought I made a mistake. I was wrong. This stuff is the best, most true moisturizer ever. Just rub it vigoursly between your fingers for a few seconds and its soft and workable. You can truly feel that its nourishing and hydrating to your skin. I dont think anything could moisturize like this,  except maybe whipped Shea butter,  maybe.</li>
            <li> Really nice shea butter. I used it to make my own lotion. Good deal for the price. No strong smell.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is amazing. The pure form heals without itching. Every other ointment, lotion or concoction on my eczema has made it miserably itchy. Even my dermatologist wanted a sample for his compound pharmacy. He thinks it might work as well as crisco. I&#x27;m not kidding compound pharmacies use crisco, it&#x27;s on the pharmacy label -- CRISCO. This Shea butter is a delight.</li>
            <li> Shea Butter is really good makes your skin smooth and moisturized, but it is really thick.</li>
            <li> Very nice Shea butter. I&#x27;ve used it alone a few times and plan to mix it with oils for different creams/lotions. Good product and size for the cost. So far so good, thank you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright but I would not buy again</li>
            <li> This is true Shea butter and I really appreciate the quality and the price, it is what it says it is, raw and unrefined. It does not need to say ivory, as real Shea butter suppose to be ivory and not yellow. Yellow butter is from a different type of an African tree which has very similar qualities of Shea, but is not the same.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, as I love natural cosmetics that smell natural and are not perfumed. It melts very easy in your palms when rubbed together and does not clump up, glides on smoothly, jar will last forever.</li>
            <li> Good product. Used it to blend with coconut oil and beeswax for my DIY body lotion. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have a year old surgery scar that still causes me discomfort. I ordered this Shea butter to help soften the scar and it appears to be working quite well. I had tried vitamin E oil but I think this is better.</li>
            <li> very moisturizing. arrive fresh !</li>
            <li> This is exactly what the label says.  Pure &amp; raw. A little gritty but nothing bad it goes away fast. My batch still has an earthy smokey smell but it evaporates quickly. Absorbs fast and keeps our skin looking fresh &amp; healthy, soft, helping w/ dry skin &amp; wrinkles. Glad I Bought it. I melt this in a double boiler &amp; add emu oil &amp; argan oil for a triple whammy on dry skin &amp; wrinkles. It also help heal &amp; protect the skin.</li>
            <li> This shea butter has been great for making homemade lotions and hair pomade. The consistency is buttery smooth, and there is no unpleasant smell to it whatsoever. Also, the dark container that it ships in is very useful for longer term storage, since it won&#x27;t let light in like typical clear containers would. After a year, the shea butter is still working as intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product, fast shipping, and great packaging: 5 stars.</li>
            <li> this shea butter has a nice nutty smell and is really creamy. i wish it came in a glass jar though instead of plastic.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. I use it to mix with my young living oils to make lotions. I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> My skin was a barren, dehydrated desert. It was becoming more and more of a problem. NOTHING I used seemed to penetrate my skin and heal the extreme dryness. One of two things would happen, the product would evaporate on my skin because there was too much water in it OR balm type products would simply sit on top and fail to absorb. Eating more healthy fats didn&#x27;t work either.&lt;br /&gt;Enter Molivera Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, this is the only thing that I have EVER tried that works. It gets into my skin and lasts through washing and getting it wet. The horrible flakiness on my torso and legs is gone. I can&#x27;t believe it took this long for this product to be on my radar. Better late than never.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could get back the wasted money I spent on subpar skin products that probably did more harm than good. The only other thing I use regularly (more as a cleanser) is unrefined organic coconut oil however coconut oil DID NOT work as a moisturizer for me. The Shea butter is hard packed and crumbly in texture. I scoop out a small amount with my finger and rub into my palm to melt. Yes, you have to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; it in but the results are more than worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;A pound tub costs around $13. You cannot beat the price for what you are getting. I also use a bit after I wash my hair and right before blowdrying as a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff and will recommend it to anyone. It has saved my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical. What difference it has made to the bottom of my feet in just 3 days. I was told by a fellow co-worker that it is one of the best remedies for tired, aching, and cracked feet. If you are on your feet a lot, this is what you need. I lucked up and made my first choice in a Molivera product which will now be my go to place for Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Much.&lt;br /&gt;Blessings &amp; Healings</li>
            <li> Best skin moisturizer I have ever tried</li>
            <li> I recieved the shea butter in a timely manner.  I made an organic whipped shea butter cream with it to use on my skin and hair.  Love, love, love it.  I also I appreciate the follow up emails from the company giving me informative feedback/history on shea butter, and its many uses, and how to preserve it.</li>
            <li> So far so good easy to warm up by rubbing hands together super easy to apply on skin smell is just right will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands and developed a nasty itchy rash on my hands. Over time, my hands were always itchy and scratching then caused a thick patch of dry skin. It would crack and bleed sometimes. I couldn&#x27;t get rid of this dry skin. I tried homemade sugar scrubs, coconut oil, and expensive organic lotions. Nothing worked. Looking online and came across this organic shea butter. The reviews were good and so was the price of the product. After a couple uses, my dry skin was healed and I no longer feel itchy! My skin looks 23 years old and not 80 anymore. So glad I ordered this product and the size of it will last me awhile. Highly recommend!! 5 star product!</li>
            <li> Very good product!  I use it for daily massages and moisturizer on my baby&#x27;s skin. I also  use it  on my kid&#x27;s  hair and it  makes their hair soft.</li>
            <li> After much research and costly sampling of different company&#x27;s&#x27; Shea butters, this is probably the best. I have used AAA SheaButter, Mountain Rose Herbs, Shea ScentSations by Synergistic living and this one. All are certified organic and unrefined. I liked them all but found Mountain Rose Herbs to be extremely grainy and timely to use, but will make a body butter with organic coconut oil out of it. I&#x27;m sure I have found a keeper with Molivera but will also continue with Shea ScentSations because of the added essential oils which smell amazing!</li>
            <li> It arrived right away. Great quality product! Natural hair and skin care are so important to me. I love that it&#x27;s raw!</li>
            <li> I like this Shea butter I used it to moisturizer my skin and on my hair as a sealant to lock in the moisture in my hair. So far so good. Came on time and I will order again</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly, and while it does have a bit of an off smell, its not as bad as other shea butters, and its healing powers are great.</li>
            <li> Fantastic moisturizer - well worth the money and highly recommended! Make sure you rub it in well by putting a blob on your palm and rub in circular motion with your fingers on the other hand.</li>
            <li> No complaints about the Shea Butter. I mix it with other butters/oils and use it after the shower.</li>
            <li> I received it within days of my order.  Service is excellent.  I love the Shea butter!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Just got this yesterday and used in myself and two little ones...&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Such great moisturizer! All comments below about how amesome this stuff is completely true. Worth it!</li>
            <li> I think its probably really good,but I am having a hard time coming past the smell of it</li>
            <li> Excellent product for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Shea Butter to make lip balms and lotions.  The shipment was delayed by the ice storms so it was not a timely delivery, but I understand the weather can delay things.  It has a strange odor but not overwhelming.  I used some on my cracked, dry heels and after a few nights it cleared up the dryness.  I really like this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I would say anyone who has dry skin, this stuff is great!  I can&#x27;t wait to see what else I can use it for.</li>
            <li> Got this for my scar from knee surgery it is helping a lot!</li>
            <li> great as a moisturizer on face and body. my only complaint is that it is hard to actually apply to your face, because it is a solid, not a liquid. so as a result, you have to rub it between your hands to turn it into a liquid. however, that is what the product is, so I can&#x27;t take away a star because of that!! 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other brands of Shea butter from Amazon. They were ok, but I knew I had hit a home run with this purchase when my husband commented on how well it works. The consistency is great. There&#x27;s not much smell with this brand brand either, which is a good thing. My husband and I both see a difference in our hair and skin since using this brand.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great product and one of the best customer service ever! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So, I have a chapped hands problem..a big one. Between the dry cold winters and all the painting I do, my hands are always a mess.  The only thing I&#x27;ve had success with restoring my hands was with an overnight treatment of L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s 100% Shea Butter.  The stuff was amazing and work&#x27;s better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried and one tin lasted me years. Well, I finally ran out and when I went to buy it again, I had major sticker shock. $42 for a 5 ounce tin. (Either the price went way up, or I got the original tin as a gift as I couldn&#x27;t imagine paying that much again.) I figured before I&#x27;d plunk down the dough on the fancy stuff, I&#x27;d try some other 100% shea butter brands to see if I could get the same results at a more reasonable price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Molivera Organics and the &amp;#34;African Shea Butter Cream&amp;#34; off Amazon as my test products.  First off, I don&#x27;t like the yellow shea butter (by Plant Guru).  Although it works as advertised, it has a much stronger nutty smell than the ivory shea butter. They both have the smell but the yellow one has a much stronger odor than the ivory one. It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but I don&#x27;t want to be overpowered by it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The L&#x27;Occitane product feels more refined as it has a smoother texture out of the jar than the Molivera, but the skin care results are much the same. My hands, lips and nails look and feel great after using it right out of the jar. The other major difference is that the L&#x27;Occitane product is scented and this one is not but that&#x27;s not a big deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you used to using the higher end French brands, I&#x27;ll warn you that the raw and unrefined products have a more gritty feeling to them at first, but as soon as they make contact with your warm skin, they melt 100% without any kind of residual particles. I have not needed to warm the butter either. The body heat seems like enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this new product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> My sister loves this product so I&#x27;m giving it a shot as a relief from very dry skin. Fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> I love this product....This has become one of my favorite skin conditioners.  It&#x27;s also great as a makeup base and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> Love it! I use this to mix with other oils for my hair and face care. You do have to mix it in your hand a bit to make it buttery.</li>
            <li> The shea butter is pale ivory with a subtle nutty scent. It melts easily on the skin and can be mixed with moisturizer for extra hydration. I use it on my very sensitive, acne-prone skin and haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation or breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is fairly nice, so there&#x27;s no need to repot the product.</li>
            <li> This product arrived ahead of schedule. I ordered it on a Saturday and was not expecting it until the following Tuesday as a Prime account holder. Imagine my surprise when it arrived on Monday afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my naturally curly hair and my scalp. I use it as a lip balm. I use it on my sons&#x27; hair and scalp. My youngest son&#x27;s scalp gets really dry and started to flake (could be due to the anti-histamine he takes year round). It has a nice pleasant smell and it melts quickly in you palms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it a body butter. I have used it as a face moisturizer and my face is super, super soft. I have not broken out at all- I have the typical T-Zone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use it after a pedicure to maintain softness- just haven&#x27;t gotten one yet.</li>
            <li> This shea butter was better than expected. I will continue to purchase this product when I run out of my current jar.</li>
            <li> Received this amazingly fast. Like the smoothness it give me  hoping it will work for mr psoriasis but so far no improvement. Will continue to hope and use daily</li>
            <li> Using this with my essential oils for more pure products for my body. Would highly recommend to anyone needing shea butter</li>
            <li> Good product to soften skin......&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that&#x27;s it&#x27;s lumpy and hard....so I scrape out a a lot and place it on my skin to smooth out and the texture is gritty....like rubbing cream mixed with fine bits of sand.&lt;br /&gt;If I just rub the very top, I can&#x27;t get much because it&#x27;s hard.&lt;br /&gt;I also use Cocacare 100% cocoa butter, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;I do like Shea butter, but not liking the texture of this raw unrefined kind....maybe heating it will help.</li>
            <li> Did not like the smell.  Also the texture was very gritty and oilier than other shea butter products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I love this! Because it&#x27;s soft and it leaves my skin feeling like it has penetrated it! I&#x27;m African American female and have a lot of dark spots so I feel this product helps me fade my scars. I only use at night because it&#x27;s very thick and does make me face look shiny.</li>
            <li> Awesomenes on my hair!!! Luv it. My skin is also way much better.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product. The smell and texture are much better than the previous brand I bought from a  well known source to people who buy health products.  Really good for chapped hands this winter, among other things. Customer service really concerned about your satisfaction!</li>
            <li> I really like this shea butter and I can tell it works very well.  I put it on my hands before bed and I can tell a big difference if I do not. My hands get irritated easily and this really helps.  This is my 4th brand of shea butter to try and I will definitely be buying this again instead of looking for something else.  Since shea butter is hard, I find it easier to get out if I scrape my fingernail backwards so it ends up on the top of my fingernail. It also melts easier and smoother than other brands.  We also use this for lip balm.  It works much better than any lip balm and stays on better as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like to apply lotion during the day, this will stay on hands much better than any lotion.  I highly recommend you try this.</li>
            <li> Wow my skin love Molivera Organics Raw African Ivory Shea Butter. Just started using this product a few days. I was skeptical about using it on my oily face, wow no breakouts and my skin look flawless. I also have dry skin  this shea butter makes my skin so moisturize I love this shea butter. Will be ordering again. Thank you Molivera Organics</li>
            <li> Great Packaging, Quality ingredients and very smooth texture. Seemed to work faster at clearing up old scars than others I&#x27;ve tried in past.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, smooth shea butter. Love the feel and consistency; keep it handy for moisturizing face and body. Leaves a nice soft feel to your skin. Arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I made skin cream with is Shea butter and it is great.</li>
            <li> I received this shea butter by Molivera timely. I have not made it in a recipe for body butter since I am new to essential oils and pure butters. However when I received the Molivera unrefined shea I used it out of the jar and it was like silk. I was amazed at the quality and though it seems very buttery on skin at first it melts into your skin and my 72 year old skin felt very smooth. It&#x27;s good to feel young.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Used this to make an eczema salve for my son. It is hard at first but once in your hand it starts to soften. Great to use when making body butters as well.</li>
            <li> I had been using coconut oil but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb. I was looking for something natural and without chemicals, I&#x27;ve found an excellent mosturizer that absorbs and feels amazing. It is solid but melts quickly between your hands when rubbed together. I use it everywhere it has especially helped my extremely dry, sometimes cracked, hands. Only suggestion is to keep a small spatula like tool with the jar to scoop it out.</li>
            <li> I feel like I got a good amount of butter for the price. I&#x27;ve been putting it on my pregnant tummy to help with stretch marks.  It&#x27;s definitely cheaper than buying fancy stretch mark lotion.  You have to rub it in a little but once it gets warm it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> Thoroughly enjoyed this Shea Butter! It was not gritty and is an ivory color. I believe that this one is pure. I might stop at this one instead of further experimenting. This one seems like my winner.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS STUFF!!! I HAVE USED IT IN MY HAIR (AFRICAN AMERICAN KINKY CURLY) SUPER MOISTURIZING/USE LIGHTLY... I HAVE APPLIED IT TO MY HANDS EVERY NIGHT FOR THE PAST WEEK, AWESOME! GREAT AFTER SHAVING, SOOTHES THE SKIN (EVERYWHERE) :-) I&#x27;VE USED IT ON MY SON&#x27;S ECZEMA FLARE UP (4 YEARS OLD). THIS SHEA BUTTER HAS A NICE SMELL, ISN&#x27;T A VERY SWEET SMELL, IT DOES SMELL A BIT ROASTED; HOWEVER THE COLOR IS IVORY AS STATED ON JAR... I LOVE IT. I WILL CONTINUE PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT FOREVER &amp; EVER :-)&lt;br /&gt;JACKSONVILLE, FL</li>
            <li> I love this product. it is truly unrefined raw shea butter. I love that my skin and my hair stays moisturized. My husband loves this product as well!!! Molivera is the brand i will keep using for my shea butter.</li>
            <li> the product feels wonderful on my skin. it has avery pleasant , mild -natural smell. it sinks in and then leaves my hands truly soft.  i am using it on my face and hands , and know there will be many applications. for it. i am also impressed by the company-they keep me informed about he product, and they were extremely helpful and quick to solve a small problem with my order.  definitely a 5 star item!!!</li>
            <li> First time to use pure Shea Butter.  All previous products has it as a minor ingredient.  Used it on my hands, which one had a scrape.  Wow, did not expect such excellent results.  Great product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  Lasts long, non-greasy, leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  Also, I noticed that it helped to lighten up the darker areas of my skin where I shave and acts as a sunblock.  While it is a rough, natural product I have found that leaving it in the shower while I take one softens up the product making it easier to spread.  If you leave it in warm water long enough it will even liquefy.</li>
            <li> Wow! Quality of this Shea Butter is unbelievable!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Smooth, not gritty. I used it in combination with other ingredients to make body butter, and it came out great! This wl be my go to product from now on.</li>
            <li> Seems like a good quality product, will be using it by itself &amp; as a main ingredient in lotion making</li>
            <li> Nice packaging and product.</li>
            <li> Smooth and nourishing for my red, dry skin. Light scent but not offensive. Should last a long time as you only need to use sparingly for good results. Going to try to use it on a recent scar and for blemishes too. Will update again soon. So far, very happy with this purchase!!! My dry skin feels instantly nourished  and moisturized. So glad I found this!!</li>
            <li> I usually mix this butter w my favorite lotion because I don&#x27;t like the Shea butter natural smell. Other brands dissolve pretty easy, this one leaves some sandy texture when mixed and my skin does not get well mosturized as when used other brand. I don&#x27;n think I&#x27;ll order again</li>
            <li> So awesome for stretch marks and dry rough skin!!&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money for sure!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Having used this three months now, I attest to the excellent quality of the product. It is a bit gritty to touch at first, but once your begin rubbing it into your skin it&#x27;s quite smooth. I appreciate the natural shea fragrance and brown plastic container. I have used at least half the container already, but  there is no reason this can&#x27;t last the average body two winters (especially if used out of the shower while still wet enough to seal in moisture). Maybe it&#x27;s just me but this winter, no matter how hydrated I was or how much of this I put on, I still dried out, quickly. Granted, I did sometimes wear cotton and other absorbent materials, and maybe my skin is a bit uncooperative when it wants to be. Just a note. My experience with cocoa butter hasn&#x27;t been that great because it was with Palmer&#x27;s and it caused an itchy rash across the entire stretch of my upper chest (that disappeared a few days after discontinued use), but I appreciate shea, and recommend it if you&#x27;ve had a similarly iffy experience with cocoa products.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s pure high quality unrefined shea butter and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with using it as a daily body moisturizer! It makes my skin so soft and feel so nourished and healthy!</li>
            <li> Has all the qualities I&#x27;ve come to expect from a high quality, organic, unrefined, raw, shea butter; beige-yellow proof the product was not bleached, the slight nutty aroma of a nutrient-rich butter, consistency in texture and firmness throughout, no signs of any rancidity or contamination, good packaging. Shea butter, like other nut butters, can sometimes be too firm to easily spread on the skin. This shea was firm enough to allow me to stretch it with added oils if I chose to, but not too firm that I couldn&#x27;t use it immediately as is, trading off the inconvenience of the slight crumbly texture for its unbeatable skin nourishment and protection. Was delivered even sooner than projected. I&#x27;m used to the quality of shea butter from Mountain Rose Herbs. This is as good, at a lower price, and with the option of free shipping and handling. Will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use this instead of body lotion on myself and my kids. We have dry skin, especially in the winter. I don&#x27;t see myself going back to regular lotion, this makes my skin feel so good!</li>
            <li> I love Shea butter and use it regularly. I generally buy a different brand and thought I would try this brand. I thought it was a good value for the size and price. While it works, it is very thick, even after rubbing it in your hands, several times.  So thick that it is difficulty to apply.  I also noticed it was a bit gritty, like it had sort of like something gritty mixed in.  I have not had that experience before with any Shea butter. The product was okay. However, I cannot say that I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Some shea butter come gritty, so far this product is very smooth. There is a lot of product but so far smooth. I use it as a facial moisturizer, day and night. It is easiest to apply after a shower your face is still damp. Other than that its best to melt the product on your finger tips and then pat onto your face. Its a thick product so just patting onto will keep you from tugging at your face. I am highly acne prone been on several pills and creams bc of acne. This product from Molivera has been amazing its simple and nourishing.  Looks great under makeup too! Just give it extra time to sink into the skin, makeup will go on smooth. Still need to powder mid day but drugstore moisturizers make me do that too. Been very happy with Molivera&#x27;s Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> Delivery was super fast and the product is legit. I bought it to mix it with other oils so for now it&#x27;s in the jar, as soon as I use more of this product I will update my review.</li>
            <li> I use this in my baby&#x27;s cloth wipes solution, along with organic coconut oil.  Feels smooth and luxurious, and smells good too.</li>
            <li> It melts in your hands if you rub it in between the palms and then just apply to area needed.  Leaves the skin super soft.  Best thing its organic and raw!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent although much harder than I expected.  It has the firmness of a stick of frozen butter.  I would love to know if the company has a recipe for making a smoother, body butter type concoction using the raw shea butter so that I can smooth it over my arms and legs after my shower.</li>
            <li> I  am very happy with my order of this Shea butter. It is wonderful on the skin and would order it again. Also the service was great. I received it quickly. No problems.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very sticky and hard to apply to your skin,I wasted 20.00 on it would never buy it again</li>
            <li> Jar not included, just a box and wax paper.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!!  I went back and purchase a second one the day after I received the first.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Great product and arrived quickly.  Will re-order when I run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert, but I have tried alot of different shea butter. This shea butter is extremely moisturizing, a little goes a long way. Mine is a little grainy, but as others have noted, once you put some in your hand and rub it between your hands it melts beautifully and the grainy quality disappears. The grainy quality may just be due to the fact that I live in Florida, and by the time things get here, and sit in mail truck all day, they are usually hot! Also want to note the container is huge, 16 oz., so I think it&#x27;s a great bargain as well.</li>
            <li> I love raw Shea butter. I was looking for a good quality organic Shea butter ivory in color. I stumbled across this one and decided to try it. However, this kind is not good for whipping. I make my own whipped Shea butter mix and this kind just didn&#x27;t have the consistency. It was crumby and felt like little small pebbles. You have to rub it in hard and until those crumbs dissolve which will take more time than you expect. I don&#x27;t like this kind. I had to order another good quality that comes in a block which will be easier to whip. Overall the seller is good, item arrived sooner than I expected, and item was as described. Still good quality but not the consistency I was looking for. I&#x27;m not disposing my Shea butter. I&#x27;m using it until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Shea butter works! I wore some rain boots/snow boots this winter that were absolutely great. However, I failed to notice the ring that formed around my calves because of them.&lt;br /&gt;I put this on every night for weeks, and now, I can barely see the dark rings.&lt;br /&gt;Give shea butter a shot. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great so far, will almost certainly purchase more although we use it frequently, there is a substantial amount.  My wife loves it, she has gotten nice compliments about her skin glowing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and will forever use this . I bought this to try on my baby&#x27;s eczema and it worked dramatically !! I also use it on my hair and my hair is now healthier then ever !! Highly recommended !!</li>
            <li> So far, I like the Molivera Organics cream. I just purchased the product, there isn&#x27;t much at this time to say about it. In any event, it is very soft and I like it.</li>
            <li> I loved , good product</li>
            <li> Use it as a face cream and love it.  Noticed an improvement in my complexion in a matter of a few weeks and like the fact that it is natural.  My skin also feels softer.</li>
            <li> Love this butter! This was my first purchase of shea butter. I actually ordered it to make my own deodorant, but also tried it on my hands. I loved how my hands felt, very soft. I would totally recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update. I developed a facial rash about a few years ago. My allergist told me that I am highly sensitive to \\&quot;unnatural\\&quot; creams, body washes, soaps, shampoos, detergents (I have never used make up in my life)- anything of that kind that could come in contact with my face and irritate it. Well, after seeing how the skin of my hands improved dramatically after using the shea butter just a few times, I decided to give it a try and apply the shea butter to my face. Well, my skin did not feel irritated at all, and the rash seems to be disappearing gradually, i.e. turning more pale in color. I love the way it makes the skin feel soft and luxurious. When I was using my hypoallergenic cream, I had to apply it several times a day. I need to apply the shea butter about 3 times a week. The skin feels super soft. I am absolutely convinced by this butter.</li>
            <li> I will probably only buy this shea butter from now on. After years of using false shea butter (that yellow stuff they sell at every beauty supply store and even here on amazon), I switched to the pure bulk shea butter sold by whole foods. I wasn&#x27;t super impressed with their shea and when I finally ran out I ordered Molivera Organics raw African shea butter and I freaking love it. Like Franks hot sauce I put that ish on everything!! I put it in my homemade body butter, I use it in my hair, on my face, my feet, everywhere!! And I only need a little bit. I expect this jar to last at least six months or more even with my using it everyday. I&#x27;m sold, this is the shea butter I&#x27;ve been looking for. My hair loves it, my skin loves it, these are the benefits true, quality, shea butter promises and delivers.</li>
            <li> Arrived quicker than expected. The butter looks off-white like natural shea butter normally looks like  and it does a great job at moisturizing. Overall very happy with the product and very pleased with how fast it arrived.</li>
            <li> Amazing properties.  This is my first time using Shea Butter. It&#x27;s even more excellent because it&#x27;s organic!  I&#x27;ve been using waxalene and it looks like I&#x27;ve been paying double the amount.  This is not only affordable,  but it&#x27;s wonderful for dry skin and eczema relieving.  It is a godsend.  Give it a try...</li>
            <li> Great customer service.  Absolutely wonderful product.  This has replaced all of my moisturizing needs -- hands, body, and especially my face.  I never want to be without it!</li>
            <li> product is really good and fresh.  love it.</li>
            <li> Very clean smell, great value and arrived here in Florida still firm even thou it was in the 80&#x27;s here in April</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased this product, but so far, I really like it. I have very sensitive skin, and my back breaks out in a rash, that is very itchy. So far, with using this product on my back, the rash is pretty much gone, and minimal itching. I hope it continues to help my itchy back. Also, the cracks on my heals are much softer, and not as rough, only after a few days. I apply it all over my body, and my skin feels like silk. So far, so good. I would definitely  recommend this product. :)</li>
            <li> Hi there, I absolutely love my shea butter, it&#x27;s very rich and I would love to have more information about any hair restoration products you may have. The next time you have a special on this product I will purchase several jars, my daughter loves it too. I wish you much success and God&#x27;s Blessings.</li>
            <li> love the product very happy with it,</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;ve used for about a month now and it does wonders for dry skin. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> The packaging is good and the Shea butter moisturizing</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer as far as Shea butter goes, but I thought this was a more whipped consistency.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard and grainy like most.</li>
            <li> I have only been using my shea butter for a few weeks and really love the way it is making my skin feel. I use it everyday on my feet, and I could feel how smooth they are. I also have very dry hands, and though I am not claiming that they are miraculously cured, I do see and feel a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought shea butter in the past and just couldn&#x27;t get past having to dig it out of the jar and rub it between my palms in order to apply.  However, neither could I find I find a moisturizer, particularly for my hands and feet, that was penetrating enough to make a difference.  Coconut oil is o.k., but no where near as effective as shea butter.  As dryness has become more of an issue, I was willing to give shea butter another try and this product, despite the effort to use, does a good job.  I like products with glycolic acid as well, but you need to be careful not to apply before spending any time in the sun.  It&#x27;s probably not a good idea to leave it in the bathroom where the steam could affect this all natural product, so I leave it in my bedside table where it&#x27;s easy to apply at bedtime.</li>
            <li> This is great! So easy to work with. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> So far I love this product! It&#x27;s super moisturizing so I put it on at night so it will have time to absorb. I put it on during the day the first time I used it, and unfortunately it ended up on the dress I was planning on wearing so I had to change. This isn&#x27;t a criticism, the product is great, but for me, it&#x27;s best used before bedtime so my body will have all night to absorb it. It is solid at room temperature, so I use a spoon to get it out of the container, and then warm it in my hands and put it on my face and body. When you first rub it in it is slightly grainy, however, that disappears once it warms up. Overall, I love it and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this product easy to rube, so smooth on the skin when apply love it..........</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin, and the Shea butter made it feel smoother.  It also seemed to help soothe a rash I developed from a medicine.</li>
            <li> Read about your product in a blog. I have always had skin issues including acne, scarring from the acne, sun spots, overall, not a smooth flawless face, hidden behind coverup makeup. I also struggled to find the right moisturizer with out all of the extra ingredients. I ordered in hopes that at least I&#x27;d be getting a moisturizer with no petroleum and bonus it has vitamins. I have used this Shea butter for a couple weeks now and I absolutely 100% love it. It has helped clean my skin up in a way nothing else has. My face looks so much brighter, smoother, and even younger. So much that I want to show off my skin, freckles and all, there&#x27;s nothing to coverup now!!!!  Also works great on hands and lips!  Thank you for this naturally amazing product. I will keep buying it as long as you sell it.</li>
            <li> The product arrived hard as a brick! Can&#x27;t even use it! Won&#x27;t soften up! What a waste of my money! It was really looking forward to using this after all the good reviews I read. Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> It came perfectly sculpted, it becomes creamy as I rub my hands together &amp; keeps my skin &amp; hair very healthy &amp; glowing!</li>
            <li> Love this amazing butter.  This DIY is in heaven.  Even came with packaging info and was just bottled the month I ordered it,  will definitely buy again.  In fact, trying all the molivera products now!</li>
            <li> I bought this shea butter to help prevent stretch marks during my second pregnancy. 32 weeks and so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is unrefined and has no additives, it is in more of a solid state. I just scrape some off of the top with my fingers and rub it in between my hands for 5 seconds and it becomes warm and spreadable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on in the morning and can still feel it on my skin when I go to bed at night. Some people may not like having this protective layer on their skin all day, but it does not bother me. I just make sure to wear a tank under my nice shirts to be sure not to ruin them :)</li>
            <li> I like it so far but it&#x27;s difficult to get it to a spreadable consistency.</li>
            <li> I love this product it is amazing i use it on my hair because it is so dry and super thick,it makes my natural curls so soft and shiny. I love,love,love it so much and it was delivered so fast i will be ordering from this company again Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> I mix this Shea butter with a carrier oil, like Argan or Almond or Jojoba oil until it is creamy. Then I use it for a massage oil. I&#x27;ve been in bed for over two years from back surgery gone bad. It has caused me to have skin issues and this&lt;br /&gt;is helping me to heal. I love using it on my lips too. It really softens them.  I was having serious allergy reactions (rash &amp; itching) to whatever they put in my body and back during surgery. The itching has stopped and rash has improved. I&#x27;m still in the healing process, but this Shea butter is very nice. I was expecting or hoping for a glass container, but it is plastic.</li>
            <li> I use only organic/chemical free/homemade beauty and home care products, and this shea butter is a staple in my home. I use daily on my 3 year old and 1 year old.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t squeeze this out of a bottle like any old lotion with lots of additives - it&#x27;s nice and thick and is made for tough, dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best shea butter I have used. My skin soakes this butter up when I put it on, which tells me I have been neglecting my skin.  It makes my skin so smooth and gives it a healthy glow.  I like the smokey nutty scent, not a heavy smell, just a  pure and fresh. I am done with chemically loaded skin care products.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! I love the texture of this product. My skin is so soft and smooth. Can&#x27;t wait to make my own body butter!</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this product. My whole family uses it and it goes a long way. I use it on my skin and my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s helped my eczema patients, keratosis piliaris, stretch marks on teenagers and some dark pigmentation associated with healing. Be careful with nut allergy patients. I&#x27;m a pediatrician</li>
            <li> One of the most amazing products I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon and the only product I&#x27;ve written about thus far. It is the only thing that keeps my skin moisturized for hours. I have dry skin, and I can&#x27;t believe this keeps my skin hydrated for 8 hours or more. I&#x27;ve never encountered anything like it before. I use it on my face, body, and hair I will definitely buy more once I run out. I swear this is a miracle product.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter has a pleasant &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smell, kind of nutty.  Right out of the jar, it&#x27;s a bit gritty, but after warming it up in my hand, the &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; melts away.  I&#x27;m mixing it with coconut oil and the combination is lovely.</li>
            <li> I have the worst hair in the world.  Millions of tangled and matted hair.  Tried so many products that just were not effective.  Decided to order the Shea Butter based on the positive reviews and very grateful that I did.  I managed to comb out almost all of the knots and matted hair. This is one the best products I&#x27;ve ever used.  Thank you Molivera Organics for an excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forever a fan!!</li>
            <li> I love this product so far! Works great on dry skin, blemishes and sun burn! I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this shea butter dries my skin. :( I have a very sensitive skin and it&#x27;s hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t irritate or gives me a reaction of some sort. Well I am still looking. (I tried Shea Butter (16 OZ) with Pure Healing Lemongrass Essential Oil - Raw, Ivory, Organic from Africa, Moisturizing Face Cream that dried my skin also, so disappointing )</li>
            <li> so far ive used it a couple days and love how much it has moisturized the skin on my face. I have really dry skin and exzema on my face and im hoping that with the use of this product it will help it disapear.</li>
            <li> Soft and moldable. Used as a conditioner for hair face and body.&lt;br /&gt;Good product - RAW refined but soft and creamy. Smelles great. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> LOVE, fixed my sons horrible eczema in just two applications!  I started using it myself, great for lips and rough patches.  Also trying on my baby stretch marks, maybe it can work a little magic there too!</li>
            <li> I worked many years as customer service rep and never like to do surveys. I can&#x27;t help but do review on this product because it was instant love for it. I decided to change the natural aroma and added some scented oil. It was hit with my boyfriend. He loves to rub on and my skin. I love the way it makes my skin feel after nice bath. It is little grainy but once it make contact with your skin it melts away.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and can already tell the difference in my skin. I originally bought it because I had dark marks from insect bites, but now those dark marks are lightening back up to my natural skin color, my skin is soft and clear and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I will be back to buy more!</li>
            <li> This product came quickly in time and I love the way it feels on my skin! I  have been using it to seal my in the winter hair and it has left my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I wanted the real deal and got it; pure, unrefined, not-messed-about-with shea butter. And the more than reasonable price is a bonus.</li>
            <li> I started by using this as a face moisturizer, but it was a little to greasy/shiny for my liking underneath my makeup...  Now I use it as an eye makeup remover and really love it for that. Better then any liquid eye makeup remover I used, and moisturizes at the same time.</li>
            <li> My belly seldom itched thanks to this product. It was very hard to melt it by rubbing my hands, so I would place a small amount on the lid and set it over my hot rollers so it would melt and it was a lot easier for me to use. Purchased twice because I ran out. I would purchase again if I have another baby!</li>
            <li> so far the product is great and came exactly as expected. I know that shea butter is full of great benefits and looking foward to some of the changes I know we will see in our skin hair and nails</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist and my approach is a combination of deep tissue, myofascial release and trigger point work, and I find this shea butter to be the best massage product I have used yet!  It offers the perfect glide for deeper, slower, fascia-focused work, allows me to glide easily over my hairier clients without any pulling, and is sooo good for the skin!  It does have an earthy smell, but I actually like the smell.  And I plan to experiment with blending in some essential oils, and I&#x27;ll post an update to let y&#x27;all know how that goes.  The other thing is it takes a moment to warm up in your hands, and can make that annoying &amp;#34;lathering-up&amp;#34; sound, but I don&#x27;t mind that.  I think it can be good to pause and let your clients integrate the work between strokes while you warm more butter in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that what you put on the body is really important, as skin is the largest organ of our bodies.  For those looking for a natural alternative to oils/lotions/cremes for massage, something that is healing for the skin and offers therapeutic benefits, and is great to work with in terms of glide-ability, I highly recommend this shea butter!  (note: this is the first brand of shea butter I have tried, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other shea butters... but compared to the oils and cremes I have used, this is great).  And one more thing: I use a dip-stick to dip the butter out of the jar so I&#x27;m not sticking my fingers into it, but a friend of mine dips right in and hasn&#x27;t seen any spoilage or anything, so if you aren&#x27;t a super-jerm-a-phobe that can be an option too :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do let my clients know that it can feel a bit greasy on the skin and takes a little while to soak in, so for those who don&#x27;t want that, I use an oil or creme that soaks in more quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;coating&amp;#34; on the skin.  But for those with dry skin, most of them really like the shea butter, and will actually leave it on the rest of the day to let it soak in and &amp;#34;do its thing&amp;#34; before showering it off.and &amp;#34;do its thing&amp;#34; before showering it off.</li>
            <li> This stuff is solid and needs to be mixed with another oil to make it usable.</li>
            <li> So glad I saw this on Amazon! I was researching products I could use to help my eczema &amp; this product is wonderful! It really makes my skin feel great &amp; has helped with my eczema! I will purchase more Shea Butter from Molivera in the future! :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this Shea Butter. I add organic coconut oil, organic argon oil, and jojoba oil to make my own body lotion. My dry skin is responding well to this combination. Thanks for keeping it so simple and natural, so I can experiment adding my own natural ingredients or use it alone!</li>
            <li> Excellent worth the Price</li>
            <li> So I was a bit unsure of this Shea butter just because it&#x27;s not a lotion per day but actual raw Shea butter. This is just awesome for the price. I mean I&#x27;ve been using this thing for like 3 months and it still lasts me. I have taken a brake from using it for a bit to try other products but over all this is worth the money. I&#x27;ve only used it for my dry feet and my face a few times. Don&#x27;t apply this to your face before going outside as you may look ridiculously shiny and such.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the type to wriTe reviews. But I had to write about this amazing product. Firat time I can say real Shea butter. I have tried many others in the market and none compares to the quality this one offers. I&#x27;m amazed. This product is great. I have combination skin and I have tried all products in the market, expensive and not so expensive and they would not work on my combination skin. But ever since I&#x27;ve been using this Shea butter my skin has been clearer and looking just perfect. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or leaves greasy residue on my skin. It penetrates. If your looking for she butter I honestly recommend this product. Don&#x27;t think about it twice and the price is amazing compare to the quality.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you molivera  for selling real Shea butter</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter! Great quality, seller sends emails with tips and recipes, will re-purchase</li>
            <li> great with skin, have tried it with skin burn and works well. Will definitely try it on my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my biracial daughters skin feel and it works great on her hair, it&#x27;s just so thick and hard to put on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using other brands of shea butter for years and love it. This one is grainy, I&#x27;m exfoliating my face every time I put it on. Scrubbing the face every night can&#x27;t be good for skin. Seeing reviews on other brands, it seems like there&#x27;s a batch of grainy product in other brands also, I personally haven&#x27;t had any like this before. Don&#x27;t know I&#x27;ll be getting this brand again.</li>
            <li> Happy with the product and it&#x27;s many uses, having fun experimenting with it&#x27;s many uses!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on sale!  This was a bargan for the quality of the product.  There were other shea butter in larger quantity and much cheaper.  after reading the reviews of the other products on quality of product and packaging, I am extremely happy with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item for my 4 month old son-baby acne, cradle cap, ezcema, rashes, etc!  So far this seems to be working.  It&#x27;s only been two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review ater a month of using this item.</li>
            <li> I use Raw African Ivory Shea Butter to stretch my natural hair. This product works wonders. I also use this product on my elbow, feet and and heels. I highly recomment the product. Spreads fairly easily and the smell is gently, not too strong. Lastly, it is a great moisturizer for your face.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying shea. After reading a lot about the benefits of shea butter, I settled on this brand because of the reviews. I was very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Really great product. Works great for skin and hair and is all natural. Not heavy at all and really does a good job!</li>
            <li> Great Shea butter for use right out of the jar or making your own skin care products. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that this was organic and contained no additives. I&#x27;ve read what to look for when purchasing shea butter and this product delivered on all counts.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, and living in the desert, I have to say it really is a pleasure to use after a day hike.</li>
            <li> When you warm this butter in your hands it softens and then you can apply it to the skin. 100% shea butter. An excellent product!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my lotions</li>
            <li> I just got the shea butter, in a very timely manner for living overseas. I haven&#x27;t used it yet. I have terrible eczema and I&#x27;m waiting on other products to use this to make my own soap, shaving cream, etc...I love Shea butter, but have yet to try this one out.I rated it a 4 because they company was so expedient with it&#x27;s shipping. They even contacted me to confirm that I had received it and to offer suggestions for it&#x27;s use. Companies that follow through like that give me the warm and fuzzies. It&#x27;s a rare trait to have that kind of customer service these days.</li>
            <li> Great product. Good price. Smells clean and slightly nutty. Will reorder this in the future.  Thanks for the good work!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just about got this used up now and over the past few months, it seemed to get really clumpy.  It becomes soft again after you rub it through your hands a bit but the clumps kind of get everywhere.  I&#x27;ve found some other organic Shea Butter I like better now.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this product, the first order was a firm smooth compound but this second shipment is very grainy, hard to rub on the body. The grainy texture makes it somewhat hard to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.  It&#x27;s exactly what is described and it&#x27;s very raw and pure.  It&#x27;s a good price too.  I recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy this again, again and again &amp;#60;3 Is so perfect, my skin love this product so pure.</li>
            <li> my eczema is almost gone with great dieting and using this as a moisterizer has been wonders , I can imagaine using anthing else ... great product and they have an great team of workers to respond your needs and questions obtaining the product !!!</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter...feels a little grainy but its doing wonders on my sons ezcema so i love it.  although kinda hard to melt like everyone claims</li>
            <li> As advertised.  I&#x27;ve never used before and this is really a fine quality exceptional product.  Will purchase it again.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Smooth, and Creamy... a little struggle to lotion in and take out the jar but overall a good product. Good for hair and eczema</li>
            <li> This is wonderful stuff.  I have a feeling this jar will last me a long time too.  Very rich and nourishing of my skin.  No breakouts either.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Shea Butter on my face each night since I got it just recently.  It makes my skin feel amazing and I am also using it on a sunburn from the other day.  It&#x27;s unusual but once you get used to the texture and smell, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I have just received my jar and I have only used it a couple times, so I can&#x27;t say anything about the long term results of using this product. It is definitely a different kind of body moisturizer, VERY rich! Getting it out of the jar and distributing it is a little more time consuming than an ordinary moisturizer, but not too difficult. The trickiest aspect of it is the smell. It is quite bad even if, as other reviewers have said, it is not especially persistent. I gave it 5 stars because it seems unfair to take any off for features (texture and smell) that did not come as a surprise.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful and has many uses.  It makes your skin feel great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a shea butter lover since I do not like any other cream on my skin with bunch of added chemicals that God knows what they are. This product in particular is so smooth and a little goes a while. Definitely recommending this brand. I have tried many other ones but they do not have the same quality. As far as the smell goes, I don&#x27;t care. I like it that it is just plain - i can make a body butter my self.</li>
            <li> I have got to say that I am a newcomer to shea butter in general and this product specifically.  But, I have really grown to love it.  It is a bit greasy going on, but it really provides a deep, rich, and lasting moisturization.  I have been using it for my face, hands, knees, and arms and it has made a real difference. I like the mild earthy smell to it, as opposed to the more fragrant moisturizers out there.  Also, this tub lasts a long time.  It&#x27;s my go to for now, and based on my experience I can highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been exclusively using organic shea butter on my face, chest, arms, feet and elbows for almost eight months. I began using shea butter because I developed an unusual red, itchy, peppered rash on my neck and chest which I never experienced before. My eyelids also became inflamed and itchy. I purchased a different brand that was certified pure by the American Shea Butter Institute and had remarkable results, so much so, that my sister-in-law with chronic eczema also bought some. When I gave my 3/4 used container to a friend whose child suffers from skin disorders, I decided to try a different brand. That brand did not deliver the same results for me even though it was also certified grade A by the ASBI. I felt my skin begin to deteriorate and it burned by eyes, so I decided to try Molivera, based on the reviews and the fact that it is fair trade. So far I am pleased with this product. My skin seems to respond well to the formula and it does not irritate my eyes. I use it on my entire face and on my lids and under eye area as well as chest, feet, elbows, etc. I no longer use any other night cream or serums, and I believe my 50+ year old face and neck looks less wrinkled and more youthful as a result. Over the summer I severely burned my arm changing a lawnmower belt, and shea butter worked wonders in speeding healing and I have no scarring. I even use this to reduce the itch in mosquito bites. Am I a convert? You bet. Shea butter has been a boon to my skin, and this brand seems to be less expensive and higher quality than others.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I never heard about shea butter sooner.  It is very soothing to my skin and especially my dry hands.  There are no bad chemicals added so I don&#x27;t have to worry about absorbing anything toxic.  I am very sensitive to perfume and odors.  This has a very faint natural smell to it.  So happy I finally found a cream that works.</li>
            <li> Best healing moisturizer. Also a natural sunscreen. I use it on my whole body and face. Especially great for dry or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My first introduction to Shea Butter.  I have only made one salve with it and my essential oils.  It is very soothing.  Will be trying more &amp;#34;recipes&amp;#34; soon.  I am very happy with the quality.</li>
            <li> I have seen an improvement in the softness and appearance of my skin.  I have sun damage in this area and it has helped improve the appearance. Don&#x27;t expect miracles but with daily application improvement can be seen</li>
            <li> I am totally in love with this great product. I will continue buying itdms ftom this brand. Totally recommended!</li>
            <li> Great product! Smooth and creamy in texture. Smell is vey mild (no added perfumes). Natural/earthy scent. Easy application. Keeps in solid form, but heat from your hands is enough to warm it up. A little goes a long way so this large jar lasts a long time. Good price. Makes my skin feel very happy. Using it on stretch marks - with vitamin e oil and bio oil. Don&#x27;t think anything exists that truly erases stretch marks, but this makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love the product and fabulous customer service! I will definitely do business with Oliver&#x27;s Organics in the future and this product will be a staple in my Home!</li>
            <li> I call it my miracle go to cream simply because it is!  I use it consistently after I shower.  It works great on dry skin and better yet on stretch marks (new AND old ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone with dry skin.  Works well on the face.  Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> very good product and delivery is OK</li>
            <li> Love to mix this with other oils and essential oils to create lotion or use alone. I love that it is noncomedogenic so I can even put it on my face.</li>
            <li> I honestly do not like to write reviews unless is worth it. With that being said I&#x27;m giving this a 4 star because it was not delivered when they said it was but I  can honestly say that I LOVE this product so much. Like I mentioned It took a while to arrive even though I have prime I&#x27;m not sure if it was because it was a holiday. I received it on a Thursday that same night I put it on as well on Friday. And By Saturday I started to notice the dark spots fading. I&#x27;m very happy I never thought this dark spots would go away.  I&#x27;m very surprised of how well and fast it works. I researched I can only find great things about this product. I have always had dark spots on my face. It&#x27;s hard to put anything on because my skin is very sensitive that turns red right away. Because My face is a bit oily and dry I only put it on during the night or if I don&#x27;t go out because it&#x27;s a bit oily. It has a strong smell my sister said it smells like lard. I read that the smell goes away. I honestly don&#x27;t if is true or I think you just get use to the smell because it&#x27;s on your face.  I can only speak from my experience but I think that before you buy anything it&#x27;s good to research And see if it&#x27;s something you want to try.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive dry skin that hasn&#x27;t been helped by the dermatologist but cleared up in 3 days. Thanks</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is no joke. I&#x27;m no expert on shea butters, but I bought this to add to my baths to soften my skin and it works wonderfully. I put a small spoonful in my baths and my skin and hair are super soft afterwards. Very noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Despite some grittiness this shea butter rocks.  The smell is totally natural and I think making this into a lotion might penetrate the layers of the skin more effectively.  I am very satisfied with this product and will order more.</li>
            <li> I love shea butter, and this one gets the job done, but crumbles in hand, making it really annoying to apply. I&#x27;m not repurchasing.</li>
            <li> It melts in my hand and the sent isn&#x27;t overpowering! i love to use it in my hair and I would order it again when it finishes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shea butter! When I got it it was very stiff and felt grainy, but I think that might be partially due to the sub freezing temperatures it was transported in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell of shea butter, so I melted it in s double boiler and added a few spoonfuls of coconut oil (hopefully to make it less stiff) and some lavender oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is creamy without being oily. It absorbs quickly but leaves my hands feeling moisturized. I will definitely order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I know shea butter is great for the skin, but did not know it was also good for scrapes and cuts. I wish it would have had a safety seal on it to to be sure of its purity, but otherwise I am happy with it</li>
            <li> Price is good, shipping is good, look and smell when arrived is good. Quality of the product is good. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this product. I&#x27;d recommend anyone looking for raw shea butter to purchase this item. I love the fact that it comes in a dark jar with a lid.</li>
            <li> I purchased Shea Butter to help with a few mosquito bite scars on my ankles from scratching, which I got over the summer.  I had recently moved from Brooklyn, NY to the country (purchased a house) and, although it is beautiful here and I love it, I did not realize that there were so many mosquitoes here, there are nearly none in the city so I have not had a mosquito bite in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that Shea butter helps the scars improve so I decided to try it.  I guess that I am accustom to using creams because this butter is really thick, similar to a soap bar, so I can hardly take some out of the jar. In addition, the butter appears to sit on my skin, it is not really absorbent at all although other reviewers mentioned that it absorbs quickly, not the case.  Maybe if you have very dry skin the butter might absorb well, but I have normal skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This butter has a nice subtle scent, which I like, and I like the fact that it is all natural.  I will continue to use the butter, and I am hoping that it helps improve the mosquito bites!</li>
            <li> leaves my skin so soft without that greasy feeling!</li>
            <li> This is the real deal. It has the distinctive color and smell of raw shea butter, which definitely threw me off at first, but after like five minutes I realized that I love the smell. As far as effectiveness, I&#x27;ve been using it as a moisturizer (in which capacity it works wonders), but I also put it on a cut that I got, and it noticeably soothed the redness and swelling. Great stuff, for real.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this Shea butter. It was recommended by a friend and I can tell its great quality, nice and ivory, smooth with a nice nutty scent. It came in a great package too! Thx</li>
            <li> Not the best smelling stuff when you first apply it but I&#x27;ve never used anything that worked so well on my very dry, flaky skin. Plus the odd smell dissipates in a very short time. I&#x27;ll never go back to those expensive, chemical lotions since finding this product.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of using a single, pure ingredient moisturizer (just like food.. i get scared when I see a million ingredients on labels). The skin near my nails is quite sensitive to chemicals in most hand moisturizers, and have found only a couple or so brands that are made for sensitive skin and that i liked enough to keep using. So I decided to try pure shea butter even though it&#x27;s a bit greasy. Use in smaller quantities and rub in for a minute or two. It absorbs well. I use more before turning in for the night, right after showers or after gardening, scrubbing pots/pans, or any other task that really does a number on my hands. I also use it as a lip moisturizer at night, on my elbows, and any body part that feels too dry (especially in the winters). The smell of this butter is very mild, sweet nutty. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this...I have mixed feelings about it...it makes your skin sooo soft &amp; smooth...but to Me...it smells Horrible!!...some said it smelled nutty so I thought it would smell good...but I can&#x27;t even use it because the smell makes me nauseous...some say they microwaved it and added Vanilla oil...which might make it smell better...but I don&#x27;t want my microwave to smell like this!!...I will probably end up throwing it away!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different products to help my dry skin, from the expensive to the organic type but this is the most effective so far.  The product shipped very quickly and the generous amount will last very long.</li>
            <li> Nothing has felt better on my skin than this Shea butter! Perfect for winter on the Midwest, no more chapping or cracking of my skin. I love it!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this shea butter purchase yet, but wanted to put out to Amazon customers that this supplier,  Molivera,  is amazing.  They truly  care about the quality of their shea butter.  I will write  again  once I use it long enough  for a review.  Molivera has sent me a few emails  to check in to make sure I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and sometimes I get small allergy rashes on my face. This butter feels so good. I put it on my whole body before I go to bed - face and hair included. When I wake up my skin is like renewed, soft and moisturized. You know how cleansing products make your skin clean but so dry ? That butter is the perfect solution for dry and sensitive skin! And you get so much Shea Butter for low price - it will be enough for the whole year. Just to let you know, it doesn&#x27;t smell very good, it&#x27;s raw and organic, don&#x27;t expect it to smell like a perfume.</li>
            <li> Great quality, just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. It&#x27;s very smooth and creamy. I mix with lavender oil Makes my hair feel and smell amazing</li>
            <li> This stuff is excellent. Very top of the line and so far, it&#x27;s been great for lip balms and skin care. I have no complaints and will keep buying. Coming from a family that suffers from skin rashes. I&#x27;m happy to have found this product.</li>
            <li> It is sooooooooo soft!!! Not too greasy. Just right for skin.  I even put small amounts in my hair after I condition it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  My first experience with Shea Butter, and I love it.  Whipped together in the mixer with coconut oil, and this will be my body lotion from now on.  Will use this seller again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Shea butter. I like to heat it up in the microwave and use it as an oil.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I normally purchase shea butter from beauty supply stores in the clear plastic containers (you know the ones I&#x27;m talking about) but wanted to try something different. I love the texture and smell of this brand. I am using it everywhere! Hair, face, lips, feet, etc. Will definitely purchase again. Thanks</li>
            <li> Love love  this product, smooth, light nutty smell, just what you would want shea butter to be. Also amazing customer service.</li>
            <li> its a fabulous product...just what i needed for my DIY projects</li>
            <li> The product was delivered on time. I have ordered this product 4 or 5 times now. While I will probably order it again the texture of the Shea Butter is inconsistent. Sometimes it is gritty, which is not what I expect or like. It was gritty again this time.</li>
            <li> High quality Shea butter! Used with essential oils to make hand lotion. Makes skin super soft. Good to know I&#x27;m not putting chemicals on my skin!</li>
            <li> Wonderful butter. It is a personal favorite.</li>
            <li> Informative product info included with purchase. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product! Super easy to use. Turns into an oil substance just by rubbing it in between your hands. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have stumbled across this product - I was just looking for Shea butter for my hair but this is even better. I have been using it on my hair for just a week and it looks soft and shiny. I am also using it on my skin which looks and feels soft and supple.  I will definitely keep buying this.</li>
            <li> This butter us amazing! Melts beautifully with other butters, oils and beeswax. There is NO grittiness in it whether it&#x27;s solid or melted. I will absolutely order this product again.</li>
            <li> great value for the money</li>
            <li> I loved this products, used it to make all sorts of DIY beauty goods- I especially loved it in lip balm! I just ordered my second tub!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable product!  I&#x27;ve used it for every possible purpose under the sun and it&#x27;s like a miracle worker!  I can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough.</li>
            <li> For the past eight or nine years I&#x27;ve been a regular user of organic raw coconut oil. Now I have another body moisturizer. I love the way shea softens my skin, makes it glow,  and it seems to be fading dark spots on my hands and ankles. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days! I am anxious to see what several weeks will show. Just one thing... it isn&#x27;t as smoothly spreadable as coconut oil. But it does melt in as you massage it into your skin. Also after it does melt in, it is odorless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a question: Is it possible to cook with it? I cook and bake with the coconut oil and was wondering if shea nut butter can be used in this way also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing. I use this for facial and skin care and this product has helped my skin a lot. It has been a brutal winter and this Shea butter has helped maintain my skin moisture. I also have acne marks and it has helped with fading those as well when I use it in my morning facial mask. Since it is raw it doesn&#x27;t really have a smell but it gets the job done and I would definitely buy this product again. The shopping was late but it was worth it!</li>
            <li> Thank you - use this product daily. Hair, face, hands, and feet.  Protects from the cold weather as well.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Bought this product a week ago and I can already see results in the texture of my skin, it looks and feels smooth. I was concerned the shea butter will make my face breakout, I have very oily and acne prone skin and using this product has not caused any pimples...so far I&#x27;m loving it!!!</li>
            <li> This is the miracle skin softener.  It works overnight!  Even better, it&#x27;s an organic and fair trade product.</li>
            <li> Shea Butter has to be the best cream I have ever tried.  It actually penetrates into the skin and doesn&#x27;t just sit on the top layer of your skin. I&#x27;m happy that it&#x27;s organic and unrefined.  The price is reasonable enough for me to buy as gifts so my family can try it and experience what I have experienced.  It helps all skin conditions.</li>
            <li> This has evened out my skin tone dramatically and helps a lot with my dark spots. It leaves my skin nice and soft with a glow in the morning. I only use it at night and use it on my face and neck. I just love shea butter</li>
            <li> This stuff moisturizers really well and isn&#x27;t greasy, but it smells awful. I have to put my Bliss body butter on after just to cover up the smell. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  My hands always crack and chap every change of season it seems.  Like cracking to the point of bleeding. This is the first thing I&#x27;ve found that works super fast. By the end of the week I forgot I forgot to keep using it  Because I didn&#x27;t need to anymore. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Great for the face! I use it every night and my skin is baby soft in the morning. You can ditch any expensive eye creams and use this instead.</li>
            <li> use with my essential oil blends.  perfect</li>
            <li> Buttery and oh so calming- I&#x27;ve never had such a soothing cream for my dry skin! Absolutely love it. Comes out of the jar a little grainy, but with a few warmup smears, it&#x27;s very silky on the skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Super moisturizing, a bit hard when you first open it, but if you leave it inside the bathroom while you&#x27;re showering, the steam from the bath will make it easier to apply. This is the best remedy against dry and chapped skin, and it leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft.&lt;br /&gt;Good packaging too, and it&#x27;s a plastic jar, which makes it easier when transporting haha.</li>
            <li> Great Shea butter. I use it mostly for my skin. I tried using it on my hair, but I found it to be a little heavy. It definitely has become a part of my holy grail.</li>
            <li> Was put off by the coarseness and stayed greasy for a long time after application..Would not order again</li>
            <li> This is truly a completely natural product.  I am very pleased with its moisturizing, soothing, and healing abilities. I highly recommend Molivera Organics Shea Butter!</li>
            <li> This shea butter feels wonderful on my skin.  It&#x27;s a little thick, but I use coconut oil first and then the shea butter on extra dry spots, and the combination makes the shea butter easier to massage into my skin.  The smell is a little strange at first, but you get used to it, plus it dissipates after about 10 minutes.  I feel really good about using something that is completely natural and totally safe, and I like this stuff!  I&#x27;m using it on my hands, dry patches on my face, elbows, and eczema spots.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It works wonders.  I had used L&#x27;Occitane Shea Butter before, there is no comparison either in quality or price.&lt;br /&gt;Five stars to the vendor as well, great service, prompt delivery and discreet follow up.</li>
            <li> We were using coconut oil for lotion but that just wasn&#x27;t cutting it now that it&#x27;s so cold and dry. Love this shea butter, and the company&#x27;s great customer service.</li>
            <li> I mix with essential oils for my sons eczema and it has improved dramatically. A little goes a long way so one tub should last for months while other creams marketed to help aid dry skin or eczema have only lasted a month or two for us because we use it so often. This product is only necessary twice a day for my son! Getcha some!!!</li>
            <li> Really good so far as my wife bought this for herself after reading the benefits of shea butter from Stacy Kiebler in some pregnancy magazine. I&#x27;ve taken to using it as well. While the promises of healing minor scrapes and scratches hasn&#x27;t really panned out for me, I do think it is a great product that keeps skin tight and soft with continued use. We will probably be reordering this when we run out.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my heals. Lied it so much I bought some for my mom</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter, best I&#x27;ve ever used. Will definitely purchase again. A little goes a long way and my skin has never felt better, I also use it on my nails and they&#x27;ve gotten stronger and are looking lovely.</li>
            <li> Wow another product tha is favorable .... I received my item before the scheduled date without a doubt they are true to their description absolutely no additives. This produc works it leaves my hair soft and manageble I am a huge fan and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> 2nd jar review:&lt;br /&gt;Well my first jar review was great (below), but I&#x27;ve now downgraded this product to one star. Why? Not only is the smell of this new jar kinda gross (like rubber) but it&#x27;s VERY GRAINY and doesn&#x27;t melt into the skin at all. I started putting it on immediately after showering but I stopped at my calves once I realized it wasn&#x27;t going to absorb into my skin like the first jar. That was an hour ago. I just touched my foot and it&#x27;s STILL grainy and I can still smell it. Gotta go wash this junk off and throw the jar out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First jar review: My first time with this brand and it&#x27;s much nicer than the other shea butter I have purchased. The packaging was good, the smell is nice (not overpowering) and it &#x27;melts&#x27; quicker in your hands. It&#x27;s fairly solid in the jar, but I just keep an old spoon next to it so it scoops out easily. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Organic Shea Butter was highly recommended by my naturopath to relieve patches of extremely dry skin. I&#x27;m now on my third tub of Molivera Organics Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a period of years I&#x27;ve likely tried some 30-plus highly rated and often very expensive products and nothing has worked to help soften these stubborn patches. That is until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Molivera Organics Shea Butter is unlike any product I&#x27;ve ever used. For one, it&#x27;s not emollient so don&#x27;t expect a creamy body butter that spreads easily over the skin. However, as many have stated, this dry, grainy texture goes part and parcel with its unprocessed purity. Believe me, for all the benefits it confers this is something that&#x27;s easily overcome. Second, I&#x27;d gladly trade all the fancy creamy lotions that I&#x27;ve used over the years for this one product as it&#x27;s the only one that really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: We have a heater/fan in our bathroom so I set it out when I&#x27;m preparing our showers and let it heat during our showers. This makes it a lot easier to spread on the skin I find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also mention that the dryness inherent in this butter is actually wonderful when used on the hands during the day because it leaves no greasy residue! I&#x27;m on the computer for a large part of the day and really appreciate having a product that dries so quickly (and works so well). That can&#x27;t be said about most hand creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, I started using this Shea Butter in late November on a stubborn brown spot on my face and six weeks later it&#x27;s almost completely faded. This was after using hydroquinone (horrors for an all-natural girl!) from my dermatologist for over six months that did nothing to lighten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also impressed by the company&#x27;s outreach. They do a great job in following up and offering instructions on how to get the most value from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: highly recommended... &#x60;Tou-Sh&amp;eacute;a!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I should mention that it took one full month of daily use to transform the driest skin on the tops of my feet. However, daily use of numerous other products (multiplied by years) didn&#x27;t do anything to resolve the issue. My skin feels baby soft again. Happy feet, happy me!f daily use to transform the driest skin on the tops of my feet. However, daily use of numerous other products (multiplied by years) didn&#x27;t do anything to resolve the issue. My skin feels baby soft again. Happy feet, happy me!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I&#x27;ve had experience with refined Shea Butter and you can for sure tell that this is actually organic. I find it quite interesting you can use for insect bites as well as sun screen. Sun screen is supposed to be terrible for you so it&#x27;s nice to find something that is organic to use. Will be buying again!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use much, but so far it is as advertised. It has a nice creamy texture and pleasant odor, and comes in a dark container to protect it from sunlight.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used!! It leaves your skin feel soft and moisturized literally all day. My man loves the feel of it to :) say bye bye to ashy skin</li>
            <li> Smells great! Goes on very smooth and leaves the skin feeling very soft. Would recommended to friends and family. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this for use in homemade body products but it is so good I use it on its own. The texture is perfect, super moisturizing without being too waxy or too greasy.  Just a light shea butter scent, nothing overpowering though so if you don&#x27;t like it it would likely be easy to cover up with essential oils.  I&#x27;ve gotten several emails from Molivera following up and giving suggestions for ways to use the shea butter, so it seems like they are focused on customer service also.</li>
            <li> I have been interested in using natural products for my face and body, so I decided to try raw shea butter as a body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This raw shea butter comes in a solid, hard form.  It can be hard to dig out of the jar and you have to warm it up in your hands before applying to the body.  I loved how hydrating it is, but there has to be a better way!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered easy recipes to whip the shea butter into a body lotion.  This is a much better way of applying the shea butter and I am not as frustrated trying to dig it out of the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many more complicated recipes, but I used a very easy one.&lt;br /&gt;1. melt shea butter using either double boiler method or microwaving.&lt;br /&gt;2. add some oil (olive, almond, jojoba, avocado, coconut)  really any other good body oil&lt;br /&gt;3. whisk by hand or blend with blender.&lt;br /&gt;4. let cool (but not completely)&lt;br /&gt;5. add essential oil for scent&lt;br /&gt;6. whisk a little more&lt;br /&gt;7.add to container!  Done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This recipe can be used for body or face, make sure essential oil is ok for face use though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOPE THIS HELPS!!!  THIS IS GREAT STUFF!!</li>
            <li> I make my own natural body products and I am going to purchase my Shea Butter from Molivera Organics from now on. I actually returned some Shea Butter I had previously purchased because it&#x27;s quality was inferior to the Raw African Ivory Shea Butter I purchased from Molivera Organics.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. My hair has been chronically dry due to extensive use of shampoos and anti-dandruff shampoos and it wasn&#x27;t until I started using this that I was able to get my hair back to it&#x27;s natural softness. Some reviewers on here have complained about grittiness, but if you take the time to melt the shea butter by rubbing it in the palm of your hands it melts easily and loses whatever grittiness that may have been there. The shea butter itself isn&#x27;t too oily that my scalp and hair feel like they&#x27;re covered in castor oil. It instead feels like a very rich, smooth, layering the lightly sits on top of my hair and scalp until being absorbed by my skin. I use it once a week or when I feel like my hair is getting dry and it works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it in areas of chronic skin dryness, and within a few uses those problems became non-existent. I would highly recommend this to those looking for natural hair conditioners and for those looking for natural alternatives to chemical-ridden lotions.</li>
            <li> This did wonders for my skin. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this Shea Butter for over a week now. It is a bit grainy, as other reviewers have said, but most of it melts as soon as you put it on your skin. It is doing wonders on a skin rash that I have had for months as well as clearing up my daughters eczema. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff nothing like a natural product that does what it says plus some. I havent had this stuff but for a couple weeks and I notice the difference its made in my skin. For me this will a product I will continue to by.  I have very sensitive skin including some mild eczema on the side of my face. Also one of the reasons why I bought this butter. Its so moisturizing i was shocked. I cant find any other moisturizer that will get that and other dry patches on my body moisturized as well as last all day. You know that was a bonus for me. So you damn right its a product that works. It seems oily when putting the product on but after 5mins of it setting in the skin its not oily at all. It also gives me a nice glow as well. Day by day I notice how its slowly improving my skin back to its natural youth. So I highly recommend this product to many with dry skin eczema or normal skin. It will keep your skin moisturized and get it back to natural glow,health and plus some.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely product and met all my expectations as I was making lotion bars.  Beautiful texture and aroma.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I use it every day all over my body and hair. I can&#x27;t get enough.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is absolutely fantastic. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different body butters from various drugstores...but this body butter is of a totally different caliber. I&#x27;m currently using this product in conjunction with dermaroller on stretch marks that I&#x27;ve had for nearly ten years. After four or so days of using this shea butter + the dermaroller, I already have seen results. It&#x27;s very hydrating, soothing, and smells fantastic. I love that this comes in a MASSIVE amount, so I know it&#x27;s going to last for a while. Once it runs out, I will definitely be getting more! Love it!</li>
            <li> good stuff, happens to work great for my skin. I&#x27;ve bought 3 tubs of it over the past couple years, same brand - the first and third were really grainy right from the start, and the 2nd was very smooth. I am guessing it has something to do with temperature.</li>
            <li> The material in the jar is quite hard and difficult to spread.  How do I soften it up?</li>
            <li> This is first time buying and using raw Shea. I have very sensitive and dry skin, and so far this is fantastic. Thick but not oily. Moisturizing without any irritation or break outs. Love it.</li>
            <li> am in love with this!!!</li>
            <li> Wow!&lt;br /&gt;This Shea is awesome.! I have made body butters with it and they are amazing. It melts really well and actually smells on the side of coco butter. I will definately be ordering again. Received in a timely manner and the dark jar is an absolute plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;It is all you say it is</li>
            <li> I mix this with coconut oil for my daily hand and body lotion.</li>
            <li> Have used other forms of the &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; shea butter and really love this one.  Will definitely buy more in the near future.</li>
            <li> I am currently stationed overseas, but I ordered this and sent it home for when I come back--I&#x27;m excited to use it in my chapsticks and lotions! The seller was great, and followed up with two emails to explain what I would be receiving, and then again to make sure I received it. Each email was signed by a person&#x27;s name, not just the company--I feel good about giving them my money for a quality product!</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how firm/hard the shea butter was when I got it - the trick is to let it warm up in your hand before rubbing it in. I&#x27;ve never had a body butter stick to my skin for so long - I put it on my hands before bed and its still there when I was my hands in the morning. This can be a pro or con depending on what you&#x27;re looking for (i.e. its not good for legs, since it sits on the surface of your skin like a glaze and fuzz/dog hair sticks to it) but it is undeniably high quality shea butter.</li>
            <li> Save my skin in Pittsburgh&#x27;s winter. I love this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold forever! I use this shea butter on my skin and in my hair. It makes my hair very soft and full of body. It makes my skin soft and moisturized. I even make my homemade deodorant with this shea butter.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this product to be a little more smoother in consistency, however it delivers great moisture without being overly oily. Use mainly on hands and body after showering and plan on using it with conditioner when I shampoo my hair. Love it so far.</li>
            <li> This made my skin soooo soft! I also put it on my feet, (my heels get real dry) and it was soooo slippery and caused me to slide and fall out of my sandals -- this is not a bad thing -- it means its super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always used lotions with shea butter in them in the past (jergens, etc.) but this is just so much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be a little bit hard to get out and spread, because it hardens, but its not inconvenient or and issue or anything. I truly love this product.</li>
            <li> I saw no difference in my stretch marks, the smell is a bit overwhelming, however it leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft. I will continue to apply it, however have given up trying to see any improvement in my stretch marks. Been using it for over 3 months now.</li>
            <li> I bought this just to add as ingredient for a recipe... But found myself dipping into it all the time to moisturize my skin😊</li>
            <li> Fabulous!!! Helps with dry skin,wrinkles, cuts you name it.  It&#x27;s real and raw and is wonderfully nourishing for skin!!!!  Do the honors of treating your skin.  Big tub will last forever!!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other brands to compare, but this product is really great. The consistency is smooth and wonderful. I&#x27;ve used it alone and in combination with other ingredients to make my own lip balm, body butter, facial moisturizer, and deodorant, among other things. Molivera Organics has been wonderful with emails remind me of the benefits of this product and give me other ideas for how to use it. This is the only brand I&#x27;ll buy!</li>
            <li> I researched organic shea butters and this is the best! Great quality, huge jar. I will have this for a long time. I got a burn on my leg and have been putting this on it every day. Miracle worker!!</li>
            <li> First, this was a hassle free purchase and arrived exactly as expected.  Second, I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks now.  I&#x27;m extremely happy with what it has done for my skin.  I&#x27;m a 43 year old male who likes to spend time outside in the sun.  I&#x27;ve been using this lotion mixed with some coconut oil based lotion. I&#x27;ve been using the same lotion without the Shea for quite a long time.  When I added the Shea Butter my skin became noticeably softer and more pliable.  Now, after two weeks I have a glow and softness to my skin that my wife really finds wonderful.  My skin has a more youthful appearance and feel!  I wish I had known about this long ago!  Thanks again Molivera!!</li>
            <li> I have used several brands but none are like this. Usually Shea butter has a slight grittiness that melts once you handle it. Even if you melt it the grittiness is there. Not with this.  Smooth.  My salve that is a mix of herb infused oils Shea and beeswax is the smoothest I have ever made. Really wonderful, inexpensive too, I shall be buying more.</li>
            <li> This is the best. I love the way my skin looks and feels after using this product. I mix it with coconut oil, Olive oil, johoba oil, vitamin e oil with a few drops of lavender oil and I have my body butter. Keeps my skin moist. Before I always had dry skin to the point of irritation. I will definitely continue to get Molivera organic Shea butter. Very smooth and not grainy.</li>
            <li> Only after a few time my skins feels much softer and wrinkles are not as noticeable . Even makes my feet soft</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less greasy than other brands of shae butter I&#x27;ve purchased. The smell is a little strong - sort of like faint licorice mixed with tobacco.</li>
            <li> I use it at night because it is a little greasy and I don&#x27;t want to get it on my clothes but it makes my skin very soft. I was expecting it to smell like chocolate or something but it actually has no fragrance. Overall it&#x27;s a good product and gives your skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as an after-shave skin conditioner (I&#x27;m using a double-edge razor). What a difference - no razor burn, no post-shave bumps. The results encouraged me to start using the shea butter as a general moisturizer, and wow, what a difference! I&#x27;ve had challenges with drying skin on my hands, elbows, scalp, and hips for years. I&#x27;ve tried various moisturizers, which provide some improvement, but marginal. The shea butter is a total transformation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of the Molivera Organics shea butter. The price is great, and my order here on Amazon was fulfilled as expected.</li>
            <li> Used to make lotion. Smells, weird to me, but I don&#x27;t know what shea butter should smell like. Melted easily and smell was not detectable after heating, mixing and adding essential oils. The texture is nice, goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different brands of shea butter, and by far this is the best one I have found! I love that is is unrefined! I have used this in many different ways, to make lotion, hair treatments, medicinal ointments and creams, and just straight out of the jar. It blends really well with other oils like coconut, sweet almond and jojoba. The best thing I have found is that it really helps seal the moisture into my skin, especially on my feet which get very dry and cracked during Rocky Mountain winters. The other thing that I love is that is sourced responsibly, that was one of the major selling points for me on my first purchase.  All around a really wonderful product, do try it!</li>
            <li> I debated whether to purchase shea butter from this particular company. The market is quite competitive and everyone pretty much has the same quality butter. I researched, read reviews, and added 2 or 3 different brands to my cart. I&#x27;m so pleased that I chose Molivera. Everything from the delivery, packaging, and actual product is stellar. As compared the butter that I used before, it is definitely more grainy, however very similar in overall consistency and nutty smell. I use it on my skin, hair, and just recently, on my newborn.</li>
            <li> This is really good on my natural African-American hair. I use it with the Life-Flo Oil, Pure Almond, 16 Ounce. You just have to rub it together in your hand really well before putting it in your hair but it&#x27;s an awesome hair softener.</li>
            <li> This a great product!  I had an issue with a cracked heel, and this cleared it up.  My feet have never been so soft.</li>
            <li> I had previously bought from essential depot and I decided to try this brand since it packaged the product in a jar and had high ratings. I liked the butter but sadly, I found black specks in my jar - maybe it&#x27;s was just a batch quality issue.</li>
            <li> best quality ,will recommend it . love the quality use it all the time , all the family , will buy again ,thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on both my skin and naturally curly 3c hair. It&#x27;s worked wonders! But, my favorite thing about this product is by far the fact that it has completely cleared up my skin! I had some bad acne and this shea butter has cleared it up faster than any topical prescription I&#x27;ve ever used. I was skeptical but I&#x27;m so happy that it&#x27;s actually worked, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent on my hand. Mixed it with that almond oil. Thanks</li>
            <li> Purchased it about a month ago and recently started using it. It just doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin the way that I anticipated that it would. So, now when I use it I add a little Vaseline to it.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is the first time we tried shea butter and we have been loving it so far.  It has a very smooth texture. My wife mixes the butter with olive oil to make it easy to rub on the skin.  My son has a dry skin and during winters, his skin breaks and gets red.  We have been applying shea butter mixed with olive oil to his skin and we are pleased with its effects.  We highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have not used this yet but I am so happy to have found this product</li>
            <li> Ordered many Shea butter products from other companies. They&#x27;ve all been just okay but Ivory Shea Butter is my favorite by far. It comes in a generous size jar, the consistency is pretty solid and this makes it last longer. It can be used on the face, body and hair but I use it on my hair. I love the way it makes my hair feel and look. The best thing about it is that it keeps your hair hydrated for ages!! I have dry hair and it keeps my hair moisturized and hydrated. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin. My face always felt tight and dry. I have used name brand moisturizers and cheaper ones nothing was really helping. I thought I would give this a try. From the first application I could tell there was a difference. my face felt soft. I have used this several times and I love it. So far it has been the best money I have spent. I will buy this again !!</li>
            <li> This is incredible, I hesitate a little bit when I ordered it but I am very happy that I did it, my face is blooming and grateful!!!</li>
            <li> I started making my own lotion and body cream for winter last year and shea butter is a must have in the cold, dry Wisconsin winter.  I have been very pleased with this brand of shea butter.  It is a good deal in price, has been very easy to work with, and a nice, smooth, creamy texture.  Will definitely purchase again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this beeswax in my homemade lotion. Looks and feels great and I love that I&#x27;m using all organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I bought this after much research on how to alleviate my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s eczema.  I have tried all kinds of commercial products such as Burt&#x27;s Bees, Aveeno, Cerave, Petroleum Jelly, Aquaphor, and a variety of other things that have been recommended for eczema and nothing has worked.  Her poor knees are always inflamed and it looks like the eczema was moving to her cheeks.  I just started using this for the last 4 weeks (morning and night - especially after a bath) and it has made an enormous difference for the better.  So glad I found this shea butter.  It&#x27;s nicely packaged and not chunky.  It&#x27;s easy to manipulate (a solid that melts nicely in your hands and goes on smoothly).  I have even used this on my face (I have very oily skin) before bed as an evening cream.  It leaves my face looking fresh and I haven&#x27;t broken out from it.  Thank you for this product!  I am sold.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Ahhhmazing product!!!!!!! I had second degree burns from hot grease on my arm. It bubbles up and formed puss in a matter of hours. I was given a tetanus shot and antibiotics upon arrival to the doctor. Everyone knows what a fresh burn looks like. This is mine after two weeks on the pure Shea butter.  Notice in the pic how parts of the burnt black sections are now healed to my normal skin color. It moisturized it, allowed the dead cells to peel away with new skin , the the best part is its scar free!!  Will continue to use because the doctor told me 2 months, the Shea butter showed me healing in 2 weeks. This is nothing short of AMAZING !! It works, please have no doubt in purchasing this!!</li>
            <li> I bought it for myself and everyone In the family household is using it and its going so fast I will be having to buy a new one soon! Great product!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, extremely beneficial to skin, fair-trade and fast shipping / great customer service.  Will repurchase frequently.</li>
            <li> This pure shea butter is really concentrated.  i recently started to use it.  Havent seen results cause is too soon, but im applying it on my hips for my stretchmarks to see what happens.</li>
            <li> Great customer service and product</li>
            <li> Before using this 100% Pure Raw African Ivory Shea Butter my hands were red, severely cracked, and scabbed over from bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;I would literally cry at night from the pain and stiffness due to dryness. But after a day and a half of using this product, my hands feel normal again. The scabs, cracking, and pain are all gone; The redness is almost completely gone! I only wish I used it much sooner. Please do yourself a favor and purchase/use this product if you have dry hands. I also use this on my feet; works great.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is very thick, and it takes a minute or so on your skin to warm up and smooth out. Feels sticky at first, then after working it into the skin for a few minutes it absorbs without any stickiness. It only takes a dime size amount for your hands...this jar will last a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know it at the time of purchase, but after purchase I received an email from the seller, stating the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does Shea Butter &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; my skin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea Butter has a very high &amp;#34;healing fraction&amp;#34;, up to 12% of the butter’s make-up (more than any other type of seed oil). These amazing healing properties have shown great success in treating various skin problems such as wrinkles, blemishes, skin allergies, eczema, and other skin conditions. Shea Butter can be used when treating minor cuts, scrapes, and soothing sunburns. Shea butter also has the ability to reduce inflammation, which makes shea butter the premiere product to speed the healing of skin that has undergone cosmetic surgery or tattooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...so now I have more reasons to love this product!</li>
            <li> Thick organic pure shea butter. My feet get very dry, especially during the winter, and this shea butter works wonders. It is much thicker than most processed, mixed ingredient body butters</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!!!! I wish I had discovered this years ago! I have used high end products and serums from high end dept. stores and I am so glad I can use just ONE dang product and get everything I need! I have been breaking out for years and was getting super frustrated with it! I am 36 and my skin is the worst it has ever been. I think it&#x27;s all hormones, but anyways, I have been using this night and day on my face and anywhere else and I saw major improvements after just applying it one night. My skin is still getting better and better and less bumpy. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does in a month! You can literally feel the healing right away.  I did a lot of research on Shea Butter and the quality that you want to get to get the most benefits and this is a great buy for premium shea butter! Oh and I also notice it is evening my skin tone out, and it has natural uv protection. I have suffer sensitive skin all my entire life and nothing has felt as good as this stuff. So very happy with this product, will be using this for the rest of my life! No more spending hundreds of dollars on complicated skin products. Like the one ingredient for me. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The best product for skin and hair I have ever tried. I use it by itself as a lotion after shower, I added it to my shampoo and conditioner and face cream. The skin is glowing and hair got healthier. Very happy with this product</li>
            <li> This product has transformed my skin. No more dryness.  Truly a miracle!</li>
            <li> At first I was thrown off by the smell and consistency (which is gritty and hard) but after whipping it up with some jojoba oil, no lotion can compare! Moisturizes all day long, legs look amazing the next day! I&#x27;ll be trying this on my breakout probe face next! Thank you! And great customer service!</li>
            <li> Hi quality product. A little goes a long ways as it is very thick and moisturizing. Absorbs very well into the skin. I purchased it to replace my cocunut oil to use as moisturizer / lip balm for myself and my little ones for our cold/dry northwest winters. The coconut oil gets the job done in summer but not in the colder weather.  My daughter is prone to getting a little winter eczema so I was hoping the shea butter will act as a preventative measure. Customer service is amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very grainy... :/ i microwaved it and it still left white specs on my skin And hair. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order this again.</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter. Its a GREAT product to experiment with by adding other oils ( essential oils, organic grapeseed oil ect )</li>
            <li> This appears to be good stuff.  I have naturally oily skin, but as I have aged, this has tapered off.  This product has excellent packaging, dark to keep light out.  Easy on and off lid.  It has an oddly musky smell, but, having never used a product like this before I have no idea if this is normal or not.  It definitely stays with you.  It does not run and get into your eyes as the day goes on.  Washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> A great price for real African shea butter.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the quality and consistency of this product. As a first time buyer of Molivera Organics Ivory Shea Butter, my apprehensiveness was muted as I smelled and felt the goodness of this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I use it in lieu of a moisturizer and my skin glows. While it is thick and can be greasy at first, my skin nicely absorbs it. There are a multitude of uses. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Skin is already so smooth and moisturized!</li>
            <li> This shea butter is wondeful! I started using shea butter i purchased at a health food store &amp; thought i was getting a superior product. After all the reading i did on shea butter i realized what i had previously bought wasn&#x27;t a grade A butter. I chose Molivera after reading the reviews &amp; i&#x27;m not dissapointed. My skin feels so soft! I really didn&#x27;t think there was going to b a difference between products but there absolutely is! I am an older woman &amp; i hate the way my skin is changing! I have moisturized my whole life but age is age. The Molivera shea butter has done wonders to soften the fine wrinkles on my face and arms! I am amazed &amp; recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that works for my skin. It moisturizes better than all the other lotions I ever brought. After using my skins stays soft for the whole day. I would buy this again and again. The best part is it lasts a long time. I still have mine and all my sisters use it and its been six months.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing. I bought it to try on my 9 year olds exzema and after the first use I noticed a difference. It made his skin so moist and best of all he was itch free.</li>
            <li> I plan on using this to make my own deodorant but haven&#x27;t done it yet. But this product seems to be a great quality &amp; value!</li>
            <li> I have added this to my own recipe for natural hair products as well as skin care. This isn&#x27;t that fake yellow stuff you find in the stores that makes you itch.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Maybe its benefits are great, but the smell is not good.</li>
            <li> I love how it stays moist on your face the entire day. Also its great for hair. I put it on the ends of my hair, makes it real thick.</li>
            <li> Glad I found this product. Ive used it in body butters, lip balms and lotion. I love it &amp; my skin has never been better. This shea butter smells fresh and seems authentic.</li>
            <li> Use this on my feet.  Amazing,</li>
            <li> Nice product and easy to use right out of the jar. I use it on my face and my skin seems to love it :)</li>
            <li> My introduction to shea butter came a few years ago when my daughter was ill.  She had to have radiation treatment and a friend gave me a tin of L&#x27;Occitane shea butter to rub on her skin after each round of radiation.  It was sublimely wonderful.  Not only did it seem to help keep her skin supple and free of radiation burns, but at the conclusion of her three week daily radiation regimen my hands felt like silk.  When it ran out I wanted to buy more, but was hit with sticker shock.  I couldn&#x27;t justify spending forty dollars on five ounces of product.  So, I just kind of let it go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I&#x27;ve done some reading about shea butter.  Seems that some people look down their nose at &amp;#34;L&#x27;O&amp;#34;  because it&#x27;s too white and doesn&#x27;t stink.  So obviously it&#x27;s filtered or heated or something else unspeakable has been done to it.  I decided to give this ivory shea butter a shot.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t live up to my experience with L&#x27;O.  First off there is the smell.  It&#x27;s not a rancid smell (it even has a bit of a chocolate aroma to it), and I think this is the way it&#x27;s supposed to smell, but it&#x27;s strong and I just don&#x27;t care for it.  And the smell DOES NOT dissipate.  It&#x27;s there all day long.  This shea butter does not melt in my palm as easily as the L&#x27;O did and the texture is grainier.  The greasiness level is about the same initially, but the L&#x27;O absorbed into my skin and my daughter&#x27;s skin much quicker.  This shea butter stays tacky to the touch for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed up an ounce of this butter with a little almond oil from the same company (seems to be wonderful stuff) and I will try using it on my hands and feet periodically to see if the scent grows on me.  I may also try using it for other things. There is nothing wrong with it if it&#x27;s your cup of tea.  In fact, it&#x27;s probably great stuff, but I confess to being spoiled by a first world &amp;#34;corruption&amp;#34; of shea butter which nonetheless worked better than anything I have ever tried onmy hands.  And useability is important.  I will get much more out of a product that I will use regularly, even though it might not meet a purist&#x27;s standards, than I will out of a product that I will likely avoid because of its scent.  I guess it&#x27;s time to open my wallet...</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  I will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> Excellent!! We love this product and use it every day!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Shea Butter and I love it. This is what I have been looking for to nourish my skin during the winter and more. I do not like the smell but I only use it at night so far.</li>
            <li> Great for diy projects</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t seem to absorb the sweet almond oil as I would have wished and I was going to give the oil to my massage therapist. However, I received an e-mail from you with a suggestion to mix it with the Raw Shea Butter-Molivera Organics. When I mixed the two products it was quite a mess as both products are very emollient, but just one application of this mixture to my body relieved the dryness I had been feeling with all other products. So I changed my mind about the little bit of greasiness I felt when it is first applied to wanting to use it again!  Thank you for all the e-mail information and tips in regard to the products.  I really appreciate them!</li>
            <li> I have had eczema all my life and most creams and lotions would make my skin more irritated. This Shea butter came highly recommended to me and it has been life changing! I have tried other Shea butters which were good, but this brand has soothed my super sensitive skin like nothing I have tried before (I have tried a plethora of products).</li>
            <li> I have order maybe about 4-5 jars of this stuff already and it has totally transformed my skin. For the past ten years I have had health problems due to unknown food allergies and hormone imbalances. My skin was just awful, acne scars , rough scaly skin, and stretch marks everywhere (the white ones). Within 3 months there has been such noticeable difference in my skin, the complements have been coming left and right. I finally feel like a twenty something year-old person and now I look like a twenty something year-old person. TEN years of looking like complete scrap and within just 3 months a very noticeable change. Molivera promise me you won&#x27;t change a thing about this product. I have tried many expensive creams, ointments, and other sheas, but yours is the only one that has actually worked. THANK-YOU</li>
            <li> It works great. Thank u for all the tips on how to use it!</li>
            <li> i am pregnant and use this stuff to combat hormonal acne and stretch marks. i usually mix it with honey and scented essential oils to make it more appealing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything special about this product yet especially for my sun spots or damage etc ..... which was main reason th@ I purchased it besides it being Organic .....  :(</li>
            <li> I have used many different moisturizers in the past, but is definitely a keeper.  I have very dry skin but when I use this shea butter my skin stay moisturized all day long.  The smell is not bad like other shea butters and a little goes a long way.  The shipping on this was very fast.  I am very pleased with the product and will by again.</li>
            <li> First of all, I enjoyed how the company emailed me as soon as I ordered the product with tips about using natural raw shea butter. I have just started using it, but I am pleased so far. Several people have complained about an occasional graininess of the shea butter, and yes it does have some of that- but it is a natural raw product. It&#x27;s not going to be perfect. I find it best to warm some of the product between my palms as others have suggested, and then apply. I am just thrilled to have an alternative to chemical - laden lotions. Plus it&#x27;s a very good price as well.</li>
            <li> For some reason the last one I bought was grainy and rough to apply on my sensitive skin. But I will buy one more time because I don&#x27;t know if I had a bad jar.</li>
            <li> Very good product and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If you have a little kid with eczema, this is the BEST. I&#x27;ve tried every remedy possible for my 18 month old and nothing was working. I found this on Amazon and decided to try it. It took about a week to start see the positive effects.  I am on my second tub now and will be a lifelong fan of this shea butter!  Many months later,  I have to say this is a gift that keeps on giving. I took my son for his 2 year doc appointment yesterday and she was amazed by his skin. She is now going to be recommending this to other parents.</li>
            <li> an excellent help for eczema and the dark pigmentation that can come with it. I am a physician and it works well for me as well as my patients.  Even better is that it&#x27;s all natural and free from chemicals</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and is definitely a superior product. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I made some cypress/citrus skin balm using this Shea Butter. I have loved it! It was easy to use in the recipe I had and has been fantastic. I still have some left for me to make another batch of something new. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is good quality, starts to melt in your hand but solid at room temperature.  Works great at moisturizing toddler skin that seems not to do well with other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Love this product! A little pricey but it is a wonderful light color and am confident using it for the lotions I make.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality shea butter.  It doesn&#x27;t smell good on it&#x27;s own but I made body butter using this as an ingredient and it&#x27;s luscious!</li>
            <li> Great for hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it&lt;br /&gt;It feels like a new skin&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Feels good, just opened it</li>
            <li> Great this is what we use instead of lotion. Need to reorder for the winter</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is just wow. Just received my order and this is by far the most best Shea butter I hve ever order on Amazon. This is definitely the new brand I will be buying. It soften the skin and smell great. I will definitely recommend it. Compare to other Shea butter , this is the best. Thank you i am very pleased even with the delay</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in my homemade deodorant and am pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer had stated that it was gritty and they didn&#x27;t like the consistency, but I found it to work well for my purposes. Even though I used it in a double boiler, I found that it &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; in your hand fairly well, too, so using it on your skin and hair isn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;This shea butter also has a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> To start things off, no it does not smell good - but the smell does not linger on you.  So far it is keeping my baby&#x27;s legs, face and arms much softer than lotions that I did not want to put on her, but felt compelled to - ones that had had all sorts of toxic, cancer causing ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it, I wish I had gotten 32 oz vs 16 oz since I will probably be done with this jar in a month or 2.</li>
            <li> I have tried different brands of Shea Butter and this is my favorite.  It goes on pretty smoothly and melts easier than other brands.  Its a great every day lotion to use on my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> Great product that does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> This shea butter  is about the best I have ever used. I love the natural smell and feel of this product.  It has become my favourite &amp;#34; all-purpose butter &amp;#34; for my hair and skin.  It keeps my skin soft and my hair manageable.  I even use it as a lip balm too.  A great product!</li>
            <li> It is gritty and leaves white specs on my skin and hair.  I researched this and found it has something to do with the heating process.  In any case I don&#x27;t like it.  The other shea butter I used does not do this.</li>
            <li> A little grainy, but I like it.</li>
            <li> This is the REAL Deal, it is pure and unrefined, therefore it contains all of the &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; healing properties of Shea!  I use it on my hair and my incredible, beautiful partner/lover/friend/wife uses it on her skin.  We love it and will be buying more regularly.  If you are looking for the benefits of Shea, this is the brand to buy!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the day :)</li>
            <li> Love Molivera Raw Shea Butter!  I use it on my hair for twists.  The twists come out nice and shiny and most of all when you run your hand through the twists it&#x27;s not greasy.  No grease running down on my forehead breaking me out either.  Smells good.  I even use it on my skin, nice and smooth.  Great for hair and body!</li>
            <li> This is really nice Shea Butter! It is pure &amp; has a great color &amp; texture. I have tried others previously, but this had been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> I love Shea butter for all sorts of home remedies and this one is excellent thanks, in large part, to the superb customer service.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Just as described.  Loved it.  Great service, as usual!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that works for my extremely dry hands. I use it on my face as well.&lt;br /&gt;My son has eczema and I apply the raw Shea butter all over his body. It helps a lot!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the mild smell. I rather smell pure natural Shea butter than lotion full of synthetic fragrance! Thank you Mother Nature!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product that I used in combination with beeswax and other raw butters to make hard lotion bars. Company also follows up nicely, I am sure if things weren&#x27;t just as they should be they would go above and beyond to fix things.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I have ever used on my skin, and I will purchase more.  I used it over the last couple weeks for keeping a small spot psoriasis moisturized for long periods of time, but it didn&#x27;t heal it up any more than usual.  This is the only thing that I have found that leaves my skin still feeling moisturized after 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Bought this for some rashes I had on my hand. Nothing seems to work, not even prescription creams. I bought this product and black soap after a friend recomemded it. Am happy I did. The rashes are completely gone. And I have never seen my skin this smooth before.</li>
            <li> It was everything it says it is.  Love the texture and it absorbs on my skin quickly. I also appreciated that the seller contacted me prior to let me know it was on its way.</li>
            <li> I bought this after comparing prices of other shea butter offerings on amazon.  This was great!  Beautiful, ivory raw shea butter.  I used this to make a shea butter cream (shea butter, aloe vera gel, black jamaican castor oil, vitamin e oil, and coconut oil).  This was perfect.  I&#x27;ve tried making shea butter cream before with the gold/yellow shea butter from your run of the mill beauty supply store--it was a no go.  This shea butter whipped up so nicely (without softening with heat).  I&#x27;d buy it again and again--especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Good quality shea butter, and the seller is very pleasant to buy from</li>
            <li> My order was received in a timely manner, I have only been using the product for a couple of days, but so for, I really like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s winter and so dry my skin craved for something natural and hydrating.. This product was perfect! I&#x27;ve had this product for a few weeks and my skin feels softer than ever and it smells great as well. Also I&#x27;ve gotten compliments that my skin is &#x27;glowing&#x27; :)</li>
            <li> Well packaged, fine product. I use it blended with coconut and argan oil and Aloe gel to make a more viscous salve.</li>
            <li> This is great quality shea butter--and such a great price. I made a couple amazing batches of body butter with this. Recommend!</li>
            <li> Use on eczema.  Think putting on but massage into skin and works well after 1 week.</li>
            <li> Oh, Oh I think I am in love. This product is beautifully packaged, with great attention to detail. I enjoy the communication with the seller. Good job! And the shea butter is top quality. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, seems very fresh. This is helping with my sons eczema tremendously. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of lotions and this seems to really help maintain a healthy balance of moisture. I use as a daily moisturizer as well after dry brushing and my skin feels the softest it ever has!</li>
            <li> This is a top quality shea butter!! I&#x27;m super impressed! It smells slightly nutty like it should and the color is a creamy yellowish white like it should be. I love using this in balms and also by itself. Shea butter is an amazing product in that it can heal a multitude of skin issues. It&#x27;s also great to use on your hair!</li>
            <li> Everyone should try this product.  Very moisturizing and literally melts in your hands when you put it on your body! I&#x27;m so purchasing this again when I run out of it. Definitely worth your money:)</li>
            <li> Leaves a greasy feel. Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea Butter! I have tried other brands in the past but this one beats them hands down. It is so rich yet absorbs quickly. Great for use in my homemade lotions.</li>
            <li> This is beautiful Shea butter!!  Does not have an overpowering unpleasant smell. Will order again!</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and the Shea butter is excellent. It is a great natural conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter! Used it as an ingredient in my homemade lip balm and it turned out wonderfully!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I have tried several different brands. This is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter. I used it to make a homemade sunscreen (I got the recipe from Dr. Axe&#x27;s website.) I also made a bug repellent salve (from the Body Unburdened website). I use it plain or mixed with fractionated coconut oil for my skin and hair and also on my poodle&#x27;s delicate skin and hair. (I also Iike to use a little raw aloe vera with a couple drops of vegetable glycerine for her - I wish I had not spayed her, maybe that&#x27;s why her skin is so easily irritated, poor girl! But these kinds of things are helpful.)  For my hair, I rub a little in my hands and warm it first, then I just rub it on the fluffiest parts of my hair first, and then work to the ends and then the scalp.</li>
            <li> use it for homemade lip balm.  Good quality and texture.&lt;br /&gt;will buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> I got this product in two days ago.  Since then I&#x27;ve used it to help various people find relief from hives, acne, and sunburn.  My dog with skin allergies also seems to enjoy its soothing properties.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this...my boyfriend loves it</li>
            <li> Love this product, incredible and would def buy again</li>
            <li> Best shea butter ever! Container should last a very long time, consistency is smooth and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product SUCKS, I was so excited because I read extensively . It has great reviews on how is great for the skin and wrinkles . As soon as I got it I took a shower and use it all over my body and face , I put it every \5 days straight......My skin became DRY !!!!!! ....IT LOST MOISTER but you apply this cream and is &amp;#34;Oily&amp;#34; !!!!!!!!...MY SKIN DOES NOT LIKE THIS PRODUCT......I prefer to put olive oil on my legs, it leaves my skin soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face as moisturizer.  Seems to work quite well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5 months pregnant and I&#x27;ve been using Molivera Shea Butter daily for a few weeks. Very satisfied with the product. Really nice quality. I use the Shea butter in the morning and before I go to bed. No stretch marks so far! I will definitely continue to use it throughout my pregnancy and post-baby.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it looks like -- it is pure raw shea butter. I use it as a lotion for my skin everyday and it is very soothing and smells wonderfully! Also great when mixed with other natural ingredients to make lotions and such. If you&#x27;re looking for good raw shea butter, you will be pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I suffer from hand and foot syndrome, so my feet and hands are very dry, this works like a charm. I am so glad that someone recommended this to me. It goes on very easily and a little bit goes a long way. I have also used it for my arms and legs wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, arrives exactly as described.  And, it is very obvious that Molivera Organics values their customers and views customer satisfaction as a top priority.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, works really well on skin , hair , just about everything</li>
            <li> Love this Shea Butter, creamy and excellent quality.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It melts easy and it leaves my skin very hydrated .I also use it with my face wash  after rinsing My face I don&#x27;t use moisturizer it leaves my face smooth and hydrated. My husband is not a moisturizer kinda guy he actually uses this and loves it.His skin is so much softer. This is a must buy for the family! !!</li>
            <li> Not really satisfied with this product. It&#x27;s hard as a rock, I try to get a little out with a spoon and warm it between my hands and it barely softens up so I can&#x27;t really use it. I think I got a defective batch or something. I want a refund. I will be throwing this in the trash and looking for another treatment for my dry skin patches. Oh and it has no smell, I was hoping for something pleasent to use as a natural moisturizer. This isn&#x27;t like butter at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about a week now and I like it so far. It leaves my skin feeling very soft!</li>
            <li> This product really works! I would recommend it to anyone who has skin problems or sensitive skin. I use it with my scented creams and it goes on smooth and keeps my skin soft and supple. I will definitely purchase this product in the near future (or sooner as everyone in my family of 6 has gotten in on the action)</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  The texture is so nice and smooth (unlike some other organic raw shea butter brands I&#x27;ve used). I play tennis almost every day and my legs and arms get a lot of sun.  Shea butter is the only thing that keeps moisturizing, so I don&#x27;t have to reapply the next day.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of pure shea butter.  This particular brand (Molivera) was lovely.  Very good size for the cost and the company was good to deal with.</li>
            <li> I made body butter using this as an ingredient. It worked well. No issues at all!</li>
            <li> Great value. I purchased for my husband, but I like to use it for myself as well as on my toddler&#x27;s dry winter skin. I will buy again when we need more - it will be a while because this goes such a long way!</li>
            <li> Love, love it! Great product, excellent service.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Shea butter! I&#x27;ve been using Shea butter for years and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> excelent. i use to smooth psoriais eczemes</li>
            <li> Received my package in a timely manner.  This is the first time that I have tried this product.  Wanted to try it out because of all of the benefits and positive reviews.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes so far.  But have been only using for about a month.  I does smell nutty and is hard to spread, but after about 1 minute is goes on smoothly.  It does feel greasy especially when it comes in contact with my naturally oily skin.  However, I have noticed that my legs and thighs still appear dry after application.  I has used almost half of the jar and will continue using until its empty.  I still have mixed feelings about the effectiveness of the Shea Butter.  Haven&#x27;t seen any old scars disappear yet.  I believe that coconut and olive oil is much easier to apply than the shea butter.  Gave it a 3 stars, because I&#x27;m still not convinced of all its benefits, but have only using it a short while.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is incredible! Being my first time ordering raw Shea butter, I was nervous. But this product has surpassed all of my expectations! I&#x27;ve been using this product in all of my homemade beauty products to add rich, creamy texture. Or I just heat a bit up on the stove and massage it in head to toe. It has wonderful moisturizing and healing properties. I&#x27;m excited to use it as a skin protectant during winter. I will definitely keep shopping with Molivera for quality products!</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, keeps your skin moisturized all day and doesn&#x27;t leave a scent. What more can you ask for!</li>
            <li> Love this Shea Butter. Great texture and smell. Obviously pure unrefined Shea Butter.Been making awesome recipes with the follow up emails. Love this brand.</li>
            <li> This product has the consistency of greasy cookie dough. Once you rub it in it looks like hair grease on your skin. I&#x27;ve read tons of reviews for Shea butter and I heard grainy and hard but never &amp;#34;greasy.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m a guy, so no covering up the grease with makeup. I&#x27;m very disapointed.</li>
            <li> Best best best! I whip it with coconut  oil and it&#x27;s just awesome! With or without it! Very good quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in my family&#x27;s hair (my daughter, son, husband and myself) and it is doing a fantastic job. After about two weeks, I have already noticed significant growth in my daughter&#x27;s hair and my husband even commented on how his hair is no longer spiking up. It&#x27;s not greasy and the scent is barely noticeable. I will definitely be purchasing more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, on my body at night as a moisturizer before bed.  Compared to raw unrefined coconut oil, it feels more &amp;#34;dense&amp;#34; when rubbing it on…it&#x27;s more difficult to spread and rub into the skin...for example, using it as a lubricant for massages (or whatever else) is out of the question.  The next morning, I felt as moisturized as I did with my raw unrefined coconut oil.  But the smell…OMG, the smell is NOT good.  When I use coconut oil, I smell divine, natural, luxurious with a light coconut scent…and my skin is off-the-charts gorgeous with a healthy glow after I apply it…there&#x27;s no glow with this shea butter.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s beneficial to the skin...I&#x27;m just going to have to find some uses for it, i.e., mix it with other oils to mask that awful smell.</li>
            <li> My shea butter had slight discoloration on the top in the middle, but I&#x27;m using it anyway. It does have good color, smell, and texture. Ever so slightly gritty like other reviewers say, but it blends in and is no problem as soon as you rub it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used raw organic Shea butter before from other companies. I purchased this because the price was right and it was organic. I use Shea butter in homemade body butter and lip balm. This does have a smell but all shea butter does. Personally I don&#x27;t care for it but it&#x27;s always mixed with other ingredients and scents in my products so you don&#x27;t smell it nearly as much. Not sure I could use this stuff straight out of the jar with it being so thick and the strong smell. Overall a great product and very fair price. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is not ivory in color but grey and and grainy as well. It does moisturize my skin, but I have to use more of the product than I would normally use other creams because it is quite hard even if I melt it in my hand, still need more product. The scent is not that bad but not that great too, so I bought lavender oil and mix a few drops with some butter I transferred in a smaller cointainer, mixing them well makes the shea butter softer and easier to apply. I would like to try the filtered shea butter after I finish this tub. Overall, for the price, the product is ok.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! My normally dry hands are so well moisturized after using this at night, mixed with sweet almond oil, beeswax, and some essential oils. I haven&#x27;t used shea butter before, but this product seems to be very high quality. It comes nicely packaged, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to use this product and make some homemade vapor rub for the family.  Love this company as their prices are great &amp; they have amazing customer service.</li>
            <li> Great wonderful nature product!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Not much more to say than that.  I make my own lotions, etc. and use it.  Have not had a problem yet.  I even recommended it to a friend and she purchased it.  All is well!</li>
            <li> I used this to make body butter and it came out great.</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff , Amazing is not good enough to describe it&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my skin after I get out from the shower and at night I use it on my heels and wear a socks&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my baby boy ( eczema ) and it works for us&lt;br /&gt;GREAT value&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for this product :)</li>
            <li> Not impressesed this is so hard I can&#x27;t scoop it out of jar and spreading on my  body just hurts. Won&#x27;t purchase again  i threw away my jar very disappointed</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I love how my skin feels and looks after using it. I also use it on my hair combined with coconut oil and the moisture is so great I can go three days after washing my hair before having to moisturize it again. The jar makes it easy to scoop out and is small enough to store with my other hair and body products.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my face to help with dry winter skin and it feels great!</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter.  I use for every thing. My feets  especialy.</li>
            <li> Item arrived fast from seller.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a very good product and the shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> This was not what I expected but like it say PURE RAW. It&#x27;s hard gritty and thick but the warmth of the body while rubbing it in melts it into a nice not too oily shine that I love!! And I can even put it on my face which is usually sensitive to everything!! I use it from head to toe literally!! There&#x27;s no perfumes in it No smell Or odor. And leaves me feeling so soft. Great buy!!</li>
            <li> Have been using for a week and love it!  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> MOST AMAZING CREAM EVER! My husband &amp; I both use for different reason and I haven&#x27;t been happier with any other cream ! I have very sensitive skin and thanks to this product it&#x27;s improved 100% !</li>
            <li> I use it on my face as and it doesn&#x27;t break me out. Enough said.</li>
            <li> Using this product for my son&#x27;s eczema. It&#x27;s thick and moisturizing to saturate his skin and makes it soft and smooth. I put it on his skin at bedtime to soak in. Also good as a scalp moisturizer and hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this product it was creamy, and a lot softer than some of the other shea butter&#x27;s I&#x27;ve purchased( from other merchants) As soon as I opened up the jar, I noticed the texture looked different than the ones I bought  from other merchants. I applied it to my skin, and because it was so much softer I didn&#x27;t need to wait for the product to melt.  This one I can use exclusively on my face, and will finish up the other jar on my elbows, knees, etc. What a great product!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize what raw unrefined shea butter was. Raw unrefined shea butter is very dense and difficult to use. I have to rub an amount vigorously between my hands before I can spread it on my skin. The smell isn&#x27;t pleasant but seems to fade pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> This product was gritty and had a very hard consistency.  It required a knife to remove from the jar.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have made body butter, lip balm, and lipstick, using the Shea butter. Love my new products, and I will order again.</li>
            <li> This came so quick!  From the time I ordered to the time I got it was like the blink of an eye.  I recently had carpal tunnel surgery and my dr&#x27;s office recommended using a shea or cocoa butter on the scar, starting about a week after my stitches came out.  I have been using, and this product has really been helping.  It is a bit grainy, so I just warm it up a bit on the rest of my hand before I  put it on the incision site.  The benefit is the rest of my skin is benefiting as well, rough elbows and calloused feet are disappearing.  At first I didn&#x27;t care for the smell, but I wanted something without added scent and I have gotten used to it.  This really helps keep the incision site flexible and I very much appreciate that!</li>
            <li> I recently just received this and the Sweet Almond oil; I have used the Ivory Shea Butter a few times since I have received it. So far so good. If you rub between hands it liquifys and goes on smooth. I am looking forward to using this on my hair; I have used it as makeup remover and moisturizer and my face have not even broken out! The smell is not perfumey nor strong; very pleasant.</li>
            <li> purchased it based on reviews ,, but it produced such a bad results,, buyers be aware.. it created white patches on skin and made it very dry..I will never use it or buy it again.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast I just got this amazing real deal shea butter ..I love the feel of it  and smell !!.. it is awesome on my hair no clumps melts in your hand.:) great on my skin nice..:(0)</li>
            <li> I received it in a bubble mailer so naturally the lid was broken and when the shea butter melted from being stuffed into my mailbox all day, it leaked out a little. The worst part was when I took the rest of the lid off to smell it...whew! It smelled like old petroleum oil mixed with stink root. The sad part about it was that when I dug underneath the grainy top surface, (because it melted in the mailer), the rest of it was soft, clean, and smooth. Seller, get a new package for delivery.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a moisturizer and discovered how well it does as a hair conditioner.  I have coarse frizz prone hair.  Used this twice in one week and the results .... awesome!  I canceled an order for a very expensive brand of hair conditioner.  Don&#x27;t need it!</li>
            <li> Great quality.  Great gift.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. It&#x27;s best when liquefied or in a melted state, but it&#x27;s great for &amp;#34;thirsty skin.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Nice! I will buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this company and this product. It is the only moisturizer I use, no more fancy creams and misleading products. Besides soothing dry lips, dry skin, feet, hands, softening hair, it also protects leather, you can even cook with it.&lt;br /&gt;I know that there are probably many more uses for this miracle butter and I am very excited to discover them.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing raw shea butter. I blended mine with coconut oil and lavender essential oil in my food processor and it made an amazing body butter. My skin is the softest it has been in a long time. I use the shea butter on it&#x27;s own on my hands and it really helps my dry, chapped skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product so much! Use it daily from my feet to my neck to seal in the coconut oil I use to moisturize my skin. It lasts a long time, too!</li>
            <li> I prefer unscented pure shea butter, and this spreads easily at room temperature. Many shea butters have added oils or water to make them more spreadable and cheaper to produce. I use shea to retain body oils and moisture, and water-based products have a counterproductive effect on my skin. This product is perfect for my needs as-is. If I choose to add, say, cocoa butter, I can do that in a separate container in the microwave or in the sun and then blending the heated product..</li>
            <li> Texture is a bit \\&quot;crumbly\\&quot; and dry and the smell is unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind the texture and smell, go for it!&lt;br /&gt;  it HAS improved my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Okay, I love this product. It absorbs quickly into my skin and hair and leaves it moisturized for days. My only negative is that it&#x27;s a bit gritty. I made a whipped shea butter recipe with some other natural oils and it has little bits in it. I am not sure if this is how shea butter always is since this is my first time buying it. But for that reason I gave it 4 stars. The gritty parts of it also absorb so I don&#x27;t have white little specks in my hair and on my skin. So I suppose that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing, I have been using it for less than a week and I already start to notice the difference.  my skin start to look smoother and brighter. excellent product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year.  While it doesn&#x27;t get rid of my eczema completely, it does make it less itchy and dry.&lt;br /&gt;I really found this to be great after a day in the sun.  I spent 10 days in Jamaica and had a slight sunburn after the first day; I used it that night and it was gone completely.  It would have sucked to live with a sunburn for that long while I was there.  Thank goodness I brought this with me.</li>
            <li> So far, I am super pleased with this shea butter. Its smooth, I like the convenience of the jar it comes in, and its worked great in the different formulations I have used it for.&lt;br /&gt;Apart from that, the costumer service is awesome. I had a delivery issue, and they took care of it really fast and courteously.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> Great authentic product, and the container is so pretty! I don&#x27;t feel like I have to hide it under my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Lovely packaging. Picture does not do justice to the size.  The product itself is great.  It takes a tiny bit of effort to create a smooth &#x27;paste&#x27; for lathering but its worth it.

            <li> This is a very high quality shea butter with a pleasant nutty aroma that I will buy again and again. The packaging is attractive enough to leave out for easy access and I&#x27;ve found myself using it several times a day - for hands, body, feet, face and hair. It warms quickly in my hands and dissolves into a salve-like cream that absorbs quickly. The price is competitive, and the quality exceptional.</li>
            <li> Great product! Just want I expected! Great service too!</li>
            <li> While I had used many other products that contained shea butter (refined) and knew that I liked it in general, I was looking for something that was all natural.  I love this product because it can replace so many products and be used for so many things.  I use this on my FACE as a moisturizer and as a result my face has virtually no breakouts, decreased dark circles, and more even tones.  I use it all over my BODY after showering and it feels great.  I put this on my CHEST AND BACK, two areas I&#x27;ve suffered with breakouts during my teens and as an adult and it has greatly improved my skin to the point I rarely ever have one breakout ANYWHERE on my body.  I use this on my LIPS in place of chap stick and they are so soft!  I rub this on my finger NAILS and toe nails and now have stronger nails as well as smoother skin around the nail bed and softer cuticles.  I keep a small tin in my purse to use in place of HAND LOTION and chap stick.  And I use a very small amount on my hands and rub it through my HAIR to help style, tame, and moisturize my hair after I dry it.  And of course, this is the first thing I go to for minor burns, bruises, rashes, and closed healing scratches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use a knife to scrape it out of the jar and put it another container.  This ensures that I don&#x27;t contaminate the jar as the instructions mentioned that moisture (from hands, showering, etc.) can make the fats in the oil go rancid.  It also allows me to mix the butter with essential oils to add scent as I wish.  And I make sure to store it somewhere cool so it will not hit the 70 something melting point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: There was one unexpected issue when I got the shea butter.  Raw shea butter has what I would term as a mild to medium earthy smell that I wasn&#x27;t expecting.  When I got it and immediately opened it to smell and feel, I was a little put off.  I bought some all natural essential oils (tea tree, lavender, rosemary, mint, rose, eucalyptus) to mix in as I feel every morning after I shower and these work really well. Adding the oils also has the added benefit of aromatherapy and allowing me to play with scents.  I choose to use the unscented shea butter for my face and lips though and have gotten used to the scent.  Its something that may not affect others as strongly as it did me, but it took me some getting used to on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I truly love this product and foresee using it perpetually.</li>
            <li> Great texture - I usually need to mix shea butter with oil to reach a texture that I can rub into my skin.  Don&#x27;t need to with this product.  I definitely recommend it, right out of the jar.  I like the company, too - they emailed to make sure I was happy with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a week now and love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I am using this as a remedy for eczema.  It makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> I mix this shea butter with oils and use it as a moisturizer on my natural hair. It leaves my hair feeling soft for days. I also use it on my skin before going to bed. I plan to order more soon</li>
            <li> This product actually helped clear up my skin and has kept it looking dewy and smooth.  It&#x27;s a little oily feeling at first, but once it absorbs into your skin, it really feels amazing!</li>
            <li> Excellent service, quality, price.  It was shipped expediently and was everything it was advertised to be.  We used it in homemade skin care products and lip balm.  Excellent results.</li>
            <li> Works great as an essential all natural ingredient for making my homemade deodorant which I found on Dr. Josh Axe&#x27;s webpage.  My son uses it sparingly on problem skin areas.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is wonderful.  It melts well in bain marie when mixed with other ingredients and helps heal the skin.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great on burns, kid scars,</li>
            <li> Sooooo good for moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, helps heal skin and gets rid of dark spots.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and great customer follow up with suggestions for use.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 5 because this company knows how to keep customers satisfied. Once I placed the order I heard from the company. The product arrived well packaged. The seal was broken which I think is due to the heat. The butter was perfect and clean and just wonderful. I would absolutely recommend buying from this company. After my shower tonight I baby my skin with this Raw Organic Shea Butter from Molivera Organics.</li>
            <li> I received the product promptly and it was well-packaged.  The sender also provided information on this product via e-mail, which is much appreciated.  I am currently using it to make whipped body butter and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews are correct, this product is great! 100% natural so it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin. It&#x27;s very moisturizes my skin really well, and since I have eczema, I&#x27;m sensitive to many products. This shea butter helps a lot. It doesn&#x27;t sooth the itching, but it helps make the skin less dry. Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to lather it all over the body because it&#x27;s a cream a not a lotion (but then again lotion is mostly water anyway) so just take your time when applying it. It does leave a light scent, but nothing too overbearing.  I&#x27;ve used one jar last month, and working on my second one.</li>
            <li> I love body butter with shea butter in it, so I thought why not use the natural Shea butter instead of the added extras in the body butter. But it turns out it is very hard to get out of the container, when you do rub it on, it is chunky and gritty and oily all at the same time and the oil doesn&#x27;t disipate. It does however make my skin soft so I figured out a plan to rub it all over my body and then shower the residue off. Not too bad I guess.</li>
            <li> Product is very beneficial and I love the fact it is raw! Seller was exemplary and shipping was prompt, thanks!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a shea butter that is easy to apply. The texture allows you to scrape off the top, getting what you need and working it through your skin. It does however leave little chunks if you don&#x27;t rub it into your skin well enough. It keeps my hands from cracking during this winter season. I also use it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy. The scent is very nice. This is a pretty good size jar. Realistically speaking will last probably 4 months if I used it everyday.</li>
            <li> Love love love it... I live in a dry desert area and this helps keep my skin moisturized. My stretch marks are disappearing + my skin feels so smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;The company sends me tips on how best i could use the product and The tips are useful. I plan on using on my hair. For sure I would recommend this product because I am sure lay buying it again</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of this brand of Shea Butter from this vendor.  My initial reaction is that it is a wonderful product.  It is very moisturizing, but not overly greasy.  I could actually tell a difference from one overnight use.  The dry winter has really worked my hands and feet over, but I think this product will help ease me in to summer quite nicely.  I also was impressed by how large the jar was (16 oz.)!  You do not have to use a lot; a little goes a long way.  I do plan to reorder, but it will probably be a while since I got two jars on the first order.  So far, this is better than any Shea I have used,  If you like the really raw formulation, you should try this one.  By the way, I was not afraid to put it on as a nighttime face treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grand-daughter who has very dry skin on her arms and legs and her scalp--she loves it as she is also a child of 2 ethnic backgrounds.</li>
            <li> I love it, I use this in my hair (4b-4c texture). The product is extremely smooth it is like butter in you hands. It smells great, its extremely difficult to apply so use a plastic butter knife or something. I have been using it for a day now. It keeps my hair moist, but it does not relieve the dryness. I use this Shea butter, with castor oil and water and boy is my hair moist and!! Its hard to keep from putting my hands in my hair constantly.</li>
            <li> Lovely service, lovely product. It really is the smoothest, creamiest shea butter I&#x27;ve found. I have Rosacea and depend on good products to keep me off antibiotics. This was an exciting find for me and has proven true to its word. Did I mention lovely?</li>
            <li> I love shea butter.  This is organic with very little odor and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I have tried few different (Shea Butter Ivory and yellow) less expensive brands than the Molivera organics. Unrefined organic and natural unrefined Shea Butter, and I am giving this one 5 stars because of the quality. It melts so easily on my hands and so smooth on my skin. No grainy at all (comparing it to another Ivory Shea Butter). Its like cream its like BUTTER actually I can say. It smells like Shea Butter again comparing it to the other ones I have tried but this one its much softer and pleasant. (I like the smell actually because I was skeptical reading some other reviews before I was introduce to this product. It has no impurities and the color its Ivory.. The container also makes the product scream quality. If this is what supposed organic unrefined Ivory Shea Butter to be, look, and feel then this company probably sells one of the best. I am trying to give a minimum detailed feedback because I dislike the ones when the post one it goes like this - very good service nice product I will buy again lol.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway this is only for the ones that like to read and don&#x27;t feel like someone is wasting their time. I hope it helps!!!</li>
            <li> I used this Shea Butter to make my homemade whipped shea butter cream.  I use this cream for my hair and body. The Shea Butter is great quality and whips up great. I didn&#x27;t  have to heat it like some other Shea butters. And there isn&#x27;t a really loud smell like some others carry. My hair and skin feel awesome this will definitely be my go to brand.</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive skin and eczema, and this raw shea butter seems to be good for my skin. Thank you</li>
            <li> Great product - truly pure and organic. This is the best quality shea butter I&#x27;ve ever gotten - great stuff.</li>
            <li> We are using this for my 11 month old dry and eczema skin. I like the thick layer of moisture it puts on. It is pretty hard but I don&#x27;t mind. I&#x27;ve been happy with it although it hasn&#x27;t taken away her issues it is helping. I will plan on using this is lip balms I plan to make and other products when I get around to it. My husband doesn&#x27;t like the smell to it I don&#x27;t mind it at all.</li>
            <li> I use this as a nighttime moisturizer and it makes my skin very soft, and it doesn&#x27;t make me breakout, as 95% of creams do. It actually reduces some of the acne I do have, which is a great plus. I do not, however, recommend wearing this in the day. It&#x27;s very heavy and makes skin look shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few reviewers who mention that it has a grainy feeling. I experienced this as well when I first received it. I believe the reason to be the temperature. It was colder weather when I received it, and it had a grainy feeling, much to my disappointment. Now that it is warmer now, there is no graininess. That&#x27;s my theory anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a great product, and I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had some issues with my order at the beginning.  First, I received a product that appeared used.  The inner seal was not intact, and a bit of the contents looked as if it had been scooped out.  Then my replacement order was never delivered.  This was not Molivera&#x27;s fault, but the shipping carrier&#x27;s. Let me say Molivera and Amazon were fantastic about resolving the problem and following up with communication, and by the third time, I received my shea butter in good condition.  For those of you who might wonder, the product arrives with the inner seal NOT attached to the jar&#x27;s rim, unlike the picture.  The company and some customers state that you can hear the seal come off when you open the lid, however you can hear that every time you open it.  I think the company should make sure that the seal is firmly attached so that the customer has to peel it off before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shea butter noticeably softens the skin.  I&#x27;ve tried it on my face, body, and feet; and it definitely helped my seriously cracked heels within days like nothing else I&#x27;ve used before.  I&#x27;m one of the few people who like putting oils on my skin.  Shea butter does not liquefy as easily as coconut oil, so it doesn&#x27;t exactly glide onto the skin.  It leaves a sort of waxy barrier.  Not sure if that&#x27;s a good or bad thing.  I searched the internet to find out if shea butter clogs pores, and the answers are varied.  But all I know is if it makes the skin soft, it must be nourishing it with natural goodness.  I&#x27;ve also tried mixing it with some olive and coconut oil to give it a smoother texture.  The smell is neither pleasant nor unpleasant.  Some people who are used to perfumed products or completely unscented ones might take a little while getting used to it. I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase would buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> This is real shea butter. It melts in your hand and the packaging is great.</li>
            <li> I have used shea butter before, so this is not a new product for me, but I forgot how wonderful it makes my skin feel.  The moisture lasts, leaving my face and hands feeling soft all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging for this particular product is excellent, also</li>
            <li> After trying this a few times, it has become a holy grail product for me.  I slather this all over my body at night (such that it is very greasy and goopy) and when i wake up in the morning, it has totally sunk in and I&#x27;m left with the softest, smoothest, most glorious skin ever.  I LOVE it!  I also love the smell of it, which is nutty and reminds me of cocoa butter.  I really like that the seller sent me some tips on using it too.  I will DEFINITELY buy again!  (I would not, however, recommend using it on your face.  it is just a theory, but it is so thick that I can only imagine it would clog the pores).</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is excellent quality. The company really put a lot of thought into providing the best product possible. I use it for just about everything!</li>
            <li> I have had this jar for approximately 2 months, and it looks like I barely scraped the top. I haven&#x27;t noticed any drastic results, however my skin is overall smoother and the other day I just started to notice the fading of stretchmarks. I think this is an amazing product based on touch, smell, moisturizing and even the slow healing properties. I would recommend this, and even though this jar will last me several more months I am purchasing another for when/if I run out</li>
            <li> I have gotten so much use out of this product it blows my mind. I&#x27;ve used it as a moisturizer, hair conditioner, and lip balm. I will defiantly buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as an ingredient when making solid lotion, lip balms and other spa DIY items. I have already used most of the container, I&#x27;ll definitely be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> I have been very impressed!  the texture is wonderful and smell is mild and nutty.  I am pregnant in the winter (who ever said that was better than summer was crazy) my skin felt like it was raw all over.  And i felt like I was going to get stretch marks even though I did not get any with my first child (born in september).  My skin looks and feels great now.  I use this product head to toe twice a day.  It&#x27;s a little greasy for a few minutes and then my skin sucks it up.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> Easy order, timely delivery, product was as advertised and in good condition.  I am loving how my face, lips, cuticles, (and wherever else I decide to put it) feel!  It&#x27;s not like lotion where it comes out really easily, but it&#x27;s soft enough that if you rub your fingers in it to warm it up you&#x27;ll get what you need.  It&#x27;s so versatile and so safe.  Thanks Molivera!</li>
            <li> MUCH cheaper than other brands while retaining the same quality and effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this for hair and skin daily, will never go back to anything else. $15 for a POUND (16oz) compared to $20+ for 8-10oz in other brands? This is a no-brainer. I&#x27;m a guy, and I probably use less than the average user each day. That being said, I&#x27;ve gone through a pound in roughly 3 months, to provide an idea of the longevity of its usage.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I wish I knew about this product sooner. I bought it on a whim and couldn&#x27;t be happier that I did. It has made my skin incredibly soft and smooth. So far I have used it everywhere from the neck down. I use it on my feet every night and the results are phenomenal! I noticed a difference after the first night!!! I am NOT exaggerating! I live in the Caribbean where it&#x27;s hot ALL the time and I&#x27;m always either in sandals or barefoot. This butter has given me back the feet of my youth! Imagine baby soft, well pedicured, pretty feet every day! This stuff is incredible people. If you need help with dry or rough or tough skin, this will help. I&#x27;m going to try it on my scalp next. It&#x27;s very thick so a little goes a long way but a lot is wonderfully awesome!! :-) Beware though...it can be greasy so wear shoes or you will leave foot prints everywhere!!! *haha* BUY THIS BUTTER! You will not regret it!</li>
            <li> I have eczema and a sensitive skin problem. Even some products specifically for sensitive skins give me a burning and itchy feeling. But this product is really good. It helps me a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it right after the shower when it is warm because the product is not creamy.</li>
            <li> I am very new to this Shea Butter thing..... however this product meet and exceeds my expectations.  I am still learning about all the wonderful things Shea Butter can do for your skin.  As I am getting older I need all the help I can get to keep my skin looking clear and radiant.  I&#x27;ve found a wonderful recipe for making ones own face cream and this is one of the ingredients.  I am very happy I chose this product over the multitue of other shea butters out there.  thank you so much Molivera Organics for a very superior product.</li>
            <li> good value. I make whipped body butter out of it.</li>
            <li> Good quality and malleable. For my peace of mind, I wish it came with a protective seal but looked and smelled fine.</li>
            <li> My skin has been broken out ever since I became pregnant with my 1st child 4 years ago. I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and a half and my skin is much smoother and less red. I&#x27;m already in love with this shea butter and don&#x27;t see myself using anything else as a moisturizer from now on.</li>
            <li> I received my order promptly. The shea butter is of excellent quality and nicely packaged. Other reviews mention an unpleasant gritty quality--I did not experience this at all. Molivera Organics also checked-in with me to see how I was doing with the product, a level of customer care and concern that I appreciated.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I am so happy I found this. I will never use any other moisturizer on my face again!!!! My skins is softer, clearer and looks better than it has in years! I am in love with this Shea butter!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this Shea butter for a little over a week but have noticed it lasts the better part of a day.  I use it on my hands, elbow area and legs which always seem to be the driest during New England winters.  The Shea butter alleviates the itchy feeling I get and smells pleasant to boot.  The jar will definitely last a long time so it&#x27;s good value.  I&#x27;m always looking for natural/organic products and this fits the bill.  The company seems to really stand by their product and has sent me a couple of emails asking if I am satisfied while providing tips for storage. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell. Its really thick kind of hard to get out . I use it on my feet at night.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is nutty-terrific, and you&#x27;re going to want a lot of it.  Love the natural smell and feel.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is great.  Not greasy.  Very hydrating.  wonderful, so fantastic, pure and clean, inexpensive, cost effective, wrinkle reducing, moisturizing butter.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I like the packaging and it makes my sons dry, eczema prone skin much smoother and less itchy. Works nice as a hand cream too.</li>
            <li> I am using this shea butter on my face now that the cold, dry weather is here.  It works great.  I look younger and the skin on my face feels and looks healthier.  I have Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, so I know this is a pure product because I am using it successfully.</li>
            <li> Best raw, unrefined shea butter I&#x27;ve bought yet. The price is great. The smell is very subtle and the texture is perfect. I&#x27;ve bought some shea butters in the past that were grainy and smelled a tad bit strong, but this is amazing! I plan on making my own body butters with it. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and neck since I received it three days ago and I already noticed a difference in my skin. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Def. Grade A IVORY shea butter. It&#x27;s not hard to deal with and it&#x27;s been gradually getting rid of my bite mark scars! Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> I use this at night on my very dry skin.  It is thick so I have to work a bit to absorb on skin.  However, the item works very well for the purpose for which it was purchased.  I will definitely buy this item again.  However, I anticipate that this jar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use this shea butter directly on my skin (I don&#x27;t use it in homemade concoctions). Applying it once after a morning shower keeps me moisturized all day. As mentioned in some other reviews, the texture takes a few tries to get used to. My method involves scraping some butter directly into my palms and rubbing it together (with solid pressure) until is turns into a dense, but liquid-y texture. I use it all over my body this way. I also smooth some over my face. I should note I am 25 and still break out. This product does not remedy the breakouts, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t add to them the way I was afraid it might. Not only is it non-greasy (when added in small layers), it helps significantly with scarring over time. I highly recommend this for any skeptics!</li>
            <li> I love this product! My skin has never been smoother, and it conditions my hair as well, leaving it so soft! I will definitely be making another purchase!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Excellent product. I use this in my home made body butter. It definitely makes a huge difference in it. Great seller.</li>
            <li> I recently started using it and it is very moisturizing. I use it all over and use it on my six year old son because he has very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with my purchase. I think it is a terrific value compared to other similar products. You could turn this jar into 20 different natural beauty items like lip balms, scrubs, creams, etc. Or just warm a small scoop in your hands and slather all over. It starts off dry and warms with your body heat to a creamier consistency. When it dries, it is not greasy or tacky. I&#x27;ve added it to a bath. I&#x27;ve used it texture my hair. I&#x27;ve used it as lip balm. I&#x27;ll probably think of something else to do it with tomorrow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality Shea butter.  Amazing customer service!  They kept me informed of the shipping status and they even sent an informative email telling how to use and care for the butter.  So happy with this purchase.  I will be using them again.&lt;br /&gt;I mixed this with lavender, cedarwood, and rosemary essential oil to treat my daughter&#x27;s eczema.  It works!  It takes a bit longer than prescription creams to work, but with regular use, it keeps the eczema from recurring.  I don&#x27;t like using steroids on her....very happy with this natural solution.</li>
            <li> So far I really like the way this butter feels on my dry skin.  I am not sure about the &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; properties, but it seems to be a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Good product No comments</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a natural moisturizer for my face, but they were all quite expensive and required a lot of research to see if they still contained badies.  I bought this instead.  It works very well, but is greasy so you are not going to be able to slather it on like moisturizer because there is no water to evaporate.  I put a little on a saucer and put it in the toaster oven on 115 to warm while I am getting ready.  Then I rub it on and wipe off the excess with a paper towel.  I am still a little shiny, but I haven&#x27;t discovered a better way to apply.  My skin is very acne-prone and this does not make me break out at all.  If anything, it seems like it heals.  Buy this with confidence, but know that it is going to be greasy when you apply it.</li>
            <li> this product is  very light colored with only a minimal aroma and I like that it comes in a container.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face (mainly at night), lips, body, and hair. I have asian skin that is used to warm, humid, tropical environments, so living in Michigan with the heater constantly on dries the heck out of me. My skin loves this stuff. Helps keep my eczema away too! The smell isn&#x27;t bad either - kind of nutty, not too strong at all.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something natural for my and my daughter&#x27;s skin. We have very sensitive skin and my daughter has some tiny, red bumps on her upper arms that were making her feel self conscious in her sleeveless summer tops. I picked this up on Amazon after reading the reviews. It has a somewhat neutral smell, somewhat nutty smell. Don&#x27;t expect it to smell like coconut like the cheap stuff you get at the supermarket (that stuff is not pure shea butter). You have to take a bit and warm it up in your hands to get it to a spreading consistency, then rub it in where you need it. It is very hydrating and, so far, not irritating and I have not had any break-outs from it. It is a healthy oil and my skin seems to love it. Very good product with a very nice price.</li>
            <li> Using this to treat babies Excema.... Seems good so far...like the texture as it is softer than some other brands.</li>
            <li> This is very pure product, and very comforting for my skin. It has very mild smell that is usually a deal breaker me.</li>
            <li> It is a staple in my health care/ beauty care routine. I use it on my face to combat the drying effects of retin-a for acne and it has helped clear up post acne marks. I use it on dry patches all over my body, dry ends of my hair, my baby&#x27;s delicate skin and has helped with her eczema!! Thank you for such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is the best I have used in my products.  Makes my skin feel so soft. Great product will continue to use.</li>
            <li> excellent product quick delivery thank you</li>
            <li> This shea butter works really well as an aftershave balm. It really calms my skin down and the feeling last throughout the day, its just a little oily after application but it goes away after a while. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this, I stay moisturized for days! My skin really likes it and it is not greasy, and like I mentioned it keeps my skin looking very nice. The smell is not very pleasant, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin, so don&#x27;t worry!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great-- I used it in a recipe for lip balm with my niece and nephew and son, and also for very cracked/chapped feet and hands.  The lip balm was a huge success-- we are all still using it, and the hands and feet are healed.  Very good quality and very useful in a rough winter.  Has a bit of an earthy smell I don&#x27;t mind-- can mix it with other oils to mask that and make it more viscous.  I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> This was a very quick ship and the product arrived in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;This is GREAT shea butter - I have already noticed a difference after only 3 days!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is much softer and smoother!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used raw Shea butter before so my review is not very educated. It&#x27;s so difficult to warm / spread that I haven&#x27;t used it more than a few times. It was purchased for my hair and skin, but it&#x27;s too much of a hassle.  I&#x27;ll try again since I don&#x27;t want to waste it.</li>
            <li> Easy to melt in my hands. It does seem a bit grainy at the beginning, but all of that melts out quickly when I rub it into the palm of my hands. I like mixing this with black castor oil to apply to my nail cuticle, hands and feet and sometimes my skin at night. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I always keep a jar of shea butter around for so many things.  It&#x27;s great for dry hair and scalp and it&#x27;s so soothing for dry skin.  I rub it into my nails to help keep them from being brittle.  It&#x27;s great for dry elbows and makes an awesome hand lotion.</li>
            <li> Skin has dramatically improved. Tenouttaten.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and this is the first product I have used on it that has not made it worse. I can not use anything that has a fragrance, so the this is perfect because it is pure. I chose this brand because it was the cheapest pure shea butter that I could find that was eligible for prime, and I do not regret it. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have very dry combo skin in the winter months and also adult acne which makes for a nightmare of situation when you are trying to pick out a moisturizer that wont break you out.  I cant say you can be in love with a product but this one has really helped my skin look smoother and also my breakouts and scars due to hyper-pigmentation from cystic acne are clearing up.  After I cleanse my face with raw African black soap .  I put a thin layer of Molivera Raw African Ivory Shea butter on my skin.  Not only does it seal in the moisture but it has dried up the pustules of my acne as long as I don&#x27;t pick my skin the place where they cyst was now is getting smoother and clearer.! Thank you folks for finally making a product I have known all my life but thought it was just for pregnant women etc that used it back in Africa.  Well this lady is using it for every crack and crevice within reason and let me tell you my skin is glowing and I get so many compliments like what have you been doing. Of course a sensible diet helps but this will be my Staple for every skin condition.  It even helps with bug bites.!!!</li>
            <li> My order arrived on time and their package was sealed perfectly. I have already tried it and will be using it in my soap making ingredients. I absolutely love this product and will be ordering more. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I am using it now on my body. I use a cosmetic spatula to scoop it so I don&#x27;t contaminate it and rub it between my hands to melt then  apply to my body.  II am pleased with product and would recommend it to others. .</li>
            <li> I had a problem with my first order.  It arrived unsealed and melted in the box.  The sellers quickly sent me a new one in perfect condition free of charge.  Absolutely excellent customer service.  I love the product .  I use in on my face, hands and feet.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> Not to happy w the smell. This is raw which is grainy I guess that&#x27;s an added bonus of an exfoliant .  I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in moisturizing effects. I probably won&#x27;t buy this ever again.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used several brands and have decided that Molivera is the most satisfying. Great produce. Some reviews complain about the smell. The very faint smell of this raw product goes away in minutes and becomes completely transparent. This is a Super Moisturizer. Five Stars!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality &amp; price!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and the customer service is even better!!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product and use it to treat eczema. The only drawback was receiving it from Amazon in the middle of August - without it being wrapped in plastic. It leaked in transit due to the heat. I&#x27;m also looking forward to using this product to make whipped shea butter.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very smooth. It&#x27;s unscented, so it almost smells &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; but I got used to it. It starts off hard but melts nicely in my hands. Does not feel greasy when applied sparingly. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Molivera shea butter has a fresh scent which I found rather pleasant and it absorbs easily into the skin with a soothing effect.  It spread quickly with the warmth of my hands and the texture became smoother.  I did not feel the need to heat it further to use as is.  A very itchy rash on my arm felt better and the redness is already disappearing on the second day.  I also appreciate the dark amber jar which protects the butter from light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black female, late 30&#x27;s w no history of skin problems but ended up with some damage after having a chemical peel done a few months back.  Any disclorations I had previously were darkened,  I had rough patches and my skin was just dull, aged.I would say it was burned and had lost its pigment, in a way. I tried Vitamin E oil, aloe vera gel,  a skin lightening cream given by the aesthetician.Everything irritated my skin so I discontinued use of all product, detoxed and switched to Molivera pure,raw shea butter. I started it 3 months post peel and any healing already in progress, sped up Day 1. My skin is nearly 100%. I&#x27;m excited to have good skin again and have a feeling this product is gonna make it Great!!!</li>
            <li> After buying this from Molivera Organics, I received an email thanking me for my order, but also giving me tips and tricks on the use and expectations of pure Shea Butter!  An even better experience than I was expecting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We make body butter with this and organic oils.  I know where I&#x27;ll be choosing to get my supplies in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product . Use it as a body moisturizer and it works excellent after shaving. Product is a little coarse (think tiny tiny sand particles) but when heated it melts. I actually like having a little slight grit because it helps exfoliate and invigorate your skin. Love it. Will repurchase. Seems to last me a long time too!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I use it along with African black soap! Has cleared my acne in just a week, while making my skin feel amazing.. Smooth and soft. Customer service is GREAT!! They email you with little tips on how to use the shea butter. Make the purchase, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Planning on using this on my son when he is born. I loved Shea moisture baby eczema cream so I decided to try PURE, unrefined Shea butter and this is great! I have tried it on myself for a few days now as a moisturizer for dry areas of my body and yessss It is THE BEST! It is thick, though, so would be difficult to moisturize an entire adult body but as I said it is perfect for dry areas or rashes!</li>
            <li> I combine Shea Butter Product from Molivera Organics and Coconut Oil Extra Virgin Organic from iOrgani for my daily facial cream treatment both days and nights. These two products are fantastic. I would highly recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry, cracked skin.</li>
            <li> Great stuff...even my teenage daughter loves it and she usually hates everything.  Leaves your  skin super soft especially in harsh, cold weather. Better than the other shea butter brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic, I think I am hooked on the elaborate process of exfoliating, bathing and then slathering this all over my body. I figured I would give this a try as an alternative treatment for my raging case of Keratosis Pilaris on arms and legs. Feels like I am a newborn baby, and it is truly therapeutic for the mind and body! It&#x27;s a bit too soon to report on whether I am seeing improvement in the skin condition yet, but I am in love with the quality of this product. A little bit goes a long way. In a league of its own, first class compared to all the crap you find in the drug store. As far as I am concerned, I have no intention in pursuing prescription strength lotions (for eczema or KP) now that I have this on my side.</li>
            <li> Feels good on the skin! Especially hands/nails.</li>
            <li> Excellent. I am happy with this entire order. This is a little thick, that is to say, not like like store bought lotions. I already expected this after reading the reviews. I do like the product and will buy it again from this seller. All you need to do is put some of this in the palm of your hand, place your other hand over it and gently rub your hands together, and it turns into a nice spreadable liquid within 15 to 30 seconds. Then you can apply it and repeat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product and very soothing to the skin. A little goes a long way, so this jar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> My favorite shea butter. I tend to forget to use it with my EO recipes and use it straight out of the jar. Will buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> Came in mail quickly. Completely satisfied and would recommend this product to others! I&#x27;ll definitely be busying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, some of the finest shea butter I&#x27;ve ever used, and awesomely priced for how much you get!  I use it for dry skin, both on myself and my cat (her paw pads tend to get dried-out and cracked).  It is the only thing that keeps my nose from bleeding in the winter months (I heat it a little and then apply it to the inside of nostrils).  A tiny bit in your hair can help give it a healthy shine, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everybody should keep some of this stuff in their home.</li>
            <li> Absolutely adore this product. Extremely healing for sun damaged skin and eczema, hydrating for dry skin, dry hair, and I use this in a home made organic sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is amazing.  I am using it to make a natural products like deodorant and foot cream.  These recipes come  from Wellness Mama.  This Shea butter is so light and creamy and the price is definitely right.  This is an excellent product!</li>
            <li> Very fresh.  We live the way that it feels on our skin and hair</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a super rich moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, because I am constantly cleaning and my hands get SO dry.  This shea butter is unbelievable.  It goes on a little dry and crumbly, but softens as you warm it up with your hands.  Then it does it&#x27;s magic.  It made my hands feel incredibly soft.  I have used it on my face, neck and even my feet because they get dry from working out and wearing flip flops.  I will definitely buy Molivera again!</li>
            <li> Texture is amazing, makes my skin and hair feel very soft. Is great to make a body butter with!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this item, I used it for everything ...hair , skin,and etc....</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer for skin. Nourishing and it makes my skin feel soft and smooth. Love it.</li>
            <li> Pretty much a lifetime supply of shea butter.  High quality, even if it is unrefined.  Slight nutty taste, if you use it on your lips, and you should.  Shea butter is water solulable, so you can use it on wet skin or as you get out of the shower.  One of the few things that actually cures dry cracked skin.</li>
            <li> oh, so great! such a great discovery for me! used it for hair masks, face masks...everything! it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> its a gift, so i cant comment</li>
            <li> Great texture, it takes a little bit to get used to the smell, but the benefits worth it. This is the first time that I use shea butter, and I&#x27;m glad that I choose this brand because is amazing!</li>
            <li> high quality shea butter. have read plenty of bad reviews of other brands. glad i found molivera</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Shea Butter and did my research on what to look for and I must see I love the Brand. It smells good without being overwhelming and it really moisturizes my hair. I blend it with a little black castor oil to fit my needs.</li>
            <li> works soooo good...still using for further benefits!</li>
            <li> This butter is exactly the way raw shea butter should be. You&#x27;re going to love the luxurious and velvety feel of this. I use this to make a homemade scar therapy lotion and it works perfectly. As for the smell you see other reviewers reporting...no it does&#x27;t smell like many of the other brand lotions that have artificial and chemical crap fragrances added to this. Because of its purity it doesn&#x27;t contain any certain added fragrance. I personally am not bothered by its mild scent at all. If you are, add some essential oils to your batch.</li>
            <li> Another great buy, best Shea butter!</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is amazing! Wonderful quality! The customer service is outstanding! I needed something to help with my newborn&#x27;s eczema and this cleared it up! Love this product! I have been recommending it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I use it on my face, hair, nails and feet. I even used a little on my cats dry skin and it completely absorbed in a few days. The smell is nutty and a little smoky. I&#x27;m very happy with this product. Also the company has wonderful customer service. They sent me 3 emails, before I received it and after. They sent instructions on how to use it and what to use it for. This is the one to buy! Great price also.</li>
            <li> BEST THING EVER!!! I mix it with coconut oil and it does miracles!! leaves my skin so soft! definitely coming back to get more when its over!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been switching to products that are as pure as possible, with a simple and short ingredient list.  You can&#x27;t get any more pure or simple than this Ivory Shea Butter.  I like that it is a bit heavier than my other go-to hand and foot cream, coconut oil, yet soaks in quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.  Molivera Organics delivers great communication about this product to your inbox, including all the ways that the Shea Butter can be used--for skin, hair, nails, etc.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best skin conditioner out there...it&#x27;s made a huge difference with my chronic dry skin and assisting in the reduction of scare discoloration.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I wanted no preservatives or additives and unrefined.  It is pure Shea Butter and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d found the very product I needed for dry hair until the morning I went into my bathroom and was greeted by a vanity top filled with tiny ants.  Though the top of the shea butter jar had been closed, ants  had completely covered the top of the contents.  I had to throw away a nearly full jar.  Have never before had ants in the bathroom.  Where they came from is a mystery--there was no trail I could see, just ants, ants, ants.  All I know is that they probably would give this product five stars.  I, however, will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Amazing products and amazing customer service!</li>
            <li> Its Raw so it has no smell other than maybe a putty type smell. So I used it to make my own lotion which i added essential oils, and coconut oil, and a tiny bit of bee wax. Worked GREAT! love it!</li>
            <li> Got it for my mom who&#x27;s been taking swimming lessons and noticed that the chlorine has made her skin dry. Doing a good job rejuvenating her face, she&#x27;ll try it in her hair next!</li>
            <li> Is a miracle for extra dry skin and lips.</li>
            <li> Perfect creamy raw shea butter, normally I end up with some grit in my unrefined shea butter but this one was perfectly smooth! Wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for my newly developed locs and I also started applying it to my face and have been surprised by the results. My face looks more darker and clea and I have not broken out once, my skin loves this Shea! ORGANIC ALL THE WAY!</li>
            <li> I love this. It keeps my skin soft and moist.</li>
            <li> Found a similar small jar at a Quilt Expo but ran out and was searching for more. This is exactly what I was looking for!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> excellent product the lid was broken in shipping but the jar stayed sealed ...the shea butter is wonderful &amp; now my whole family is using it</li>
            <li> Not impressed!  Harsh winter this year in NH and very dry hands.  This is easy to warm in palms and apply to hands but effect  is short lived.  Glad other Reviewers had better luck.  I&#x27;ll keep looking for better dry skin solution.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product and I can already see the difference with my feet and my face.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this Shea Butter to any and everyone, no matter the skin type.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Love what it&#x27;s doing for my skin.</li>
            <li> I am still trying to figure out just how to use.</li>
            <li> We use the shea butter in my son&#x27;s hair to help moisturize his hair and scalp. It works great! No more fuzz clinging in his hair, his tight curls are much more manageable, and he isn&#x27;t itching his scalp. A bonus for me is that my hands have never been softer! It has a very earthy scent, which isn&#x27;t bad, but if you&#x27;re not a fan, you could add some fragrance oils.</li>
            <li> Molivera&#x27;s shea butter is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.  It&#x27;s smooth and creamy, not hard and gritty, like some of the other brands.  I love it, and will definitely purchase again when I need more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for eczema. My son&#x27;s feet have eczema, I have used coconut oil on them for more than one month, they&#x27;re getting better but not totally recovered. After I put Shea butter and coconut oil together on them, about 2 weeks later, his eczema seems gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it makes my feet skin softer, better than coconut oil.</li>
            <li> My Wife Liked it very much</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter. I put it everywhere just on its own-- legs/arms/face. I also melted some down to make my own deodorant. It is high quality and smells great!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have been using it on my hands, elbows , knees and it is not greasy, absorbs well, odorless and does not wash out fast. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this, it was great. The second purchase caused dry skin/eczema to appear on my chest and decolletage.</li>
            <li> Nice product. I like to mix it with my lavendar essential oil. I would like to try to whip it but haven&#x27;t got a chance yet. The shea butter is really thick and a little goes a long way. Once you put the shea on your skin the warmth of your body melts it. I use it on my feet knees, elbows, everyday. Sometimes I put a little on my face around my eye area. The scent is a little different but if you mix it with a nice scent it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li> nature&#x27;s skin elixir! i have severe eczema (currently on my face) and i&#x27;ve used everything from prescription steroids to coconut oil to apple cider vinegar toner. this is the only remedy that has given my face enough moisture to last through the day. it&#x27;s pretty strong so i recommend using it once a day and gradually working your way if you need more. love this stuff and plan on ordering more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving this shea butter so far. I use it for my hair and skin and i&#x27;m definitely planning on purchasing more in the future :)</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. It&#x27;s even better if you melt it and add carrier oil and essential oils. Can get a bit grainy.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Very moisturizing and soothing.  The entire family is impressed with this product..  Had to order a second jar.  Great customer service too.  They share interesting facts about their product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Smooth, like custard and emulsifies - beautifully. I use this product on my hair skin and nails. I plan to reorder from this company as the product was as described and arrived on time !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with it !!</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my skin feel! It does have a mild smell to it, which my family does not like, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long once you apply it to your skin. I also use it in DYI deodorant.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, made my baby&#x27;s diaper rash disappear in 48 hours and the dry skin in my hands gone over night.. Great costumer service</li>
            <li> lid was broken, but that did not bother me. I bought Shea Butter cause I have very dry skin and a friend recommended to me, let me just say that it dis not help at all. What added to my frustration is how difficult it was to apply it on your skin.</li>
            <li> Thought it was supposed to be creamy...this was hard as a brick !</li>
            <li> Product is awesome, just two days and the skin around my eyes is improving nicely.  Also, I think it&#x27;s makIng a large brown spot on my face fade.</li>
            <li> This is incredible for my skin. And it&#x27;s a big jar, so it will last me a very long time. Definitely should be applied at night because it takes a while to soak into the skin. But it&#x27;s amazing, I love it</li>
            <li> This is all you need for your skin.  You can get creative with oils, etc. but honestly, raw to your face (areas around the eye, mouth etc.) is all I need.  Softens. Renews.  Just a little bit melts a long way.  It is amazing!  Honestly again.</li>
            <li> This is definitely NOT a body butter! It is dry and flaky and grainy as reviewed by other 1-star reviews. If you scoop it out and let it melt from your body heat, only then can it be put on. The odor smells really weird. Don&#x27;t risk it. Going in the garbage. SO DISAPPOINTED. Don&#x27;t waste your $$. If this is helpful, please click &amp;#34;Helpful Review.&amp;#34; Thank you.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the texture and quality of this shea butter. Have been using it to make lotion w/ coconut oil, and loving it. Great for hair, skin and lips!</li>
            <li> Good as an ingredient in homemade lotions.</li>
            <li> This was my first go at buying Shea butter and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  It has a &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; smell to it (not unpleasant at all) and I have not experienced any gritty feeling as I had seen mentioned in comments on other products.  I used this in combination with my Essential Oils to make face cream for myself and my daughters as well as making us some lotion.  I&#x27;m hooked and will never buy regular lotions from the store again.</li>
            <li> Repeat orders! This has been great shea butter for making homemade body butters! Smells very earthy but not bad.</li>
            <li> Good stuff- didn&#x27;t feel gritty as some reviewers mentioned. Does not have the &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34; smell. Very smooth and soothing. I find that I like to put this on first (lips, elbows, feet) and then like to layer something else (lotion, lip balm) on top to really moisturize deep.</li>
            <li> Very thick. Good stuff</li>
            <li> The most incredible product ever you can&#x27;t go wrong with this awesome</li>
            <li> This smelled so bad, I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is fantastic. This particular brand is especially wonderful because they give you amazing suggestions about numerous uses for this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great used alone or as an additive to other things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only started using this (about 2 days now) and have whipped it up with coconut oil and an essential oil to make my own body butter. So far, I love it. I researched several different companies, and found this to be the best one for me.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product!  I love it!  Great price!</li>
            <li> I finally got my order and the consistency of my shea butter was nothing like what i saw pictured. It was runny and gritty and looked discoloured. I am not sure if this is 100% shea butter as it should be a harder if I am not mistaken. Disappointed in this purchase. Would not buy from here again. I want my money back!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Love this, it&#x27;s a high quality, orangic and non-gmo.  The price is great and really sets this over the top.  I ordered mine in the middle of a midwest winter so so when it came it was frozen (sat out in extreme cold).  It softed up some in room temper, just had to run it under warm water to thaw it.  This is great for using when creating a &amp;#34;calming lotion&amp;#34; with magnesium oil.</li>
            <li> this is raw and is very helpfull. best shea i have seen/used</li>
            <li> This product is miracle.</li>
            <li> Perfect; exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Ok not the best in terms of smell</li>
            <li> My tub of African Organic Shea butter was like cement.  I had to dig it out of the jar.  No question, if you have the time to rub the chunk on your body until it absorbs, it does work beautifully.  However, my particular jar is so hard I have to use a spoon to get it out!  Is this normal?</li>
            <li> Nice smell, and I can tell it&#x27;s unprocessed by the slightly gritty texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this products for a few weeks, and now I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it! This Shea butter goes on very smooth, and it stretches well. I use it daily on my head, face, and body, and it&#x27;s given my skin a clean, radiant glow. The only minute downside to this product is that I leave grease marks everywhere.-- on glass doors, on my glasses, on my phone. I find myself continuously having to clean up residue that I leave behind, but it&#x27;s worth the trouble!</li>
            <li> A great product. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Love this item, It came on time and the shea butter is so creamy. Its awesome!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter was great! My kids have been using it for the past weekend we already see a difference in their skin. They were breaking out prior and we couldn&#x27;t figure out why.... The Shea Butter has cleared it up. We will definitely be repeat customers!</li>
            <li> So far I have purchased 2 tubs, and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;My job requires me to wash my hands again and again, and then on top of weight lifting ripping my hands up I also work a second job at a car wash which my hands are constantly getting wet.&lt;br /&gt;*Most products irritate my eczema I get from allergies this however does not, and it works must better than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;*I usually apply lotion 6 or so times a day, I only have to apply this 2 times in the morning and at night, and my hands don&#x27;t dry out.&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;+My hands look AMAZING when I use this stuff, after about 60 seconds it absorbs into my hands and it is no longer shiny&lt;br /&gt;+The tub is MUCH bigger than I had thought it would be!&lt;br /&gt;+It only takes a small amount and it lasts all most all day&lt;br /&gt;+It&#x27;s ORGANIC, there&#x27;s no chemicals! just pure shea butter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;-It goes on very shiny and almost greasy (it absorbs quickly though) but if you touch something it rubs off onto it so be careful&lt;br /&gt;-It can smell a little funky if your not used to it, almost slightly like off scented Play-Doh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMPANY&lt;br /&gt;+I emailed them about one of the tubs that I ordered that smelled a little bit different, and they QUICKLY replied and sent me a new tub at no charge, and after that they even explained that the old tub was not bad but simply smells different because of the cultivation product.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT customer service&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REMEMBER&lt;br /&gt;If this review was helpful to you in any way click the YES button below \/</li>
            <li> Skip the other shea butters in a bag and get this one. I ordered several bags from a different company and 3 out of the 5 were grainy. This one is great. Goes on smooth and creamy like butter, just the way it should be.</li>
            <li> Works well as a carrier oil with essential oils.</li>
            <li> When applied, it gives your skin a nice glossy look (like how Beyonce&#x27;s skin looks during a sexy dance routine). And then, when it dries, it leaves your skin feeling nice and soft. At first, I applied this over my usual body lotion. But after a while, I  just used this on its own.  I just put in my second order.</li>
            <li> I know shea butter is not supposed to plug up pores, but this one seemed to.</li>
            <li> I swear by the amazing properties of Shea Butter, this is my first time getting this brand. It has a nutty smell, spreads well and mixes wonderfully. i put in on early in the morning all over my body and it leaves me feeling soft and non greasy.</li>
            <li> My son has horrible eczema and Shea butter seems to be the only thing that helps him....and fast. In about 1 week of using this my sons akin has softened and healed tremendously. And who wouldn&#x27;t want to use all natural products on their kids over the chemical full lotions sold in the store. This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever bought for my skin. If you suffer from eczema you have to try this. I will never use store bought lotion again. Shea butter is all you will need. It feels great on your skin. Nothing else has worked to cure my itchy skin for years until I found this shea butter.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. I use it mostly on my lips because they get so dry at night. Also great for your cuticles and feet. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about 10 days ago and fell in love with it immediately.  First, it&#x27;s pure, second, it&#x27;s natural.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thick, but goes on easily. You can feel the difference. It can be applied to skin and hair. Having some first-hand knowledge of the cocoa plant and it&#x27;s fruit, I can highly recommend this product.  There is no fragrant odor just pure and natural no additives etc.  You will love it, it you prefer wholesome product without all the junk. wife of John,</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product I could use to keep my hair soft and manageable and after using this on my hair I felt a huge difference!!! My hair use to be really dry prior to application of this amazing African Shea butter and now it has become so much more softer! I use it at room temperature and I take about a coin size (a little goes along way) and melt it between my hands, and apply to my tight curls! I enjoy using this on my hair and definitely recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for my baby, but I cannot get past the smell! I used it once and then just threw it away because the scent was so awful. I bought the Now brand shea butter, which smells so much better, even though it&#x27;s probably refined and not raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the texture of this shea butter is fine. Like most shea butters, you have to rub it between your fingers to warm it up so it can be smoothed on, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST Shea Butter out there.  I mainly use it in my daughter&#x27;s extra dry hair for moisture, but it is also amazing to use on the skin.  A little bit goes a long way and so it is very reasonably priced.  My first jar lasted about 6 months and we use it several times a day.  I especially love that it is in its natural form!  No additives or preservatives!  :)</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. We have used it for lip balm so far and it is really nice stuff! Looking forward to using it for more homemade products!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I bought this product that I realized that my old shea butter was processed.  I prefer this raw (unprocessed) product because it&#x27;s smoother and feels more natural.  My processed version is many years old, and now it has a stickier consistency and &amp;#34;dead&amp;#34; scent (like petroleum jelly with particles).  The uses for shea butter are endless - heels, face, body, and also as a chap stick when at home.  Why pay for those products that make such a big deal about containing shea butter, when they actually contain a small percentage of this ingredient. This seller follows up with emails, so direct contact information is available if necessary.  I purchased a 2nd as a gift.</li>
            <li> This Shea butters seems to be very good quality. I use it on my face, body and hands. I use it in my homemade &amp;#34;lotions&amp;#34; or when I haven&#x27;t had time to make any, I just take a scoop add a few drops of essential oil, mix in my hand until it softens and rub on face/body. I use it for my eczema and on scars. It is a little to heavy for my very thin hair so only as a very occasional deep conditioning treatment. I use it one my kids too.</li>
            <li> I like how creamy and smooth it is.</li>
            <li> Very good quality. I use it to make lotions and this is my first time using this brand. The lotion came out excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Shipment came very quickly, and the packaging was appropriate for the amount I ordered.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful, and it&#x27;s not chemically refined, just pure bliss......I have used Shea butter for years and love it.  I&#x27;ll do a facial mask and then slather it on and when I wake up my face is as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom, it surprised me every time. It&#x27;s great for all sorts of things and YES you can use it on your baby.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shea butter because the brand I normally used was sold out. Unfortunately, Molivera&#x27;s brand was very gritty (and the grittiness didn&#x27;t completely disappear as I warmed the butter in my hand. With other shea butters I hadn&#x27;t encountered grittiness.) There was a plasticky scent to this shea butter (as opposed to the cocoa-like smell from other shea butters I&#x27;ve used). It seemed to moisturize decently but I purchased this to help treat my infant&#x27;s eczema. With the plasticky smell, we ended up setting it aside and had to find another brand.</li>
            <li> Great product. My first time using shea butter to help moisturize and treat my excema ridden hands and although took some time to get used to the texture I can see my skin is starting to heal and maintain the moisture. Shipping was quick - not eligible for prime two day shipping but as soon as I got the email notification I received product the same day!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  It helped heal my cracking/bleedy knuckles due to over washing my hands during this cold/flu season.  We&#x27;ve had a cold/flu in our household in some manner for over a month, so I&#x27;ve been washing my hands obsessively and not moisturizing diligently.  I slather this stuff on at night and really rub it into the bleeding knuckles, I literally noticed a difference the next day.  By the second or third night the cracks appear to be healed and am now left with the chapped skin, which appears to be getting smoothed out in the areas that we&#x27;re not as severely dried out initially.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this one. It&#x27;s grainy and doesn&#x27;t absorb well into my skin. Not sure if it&#x27;s a bad jar or if this is how it always is. I&#x27;ve bought Shea butter from other companies and it was much better.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS AAMMAAZZZIINNGGGG!!! i wish i found out about this sooner! ugh! i put it all over my body and face (i add a little bit of Jojoba oil too, consistancy is a little bit thick) i wake up with the smoothest skin ever! like a babys bottom!</li>
            <li> It came as promised, wrapped up nice, love the label and jar. I have never felt true raw shea butter before, the ones I have used in the past were creamy this one is gritty and needs to be warmed up in your hands to rub on the body. I love what it does and what it stands for, so I will grit and bear the grittiness of it all. I recommend it....</li>
            <li> Great item, have been using for a couple of weeks with no problems. Quality of butter feels high.</li>
            <li> I am so thankful that I found your company on line and for all the helpful hints on using this and I will try every one to see how it work for me thank you again I am loving it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Raw African Shea Butter!!! It has helped me so much with skin problems I have been trying to resolve for over the past year now. I highly recommend this product. You will not regret buying this! For my skin conditions it has helped OVERNIGHT! Truly worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter!</li>
