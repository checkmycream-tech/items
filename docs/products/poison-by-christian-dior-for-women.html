    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to get it.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that Amazon has it at an affordable price.  </li>
            <li>My all-time favorite!!</li>
            <li>She was thrilled to receive it as a gift for Christmas!</li>
            <li>forgot how darn good Poison is.</li>
            <li>Since I was a teenager (yes, this perfume has been around that long!)I loved this perfume.  </li>
            <li>The iridescent bottle is beautiful, like a magical \\&quot;poison\\&quot; apple.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent, lasts all day!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my scent every time I wear it!</li>
            <li>so I found it on here for a better price!</li>
            <li>Looking at the notes, the white florals would scare the bejesus out of me now, but they wear so perfectly.</li>
            <li>This has always been my daughter&#x27;s favorite cologne, so when I saw it</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>Been my favorite for years.</li>
            <li>Have used this scent since it was introduced many years ago.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find another that compares and feels as comfortable while wearing it.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see it was the perfume I wanted-not the \\&quot;Tendre\\&quot; version that most currently sell at these prices.</li>
            <li>Even when I think I can&#x27;t smell it anymore as it&#x27;s so strong when going on, you can smell it as others tell me.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful perfume, slightly exotic: strong - lasts all day, so just use a small amount</li>
            <li>The white florals are amazingly beautiful without being cloying, girly or sweet.</li>
            <li>Poison is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume! :&amp;#62;) :&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li>Poison is one of the most unique and long lasting- unforgettable fragrances ever!</li>
            <li>Poison is an old favorite!  </li>
            <li>I have to wait for special occasions to get it though.  </li>
            <li>This is my Mom&#x27;s absolute favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>Such a rich, smooth, exotic scent.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t yet opened the bottle because I have a drop left of my old perfume, but so far, I&#x27;m quite impressed!</li>
            <li>Perfume arrived FAST!</li>
            <li>No ridiculously silly descriptions needed.</li>
            <li>I tried Poison again, for the first time in close to 20 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to wear this perfume, just not spray it on my neck, though ;)</li>
            <li>The drydown left some stinky, offensive strong notes that made my throat sore to breathe them in.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Along with Red, Poison was my signature scent in the late 80s and early 90s, until the mid-90s hit and we all felt the need to get Happy, smell like Sunflowers, and jump in Cool Water. ;)</li>
            <li>and it gives me a very itchy rash.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expound much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s favorite &amp; almost impossible to find locally &amp; a good price.</li>
            <li>I clearly remember buying large bottles of EDT in Kroger&#x27;s - of all places - for about 35 USD.</li>
            <li>I like it as it&#x27;s not like a floral perfume but a woodsy, exotic quite heavy perfume.  </li>
            <li>Though I do not care for the fragrance you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth out of this stuff.</li>
            <li>That was a lot of money for me then, a lot, which is why I clearly remember the price.</li>
            <li>Worth the price as well because the bottle lasts so long even with daily use.</li>
            <li>Poison is pretty much spent in 2 hours on me, and it moves to the heart in a blink of an eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s hard to just put a little on, even one spray is very overwhelming.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s so sad is that I have smelled this on other people and liked it (other than the full frontal nasal assault it causes me).</li>
            <li>Not a long wearing product either.</li>

            <li> Projects like a beast and very long lasting.</li>
            <li> Poison is going for 2 to 3 times that price now, and Red is still the same price (or less).</li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t had it for a very, very long time and was ecstatic when she opened her gift!</li>
            <li> Then, Red was just 5 less.</li>
            <li> Sharp, bitter bergamot and gardenia.</li>
            <li> I have to say that it has been replaced by &amp;#34;Daisy-Hot Pink Edition&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li> A very little goes a long way, so I wear a little.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey but cheaper than buying in store.</li>
            <li> One word: harsh.</li>
            <li> BUT, the only reason I didn&#x27;t rate this 5 stars is because I have some weird allergic reaction to it on my neck</li>
            <li> This is my favourite perfume for the past 20 yrs since I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quit hard to find a perfume like this.  </li>
            <li> This product is FAKE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is FAKE. Do not buy</li>
            <li> My favorite scent, lasts all day! A little pricey but cheaper than buying in store. Worth the price as well because the bottle lasts so long even with daily use. Just recieved my bottle only 3 days after ordering. Will definitely purchase again when I finish this one off!</li>
            <li> Perfume arrived FAST! I was happy to see it was the perfume I wanted-not the \\&quot;Tendre\\&quot; version that most currently sell at these prices. I haven&#x27;t yet opened the bottle because I have a drop left of my old perfume, but so far, I&#x27;m quite impressed!</li>
            <li> No ridiculously silly descriptions needed. (Floral notes, woody undertones, whatever blah blah blah.) As the review title states: Best. Perfume. Ever.</li>
            <li> Wonderful perfume, slightly exotic: strong - lasts all day, so just use a small amount</li>
            <li> I tried Poison again, for the first time in close to 20 years. Along with Red, Poison was my signature scent in the late 80s and early 90s, until the mid-90s hit and we all felt the need to get Happy, smell like Sunflowers, and jump in Cool Water. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot how darn good Poison is. Looking at the notes, the white florals would scare the bejesus out of me now, but they wear so perfectly. The white florals are amazingly beautiful without being cloying, girly or sweet. Sadly, lasting power is not at all what I remember: Poison is pretty much spent in 2 hours on me, and it moves to the heart in a blink of an eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What ever happened to the price of Poison? I clearly remember buying large bottles of EDT in Kroger&#x27;s - of all places - for about 35 USD. That was a lot of money for me then, a lot, which is why I clearly remember the price. Then, Red was just 5 less. Poison is going for 2 to 3 times that price now, and Red is still the same price (or less). Wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I just bought a bottle of Poison. Oh, Poison, how I&#x27;ve missed you!</li>
            <li> I was given this perfume for christmas and I absolutely love it! I get so many compliments on my scent every time I wear it! BUT, the only reason I didn&#x27;t rate this 5 stars is because I have some weird allergic reaction to it on my neck and it gives me a very itchy rash. I&#x27;ll continue to wear this perfume, just not spray it on my neck, though ;)</li>
            <li> Poison is an old favorite!  I have to say that it has been replaced by &amp;#34;Daisy-Hot Pink Edition&amp;#34;!  However, sometimes I like a change, &amp; Poison  accommodates that change!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s favorite &amp; almost impossible to find locally &amp; a good price.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this perfume and I buy it every year for Christmas, lame but she loves it. A lot of store have stopped selling it so I found it on here for a better price!</li>
            <li> This smelled like BUG SPRAY on me after about 20 minutes. The drydown left some stinky, offensive strong notes that made my throat sore to breathe them in.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to just put a little on, even one spray is very overwhelming. What&#x27;s so sad is that I have smelled this on other people and liked it (other than the full frontal nasal assault it causes me). Not a long wearing product either.</li>
            <li> This is my favourite perfume for the past 20 yrs since I was a teenager.  It&#x27;s not a perfume I would wear during the day, I wear it for the evening.  I like it as it&#x27;s not like a floral perfume but a woodsy, exotic quite heavy perfume.  It&#x27;s quit hard to find a perfume like this.  A very little goes a long way, so I wear a little.  Even when I think I can&#x27;t smell it anymore as it&#x27;s so strong when going on, you can smell it as others tell me.  Not for everyone.</li>
            <li> Was what I ordered and arrived promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t respond to surveys as you can see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I don&#x27;t expound much.</li>
            <li> This has always been my daughter&#x27;s favorite cologne, so when I saw it I knew I had to get it for her.  She hasn&#x27;t had it for a very, very long time and was ecstatic when she opened her gift!</li>
            <li> One word: harsh. The iridescent bottle is beautiful, like a magical \\&quot;poison\\&quot; apple. Sharp, bitter bergamot and gardenia. The combination of citrus and white flowers just never does it for me. Projects like a beast and very long lasting. Though I do not care for the fragrance you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth out of this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent.  I have to wait for special occasions to get it though.  Been my favorite for years.</li>
            <li> This is my Mom&#x27;s absolute favorite perfume.  She was thrilled to receive it as a gift for Christmas!</li>
            <li> My all-time favorite!! Have used this scent since it was introduced many years ago. Haven&#x27;t been able to find another that compares and feels as comfortable while wearing it. Please, please never discontinue!</li>
            <li> I wore this 25 years ago before I went into the Care Giving field. ( You can&#x27;t use perfumes.) Now that I have retired from that field I find I can indulge in this passion again. Such a rich, smooth, exotic scent. I missed it.</li>
            <li> Now, this was a &amp;#34;No-Brainer&amp;#34;! Poison is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume! :&amp;#62;) :&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li> Poison is one of the most unique and long lasting- unforgettable fragrances ever! And I&#x27;ve tried dozens over the years!</li>
            <li> Since I was a teenager (yes, this perfume has been around that long!)I loved this perfume.  Now I can afford it and I am buying it every time it runs out.  I am so happy that Amazon has it at an affordable price.  I love Amazon.  Everything I buy online is through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for this scent.  I was very happy to get it.</li>
