            <li> I love it!  Colors are so pretty.</li>
            <li> This palette is by far the best palette I own. I wanted it for a whole year but it was sold out...When I finally got my hands on it, I couldve died! The black diamond is a beautiful rich pigment black  w/ specks of color in it which is perfect for holidays and nights out. Ive never seen a black like this. Very buttery...non-powdery pigments. Every color goes well with other transition shades. Can create a smokey eye..to daytime appropriate eye looks. Ugh! I Love It! Well worth the wait...♡</li>

            <li> I love this palette, the colors are gorgeous and highly pigmented! I think they are a great quality and from my experience my eye makeup looks the same at the end of the day as it did when I applied it (I use UD primer potion which probably helps).</li>
