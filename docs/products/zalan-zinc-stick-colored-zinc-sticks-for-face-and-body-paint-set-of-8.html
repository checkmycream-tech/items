            <li>But my kids love putting it on, so it is a great way keep their noses covered!</li>

            <li>love this product!  </li>
            <li>Much better than the liquidy tube zinc!</li>
            <li>We love zinc sticks!  </li>
            <li>They loved the bright colors and how easy it went on.</li>
            <li>Nice colors</li>
            <li>It becomes quite the thing to bust these out, let the kids paint their own faces.</li>
            <li>Washes off very easily though.</li>
            <li>Great sunscreen and lots of fun colors.</li>
            <li>Great sunscreen sticks with fun colors.</li>
            <li>Great colors and lots of fun for the grandchildren.  </li>
            <li>Colors are vibrant and bright!</li>
            <li>This was a huge hit at both Boy Scout and Girl Scout camp this summer!</li>
            <li>probably during shipping, but i still love the product.</li>
            <li>My daughter spends most of her life in the pool.  </li>
            <li>They enjoyed using them, but this product stained their skin, even after washing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since I was a kid :)</li>
            <li>My daughters ages 10-15, love these sunscreen face sticks.</li>
            <li>We do have to reapply mid-day though as it rubs off which I didn&#x27;t have to do many years ago.</li>
            <li>My kids love this because of the colors.</li>
            <li>Outstanding color that stays on you lips and protects Rays from the sun.</li>
            <li>It is going to be great for spirit days during the school year too (and football games for my older kids)</li>
            <li>Plus, it looks reall cool!</li>
            <li>I wish it didn&#x27;t rub off so easy.  </li>
            <li>They go on easy and stayed on well.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, but also comes off too easy all over clothes.</li>
            <li>I love the smooth application and bold colours.</li>
            <li>Fun!</li>
            <li>What a fun way to get kids to put on their sunblock!</li>
            <li>It lasts forever and is great for long day wear.</li>
            <li>So fun for kids party or biddy soccer games!</li>
            <li>Fun for the kids to use for sports and the pool alike!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fun!</li>
            <li>Fun for kids to use!</li>
            <li>So much fun for the kids with sun protection!  </li>
            <li>So easy and fun to apply.  </li>
            <li>You can make a lot of neat designs with this many colors - much more than with the old tubes of nothing but florescent colors.</li>
            <li>Super fun!</li>
            <li>Super fun for the kids in the sun!</li>
            <li>The only con is that it takes a good deal of scrubbing to get the stains off your skin if you have worn it all day.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we wanted!</li>
            <li>The colors were fantastic and very vibrant and an added bonus  - they saved her cheekbones from the sun.</li>
            <li>They stay on and can be used for fun days at camp or the beach or even as lipstick for the kids</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot of fun</li>
            <li>My kids had a lot of fun using these sunscreen sticks during the summer swim season.</li>
            <li>They paint fun stuff on their face and it protects them from the sun.</li>
            <li>One of the tubes did sort of break, but it was easy to snap the piece back on, and it worked fine after that.</li>
            <li>Bold, bright colors are EXTREMELY waterproof (to the point of needing some major scrubbing after time in the pool), and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>The green is a perfect match to the Hulk, so it was a big hit.  </li>
            <li>They do tend to melt in the sun, so I leave mine in the cooler bag on really hot days.  </li>
            <li>I put some on my face and it stayed on pretty well through 6 hours on river.</li>
            <li>Cheaper and stay on really well!</li>
            <li>At around $12-13 for 8 tubes, it&#x27;s a better value than a lot of regular chapstick-style sunblocks...</li>
            <li>Many years ago when I was a YMCA camp counselor I would die zinc orange before our weekly field trip to the local pool</li>
            <li>This version is MUCH easier than that!  </li>
            <li>It stayed on pretty well in a swim, and when it does rinse or rub off, you can see because of the color.</li>
            <li>Other colors are good so far.</li>
            <li>The colors are thick and bright, and the &amp;#34;chapstick&amp;#34; style containers make it easy to apply without getting your fingers all gross.</li>
            <li>The whole team started using it in their team colors.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to use with my gear.</li>
            <li>It works great...and very fun&lt;br</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t have any complaints about this sunblock.</li>
            <li>Apparently, what&#x27;s retro is now cool again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read reviews that the colors rub off easily, which is true, but only if you rub it shortly after it is applied.</li>
            <li>Kids love having these to draw designs on themselves and each other.</li>
            <li>I promised my sister that she and her kids could have the rest when I&#x27;m back from the trip, and they were extremely excited.</li>
            <li>If you have a small makeup brush (or a set of small brushes), it would be pretty easy to use this for creating more detailed &amp;#34;face painting&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Though this would be a nice and thick for added protection.</li>
            <li>Only downfall is it rubs off easily (like regular zinc does) and can stain clothes</li>
            <li>It does help to let them dry a bit before swimming, but even on top of other sunscreen they held up pretty well.</li>
            <li>Pretty bummed about the blue as it was the one color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about it is safe chemical...</li>
            <li>The stick is much better than the tube as it&#x27;s less messy.  </li>
            <li>The rest of the colors are vibrant and long lasting though!</li>
            <li>A little harder to get off than most sunscreens but extra time spent in the shower helped.</li>
            <li>This second set is great too, but the white when opened broke in the middle :(</li>

            <li> and when I tried it I didn&#x27;t expect it to last as long as it did.</li>
            <li> Will be using these for a long time.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to use it all summer long!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They got my review and sent me a whole new set to compensate for the broken black!!!</li>
            <li> With all this being said, my only complaint is that the blue one broke off as soon as I opened it!</li>
            <li> Worked as I expected.</li>
            <li> Disapointed in the black tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wish it was a less transparent.</li>
            <li> I wanted a little heavier color for the kids.</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t touch my face for a few hours after I applied it.</li>
            <li> They are not as thick as you would hope and one forgotten touch and it is a smeared mess.  </li>
            <li> No more gooey fingers.  </li>
            <li> I purchased three sets for the summer at the pool and am very disappointed to see that it&#x27;s no longer available.  </li>
            <li> It is also really hard to remove.  </li>
            <li> so after he puts sunscreen on (he is 10 - he was never enthusiastic about sunscreen) -</li>
            <li> but the black wont work!!!</li>
            <li> The product is not a good one.</li>
            <li> For once, my children didn&#x27;t get annoyed at me sunscreening up their face.  </li>
            <li> Our kids look crazy, but at least they are wearing sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Extremely difficult to remove.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love these! I purchased one set, tried them out while surfing, and they worked phenomenally!! This second set is great too, but the white when opened broke in the middle :( probably during shipping, but i still love the product.</li>
            <li> Reallt Good colors... but the black wont work!!! The tube wont turn up like the rest. It is stuck. Thats a big bummer because i was going to use it for football events. The rest of the colors are vibrant and long lasting though! Disapointed in the black tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;UPDATE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;They got my review and sent me a whole new set to compensate for the broken black!!! Awesome customer service!!! Will be using these for a long time.</li>
            <li> These are great. They stay on and can be used for fun days at camp or the beach or even as lipstick for the kids</li>
            <li> fantastic,fun and stays on through hours of swim, sun and play!</li>
            <li> I wish it didn&#x27;t rub off so easy.  But my kids love putting it on, so it is a great way keep their noses covered!</li>
            <li> Just like the colored zinc of the 90s. Fun! Washes off very easily though.</li>
            <li> My daughter spends most of her life in the pool.  We were bringing back my childhood with these.  She and her swim team had a great time putting these on.  The stick is much better than the tube as it&#x27;s less messy.  The colors were fantastic and very vibrant and an added bonus  - they saved her cheekbones from the sun.</li>
            <li> The product is not a good one. It stained my grandchildren&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> Kids love having these to draw designs on themselves and each other. Colors are good.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this product!</li>
            <li> Good value.  Worked as I expected.</li>
            <li> My boys LOVE these colored sunscreen sticks!  They work perfectly for &amp;#34;war paint&amp;#34; for swim meets!  They do tend to melt in the sun, so I leave mine in the cooler bag on really hot days.  They were a big hit at the pool this summer, though!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sons to use during sporting events. The whole team started using it in their team colors. Also used it for camp face paint. Great sunscreen and lots of fun colors. Love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> My son was so stoked to get this &#x27;retro&#x27; gift.  Apparently, what&#x27;s retro is now cool again.</li>
            <li> This was a huge hit at both Boy Scout and Girl Scout camp this summer! What a fun way to get kids to put on their sunblock!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a music festival later this summer and when I tried it I didn&#x27;t expect it to last as long as it did. This  is waterproof, sweat proof, and rub proof. It lasts forever and is great for long day wear. It&#x27;s a lot of fun and I can&#x27;t wait to use it all summer long!</li>
            <li> Nice colors but they do not stay put. I bought this for my children to have extra protection on their nose and under their eyes as that is where they tend to burn. Though this would be a nice and thick for added protection. They are not as thick as you would hope and one forgotten touch and it is a smeared mess.  It is also really hard to remove.  I found that you  need an oil based substance to remove it and not have to scrub.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen sticks with fun colors. My kids had a lot of fun using these sunscreen sticks during the summer swim season. They loved the bright colors and how easy it went on. A little harder to get off than most sunscreens but extra time spent in the shower helped.</li>
            <li> I love the smooth application and bold colours. The only con is that it takes a good deal of scrubbing to get the stains off your skin if you have worn it all day.</li>
            <li> Got these in the mail last night and used them guiding a white water rafting trip today. Colors are vibrant and bright! They go on easy and stayed on well. I&#x27;ve read reviews that the colors rub off easily, which is true, but only if you rub it shortly after it is applied. I put some on my face and it stayed on pretty well through 6 hours on river. I just didn&#x27;t touch my face for a few hours after I applied it. With all this being said, my only complaint is that the blue one broke off as soon as I opened it! Other colors are good so far. Pretty bummed about the blue as it was the one color I really wanted to use with my gear.</li>
            <li> These are the best colored zinc sticks I&#x27;ve found. It does help to let them dry a bit before swimming, but even on top of other sunscreen they held up pretty well. Great bright colors.</li>
            <li> love this product!  great price too!</li>
            <li> wish it was a less transparent. I wanted a little heavier color for the kids.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, but also comes off too easy all over clothes.</li>
            <li> I bought these and sent them to my daughter and her cabin mates at sleep away camp.  They enjoyed using them, but this product stained their skin, even after washing.  Last year I purchased Zinka brand, and there was no staining.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughter for Jr. Lifeguard.  She loved them.  No more gooey fingers.  So easy and fun to apply.  She used the red for lipstick.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of color options, and great protection! I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since I was a kid :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Would have gave it 5 Stars had it maybe came with some sort of convenient travel case or bag.</li>
            <li> Colored zinc in a lip stick style packaging, bright colors, keeps lips from burning while in the sun.</li>
            <li> So fun for kids party or biddy soccer games!</li>
            <li> Exactly what we wanted! GREAT sunblock! Fun for the kids to use for sports and the pool alike!</li>
            <li> My daughter uses them for Junior Life Guards. She loves all the great colors</li>
            <li> AWESOME!I use them in place of lipstick. Cheaper and stay on really well!</li>
            <li> LOVE this!!  I purchased three sets for the summer at the pool and am very disappointed to see that it&#x27;s no longer available.  Hope it will be again, soon!</li>
            <li> It works great...and very fun&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m not sure about it is safe chemical...</li>
            <li> Best price. Super fun! Made for fun vacation pics and protected our faces exceptionally well!! Much better than the liquidy tube zinc!</li>
            <li> I wish they had a pencil version of these too.  My son loves getting face painted - so after he puts sunscreen on (he is 10 - he was never enthusiastic about sunscreen) - I use these and the zinka tubes to facepaint something for camp (really simple on one cheek).  It is going to be great for spirit days during the school year too (and football games for my older kids)</li>
            <li> Lasts but you can still wash it off. We used it for a party where we were face-painting, and then we use them for the beach. Our kids look crazy, but at least they are wearing sunscreen. It becomes quite the thing to bust these out, let the kids paint their own faces.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunblock for a circus trip to the Caribbean, and it&#x27;s perfect. The colors are thick and bright, and the &amp;#34;chapstick&amp;#34; style containers make it easy to apply without getting your fingers all gross. I promised my sister that she and her kids could have the rest when I&#x27;m back from the trip, and they were extremely excited. You can make a lot of neat designs with this many colors - much more than with the old tubes of nothing but florescent colors. If you have a small makeup brush (or a set of small brushes), it would be pretty easy to use this for creating more detailed &amp;#34;face painting&amp;#34; designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t have any complaints about this sunblock. One of the tubes did sort of break, but it was easy to snap the piece back on, and it worked fine after that. The color stays put all day, and it doesn&#x27;t sweat off or fade in water like a lot of sunblock does. At around $12-13 for 8 tubes, it&#x27;s a better value than a lot of regular chapstick-style sunblocks...and it&#x27;s fun!</li>
            <li> Worked well in our carribean cruise. Fun for kids to use!</li>
            <li> So much fun for the kids with sun protection!  I always have to fite my kids to put sunscreen on their face.  With these sticks, they beg me to put on sunscreen.  Only downfall is it rubs off easily (like regular zinc does) and can stain clothes</li>
            <li> Super fun for the kids in the sun!</li>
            <li> My daughters ages 10-15, love these sunscreen face sticks. They paint fun stuff on their face and it protects them from the sun.</li>
            <li> They were awesome!  My kids loved them!</li>
            <li> Great colors and lots of fun for the grandchildren.  Extremely difficult to remove.  Will not use again.</li>
            <li> We love zinc sticks!  We use them when going to a theme park or water park to identify our kids.  We color their noses in whatever color they choose for the day and know to just &amp;#34;look for the blue kids&amp;#34;.  Many years ago when I was a YMCA camp counselor I would die zinc orange before our weekly field trip to the local pool so we always knew the orange kids were ours.  This version is MUCH easier than that!  We do have to reapply mid-day though as it rubs off which I didn&#x27;t have to do many years ago.</li>
            <li> Bold, bright colors are EXTREMELY waterproof (to the point of needing some major scrubbing after time in the pool), and easy to apply.  For once, my children didn&#x27;t get annoyed at me sunscreening up their face.  The green is a perfect match to the Hulk, so it was a big hit.  Protected well too, kids were in the pool for over an hour. Just as a suggestion,  Zalan, come up with some glittery colors too!</li>
            <li> The kids loved this and used it like facepaint. It stayed on pretty well in a swim, and when it does rinse or rub off, you can see because of the color.</li>
            <li> My kids love this because of the colors.</li>
            <li> Outstanding color that stays on you lips and protects Rays from the sun. Plus, it looks reall cool!</li>
