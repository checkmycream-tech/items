            <li>I WILL DEFF BUY MORE OF THIS TO HAVE IN HANDY.</li>
            <li>pretty well I&#x27;m really happy with this item</li>
            <li>So much better than just using A&amp;D.</li>
            <li>This stuff works like magic.</li>
            <li>I will always use this product and nothing else because of its natural ingredients and quality as well as, how brilliant my colors remain from using the &amp;#34;Goo&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It is very  Soothing &amp; smells great.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Best Stuff on Earth for lasting color and great for minor scraps and chapped lips.</li>
            <li>it was easy to apply an it was soothing to the skin</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Exactly as descibed and really cheap!</li>
            <li>If your an avid lover of tattoo&#x27;s than this is the stuff for you!</li>
            <li>and they did not seem to work as well and required far more care than Tattoo Goo.</li>
            <li>it certainly worth trying and experiencing Tattoo Goo.</li>
            <li>I got this for myself and a friend and was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It absorbed easily and brightens old tattoos.  </li>
            <li>Love the &amp;#34;tin&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Great for daily use!</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty neat.</li>
            <li>AFTER MY TATTOOS I APPLIED IT AND ITS REALLY NICE COMPARED TO THE OTHER STUFF.</li>
            <li>I heal pretty fast anyways when I get a new tattoo but the &amp;#34;Goo&amp;#34; takes healing to a whole nother level!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone who wants this priductg.</li>
            <li>It really helps the color stay in</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>It works very well for me, and is the first ointment I ask for after getting a new tattoo.</li>
            <li>Just in a week I start to notice a big difference on what it&#x27;s doing to the ink work I had done more ten years ago.</li>
            <li>an it seems to brighten the older tattoos</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>What we have experienced is reduced healing time, less scabbing and less need for care than alternatives.</li>
            <li>We always use this on our new and older tattoos.</li>
            <li>it really revives a tattoo i had a couple that are over 20 years old with the goo they have been resurrected.</li>
            <li>Stays in place and keeps a new tattoo moist.</li>
            <li>We always keep it on hand to use on our new ink.</li>
            <li>New one healed, old one brightened up!</li>
            <li>I liked how soothing it was and a little goes a long way with this product</li>
            <li>You know the burn you experience in your skin after your new tattoo is complete?</li>
            <li>On my new tattoo, as well as on an old one.</li>
            <li>It brings the color out in old and new tattoos.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this in the summer to an Arizona address, the item was delivered quickly, but came in a plain envelope- the product was completely melted and leaking into the paper of the  envelope.</li>
            <li>VERRRYYY EARLY WAY AHEAD OF TIME AND ON THE SAME DAY!</li>

            <li> It absorbed easily and brightens old tattoos.  It is not greasy which is a plus.  And it lasts for a while.  I use mine every day granted the tattoos i have are not huge and this tin has lasted me a month already</li>
            <li> The tattoo goo salve was great and came in a sealed package I liked how soothing it was and a little goes a long way with this product</li>
            <li> The Tattoo Goo works Great! A little goes a long way. This is the cheapest I&#x27;ve found. I always put this on my tattoos whenever I go out, everyone notices my artwork. I ordered this in the summer to an Arizona address, the item was delivered quickly, but came in a plain envelope- the product was completely melted and leaking into the paper of the  envelope. Yuck. I just put it in the freezer for a few minutes. Everything turned out well. I suggest just order extra in the winter time to avoid that issue.</li>
            <li> So much better than just using A&amp;D. This stuff works like magic. Promotes the healing process quicker than I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Smells fantastic. Stays in place and keeps a new tattoo moist. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. This container is the perfect size for a medium to large tattoo. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Exactly as descibed and really cheap! I would recommend this for anyone who wants this priductg. the cheapest place you will ever find it.</li>
            <li> Great product! Won&#x27;t use anything else on my tattoos!</li>
            <li> If your an avid lover of tattoo&#x27;s than this is the stuff for you! I heal pretty fast anyways when I get a new tattoo but the &amp;#34;Goo&amp;#34; takes healing to a whole nother level! You know the burn you experience in your skin after your new tattoo is complete? Well Tattoo Goo takes the burn away as well as, making your new body art heal at least a week or so faster. I will always use this product and nothing else because of its natural ingredients and quality as well as, how brilliant my colors remain from using the &amp;#34;Goo&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Best Stuff on Earth for lasting color and great for minor scraps and chapped lips. Smells great! Love the &amp;#34;tin&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Great for daily use!</li>
            <li> IMHO, I feel it works great. Every Tattoo myself and my wife have gotten we have used this (although it seems every artist swears it&#x27;s the worst thing one can use). What we have experienced is reduced healing time, less scabbing and less need for care than alternatives. We have tried using other things and they did not seem to work as well and required far more care than Tattoo Goo. It also revitalizes colors a bit with maintained use, not too oily or greasy with a pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;Although I do not expect the same results for everyone (we all have different skin types/oils) it certainly worth trying and experiencing Tattoo Goo.</li>
            <li> I have a tattoo on my foot that was taking forever to heal. I have used this product ever since I received it. On my new tattoo, as well as on an old one. New one healed, old one brightened up!</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty neat. Just in a week I start to notice a big difference on what it&#x27;s doing to the ink work I had done more ten years ago.</li>
            <li> it was easy to apply an it was soothing to the skin an it seems to brighten the older tattoos as well I will have to order a case the next time I order it</li>
            <li> We always use this on our new and older tattoos.</li>
            <li> BOUGHT THIS SINCE I HAD UPCOMING TATTOOS. I HATED THE A$D OINTMENT OPTION. I ORDERED AND WAS SAD TO THINK IT WOULD GET HERE LATE SINCE I ORDERED LATE AND MY TATTOO DAY CAME.. IT GOT HERE VERRRYYY EARLY WAY AHEAD OF TIME AND ON THE SAME DAY! :) WHEN I OPENED IT, IT SMELLED SO GOOD AND WAS SMOOTH. AFTER MY TATTOOS I APPLIED IT AND ITS REALLY NICE COMPARED TO THE OTHER STUFF. I WILL DEFF BUY MORE OF THIS TO HAVE IN HANDY.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful. We always keep it on hand to use on our new ink.</li>
            <li> It works very well for me, and is the first ointment I ask for after getting a new tattoo.It is very  Soothing &amp; smells great. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to keep some bacatracin on hand as an antibiotic (as well as some A&amp;D ointment for further healing later in the healing process) but I&#x27;ve been very pleased with Tattoo Goo for over a dozen years and over a dozen tattoos.</li>
            <li> It really helps the color stay in and I personally think the healing process is shorter with this. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> great product it disappeared soon after it arrived here i need to replenish my supply it really revives a tattoo i had a couple that are over 20 years old with the goo they have been resurrected.</li>
            <li> Great price, great size for mobility.. Compact size</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  It brings the color out in old and new tattoos.  I would recommend to anyone with ink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 or 4 months and it seems to be working great! I used it during the healing process and I have to say it looks like it preserved the color of my tattoo pretty well I&#x27;m really happy with this item</li>
            <li> It works really good, and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Its a really good buy, and trustworthy. I got this for myself and a friend and was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love it. Its  the best thng ever for my tats. I would tell everyone about it. I use it all the time.</li>
