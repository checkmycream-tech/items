            <li>Love love love this brush</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>It was heathy before the brush use and is still healthy.</li>
            <li>I bought three more.</li>
            <li>Kids love them.</li>
            <li>This is the greatest product for anyone with long hair.</li>
            <li>The difference is his hair is much more fine.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean too!</li>
            <li>Not to mention, they are very gentle on my own hair as well.  </li>
            <li>I had someone use one of these on my at Great Clips the other day, and couldn&#x27;t believe how amazing it was.</li>
            <li>After buying my own set many months ago, I purchased this set as a &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; to my mom and sister who have natural hair.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for little ones!</li>
            <li>I have had one for myself for many years and it has held up pretty well.  </li>
            <li>the brush goes right though hair without getting stuck at all!  </li>
            <li>Just spritz with a bit of water and brush right through!</li>
            <li>The Wet brush not so great.</li>
            <li>Exactly what the product states!  </li>
            <li>So excited to get my own Wet Brush!</li>
            <li>I gave several as gifts and it has become a favorite in the hands of others as well.</li>
            <li>but I think the smaller size travel brush works much better and smoother on tangly hair</li>
            <li>I have long, very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Goes straight through my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser said she can see a difference and that I don&#x27;t have as much breakage.</li>
            <li>I went with this brush first because it seems more intuitive to use, since the shape of the brush is the same as a regular brush.</li>
            <li>I love my wet brush!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is because the brush gets the tangles better or because I am more comfortable brushing my hair when it&#x27;s dry at night before bed, but my tangles seem to have decreased.  </li>
            <li>Mainly works well after their bath</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li>They are so much easier to use on my wiggly 4 year old.  </li>
            <li>I have about 1/4 the amount of hair in my brush as I normally would.  </li>
            <li>The items are brand new</li>
            <li>What a concept!I had so many doubts about whether or not this brush would be different from other brushes.</li>
            <li>You can really tell the difference between this brush and a regular brush.</li>
            <li>I brushed it wet, straight out of the shower and did NOT brush it before shampooing (which I normally would do</li>
            <li>I have such a sensitive scalp, it hurts.  </li>
            <li>However, when is used it all seemed fine until my hair dried then it looked frazzled, damaged, dry, and staticky!</li>
            <li>So if your hair is fine hair--maybe, and if you have thick hair-I advise against this brush!</li>

            <li> So if your hair is fine hair--maybe, and if you have thick hair-I advise against this brush!</li>
            <li> I have to go through it a few times, but the awful sound is less and brushing it more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a little girl this year and will 100% eventually use this brush on her delicate hair! :)</li>
            <li> My husband rather likes his however, and he has long hair too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it on dry hair after I have taken it out of a style for the day.  </li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t like the shape of the curl after it is brushed dry, but I get a lot less frizz and no static-look.  </li>
            <li> It goes through wet (and dry) hair with ease.  </li>
            <li> the pink was metallic and the black didn&#x27;t have the white tips</li>
            <li> I do often brush my hair wet</li>
            <li> Gets out tangles with not much effort and minimal hair breakage.  </li>
            <li> This brush does not work on thick, African American hair.</li>
            <li> It detangles extremely well.</li>
            <li> Now my daughter has one of her own and it;s been the least painful for her to endure.  </li>
            <li> It only works if the hair is thin or straight or if you part the hair in small sections, so no better than any other brush.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve actually cut my hair, even though I prefer it long, just because I was tired of fighting to get a brush through it.  </li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair.</li>
            <li> and now I have TWO Wet Brushes!!!</li>
            <li> This is a softer bristle, so it does not pull hard on your hair when wet.  </li>
            <li> That horrifying sound when your brush a wet tangle was another motivator for trying this brush.  </li>
            <li> Have a daughter with long thin hair.  </li>
            <li> and I usually ended up with a TON of hair in the brush at the end of the ordeal.  </li>
            <li> I always brushed my hair when it&#x27;s wet, but I read bad things about it.  </li>
            <li> If I brush it when it&#x27;s dry, it frizzes out, stands up like it&#x27;s statically charged, and looks pretty awful.  </li>
            <li> It all goes different directions and it tangles like crazy.  </li>
            <li> The amount of hair I lose in the shower has also decreased.  </li>
            <li> It was a long, tedious, painful process</li>
            <li> The only bad thing was deciding which colors to buy!  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong to doubt.</li>
            <li> I hated it.</li>

            <li> Good build quality, works well.</li>
            <li> These are great for tangles. Goes straight through my hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is really amazing! I bought it for me and one for a gift for my niece. You can really tell the difference between this brush and a regular brush.</li>
            <li> I have long, very fine hair.  In the past, I&#x27;ve actually cut my hair, even though I prefer it long, just because I was tired of fighting to get a brush through it.  It was a long, tedious, painful process and I usually ended up with a TON of hair in the brush at the end of the ordeal.  Till now!  This is the best hairbrush I have ever used in my 54 years on earth.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.  I have about 1/4 the amount of hair in my brush as I normally would.  I brushed it wet, straight out of the shower and did NOT brush it before shampooing (which I normally would do but, I wanted to give this a good test).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they never stop making this brush!!</li>
            <li> I have wavy to curly hair.  It all goes different directions and it tangles like crazy.  If I brush it when it&#x27;s dry, it frizzes out, stands up like it&#x27;s statically charged, and looks pretty awful.  I always brushed my hair when it&#x27;s wet, but I read bad things about it.  That horrifying sound when your brush a wet tangle was another motivator for trying this brush.  I love it! I have to go through it a few times, but the awful sound is less and brushing it more comfortable.  I&#x27;ve tried it on dry hair after I have taken it out of a style for the day.  I still don&#x27;t like the shape of the curl after it is brushed dry, but I get a lot less frizz and no static-look.  It smooths the hair very nicely.  I don&#x27;t know if it is because the brush gets the tangles better or because I am more comfortable brushing my hair when it&#x27;s dry at night before bed, but my tangles seem to have decreased.  The amount of hair I lose in the shower has also decreased.  I am looking to try the Tangle Teezer, soon, and will update this review when I have tried them both.  I went with this brush first because it seems more intuitive to use, since the shape of the brush is the same as a regular brush.</li>
            <li> Love love love this brush</li>
            <li> Bought these for all of the women in my family! They don&#x27;t hurt when you pull them through tangles! I&#x27;m having a little girl this year and will 100% eventually use this brush on her delicate hair! :)</li>
            <li> I love my wet brush!  I have bought one for each one of us in the family. They all kept stealing mine!  This is a softer bristle, so it does not pull hard on your hair when wet.  It detangles extremely well. I have such a sensitive scalp, it hurts.  This keeps me from wincing when I am brushing my hair after washing it.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. My hair dresser said she can see a difference and that I don&#x27;t have as much breakage.</li>
            <li> This is now my go to brush because it is the best I&#x27;ve ever used!  I gave several as gifts and it has become a favorite in the hands of others as well.</li>
            <li> The Wet brush not so great. I have very long and thick hair. It was heathy before the brush use and is still healthy. I do often brush my hair wet so I thought this was made for me! However, when is used it all seemed fine until my hair dried then it looked frazzled, damaged, dry, and staticky! I hated it. My husband rather likes his however, and he has long hair too. The difference is his hair is much more fine. So if your hair is fine hair--maybe, and if you have thick hair-I advise against this brush!</li>
            <li> ●▬☆★☆▬。。。A+++ ♥ A+++。。。▬☆★☆▬●</li>
            <li> Only brushes my daughter and I will use now! Easy to clean too!</li>
            <li> A great brush and product but I think the smaller size travel brush works much better and smoother on tangly hair</li>
            <li> This brush does not work on thick, African American hair. It only works if the hair is thin or straight or if you part the hair in small sections, so no better than any other brush.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes.  One for wife, one for daughter.  Great value!</li>
            <li> Product not as appeared- the pink was metallic and the black didn&#x27;t have the white tips</li>
            <li> Too proud of their name, get the shark or conair!</li>
            <li> I almost bought the infomercial one until I saw reviews for this one on Amazon...it truly is amazing!  2 girls with knots every day...the brush goes right though hair without getting stuck at all!  Just spritz with a bit of water and brush right through!</li>
            <li> Perfect Brush Set! After buying my own set many months ago, I purchased this set as a &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; to my mom and sister who have natural hair.  It goes through wet (and dry) hair with ease.  Gets out tangles with not much effort and minimal hair breakage.  Exactly what the product states!  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.  The only bad thing was deciding which colors to buy!  Awesome color choices!</li>
            <li> The product purpose is actually the purpose. What a concept!I had so many doubts about whether or not this brush would be different from other brushes. I was wrong to doubt. The brush works amazing.  I do have color treated hair so it does tend to tangle and with this brush I can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s tangled! I bought three more. And I&#x27;ll give to my niece mother and sister for Christmas!</li>
            <li> Kids love them. I bought two. One for each girl. Mainly works well after their bath</li>
            <li> Perfect for little ones!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest product for anyone with long hair.</li>
            <li> So excited to get my own Wet Brush! I had someone use one of these on my at Great Clips the other day, and couldn&#x27;t believe how amazing it was. I rushed home and ordered this set. It was a great price and although it didn&#x27;t have Prime shipping, it was free, and still got here in under a week. The items are brand new and now I have TWO Wet Brushes!!!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!  They are so much easier to use on my wiggly 4 year old.  Not to mention, they are very gentle on my own hair as well.  I have had one for myself for many years and it has held up pretty well.  Now my daughter has one of her own and it;s been the least painful for her to endure.  LOVE!</li>
            <li> Have a daughter with long thin hair.  She hates to have her hair brushed.  These are great.  Helps keep her painfree.</li>
