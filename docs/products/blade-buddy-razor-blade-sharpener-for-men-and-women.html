            <li>Best invention ever for razors!</li>
            <li>it is amazing!!!</li>
            <li>This is awesome!!!  </li>
            <li>Amazing customer service!!!</li>
            <li>Used the product as described and receive a great shave afterwards.</li>
            <li>Instead I use liquid hand soap and a splash of water, works great.</li>
            <li>Seems to work great....</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, I think it does help.  </li>
            <li>I read the good reviews before I purchased the Blade Buddy</li>
            <li>It does work, just not quite as effectively as I anticipated.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to report it works and the positive reviews were correct.</li>
            <li>maybe he will learn to love it....</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking the better their shave and their blades.</li>
            <li>two weeks before knicks, cuts and pulls would prevent me from using them any more.  </li>
            <li>just make sure you use a shaving gel with it.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work best if you wet the surface of the blade buddy.</li>
            <li>It took me a year to purchase and my reasoning was confirmed.</li>
            <li>Buy it and enjoy stroking it in the shower before you shave.</li>
            <li>And I am delighted I gifted him something that actually worked!</li>
            <li>When I am done, I swipe it 10 another times to clean it for storage..</li>
            <li>I read many reviews before purchasing and had some high expectations, i admit.  </li>
            <li>I swipe with a pretty good amount of pressure, about the same pressure when grating cheese.</li>
            <li>That said, the Blade Buddy (though it requires  consistent maintenance) seems to keep the blade I am using clean.</li>
            <li>swipe it 15-20 times right before I shave.</li>
            <li>In life if something is too good to be true, it usually is.</li>
            <li>I use the Blade Buddy first</li>
            <li>I was hoping for the miraculous stories of 3-6 mos of use, but hey will take it ;)  </li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve started using it even before the first shave.  </li>
            <li>It would certainly take some magnifying and intense record keeping to see if this item does what it claims.</li>
            <li>Do you realize how much money one saves???</li>
            <li>I hope so as when you get it it doesn&#x27;t look like much.  </li>
            <li>must say, this really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it works and that is all that really matters.  </li>
            <li>Every shave is almost as good as the first, and the blades will last you at least 3 times longer using this thing.</li>
            <li>highly recommended</li>
            <li>DO highly recommend this Blade Buddy for you.  </li>
            <li>I went out and purchased top of the line blades to use with the Blade Buddy and after two months there has been no significant change in the longevity(sharpness) of the blades being used.</li>
            <li>I put in a new blade on my shick 5 blades razor on March 16.</li>
            <li>and it is like I just put in a new blade.  </li>
            <li>so I just start a new blade.  </li>
            <li>Yes... it works pretty well and my blades are lasting longer.  </li>
            <li>So now I spend less than $2/month on blades and keep a baby smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I received the Blade Buddy yesterday, and was surprised when I opened the package and saw something that looked and felt like a piece of rubber.  </li>
            <li>I took my 2 week old razor blade and proceeded to sharpen it in accordance with the instructions.  </li>
            <li>I was completely amazed</li>
            <li>when I shaved, it was as sharp as the day I first started using this razor</li>

            <li> I took my 2 week old razor blade and proceeded to sharpen it in accordance with the instructions.  </li>
            <li> I was completely amazed</li>
            <li> when I shaved, it was as sharp as the day I first started using this razor</li>
            <li> I used my old blade that I have been stretching out for some time now with other techniques.</li>
            <li> and the razor is not good as new it is still working, It has been 7 weeks compared to the normal 2,</li>
            <li> It will have to be tested for a few months then compared to a new blade to see if the BBRBS works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I had a different one that I&#x27;ve used for years that finally gave in to the ravages of time, so I decided to buy this one because I thought it was basically the same (just a little cheaper).</li>
            <li> Normally I would have gone through at least 3-4 blades.  </li>
            <li> Since beginning to use this product a few weeks ago, he is still using the same razor blade.  </li>
            <li> One change I made was I stopped using shaving cream on the blade buddy as I had to re-apply after every other swipe.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First time I started using this I waited until the blade began to dull and it lasted a second week.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why they made this two pieces - as it is, it&#x27;s a pain in the butt to try and sharpen the razor because when you push the razor up against the little black rubber(ish) piece it immediately slides out of the larger black plastic case.  </li>
            <li> At that point I start to notice a slight deterioration in efficiency</li>
            <li> I am very hard on blades too, only shave a couple of times a week, heavy beard, and I shave my head.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband as a xmas present, as he was going through a five pack of expensive razor blades every couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> It seems silly enough, but it just does.</li>
            <li> Now I get at least 4 weeks out of a blade.  </li>
            <li> I seriously would not recommend this product for anyone.</li>
            <li> After a week a blade becomes painful and requires replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> maybe he will learn to love it....</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband as a xmas present, as he was going through a five pack of expensive razor blades every couple of weeks.  Since beginning to use this product a few weeks ago, he is still using the same razor blade.  He is in awe of this product.  And I am delighted I gifted him something that actually worked!</li>
            <li> have had this for 2 months and am on the same razor blade.</li>
            <li> Yes... it works pretty well and my blades are lasting longer.  It probably paid for itself already.</li>
            <li> Best invention ever for razors! It made my Razors last about 3 months. I got one for my brother and my dad and they are experiencing the same results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the same disposable razor cartilage for 3 months! It seems to work best if you wet the surface of the blade buddy. This product is genius.</li>
            <li> well I was dubiuusi Thought it was like the blade pyramid back in the 70&#x27;s. I put in a new blade on my shick 5 blades razor on March 16. It is now May 5th and the razor is not good as new it is still working, It has been 7 weeks compared to the normal 2,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for 5 years...it is amazing!!! I change blades about every 11 weeks...Do you realize how much money one saves??? I actually think the blade feels sharper after you hone it...Don&#x27;t miss this product!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the same razor blade (I Use the second most expensive from the Gillette company) for the</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about the product. I am glad to be wrong. I used my old blade that I have been stretching out for some time now with other techniques. Used the product as described and receive a great shave afterwards. I would recommend this to anyone looking the better their shave and their blades. I use Schick Hydro 5. I am purchasing another one to keep in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> It would certainly take some magnifying and intense record keeping to see if this item does what it claims. That said, the Blade Buddy (though it requires  consistent maintenance) seems to keep the blade I am using clean. It will have to be tested for a few months then compared to a new blade to see if the BBRBS works as advertised. We are in April 2015; I will check back with you in August 2015.</li>
            <li> This is awesome!!!  I have used the same blade for the last 2.5 months, unheard of prior to using the Blade Buddy.  Normally I would have gone through at least 3-4 blades.  I am very hard on blades too, only shave a couple of times a week, heavy beard, and I shave my head.  Every time I shave I use the Blade Buddy first and it is like I just put in a new blade.  At this rate, I don&#x27;t know when I will need to change blades...</li>
            <li> I seriously would not recommend this product for anyone. It took me a year to purchase and my reasoning was confirmed. I went out and purchased top of the line blades to use with the Blade Buddy and after two months there has been no significant change in the longevity(sharpness) of the blades being used. Rubbing blades on rubber does nothing to align or sharpen blades (PERIOD).....</li>
            <li> I read many reviews before purchasing and had some high expectations, i admit.  It does work, just not quite as effectively as I anticipated.  I shave both my face and head daily.  Before blades would last me approx. two weeks before knicks, cuts and pulls would prevent me from using them any more.  I can now use the blade for 4 weeks, so yes it does extend the life of the blades.  I was hoping for the miraculous stories of 3-6 mos of use, but hey will take it ;)  One change I made was I stopped using shaving cream on the blade buddy as I had to re-apply after every other swipe.  Instead I use liquid hand soap and a splash of water, works great.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I think it does help.  I hope so as when you get it it doesn&#x27;t look like much.  just make sure you use a shaving gel with it.  One question would be why are the colors so different in price.</li>
            <li> Wife bought it for me and this present was a home run.  I shave daily and have coarse hair.  After a week a blade becomes painful and requires replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time I started using this I waited until the blade began to dull and it lasted a second week.  Since then I&#x27;ve started using it even before the first shave.  Now I get at least 4 weeks out of a blade.  At that point I start to notice a slight deterioration in efficiency so I just start a new blade.  So now I spend less than $2/month on blades and keep a baby smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I have a baby face. I shave once every 1 or two weeks. so I guess I&#x27;m no &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the same Gillette 4 razor since I bought this on Jan 12, 2015. that&#x27;s basically 6 months.. uncalled for right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, this really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swipe it 15-20 times right before I shave. When I am done, I swipe it 10 another times to clean it for storage.. I swipe with a pretty good amount of pressure, about the same pressure when grating cheese.</li>
            <li> Amazing customer service!!! highly recommended</li>
            <li> I received the Blade Buddy yesterday, and was surprised when I opened the package and saw something that looked and felt like a piece of rubber.  I took my 2 week old razor blade and proceeded to sharpen it in accordance with the instructions.  I was completely amazed when I shaved, it was as sharp as the day I first started using this razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO highly recommend this Blade Buddy for you.  It works well, just as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Wrye / Crestview, FL</li>
            <li> I had a different one that I&#x27;ve used for years that finally gave in to the ravages of time, so I decided to buy this one because I thought it was basically the same (just a little cheaper). I should have known - stick with what you know. Not sure why they made this two pieces - as it is, it&#x27;s a pain in the butt to try and sharpen the razor because when you push the razor up against the little black rubber(ish) piece it immediately slides out of the larger black plastic case.  It doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s reversible either, so I can&#x27;t figure out any reason why they made it this way. I&#x27;m probably just going to glue it in and be done with it, but I definitely wish I bought another of the all-one-piece sharpeners and I will not ever buy this again.</li>
            <li> Seems to work great....I have no idea how but it works and that is all that really matters.  I read the good reviews before I purchased the Blade Buddy but I doubted them.  After using it and the same blade for about a month now (prior to using the Blade Buddy I was changing blades once a week) I am happy to report it works and the positive reviews were correct.</li>
            <li> In life if something is too good to be true, it usually is. This is not the case with this product. The thing just works. It seems silly enough, but it just does. Every shave is almost as good as the first, and the blades will last you at least 3 times longer using this thing. Buy it and enjoy stroking it in the shower before you shave.</li>
