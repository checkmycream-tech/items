            <li>powder has a very nice light smell.  </li>

            <li>Cannot find it at the drugstore anymore and am quite pleased that it is available online.</li>
            <li>Great old timey scent.</li>
            <li>I love this, I collect vintage beauty products and I was so excited to hear they were still making this product.</li>
            <li>This powder isn&#x27;t an easy item to find in stores.  </li>
            <li>Too Strong.</li>
            <li>The wife liked this very much.</li>
            <li>Its such a beautiful scent, as I remembered it,  </li>
            <li>It is not too sweet or overwhelming.  </li>

            <li>Its a light scent.</li>
            <li>With her recent passing it greatly reminded my mother of her.</li>
            <li>Still the same great packaging.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it after an evening bath.  </li>
            <li>Feels smooth and light on skin.</li>
            <li>Velvety soft and smells so good.</li>
            <li>Celebrities such as Lucile Ball loved wearing the perfume and this powder, but many celebrities did not just her.</li>
            <li>The powder is a very fine quality and the scent is pure springtime.</li>
            <li>She was excited to get, remembered the smell.</li>
            <li>I bought this as an alternative to my usual baby powder, and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>My first love wore that!&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve also heard &amp;#34;my</li>
            <li>I always get the original.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find a logical on-line source for this product.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased (as well as surprised) to receive this product today, and its fragrance is true to what I remember years ago.  </li>
            <li>How can you not love this powder, lovely sent great price.  </li>
            <li>This was purchased for my mother who has loved White Shoulders (she is in her mid-80&#x27;s) since she was a teenager in the 1940&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It is a good cross between a floral and a powdery smell.  </li>
            <li>This is a light and fresh scent.</li>
            <li>This powder reminds me of the sweet comfort of my mothers arms.</li>
            <li>WHO RECEIVED IT LOVED IT, ESPECIALLY SINCE I HAD A POWDER PUFF</li>
            <li>And such a good price</li>
            <li>Nice big puff makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>The box stores nicely on my vanity and is easy to open and close.</li>
            <li>She has been using the same brand for many, many years and is not looking to change any time soon.</li>
            <li>I like the size, meaning it won&#x27;t run out too quickly.</li>
            <li>This was okay, but it did not smell the same as I remember from many years ago.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>My mother is absolutely thrilled, as she could never afford this on Social Security.  </li>
            <li>White Shoulders is her favorite perfume!</li>
            <li>The container is a pretty pink color, and will look very nice on your vanity.</li>
            <li>but it seems to have just a hint of something I&#x27;m not crazy about.  </li>
            <li>There is a plastic resealable pull top inside the pink top to rest your powder puff on when not in use.</li>
            <li>Harder to find powder, good deal</li>
            <li>This is a golden oldie</li>
            <li>it gave me a fresh feeling after showers.  </li>
            <li>The scent is just right, smelling of orchid, jasmine, and gardenia.</li>
            <li>I loved the classic, subtle scent and others must too because back then people were always telling me how great I smelled.  </li>
            <li>If I use any other bath powder everyone notices that I just don&#x27;t smell quite the same, a good smell but not the White Shoulders smell, so I keep a good supply in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Soft, feminine, and light.</li>
            <li>I love my white shoulders powder.</li>
            <li>Its exactly as pictured/described.</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY recommended to buy here:)  </li>
            <li>I also love the smell, but if you go to the exclusive dept. stores, you are going to spend $40.00 on the tiny perfume bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love the White Shoulder powder and parfume scent.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift for several of my friends and they all love the smell and feel of this powder.  </li>
            <li>will get more of these for gifts next year!</li>
            <li>I love White Shoulders.</li>
            <li>Joseph wife writes: The first time I used white shoulders, I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>Then, I logged into Amazon.com and found the very thing I had been looking for!</li>
            <li>Mission accomplished!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t sweat we mist ;)</li>
            <li>I love White Shoulders and always will.</li>
            <li>big chunks in the powder like it was stored in a very damp place, even though the top was sealed.</li>
            <li>this powder I stay smelling lovely all day long</li>
            <li>All of the white flower fragrances, which, I&#x27;ve found, spark lovely memories in the older generations.  </li>
            <li>I adore the pretty pink box, and the adorable puff.  </li>
            <li>My mom loves this stuff and since my father passed it has been up to me to get it for her for certain occasions.</li>
            <li>-- my nose is 25 years older now! --</li>
            <li>And NO it is NOT for old ladies!! ; )</li>
            <li>She absolutely  loves it.</li>
            <li>so it has a very \\&quot;nostalgic\\&quot; smell to me.  </li>
            <li>I felt very feminine wearing this.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t care of it as much as I thought it would --</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>My Mom absolutely adores the powder and uses it every day.</li>
            <li>I buy this product every Christmas for my friend who absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>my favorite in the whole wide solar system!</li>
            <li>I am thoroughly enjoying my walk down memory lane.</li>
            <li>The scent is very delicate and pleasant.</li>
            <li>This is the same soft pink plastic box that I remember and the same beautiful smell.  </li>
            <li>Keep you dry and silky smooth all day long.&lt;br /&gt;Girls</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had older gentlemen say...</li>
            <li>Now that I am getting older</li>
            <li>Love this product , wish it were a little less pricey but am grateful to be able to find it...</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this powder.</li>
            <li>I love the box I use it to hold jewelery or little trinkets.</li>
            <li>Very feminine, young but with a vintage flair.  </li>
            <li>The round top screws on and is embossed.  </li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite but not many stores carry the full line of White Shoulders.  </li>
            <li>It does not smell like I remember &amp;#34; White Shoulders &amp;#34; as a young teen-ager ...not as sweet or something .</li>
            <li>The puff is fluffy and sweet, probably about 3&amp;#34;, just right for those &amp;#34;underneath&amp;#34; areas.</li>
            <li>As someone else said the puff is too small otherwise ok</li>
            <li>Ok so I&#x27;m sentimental.</li>
            <li>It would be so much nicer if the scent were more subtle.</li>
            <li>To be honest, there is nothing wrong with the product, but there isn&#x27;t much choice out there!</li>
            <li>From a product point if view it is a pretty pink plastic container with a fluffy powder puff and a good quantity of loose powder in the container.</li>
            <li>White Shoulders is such a pretty scent!</li>
            <li>White Shoulders reminds me of my mother, and  I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s timeless and not a heavy scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes me feel like a glamorous old fashioned movie star putting it on after a luxurious bath.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell of White Shoulders not just for myself</li>
            <li>This bath powder is my very favorite--and has been the only one I have used for years--Happy to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit old fashion</li>
            <li>I remember it from when I was young</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering and lingers just enough, but not too much</li>
            <li>When it was opened the first time there was loose powder all over everywhere.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say I don&#x27;t think it smells exactly the same as it did way back when.  </li>
            <li>White Shoulders is a classic fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love White Shoulders, and this dusting powder is hard to find, now.</li>
            <li>not only is it a good product but its Nostalgic and a</li>
            <li>I thought this was a small thing and was surprised to see that it was more than I expected.</li>
            <li>I bought this to go along with the large bottle of White Shoulders cologne and the tiny perfume bottle of White Shoulders all for $40.00 on Amazon.com!!!  </li>
            <li>Her boyfriend loves it too, apparently.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and  is exactly as expected.</li>
            <li>This is a hard to find items in the stores &amp; I was excited to find it.</li>
            <li>It was packaged well, nothing was damaged and there was no loose powder in the box.</li>
            <li>A light dusting of scented powder with a discreet spritz of matching cologne creates a subtle fragrance that lingers for hours.</li>
            <li>As someone else said, the powder puff is a little small but fits nicely in the box when it is closed.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> the prices are good.</li>
            <li> I guess this is good because then the powder is not flying everywhere when you puff.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend says my skin smells so good.</li>
            <li> She really loved the scent.  </li>
            <li> very nice and just as I remember it from 40 years ago, very pleasant and brings back some wonderful memories.</li>
            <li> The powder smells wonderful and the lovely container top screws shut to stop powder spills.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful powder--will be back for more!!!  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and I will continue to use this when I run out.</li>
            <li> So happy to be able to get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> A great deal :-)</li>
            <li> I bought the Eau Du Perfume too, and am very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect silky feel right after a shower.</li>
            <li> For instance, most sellers on e-bay wanted this amount or more for 2 oz of this bath powder!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my Mother will love this as part of her Christmas gift this year!!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love the smell!</li>

            <li> This box comes with a nice puff</li>
            <li> It has a kind of musty smell to me .</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and the smell lingers through the day.</li>
            <li> powder has a very nice light smell.  </li>
            <li> The powder isn&#x27;t too strongly scented so it provides just a lovely hint of honeysuckle that makes me happy</li>
            <li> This is a beautifully packaged, beautifully scented product, clean vivid florals with a powdery softness.  </li>
            <li> The gardenia and jasmine come through beautifully on me, and this powder is very effective at keeping areas silky and dry</li>
            <li> This powder has a lovely fragrance and the quality of the powder is very fine.  </li>
            <li> Amazing how your sense of smell is so strong.</li>
            <li> If you like dusting powder, you&#x27;ll love this.  </li>
            <li> Lovely container for the dressing table.</li>
            <li> and I think that she will love it.</li>
            <li> If there were a contest to see who gave the best present at Christmas, I&#x27;d have won.  </li>
            <li> This powder is so nice to have a light scent on your skin after a shower, before going out in the summer heat.  </li>
            <li> This is my Mother&#x27;s favorite dusting powder, and I buy it through Amazon for her.  </li>
            <li> The scent in this powder is almost overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it again.</li>
            <li> Lots of powder and lovely scent.</li>
            <li> My favorite powder fragrance.</li>
            <li> always a favorite for mom</li>
            <li> Love the feel and the scent.</li>
            <li> What more can one say?</li>

            <li> Love this body powder ,glad to be able to purchase without having to get the perfume which I don&#x27;t go through as quickly</li>
            <li> Cannot find it at the drugstore anymore and am quite pleased that it is available online.</li>
            <li> Great old timey scent.</li>
            <li> I love this, I collect vintage beauty products and I was so excited to hear they were still making this product.</li>
            <li> This powder isn&#x27;t an easy item to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> Too Strong.</li>
            <li> The wife liked this very much.</li>
            <li> Its such a beautiful scent, as I remembered it,  </li>
            <li> It is not too sweet or overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic, so nice for hot summer days, a dusting of this scented powder.</li>
            <li> The powder arrived quickly &amp; met all my expectations!</li>
            <li> It smelled fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Its a light scent.</li>
            <li> With her recent passing it greatly reminded my mother of her.</li>
            <li> Still the same great packaging.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it after an evening bath.  </li>
            <li> Feels smooth and light on skin.</li>
            <li> Velvety soft and smells so good.</li>
            <li> Celebrities such as Lucile Ball loved wearing the perfume and this powder, but many celebrities did not just her.</li>
            <li> The powder is a very fine quality and the scent is pure springtime.</li>
            <li> She was excited to get, remembered the smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to my usual baby powder, and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> My first love wore that!&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve also heard &amp;#34;my</li>
            <li> I always get the original.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find a logical on-line source for this product.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased (as well as surprised) to receive this product today, and its fragrance is true to what I remember years ago.  </li>
            <li> How can you not love this powder, lovely sent great price.  </li>
            <li> This was purchased for my mother who has loved White Shoulders (she is in her mid-80&#x27;s) since she was a teenager in the 1940&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It is a good cross between a floral and a powdery smell.  </li>
            <li> This is a light and fresh scent.</li>
            <li> This powder reminds me of the sweet comfort of my mothers arms.</li>
            <li> WHO RECEIVED IT LOVED IT, ESPECIALLY SINCE I HAD A POWDER PUFF</li>
            <li> And such a good price</li>
            <li> Nice big puff makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> The box stores nicely on my vanity and is easy to open and close.</li>
            <li> She has been using the same brand for many, many years and is not looking to change any time soon.</li>
            <li> I like the size, meaning it won&#x27;t run out too quickly.</li>
            <li> This was okay, but it did not smell the same as I remember from many years ago.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> My mother is absolutely thrilled, as she could never afford this on Social Security.  </li>
            <li> White Shoulders is her favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> The container is a pretty pink color, and will look very nice on your vanity.</li>
            <li> but it seems to have just a hint of something I&#x27;m not crazy about.  </li>
            <li> There is a plastic resealable pull top inside the pink top to rest your powder puff on when not in use.</li>
            <li> Harder to find powder, good deal</li>
            <li> This is a golden oldie</li>
            <li> it gave me a fresh feeling after showers.  </li>
            <li> The scent is just right, smelling of orchid, jasmine, and gardenia.</li>
            <li> I loved the classic, subtle scent and others must too because back then people were always telling me how great I smelled.  </li>
            <li> If I use any other bath powder everyone notices that I just don&#x27;t smell quite the same, a good smell but not the White Shoulders smell, so I keep a good supply in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Soft, feminine, and light.</li>
            <li> I love my white shoulders powder.</li>
            <li> Its exactly as pictured/described.</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY recommended to buy here:)  </li>
            <li> I also love the smell, but if you go to the exclusive dept. stores, you are going to spend $40.00 on the tiny perfume bottle.  </li>
            <li> I love the White Shoulder powder and parfume scent.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for several of my friends and they all love the smell and feel of this powder.  </li>
            <li> will get more of these for gifts next year!</li>
            <li> I love White Shoulders.</li>
            <li> Joseph wife writes: The first time I used white shoulders, I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> Then, I logged into Amazon.com and found the very thing I had been looking for!</li>
            <li> Mission accomplished!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t sweat we mist ;)</li>
            <li> I love White Shoulders and always will.</li>
            <li> big chunks in the powder like it was stored in a very damp place, even though the top was sealed.</li>
            <li> this powder I stay smelling lovely all day long</li>
            <li> All of the white flower fragrances, which, I&#x27;ve found, spark lovely memories in the older generations.  </li>
            <li> I adore the pretty pink box, and the adorable puff.  </li>
            <li> My mom loves this stuff and since my father passed it has been up to me to get it for her for certain occasions.</li>
            <li> -- my nose is 25 years older now! --</li>
            <li> And NO it is NOT for old ladies!! ; )</li>
            <li> She absolutely  loves it.</li>
            <li> so it has a very \\&quot;nostalgic\\&quot; smell to me.  </li>
            <li> I felt very feminine wearing this.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t care of it as much as I thought it would --</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> My Mom absolutely adores the powder and uses it every day.</li>
            <li> I buy this product every Christmas for my friend who absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> my favorite in the whole wide solar system!</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly enjoying my walk down memory lane.</li>
            <li> The scent is very delicate and pleasant.</li>
            <li> This is the same soft pink plastic box that I remember and the same beautiful smell.  </li>
            <li> Keep you dry and silky smooth all day long.&lt;br /&gt;Girls</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had older gentlemen say...</li>
            <li> Now that I am getting older</li>
            <li> Love this product , wish it were a little less pricey but am grateful to be able to find it...</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this powder.</li>
            <li> I love the box I use it to hold jewelery or little trinkets.</li>
            <li> Very feminine, young but with a vintage flair.  </li>
            <li> The round top screws on and is embossed.  </li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite but not many stores carry the full line of White Shoulders.  </li>
            <li> It does not smell like I remember &amp;#34; White Shoulders &amp;#34; as a young teen-ager ...not as sweet or something .</li>
            <li> The puff is fluffy and sweet, probably about 3&amp;#34;, just right for those &amp;#34;underneath&amp;#34; areas.</li>
            <li> As someone else said the puff is too small otherwise ok</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;m sentimental.</li>
            <li> It would be so much nicer if the scent were more subtle.</li>
            <li> To be honest, there is nothing wrong with the product, but there isn&#x27;t much choice out there!</li>
            <li> From a product point if view it is a pretty pink plastic container with a fluffy powder puff and a good quantity of loose powder in the container.</li>
            <li> White Shoulders is such a pretty scent!</li>
            <li> White Shoulders reminds me of my mother, and  I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s timeless and not a heavy scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes me feel like a glamorous old fashioned movie star putting it on after a luxurious bath.  </li>
            <li> I really like the smell of White Shoulders not just for myself</li>
            <li> This bath powder is my very favorite--and has been the only one I have used for years--Happy to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit old fashion</li>
            <li> I remember it from when I was young</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering and lingers just enough, but not too much</li>
            <li> When it was opened the first time there was loose powder all over everywhere.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say I don&#x27;t think it smells exactly the same as it did way back when.  </li>
            <li> White Shoulders is a classic fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love White Shoulders, and this dusting powder is hard to find, now.</li>
            <li> not only is it a good product but its Nostalgic and a</li>
            <li> I thought this was a small thing and was surprised to see that it was more than I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go along with the large bottle of White Shoulders cologne and the tiny perfume bottle of White Shoulders all for $40.00 on Amazon.com!!!  </li>
            <li> Her boyfriend loves it too, apparently.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and  is exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find items in the stores &amp; I was excited to find it.</li>
            <li> It was packaged well, nothing was damaged and there was no loose powder in the box.</li>
            <li> A light dusting of scented powder with a discreet spritz of matching cologne creates a subtle fragrance that lingers for hours.</li>
            <li> As someone else said, the powder puff is a little small but fits nicely in the box when it is closed.  </li>
            <li> While I usually hate odors and would never wear perfume so as not to annoy others, the very slight scent imparted by this powder, is perfectly acceptable to me and others never even seem to notice.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit sweet, hints of flower, with a depth of maybe a slight musk or wood, not sure.  </li>
            <li> which won&#x27;t be anytime soon judging from how long it seems to last.</li>
            <li> I will buy White Shoulders as long as they make it.  </li>
            <li> White Shoulders is an older, hard to find product.  </li>
            <li> It also arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I purchased these products for a resident at a long term care facility who was celebrating her 100th birthday.  </li>
            <li> I have used the perfume for a long time(still working).  </li>
            <li> The powder puff is small, but I focus on my pulse points to powder with this: back of knees, , waist, inner arms, neck.  </li>
            <li> smell bad -- just not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Came just in time as my other box was nearly empty.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I will be a repeat customer, as I use this powder every day after showers and it doesn&#x27;t interfer with my other fragrances.</li>
            <li> I mix it with unscented powder to tone it down.  </li>
            <li> I wish the powder puff was bigger, it is very small.</li>
            <li> The price was a lot less than what you would pay elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This is by a imitation manufacturer and a deception!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found that if I use a little bit of vanilla lotion with it...</li>
            <li> A big hit with Grandma for Mother&#x27;s Day - very hard to find in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Hands down!</li>
            <li> The bath powder complements the cologne I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> not even the small print.</li>
            <li> The powder puff was a bit small.</li>
            <li> The puff is small but the opening of the container is small as well.</li>
            <li> was hard to find this my mother loves it</li>
            <li> Too bad those old fashion ideas aren&#x27;t around anymore.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of the past and I like to use this after soaking in the tub!</li>
            <li> I still like it, but its not perfect.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a difficult time finding it in stores</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the scent.</li>
            <li> But I was disappointed in the shipping.</li>
            <li> Annoying to have to do that.  </li>

            <li> Lovely container for the dressing table.</li>
            <li> This is a gift for my boyfriend&#x27;s grandmother and I think that she will love it. It was packaged well, nothing was damaged and there was no loose powder in the box. It also arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> The powders are nice as powders go. I wish the powder puff was bigger, it is very small. To be honest, there is nothing wrong with the product, but there isn&#x27;t much choice out there!</li>

            <li> Disappointed in the scent. Too Strong.</li>
            <li> Everything as promised, although I prefer old-style powder boxes that had a larger powder puff. This box comes with a nice puff it&#x27;s not much larger than a face powder puff..</li>
            <li> White Shoulders is an older, hard to find product.  I get it for my mother.  She loves the fact that I can get it delivered to our home.</li>
            <li> Soft, feminine, and light. Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased these products for a resident at a long term care facility who was celebrating her 100th birthday.  White Shoulders is her favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> my favorite in the whole wide solar system! truly!</li>
            <li> I always used this powder in college and when I ran across it a while back, I just couldn&#x27;t resist.  While I usually hate odors and would never wear perfume so as not to annoy others, the very slight scent imparted by this powder, is perfectly acceptable to me and others never even seem to notice.  As someone else said, the powder puff is a little small but fits nicely in the box when it is closed.  This is the same soft pink plastic box that I remember and the same beautiful smell.  I am thoroughly enjoying my walk down memory lane.</li>
            <li> I love my white shoulders powder. The delivery was 2 days ahead of the scheduled date. I am very satisfied and I will continue to use this when I run out.</li>
            <li> My mom would buy this all the time from May Company.  She hadn&#x27;t seen it anywhere in decades, and I found it on Amazon.  Got her the dusting powder, powder puff included, for Christmas.  If there were a contest to see who gave the best present at Christmas, I&#x27;d have won.  Hands down!</li>
            <li> White Shoulders reminds me of my mother, and  I really like it.  Cannot find it at the drugstore anymore and am quite pleased that it is available online.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to get this powder by mail.  This type of shopping (by mail) was a pleasure for me.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in the time span stated.  Love the smell!</li>
            <li> was hard to find this my mother loves it</li>
            <li> My grandmother wore White Shoulders, my mother wore White Shoulders, I wore White Shoulders when I was a teenager.  I loved the classic, subtle scent and others must too because back then people were always telling me how great I smelled.  I bought the bath powder for myself this Christmas and I have to say I don&#x27;t think it smells exactly the same as it did way back when.  Maybe its me -- my nose is 25 years older now! -- but it seems to have just a hint of something I&#x27;m not crazy about.  I wish it was as I remembered.  I still like it, but its not perfect.  Darn!</li>
            <li> They shipped very quickly and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.  I wish they supplied a bigger powder puff, however.  They used to be a bit larger!  I will be a repeat customer, as I use this powder every day after showers and it doesn&#x27;t interfer with my other fragrances.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother. Its exactly as pictured/described. Thank you! I may buy some for myself next time! YEAH!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this fragrance, even as a child.  My sister used it so I used hers.  It&#x27;s timeless and not a heavy scent. It&#x27;s a bit sweet, hints of flower, with a depth of maybe a slight musk or wood, not sure.  This powder is so nice to have a light scent on your skin after a shower, before going out in the summer heat.  It won&#x27;t choke you or others around you...nor will you sneeze or cough.  I am literally allergic to some scents, or it could be from the amount some use of it.  This scent never bothered me.  The powder puff is small, but I focus on my pulse points to powder with this: back of knees, , waist, inner arms, neck.  The round top screws on and is embossed.  There is a plastic resealable pull top inside the pink top to rest your powder puff on when not in use.</li>
            <li> I remember my Mother use to wear this when I was growing up...so it has a very \\&quot;nostalgic\\&quot; smell to me.  I didn&#x27;t even think they made this powder anymore until I came across it here on Amazon &amp; at a GREAT price!!  For instance, most sellers on e-bay wanted this amount or more for 2 oz of this bath powder!!  DEFINITELY recommended to buy here:)  I&#x27;m sure my Mother will love this as part of her Christmas gift this year!!</li>
            <li> This is my Mother&#x27;s favorite dusting powder, and I buy it through Amazon for her.  I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because she loves it!</li>
            <li> Mom loves her gift. Harder to find powder, good deal</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Excellent service</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my mother who has loved White Shoulders (she is in her mid-80&#x27;s) since she was a teenager in the 1940&#x27;s.  I also love the smell, but if you go to the exclusive dept. stores, you are going to spend $40.00 on the tiny perfume bottle.  I bought this to go along with the large bottle of White Shoulders cologne and the tiny perfume bottle of White Shoulders all for $40.00 on Amazon.com!!!  My mother is absolutely thrilled, as she could never afford this on Social Security.  She can&#x27;t believe what a value I found on Amazon.com.  Great value.</li>
            <li> The scent in this powder is almost overwhelming.  I mix it with unscented powder to tone it down.  Annoying to have to do that.  It would be so much nicer if the scent were more subtle.</li>
            <li> This is not White Shoulders and the name EVYAN is not on the box or container anywhere...not even the small print. This is by a imitation manufacturer and a deception!</li>
            <li> Mom loves this fragrance but could not find it in the stores anymore. She was excited to get, remembered the smell.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mother and she loved it.  She like the Wal-Mart alternative as well.  So unless she asks for it, we won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Love this body powder ,glad to be able to purchase without having to get the perfume which I don&#x27;t go through as quickly</li>
            <li> I love the White Shoulder powder and parfume scent.  Its such a beautiful scent, as I remembered it,  I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it again.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite but not many stores carry the full line of White Shoulders.  I have had to make several stops to find any of the White Shoulders products.  It was a relief for me to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> What a lovely dusting powder! The scent is just right, smelling of orchid, jasmine, and gardenia. The puff is fluffy and sweet, probably about 3&amp;#34;, just right for those &amp;#34;underneath&amp;#34; areas. I felt very feminine wearing this. The container is a pretty pink color, and will look very nice on your vanity. I bought this as an alternative to my usual baby powder, and am very happy with it. This does contain talc.</li>
            <li> Great old timey scent. Nice big puff makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> The powder arrived quickly &amp; met all my expectations! This is a hard to find items in the stores &amp; I was excited to find it.</li>
            <li> It does not smell like I remember &amp;#34; White Shoulders &amp;#34; as a young teen-ager ...not as sweet or something . It has a kind of musty smell to me .</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for several of my friends and they all love the smell and feel of this powder.  They like the look of the container it comes in too.</li>
            <li> Lots of powder and lovely scent. It&#x27;s silky and feminine. The box stores nicely on my vanity and is easy to open and close.</li>
            <li> Came just in time as my other box was nearly empty.  My favorite powder fragrance.</li>
            <li> As someone else said the puff is too small otherwise ok</li>
            <li> Very nice classic smell. My mother loves it</li>
            <li> always a favorite for mom</li>
            <li> always a good buy for my wife</li>
            <li> Have used for over 65 years. Of course it&#x27;s great to me</li>
            <li> What can I say...it&#x27;s White Shoulders!  All of the white flower fragrances, which, I&#x27;ve found, spark lovely memories in the older generations.  They remember it but just can&#x27;t place it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had older gentlemen say...&amp;#34;Oh, what is that perfume? My first love wore that!&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve also heard &amp;#34;my mother/sister wore that&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White Shoulders is the ultimate in femininity, which is a rarity these days.</li>
            <li> Great product. Wife loves it. At a very good price</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister for her birthday. She loved it! Her boyfriend loves it too, apparently. Pretty packaging and wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> White Shoulders Bath Powder is a necessity for me each and every day.  If I use any other bath powder everyone notices that I just don&#x27;t smell quite the same, a good smell but not the White Shoulders smell, so I keep a good supply in the bathroom.  The scent is very delicate and pleasant.</li>
            <li> White Shoulders is such a pretty scent! I bought it as a gift. Now I wouldn&#x27;t mind getting one for myself at some point!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift. It was packaged very nicely, smelled wonderful.</li>
            <li> old product line which is special and wonderful!</li>
            <li> Love White Shoulders, and this dusting powder is hard to find, now. So happy to be able to get it on Amazon. Shipped fast and  is exactly as expected. A great deal :-)</li>
            <li> Bought for Grandma, she loves it and I now want some for myself.  The fragrance is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and the scent.The price is also great!</li>
            <li> I buy White Shoulders for my wife.  She loves it and it does smell good on her .  I always get the original.</li>
            <li> This is a beautifully packaged, beautifully scented product, clean vivid florals with a powdery softness.  Very feminine, young but with a vintage flair.  I adore the pretty pink box, and the adorable puff.  I bought the Eau Du Perfume too, and am very pleased with my purchase.  The gardenia and jasmine come through beautifully on me, and this powder is very effective at keeping areas silky and dry (we all have those areas, don&#x27;t we?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes me feel like a glamorous old fashioned movie star putting it on after a luxurious bath.  Definitely a scent and product for all ages (I&#x27;m only 23)</li>
            <li> The bath powder complements the cologne I use it everyday.  I love the box I use it to hold jewelery or little trinkets.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of White Shoulders not just for myself but it reminds me of my Mom.  It is a good cross between a floral and a powdery smell.  It is not too sweet or overwhelming.  And NO it is NOT for old ladies!! ; )</li>
            <li> This was a very nice gift to give as a birthday gift.  It smelled fantastic.  The powder puff was a bit small.</li>
            <li> my mother loves this fragrance and her birthday is just around the corner. This is a light and fresh scent.</li>
            <li> What more can one say? Beautiful powder and puff, wonderful scent!&lt;br /&gt;I will get more of these for gifts next year!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t care of it as much as I thought it would -- but that&#x27;s me -- kinda picky&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smell bad -- just not my favorite.  Its a light scent.</li>
            <li> This bath powder is my very favorite--and has been the only one I have used for years--Happy to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I like the size, meaning it won&#x27;t run out too quickly. The scent is great</li>
            <li> I love White Shoulders. The scent is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother for Christmas and she loved it. It was the same product that my grandmother use to use. With her recent passing it greatly reminded my mother of her. Still the same great packaging. I thought this was a small thing and was surprised to see that it was more than I expected. Great deal! 8oz for only $15 dollars!! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of the past and I like to use this after soaking in the tub! Delivery was good and product in great shape. Thanks.</li>
            <li> have used product for fifty years and quality is unwavering</li>
            <li> My mom loves this stuff and since my father passed it has been up to me to get it for her for certain occasions. It&#x27;s a bit old fashion but it is so comforting of a smell. I remember it from when I was young and I still love the smell of it. Now that I am getting older I may just switch to it myself. My mom has told me that her Aunt use to tell her that a woman never leaves the house without a proper powdering. Too bad those old fashion ideas aren&#x27;t around anymore. The world would be a much better smelling place!</li>
            <li> This was okay, but it did not smell the same as I remember from many years ago. I will probably not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Good vendor service. Good value product.</li>
            <li> big chunks in the powder like it was stored in a very damp place, even though the top was sealed. Not the best product.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my moms birthday and she absolutely loved this.  This powder isn&#x27;t an easy item to find in stores.  I was so pleased to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price</li>
            <li> My Mom used to use this and I just love the fragrance.  It&#x27;s not overpowering and lingers just enough, but not too much</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother and she loved it! I&#x27;ve had a difficult time finding it in stores so this was a great find for me!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom. She has been using it for years and loves it. I loved the price and service.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter. She loves it. But I was disappointed in the shipping. When it was opened the first time there was loose powder all over everywhere.  As if it had been opened before and perhaps returned.  Don&#x27;t think I will do this again.</li>
            <li> purchased as a gift and she loves it</li>
            <li> Wonderful powder--will be back for more!!!  Thank you :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My wife was wearing White Shoulders when I met her over 40 years ago.  She loves this scent and so do I.  Love it that Amazon carries it and the prices are good.</li>
            <li> The powder smells wonderful and the lovely container top screws shut to stop powder spills.  Love the puff too.  I&#x27;ve ordered more to give as gifts.  Everyone seems to like White Shoulders.</li>
            <li> This is a golden oldie but it still smells great and blends with my body chemicals.  I&#x27;ve worn White Shoulders for 100 years.  Ok...not 100, just seems like it.  Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;ve used it perhaps 50 years.  A little goes a long way and I&#x27;ve found that if I use a little bit of vanilla lotion with it...I get all kinds of great compliments.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, beautiful, lovely scent. The powder isn&#x27;t too strongly scented so it provides just a lovely hint of honeysuckle that makes me happy all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes mix it with some Zeasorb AF to make that smell nicer, too.</li>
            <li> My Wife has used White Shoulders bath powder for years and loves it.  I was pleased to find a logical on-line source for this product.</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;m sentimental. But isn&#x27;t that one of the pleasures of our sense of smell? This powder reminds me of the sweet comfort of my mothers arms. I do miss her. But enough of that. From a product point if view it is a pretty pink plastic container with a fluffy powder puff and a good quantity of loose powder in the container. I&#x27;ll be buying more when it runs out - which won&#x27;t be anytime soon judging from how long it seems to last.</li>
            <li> very nice and just as I remember it from 40 years ago, very pleasant and brings back some wonderful memories.</li>
            <li> wonderful powder love it!!!!! thank you  A++++++++ seller</li>
            <li> Joseph wife writes: The first time I used white shoulders, I fell in love with it.  I wore it on every date (must have worked). I have used the perfume for a long time(still working).  It is not overpowering. I love the bath powder as well.  A great product for a great price. I will buy White Shoulders as long as they make it.  Thank you Evyan.</li>
            <li> Love this product , wish it were a little less pricey but am grateful to be able to find it...this is not always so unless i go through you.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased (as well as surprised) to receive this product today, and its fragrance is true to what I remember years ago.  I was even more pleased to find it at a good price!</li>
            <li> my mother interrduced white shoulders to my wife 54 years ago and she loves it has been using it ever since</li>
            <li> I looked in every department store within a 50 mile drive and could not find the one thing my Mom asked me for as a Christmas gift! Then, I logged into Amazon.com and found the very thing I had been looking for! My Mom absolutely adores the powder and uses it every day. Mission accomplished!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  it gave me a fresh feeling after showers.  It made me feel like silk.  love it</li>
            <li> Fantastic, so nice for hot summer days, a dusting of this scented powder.</li>
            <li> WHITE SHOULDERS WAS  PURCHASED AS A GIFT AND THE PERSON  WHO RECEIVED IT LOVED IT, ESPECIALLY SINCE I HAD A POWDER PUFF</li>
            <li> I buy this product every Christmas for my friend who absolutely loves it.  It has a nice smell and the smell lingers through the day.</li>
            <li> This powder has a lovely fragrance and the quality of the powder is very fine.  I enjoy using it after an evening bath.  I would order this again as a gift for someone.  The puff is small but the opening of the container is small as well. I guess this is good because then the powder is not flying everywhere when you puff.</li>
            <li> White Shoulders Bath Powder&lt;br /&gt;This powder has a very nice light smell.  Feels smooth and light on skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Mother as a gift. She has had this on her gift list for a while. She is extremely happy with it. I&#x27;m happy with the price.</li>
            <li> I love this, I collect vintage beauty products and I was so excited to hear they were still making this product. Ladies have been wearing this since the 40s . Celebrities such as Lucile Ball loved wearing the perfume and this powder, but many celebrities did not just her. It&#x27;s a perfect silky feel right after a shower. Keep you dry and silky smooth all day long.&lt;br /&gt;Girls don&#x27;t sweat we mist ;)&lt;br /&gt;With this powder I stay smelling lovely all day long ans my boyfriend says my skin smells so good. Trust me not only is it a good product but its Nostalgic and a must have.</li>
            <li> I have looked for this powder for some time and finally found it. I like the powder and the puff.</li>
            <li> Just as I remember it from my grandmother. And such a good price</li>
            <li> White Shoulders is a classic fragrance. When I dust with the powder after a shower, it takes me back to childhood at my grandmother&#x27;s house. Amazing how your sense of smell is so strong. I love White Shoulders and always will.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my aunt for Christmas.  She really loved the scent.  Shipped quickly.  Great gift for her.</li>
            <li> I get this each year for my mothers birthday.  She loves it.  I could go to Walgreens and get it but amazon is always cheaper and i save on tax.</li>
            <li> How can you not love this powder, lovely sent great price.  Nice and silky with a sweet yet not to strong a sent.</li>
