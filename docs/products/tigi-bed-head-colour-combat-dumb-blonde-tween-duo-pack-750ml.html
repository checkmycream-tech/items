            <li>It&#x27;s a great price for a great product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost out of the products now after using it for 2 months and will happily re-order.</li>
            <li>so I figured this would be great too...</li>
            <li>Great value.</li>
            <li>about 5 months lol.</li>
            <li>The product is great though</li>
            <li>Even the smell is off... not as great.</li>
            <li>I have great hair.</li>
            <li>great stuff at a great price.  </li>
            <li>Use brands from the supermarket they&#x27;re much better!!</li>
            <li>This is a great product it just does not have a good smell.</li>
            <li>I loved the stuff and loved the smell.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product, great shampoo and leave in conditioner...perfect for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>Even the 99 cent bottles of suave would be better!</li>
            <li>I really liked the smell so decided to gave it a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does smell nice though.</li>
            <li>the most amazing shampoo iÂ´ve tried&lt;br /&gt;totally recommended</li>
            <li>But these huge bottles are under my sink, almost completely full, not being used and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
            <li>They make my hair feel dirtier than before I washed it.. which isn&#x27;t okay.</li>
            <li>Thankfully I was able to return the shampoo and conditioner to the salon I purchased it from.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE END RESULT -</li>
            <li>The shampoo is fantastic and my hair looks, feels, and smells amazing after using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Bed Head treatment for years and my hair is getting better and better.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>but I still love it.  </li>
            <li>However, there are many varieties of Bed Head that work better than this one.  </li>
            <li>If you were to buy this at your hairdressers or in the store you would pay so much more than you do on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love bedhead products.</li>
            <li>and it smells lovely</li>
            <li>I actually love this stuff.</li>
            <li>There is nothing redeeming about this product.</li>
            <li>Will order more when I run out</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it one star was because it smells incredible, like peachy tangerine.</li>
            <li>It smells incredible, both the shampoo and the conditioner - they have a light fresh tangerine scent, and it leaves my hair very silky to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I guess they took out the old great moisturizers and inserted some color-lasting chemicals instead.  </li>
            <li>I have light brown fine hair.</li>
            <li>and that is a huge savings.</li>
            <li>The hairdresser told me that hair products for \\&quot;color treated hair\\&quot; will work great for anyone who wants more moisture, no matter your natural hair color.</li>
            <li>I used it 2-3 times to make sure I was not crazy.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to go home and use</li>
            <li>he original,</li>
            <li>Smells great but makes your hair feel so greasy and not soft at all.</li>
            <li>After the first use, my hair felt okay</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this product because I found it for a good price and have been a fan of many other Bed Head products.</li>
            <li>tried it that night, I loved the smell, and was so excited to try something that was made for blonde&#x27;s that bleach their hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 2 years and still love it as much now as the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>The only way this could get better is if Amazon adds them to their subscription plan, because I go through these bottles twice a year!</li>
            <li>It is an overwhelming smell too strong for my personal taste</li>
            <li>It could be the result of certain drying hair products I&#x27;m using conflicting with this, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge increase in softness.</li>
            <li>So far, I love it.</li>
            <li>I originally thought I might use it up washing the dogs, but I&#x27;m not cruel enough to use this bad-smelling sticky product on them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m literally almost in tears right now.</li>
            <li>I can comb right thru any tangles with no problem.  </li>
            <li>It smells great but the first time I used this and then dried my hair</li>
            <li>I originally had left a positive review on this product, but then I used it for more than a week.</li>
            <li>First off, if I could have given this product NO STARS, I would have but it didn&#x27;t allow me to do</li>
            <li>I usually love TIGI products, try TIGI BEDHEAD resurrection if you need a ultimate moisture boost.</li>
            <li>The old pink and yellow bottles were a wonderful shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what youd&#x27; think when you hit the order button.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible I&#x27;ve been using incorrect amounts of these products, but I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve the level of softness that my stylist did with them, and that was what I was after with this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now switched to KMS and even though it costs more, it actually works.</li>
            <li>I will say, if your hair is more on the oily side, don&#x27;t get it, because this product, especially the conditioner, is meant to moisturize and help preserve color.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo with a different conditioner and my hair has been better.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is completely fine, and it moisturizes my course, thick hair nicely.</li>
            <li>Love the price, but there must be a new formula for the conditioner, its not the same as before.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of blonde shampoos/conditioners to keep my locks shiny, this is NOT it!</li>
            <li>But the conditioner is a creation straight out of hell.</li>
            <li>really wish I wouldn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>I tried this because I really like TIGI products.</li>
            <li>gave my hair so much volume.</li>
            <li>Even my mom commented on how much healthier my hair looked when I went to visit home.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an affordable hair product that really works wonders for your hair then the company \\&quot;Bed Head\\&quot; is the product to buy.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much of it at all</li>
            <li>Be it straight, wavey, frizzy, treated or otherwise.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and I regret it so much.</li>
            <li>Also, you do not need to use a ton of the conditioner, just a quarter-sized amount in your palm (depending on how much hair you have -</li>
            <li>Well, after a while it started to make my hair oily from time to time which made me really aggravated when it came to straightening it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in the change of bottle.</li>
            <li>Shampoo was good but the conditioner is too thick and slimy feeling.</li>
            <li>Had to use good old garnier to clean the mess tigi left!</li>
            <li>I will agree with most of the other reviewers here.  </li>
            <li>My hair color also stays rich and shiny for the entire time between root touch-ups.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get home and use this shampoo/conditioner especially because of the smell!</li>
            <li>6/2/12:&lt;br /&gt;After several months of using this set and others, I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>The stuff in the pink bottle not only doesn&#x27;t smell as good, but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft and shiny like this does.</li>
            <li>The next time I used it I made sure I got it all out, but the same thing happened.</li>
            <li>Smells good but its deceiving, the shampoo and condition leave such a heavy film in your hair than you can brush it, its literally so sticky your hair mats together.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!!</li>
            <li>So I used a normal amount of shampoo but a conservative amount (quarter size) of the conditioner.</li>
            <li>The conditioner works a lot better than the Paul Mitchell tea tree conditioner (that left my hair really really dry).</li>
            <li>Also, if you use a heavy amount of external (outside-the-shower) hair products, such as gel, mousse, etc., it would be good to first use a clarifying shampoo before using this, or any other shampoo/conditioner, to make sure all products are out of your hair before the regular washing/conditioning process.</li>
            <li>Gotta find a new conditioner:/</li>
            <li>This new formula is just for dyed and bleached blondes.  </li>
            <li>see in the reviews that some people like the new smell.  </li>
            <li>So the location I am in the water makes my hair super dry.</li>
            <li>I used to use this in the pink and yellow bottles and was pleased.</li>
            <li>Even though this has the same \\&quot;Dumb Blonde\\&quot; name, it is NOT the same excellent product that TIGI has produced for years with the shampoo in a purple bottle and the conditioner in a yellow bottle.  </li>
            <li>it feels healthy, thick, and soft!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way better than the pink bottle for my hair, which is very thick, curly and fine.</li>
            <li>I simply blow dried my hair without any other products and my hair looked really full and healthy.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I was using too much of both shampoo and conditioner, so I started using only about a nickel size of both,</li>
            <li>As they are complete trash.</li>
            <li>Bought this shampoo because I like the epic volume set.</li>
            <li>I can only get a comb through it when it&#x27;s really wetand</li>
            <li>If you really have your heart set on clarifying your blonde hair, mix in some baking soda with your shampoo;</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft.  </li>
            <li>so I rewashed my hair a few hours later and made sure to rinse it well.</li>
            <li>These new white bottles with paint-splash decorations also have new formula of shampoo and conditioner inside</li>
            <li>It is very strong and unappealing.  </li>
            <li>I had a smaller bottle of Dumb Blonde shampoo, so when I saw the liters for such a good price I HAD to get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wish they would bring back the old formula!</li>
            <li>I just wrote an email to TIGI yesterday complaining about this product and today I am scouring Amazon looking for the old, better version of Dumb Blonde.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, straight hair, so I need a little more).  </li>
            <li>Before I found this product I tried many other products that always made my hair so dried out and tangled easily, so glad I found Bed Head Dumb Blonde and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I have platinum blonde hair and have had it for over 5 years and nothing has ever made my hair feel soft and Un-damaged like this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Now I have to be careful when I use it because I think if I use too much conditioner is it going to make my hair oily?</li>
            <li>I thought washing it again with my regular shampoo and conditioner would get rid of the buildup and bring my hair back to normal.</li>
            <li>Shampoo seems ok but not great.</li>
            <li>I have also loved the previous dumb blonde and used it for years.</li>
            <li>Why change something that was so good in the first place - really disappointed!</li>

            <li> 6/2/12:&lt;br /&gt;After several months of using this set and others, I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> The stuff in the pink bottle not only doesn&#x27;t smell as good, but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft and shiny like this does.</li>
            <li> The next time I used it I made sure I got it all out, but the same thing happened.</li>
            <li> Smells good but its deceiving, the shampoo and condition leave such a heavy film in your hair than you can brush it, its literally so sticky your hair mats together.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!!</li>
            <li> So I used a normal amount of shampoo but a conservative amount (quarter size) of the conditioner.</li>
            <li> The conditioner works a lot better than the Paul Mitchell tea tree conditioner (that left my hair really really dry).</li>
            <li> Also, if you use a heavy amount of external (outside-the-shower) hair products, such as gel, mousse, etc., it would be good to first use a clarifying shampoo before using this, or any other shampoo/conditioner, to make sure all products are out of your hair before the regular washing/conditioning process.</li>
            <li> Gotta find a new conditioner:/</li>
            <li> This new formula is just for dyed and bleached blondes.  </li>
            <li> see in the reviews that some people like the new smell.  </li>
            <li> So the location I am in the water makes my hair super dry.</li>
            <li> I used to use this in the pink and yellow bottles and was pleased.</li>
            <li> Even though this has the same \\&quot;Dumb Blonde\\&quot; name, it is NOT the same excellent product that TIGI has produced for years with the shampoo in a purple bottle and the conditioner in a yellow bottle.  </li>
            <li> it feels healthy, thick, and soft!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way better than the pink bottle for my hair, which is very thick, curly and fine.</li>
            <li> I simply blow dried my hair without any other products and my hair looked really full and healthy.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I was using too much of both shampoo and conditioner, so I started using only about a nickel size of both,</li>
            <li> As they are complete trash.</li>
            <li> Bought this shampoo because I like the epic volume set.</li>
            <li> I can only get a comb through it when it&#x27;s really wetand</li>
            <li> If you really have your heart set on clarifying your blonde hair, mix in some baking soda with your shampoo;</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft.  </li>
            <li> so I rewashed my hair a few hours later and made sure to rinse it well.</li>
            <li> These new white bottles with paint-splash decorations also have new formula of shampoo and conditioner inside</li>
            <li> It is very strong and unappealing.  </li>
            <li> I had a smaller bottle of Dumb Blonde shampoo, so when I saw the liters for such a good price I HAD to get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish they would bring back the old formula!</li>
            <li> I just wrote an email to TIGI yesterday complaining about this product and today I am scouring Amazon looking for the old, better version of Dumb Blonde.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, straight hair, so I need a little more).  </li>
            <li> Before I found this product I tried many other products that always made my hair so dried out and tangled easily, so glad I found Bed Head Dumb Blonde and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have platinum blonde hair and have had it for over 5 years and nothing has ever made my hair feel soft and Un-damaged like this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Now I have to be careful when I use it because I think if I use too much conditioner is it going to make my hair oily?</li>
            <li> I thought washing it again with my regular shampoo and conditioner would get rid of the buildup and bring my hair back to normal.</li>
            <li> Shampoo seems ok but not great.</li>
            <li> I have also loved the previous dumb blonde and used it for years.</li>
            <li> Why change something that was so good in the first place - really disappointed!</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells delicious and is very thick, but I haven&#x27;t found that it left my hair with any unpleasant residue.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before using this for the first time and noticed a lot of people complained about the \\&quot;waxy film\\&quot; effect it left.</li>
            <li> the only trade-off is it&#x27;s not safe for colored hair, and this set is (although I&#x27;m not sure how much it would really affect blonde dye anyway).</li>
            <li> but maybe if you have thinner, flat hair, you should give this a try!</li>
            <li> Totally a HUGE waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> even though I have long</li>
            <li> I have long, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> Only apply from where your hair separates from the nape of the neck and down, otherwise you&#x27;re likely to get that heaviness</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the same results that other people have been getting.  </li>
            <li> The next day before my shower my hair felt extremely greasy.</li>
            <li> it is very strange.</li>
            <li> But once It is dry (air dry or by blow dryer)</li>
            <li> This left the stickiest, waxiest residue on my hair and left the ends so dried out and crunchy</li>
            <li> /&gt;The old Dumb Blonde shampoo and conditioner (which was for any hair color) left my hair fully moisturized, silky and untangled.  </li>
            <li> I normally do not rinse out 100% of the conditioner I use, because I get a lot of frizz.</li>
            <li> Back down to 3 stars</li>
            <li> I looked for this set after my stylist used the new line of Dumb Blonde products in my hair -- which I found left it bouncy and silky -- and I found the shampoo just a couple weeks ago at a discount store for about half the price of this combo set.  </li>
            <li> I am of asian desent and have naturally black hair.</li>
            <li> I never used the old dumb blonde</li>
            <li> this is not the same as the old dumb blond.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other salon brands and they dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> and I DO NOT suggest anyone buying this unless you like heavy, sticky, gross hair.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair and still GROSS!</li>
            <li> I have thin, naturally straight hair and these two products</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of the pink bottle for years and years.  </li>
            <li> This particular variety called \\&quot;combat dumb blonde\\</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t don&#x27;t don&#x27;t buy the Dumb Blonde in the white bottle.  </li>
            <li> other reviewers spoke of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the other reviewers about these products.  </li>
            <li> When I switched to other products including cheap and expensive ones, my hair just felt dry, porous, and weak...</li>
            <li> It feels silky when you put it in your hair and then......a dry waxy stiff head of hair.</li>
            <li> I feel like I need to use it since this stuff is expensive, however I find myself alternating with another brand so that my hair feels clean at least some of the time.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it smell way too citrusy but it&#x27;s not a nice citrus smell.  </li>
            <li> however I was in for a rude suprised, i can only guess pouring elmers glue all over my hair and trying to rinse it out in the shower would be a comparable experience.</li>
            <li> However, this new formula makes my hair feel gross and dirty.</li>
            <li> Even when I poured this stuff down the sink, I had to SCRUB my sink with Dawn dish soap to the remove the horrid residue.</li>
            <li> Not like the other dumb blonde.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling slightly greasy...</li>
            <li> even when I do I end up ripping out half of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long, platinum hair.</li>
            <li> Felt like my hair was not clean</li>
            <li> I used the Dumb Blonde set once</li>
            <li> Little did I know the nightmare I was in for.</li>
            <li> BedHead&#x27;s dumb blonde has changed!</li>
            <li> Have been using dumb blonde line for years &amp; this was not the quality product I am used to.  </li>
            <li> ; I figured my hair was still a little dried out after having just been highlighted.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still makes hair feel greasy, as if I haven&#x27;t washed it in a few days.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> But, it also leaves a film in your hair and makes your hair feel heavy.</li>
            <li> Made my hair look sticky and heavy.  </li>
            <li> I towel dried it</li>
            <li> This is honestly the worst product I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair</li>
            <li> Unless you want to destroy your hair and your week.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much trouble brushing my damp hair but</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> I complained and tigi are not interested.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make your hair soft and leaves it feeling waxy and dry :(</li>
            <li> I was also very skeptical about it the first few times due to the weird texture of my hair after using both the shampoo and conditioner...</li>
            <li> It was difficult to comb through and even after I did, it still felt gross.</li>
            <li> I purchase, I usually finish it before I get another bottle.</li>
            <li> I just use a small amount.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about $37 per bottle at salons $15 on sale at ulta, usually.</li>
            <li> I hate that I wasted so much money on them, but in the trash they go!</li>
            <li> Hate this new dumb blonde.</li>
            <li> Yesterday I used Matrix Biolage Color Care shampoo and conditioner and the result was so great that it made me realize just how awful this Dumb Blonde product is. :(</li>
            <li> I used the previous dumb blond shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> As with the other reviews, Dumb Blonde leaves your hair feeling sticky and dirty.  </li>
            <li> This new formula in the white bottles is just horrible.  </li>
            <li> After towel drying my hair and getting ready to blow dry and style, I found my hair was just as waxy and disgusting as before, and I couldn&#x27;t even get a comb through it.</li>
            <li> and when I dried my hair it felt waxy and very thick.</li>
            <li> I now have two huge nearly-fully bottles of this terrible product in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this set for at least 8 years.  </li>
            <li> If you were a fan of the old product, do not buy this as you will be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I read other bad reviews, but I don&#x27;t understand them, because I don&#x27;t have any issues with my hair feeling waxy or heavy after using this product.  </li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> I was just overall disappointed with this as the time went on.</li>
            <li> It leaves a nasty waxy film in my hair and when it&#x27;s dry my hair doesn&#x27;t feel conditioned at all- just really dry and waxy.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel heavy and dirty.  </li>
            <li> If anything this product has made my hair exponentially worse.</li>
            <li> Conditioner dispenser pump was broken.</li>
            <li> conditioner is kinda weird and real thick sticks to the shower like glue.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s for the worse!</li>
            <li> After the third use though, my hair felt nasty.</li>
            <li> Conditioner leaves a greasy, annoying substance in hair that makes it appear that you haven&#x27;t washed your hair in a few days!</li>
            <li> It was matted down, putting my fingers through it felt terrible.</li>
            <li> It was so bad that it started clogging up my shower drain.</li>
            <li> &quot; is bad.</li>
            <li> Was so bad I had to throw conditioner away.  </li>
            <li> In fact, no one should buy it because anyone would be disappointed with this.  </li>
            <li> But I made that mistake once with this crap, and my hair looked like I had not showered in over a month.</li>
            <li> I hate it.  </li>
            <li> and I still can&#x27;t get this crap out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Almost indescribaably bad!</li>
            <li> This is the WORST shampoo I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Horrible Horrible Horrible.</li>
            <li> However, the condition is terrible.</li>
            <li> Worst shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> it is awful.  </li>
            <li> The WORST shampoo and conditioner Ive ever tried.</li>
            <li> It would always leave my hair greasy and nasty feelings.</li>
            <li> This is the WORST hair product ever.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo and conditioner, and my hair came out absolutely disgusting.</li>
            <li> My hair is so nasty feeling.</li>
            <li> Worst bed head products ever!</li>
            <li> TIGI changed there formula the conditioner is horrible!</li>
            <li> Awful, awful product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I originally had left a positive review on this product, but then I used it for more than a week. The shampoo is completely fine, and it moisturizes my course, thick hair nicely. But the conditioner is a creation straight out of hell. I cannot believe they sell this garbage. It leaves a residue in your hair like I have never felt before. It almost feels like I melted plastic and then poured it onto my hair. Even after repeated rinses, this conditioner will NOT wash out. I normally do not rinse out 100% of the conditioner I use, because I get a lot of frizz. But I made that mistake once with this crap, and my hair looked like I had not showered in over a month. Stay away from this product, folks. Even when I poured this stuff down the sink, I had to SCRUB my sink with Dawn dish soap to the remove the horrid residue.</li>
            <li> I had a smaller bottle of Dumb Blonde shampoo, so when I saw the liters for such a good price I HAD to get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish I wouldn&#x27;t have. They make my hair feel dirtier than before I washed it.. which isn&#x27;t okay. I thought maybe I was using too much of both shampoo and conditioner, so I started using only about a nickel size of both, even though I have long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still makes hair feel greasy, as if I haven&#x27;t washed it in a few days. Have to use a clarifying shampoo every so often to remove the \\&quot;gunk\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> First off, if I could have given this product NO STARS, I would have but it didn&#x27;t allow me to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought this product I was so excited to go home and use it.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it that night, I loved the smell, and was so excited to try something that was made for blonde&#x27;s that bleach their hair. I have thick, long, platinum hair. The next morning I woke up and my hair felt like it was stuck together. It was difficult to comb through and even after I did, it still felt gross. I figured I just hadn&#x27;t gotten all the conditioner out. The next time I used it I made sure I got it all out, but the same thing happened. I tried it a third time and it was just so gross I couldn&#x27;t stand it. Even if I&#x27;m not fond of the shampoo and conditioner I purchase, I usually finish it before I get another bottle. But these huge bottles are under my sink, almost completely full, not being used and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy. This is the WORST shampoo I have ever bought. I&#x27;m so dissapointed with the results and I DO NOT suggest anyone buying this unless you like heavy, sticky, gross hair. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I tried this because I really like TIGI products. BIG MISTAKE!!! The only reason I gave it one star was because it smells incredible, like peachy tangerine. It feels silky when you put it in your hair and then......a dry waxy stiff head of hair. Almost indescribaably bad! It feels waxy and sticky and when you try and brush it your hair breaks off! Totally a HUGE waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> Shampoo was good but the conditioner is too thick and slimy feeling. Left my hair feeling like I didn&#x27;t rinse it out.</li>
            <li> Scent, texture, weight, and overall conditioning effect are different than the original yellow bottled Tigi for dumb blondes conditioner .Dont make the mistake of trying it.</li>
            <li> Not like the other dumb blonde. Smells good but its deceiving, the shampoo and condition leave such a heavy film in your hair than you can brush it, its literally so sticky your hair mats together. Not a good product. I usually love TIGI products, try TIGI BEDHEAD resurrection if you need a ultimate moisture boost. That is awesome</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo for my hair!</li>
            <li> Horrible Horrible Horrible. It smells great but the first time I used this and then dried my hair it felt gross. I thought maybe I didn&#x27;t wash it all out so I rewashed my hair a few hours later and made sure to rinse it well. Dried my hair and still GROSS! Thankfully I was able to return the shampoo and conditioner to the salon I purchased it from.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from my salon after my Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo/conditioner ran out. I am of asian desent and have naturally black hair. The hairdresser told me that hair products for \\&quot;color treated hair\\&quot; will work great for anyone who wants more moisture, no matter your natural hair color. I really liked the smell so decided to gave it a try. I read the reviews before using this for the first time and noticed a lot of people complained about the \\&quot;waxy film\\&quot; effect it left. So I used a normal amount of shampoo but a conservative amount (quarter size) of the conditioner. I LOVE THE END RESULT - I have thin, naturally straight hair and these two products gave my hair so much volume. I simply blow dried my hair without any other products and my hair looked really full and healthy. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with a waxy film or residues. The conditioner works a lot better than the Paul Mitchell tea tree conditioner (that left my hair really really dry). Even my mom commented on how much healthier my hair looked when I went to visit home. I&#x27;m almost out of the products now after using it for 2 months and will happily re-order. I never used the old dumb blonde so I can&#x27;t comment on that. I can understand how this product may not work for those with thicker or curly hair but maybe if you have thinner, flat hair, you should give this a try!</li>
            <li> So the location I am in the water makes my hair super dry. This conditioner i leave in like a mask and it works wonders</li>
            <li> The shampoo is fantastic and my hair looks, feels, and smells amazing after using it. However, the condition is terrible. It leaves my hair feeling slightly greasy...it is very strange. I recommend getting the shampoo by itself and going with another conditioner.</li>
            <li> Worst shampoo I have ever used.  Felt like my hair was not clean, felt like a film was on my hair. Even after 3 washes with another shampoo it felt like this is still on there. It was so bad that it started clogging up my shower drain. I wish I didnt even have to give this review 1 star.</li>
            <li> I used the previous dumb blond shampoo and conditioner so I figured this would be great too...it is awful.  It makes your hair feel heavy and dirty.  Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> I have also loved the previous dumb blonde and used it for years. So it&#x27;s such a shame that the product has been changed. Gotta find a new conditioner:/</li>
            <li> This is a great product it just does not have a good smell. It is an overwhelming smell too strong for my personal taste</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t don&#x27;t don&#x27;t buy the Dumb Blonde in the white bottle.  I have been a fan of the pink bottle for years and years.  I loved the stuff and loved the smell.  Now, in 2012 I bought the white and I cannot stand the smell!  I can&#x27;t wait to get rid of it!  I hate it.  I just did my research and I am switching to Redken Blonde Glam.  Tigi, you messed up with this white bottle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Bed Head treatment for years and my hair is getting better and better. I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I don&#x27;t get the same results that other people have been getting.  It is different fromt he original, but I still love it.  I just use a small amount.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an affordable hair product that really works wonders for your hair then the company \\&quot;Bed Head\\&quot; is the product to buy.  You don&#x27;t have to use much of it at all and that is a huge savings. However, there are many varieties of Bed Head that work better than this one.  This particular variety called \\&quot;combat dumb blonde\\&quot; is bad. Not only does it smell way too citrusy but it&#x27;s not a nice citrus smell.  But, it also leaves a film in your hair and makes your hair feel heavy. As if you didn&#x27;t get all of the product out of your hair. Didn&#x27;t care for it at all. I&#x27;m going back to using the Bed Head red bottle #3. It&#x27;s the best for all types of hair. Be it straight, wavey, frizzy, treated or otherwise. If you were to buy this at your hairdressers or in the store you would pay so much more than you do on Amazon. Great value.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try dumb blonde however I was in for a rude suprised, i can only guess pouring elmers glue all over my hair and trying to rinse it out in the shower would be a comparable experience. The WORST shampoo and conditioner Ive ever tried. Even the 99 cent bottles of suave would be better! Could baraly brush out my hair infact alot of it ripped out while trying. Made my hair look sticky and heavy.  These products need to be disconued. As they are complete trash.</li>
            <li> I love bedhead products. And have been using them for years. I went blonde so I thought that this would be perfect for me. But it was not. It felt as though the product would never rinse out. It would always leave my hair greasy and nasty feelings. I used it 2-3 times to make sure I was not crazy. Then gave it to my mom thinking maybe its just my hair type. Did the same thing to hers, so she threw it out.</li>
            <li> Love the price, but there must be a new formula for the conditioner, its not the same as before.  Wish they would bring back the old formula!</li>
            <li> Bought this shampoo because I like the epic volume set. I have highlighted hair and wanted something to keep my color. I used the Dumb Blonde set once and when I dried my hair it felt waxy and very thick. The next day before my shower my hair felt extremely greasy. I will be returning this set where I bought it. So happy I have the receipt!</li>
            <li> I will agree with most of the other reviewers here.  The old pink and yellow bottles were a wonderful shampoo and conditioner.  This new formula in the white bottles is just horrible.  It leaves a nasty waxy film in my hair and when it&#x27;s dry my hair doesn&#x27;t feel conditioned at all- just really dry and waxy.  I feel like I need to use it since this stuff is expensive, however I find myself alternating with another brand so that my hair feels clean at least some of the time.  I hope tigi fixes this- as is I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I have platinum blonde hair and have had it for over 5 years and nothing has ever made my hair feel soft and Un-damaged like this shampoo and conditioner. It&#x27;s about $37 per bottle at salons $15 on sale at ulta, usually. It&#x27;s a great price for a great product! I was also very skeptical about it the first few times due to the weird texture of my hair after using both the shampoo and conditioner... But once It is dry (air dry or by blow dryer) it feels healthy, thick, and soft! When I switched to other products including cheap and expensive ones, my hair just felt dry, porous, and weak... I highly recommend this. Also it last for about 5 months lol.</li>
            <li> I had been buying these bottles at my local salon for about $25 each before I decided to see if Amazon had them. To my surprise, they did, and at about $25 for both, a DEAL! They smell/work/etc the same as the bottles I&#x27;ve gotten in the salons. They came with no damage/etc. Exactly what youd&#x27; think when you hit the order button. The only way this could get better is if Amazon adds them to their subscription plan, because I go through these bottles twice a year!</li>
            <li> Item as described. Thanks.</li>
            <li> From the description, I thought I was getting 2 shampoos not a shampoo and conditioner.  The product is great though</li>
            <li> When I decided to try this product I thought it might save my dying, overprocessed, bleached hair. Little did I know the nightmare I was in for. This left the stickiest, waxiest residue on my hair and left the ends so dried out and crunchy it looked like tumbleweed. I thought washing it again with my regular shampoo and conditioner would get rid of the buildup and bring my hair back to normal. I was wrong. After towel drying my hair and getting ready to blow dry and style, I found my hair was just as waxy and disgusting as before, and I couldn&#x27;t even get a comb through it. I tried washing it again with Neutrogena clarifying shampoo FOUR TIMES to no avail. Tonight I brought out the big guns and used Dawn dish washing detergent. I towel dried it and I still had a ton of buildup. Just now I shampooed the bejesus out of it several times AGAIN with a combination of the Neutrogena shampoo and the Dawn and I still can&#x27;t get this crap out of my hair. I can only get a comb through it when it&#x27;s really wetand even when I do I end up ripping out half of my hair. If anything this product has made my hair exponentially worse. I&#x27;m literally almost in tears right now. I don&#x27;t know what to do to get this stuff out of my hair. It just won&#x27;t come out! This is honestly the worst product I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair and I regret it so much. If I could find the person who formulated it I would probably punch them in the face. I&#x27;m so upset about it. Whatever you do DO NOT buy this product!!!!!!! Unless you want to destroy your hair and your week.</li>
            <li> I looked for this set after my stylist used the new line of Dumb Blonde products in my hair -- which I found left it bouncy and silky -- and I found the shampoo just a couple weeks ago at a discount store for about half the price of this combo set.  So far, I love it. The shampoo smells delicious and is very thick, but I haven&#x27;t found that it left my hair with any unpleasant residue. I just purchased a bottle of the conditioner and expect I will upgrade this review to five stars when I&#x27;ve tried it out on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Got the conditioner, moving this up to four stars. It could be the result of certain drying hair products I&#x27;m using conflicting with this, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge increase in softness. However, I do like it and it smells lovely -- just don&#x27;t put it on your roots! Only apply from where your hair separates from the nape of the neck and down, otherwise you&#x27;re likely to get that heaviness other reviewers spoke of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/2/12:&lt;br /&gt;After several months of using this set and others, I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s nothing special. I actually prefer my John Frieda Root Awakening set, which would cost about 1/3 what this does.  If you really have your heart set on clarifying your blonde hair, mix in some baking soda with your shampoo; the only trade-off is it&#x27;s not safe for colored hair, and this set is (although I&#x27;m not sure how much it would really affect blonde dye anyway). It&#x27;s possible I&#x27;ve been using incorrect amounts of these products, but I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve the level of softness that my stylist did with them, and that was what I was after with this. Back down to 3 stars it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell nice though.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the other reviewers about these products.  I didn&#x27;t have much trouble brushing my damp hair but while blow-drying, I could feel a waxy film.  I thought \\&quot;I must have forgotten to rinse my conditioner out!\\&quot; so I rinsed it again.  Still had a sticky, waxy feeling (like Barbie hair).  I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I used to use this in the pink and yellow bottles and was pleased. However, this new formula makes my hair feel gross and dirty. What a waste. I&#x27;ve now switched to KMS and even though it costs more, it actually works. I&#x27;m sticking to quality!</li>
            <li> I actually love this stuff. It&#x27;s way better than the pink bottle for my hair, which is very thick, curly and fine. The stuff in the pink bottle not only doesn&#x27;t smell as good, but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft and shiny like this does.</li>
            <li> BedHead&#x27;s dumb blonde has changed! And it&#x27;s for the worse! Conditioner leaves a greasy, annoying substance in hair that makes it appear that you haven&#x27;t washed your hair in a few days! Even the smell is off... not as great. Hate this new dumb blonde. Definitely would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 years and still love it as much now as the first time I used it.  It smells incredible, both the shampoo and the conditioner - they have a light fresh tangerine scent, and it leaves my hair very silky to the touch.  My hair color also stays rich and shiny for the entire time between root touch-ups.  I read other bad reviews, but I don&#x27;t understand them, because I don&#x27;t have any issues with my hair feeling waxy or heavy after using this product.  I will say, if your hair is more on the oily side, don&#x27;t get it, because this product, especially the conditioner, is meant to moisturize and help preserve color.  Also, you do not need to use a ton of the conditioner, just a quarter-sized amount in your palm (depending on how much hair you have - I have thick, straight hair, so I need a little more).  Also, if you use a heavy amount of external (outside-the-shower) hair products, such as gel, mousse, etc., it would be good to first use a clarifying shampoo before using this, or any other shampoo/conditioner, to make sure all products are out of your hair before the regular washing/conditioning process.</li>
            <li> the most amazing shampoo iÂ´ve tried&lt;br /&gt;totally recommended</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, great shampoo and leave in conditioner...perfect for color treated hair.  The fragrance is wonderful!  Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> This is the WORST hair product ever. I have great hair. I can go days without washing it and it never looks or feels oily/greasy. I used this shampoo and conditioner, and my hair came out absolutely disgusting. It felt like it had been weeks since I had washed it last. It was matted down, putting my fingers through it felt terrible. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! I am a huge fan of blonde shampoos/conditioners to keep my locks shiny, this is NOT it! BEWARE!!! I only gave it 1 star, because it wouldn&#x27;t let me put zero stars. There is nothing redeeming about this product.</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy this product.  As with the other reviews, Dumb Blonde leaves your hair feeling sticky and dirty.  Now I know why it was on sale at the local hair salon....</li>
            <li> Do not buy this! My hair is so nasty feeling. Smells great but makes your hair feel so greasy and not soft at all. Worst bed head products ever!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get home and use this shampoo/conditioner especially because of the smell! Well, after a while it started to make my hair oily from time to time which made me really aggravated when it came to straightening it. Now I have to be careful when I use it because I think if I use too much conditioner is it going to make my hair oily? And after I straightened my hair, I could not smell the shampoo scent anymore (which I can&#x27;t stand). I was just overall disappointed with this as the time went on.</li>
            <li> I have long, color-treated hair. It makes my hair feel moisturized and managable.  I can comb right thru any tangles with no problem.  I don&#x27;t know why people are saying it makes their hair feel sticky or greasy, I have never had that problem.  My hair feels soft.  Before I found this product I tried many other products that always made my hair so dried out and tangled easily, so glad I found Bed Head Dumb Blonde and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> conditioner is kinda weird and real thick sticks to the shower like glue. dont remember it being like that. But it makes my hair blonde i like it</li>
            <li> I did not see that this was for conditioner AND shampoo. The listing just said&lt;br /&gt;shampoo. I can&#x27;t use the conditioner and I am out the money.</li>
            <li> Conditioner dispenser pump was broken. Have been using dumb blonde line for years &amp; this was not the quality product I am used to.  Bottle markings were different, it was labeled color protectant. Conditioner left a waxy coating on hair.  Hair seemed brittle.  Was so bad I had to throw conditioner away.  Shampoo seems ok but not great.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product because I found it for a good price and have been a fan of many other Bed Head products. After the first use, my hair felt okay; I figured my hair was still a little dried out after having just been highlighted. After the second use, my hair felt sticky, but I thought maybe I forgot to rinse out the conditioner. After the third use though, my hair felt nasty. It reminded me of when I was a kid and tried to brush all the knots out of Barbie&#x27;s ratted plastic hair, but could never get all the tangles out. I have been using this shampoo with a different conditioner and my hair has been better. Yesterday I used Matrix Biolage Color Care shampoo and conditioner and the result was so great that it made me realize just how awful this Dumb Blonde product is. :(</li>
            <li> this is not the same as the old dumb blond. TIGI changed there formula the conditioner is horrible! it doesn&#x27;t make your hair soft and leaves it feeling waxy and dry :(</li>
            <li> What on earth have you done to my favourite conditioner - the smell is off and the product just not the same.  Why change something that was so good in the first place - really disappointed!</li>
            <li> great stuff at a great price.  My hair looks and feels wonderful using T&amp;G products.  Will order more when I run out</li>
            <li> I have been using this set for at least 8 years.  I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in the change of bottle. I&#x27;ve tried other salon brands and they dry my hair out. I have light brown fine hair. I highlight my hair in the summer</li>
            <li> Awful, awful product. If I could give 0 stars I would. Left my hair greasy and knotty. Had to use good old garnier to clean the mess tigi left! I complained and tigi are not interested. Do not waste your money!! Use brands from the supermarket they&#x27;re much better!!</li>
            <li> I just wrote an email to TIGI yesterday complaining about this product and today I am scouring Amazon looking for the old, better version of Dumb Blonde.  Even though this has the same \\&quot;Dumb Blonde\\&quot; name, it is NOT the same excellent product that TIGI has produced for years with the shampoo in a purple bottle and the conditioner in a yellow bottle.  These new white bottles with paint-splash decorations also have new formula of shampoo and conditioner inside and they are TERRIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old Dumb Blonde shampoo and conditioner (which was for any hair color) left my hair fully moisturized, silky and untangled.  This new formula is just for dyed and bleached blondes.  I guess they took out the old great moisturizers and inserted some color-lasting chemicals instead.  If you were a fan of the old product, do not buy this as you will be disappointed.  In fact, no one should buy it because anyone would be disappointed with this.  This left my hair tangled and sticky, like hay covered in Elmer&#x27;s glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see in the reviews that some people like the new smell.  I do not.  It is very strong and unappealing.  I now have two huge nearly-fully bottles of this terrible product in my bathroom.  I originally thought I might use it up washing the dogs, but I&#x27;m not cruel enough to use this bad-smelling sticky product on them.  I hate that I wasted so much money on them, but in the trash they go!</li>
