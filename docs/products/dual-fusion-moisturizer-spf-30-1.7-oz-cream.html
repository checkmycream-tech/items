            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>Best Spf AND Moisturizer thus far!!!</li>
            <li>I have combo skin and could never find a good enough moisturizer that tends to both skin types perfectly.</li>
            <li>Light, absorbs right in and feels great!</li>
            <li>This product was recommended in a magazine as a gel moisturizer with sunscreen suitable for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Very light fragrance, nothing overpowering or noticeable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an interesting concept nonetheless.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the Best SPF Facial Lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin feeling softer and happier, and even has some qualities that make the skin tone look clearer and more even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your face greasy like most face lotions I have used  </li>
            <li>I  have aging skin and have used many products.  </li>
            <li>I also love the refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>Even better it has a combined sun block.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m better not putting anything on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather apply a separate sunscreen that I know penetrates the skin &amp; then apply Biore&#x27;s Overnight Moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love this SPF.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I bought a moisturizer/sunscreen in a dual formula (Neutrogena) that many friends had recommended when I ran out of Biore.</li>
            <li>So far it has been great.</li>
            <li>Also, it can help with acne and reduce scarring, which is a huge issue for me.  </li>
            <li>Anyway i tried tapping the bottle lightly as suggested to get both pumps to work but that didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s oil free and non-comedogenic(won&#x27;t clog pores).</li>
            <li>It says PABA free on the box.</li>
            <li>Its so light and does not feel greasy on your face.  </li>
            <li>SPF is SO IMPORTANT and your face is exposed to the sun always.  </li>
            <li>This one is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizer is light and non-irritating.</li>
            <li>As long as I can get it on line I will be happy.  </li>
            <li>I love this whole line!  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s important to wear sunscreen daily as I am fair with freckles(which</li>
            <li>It has a really lovely, but light scent, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li>and I get the right moisture that my face needs!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried soooo many, from the cheap drug store brands to all the high end brands like chanel.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m super oily.</li>
            <li>I received them promptly and exactly as described!</li>
            <li>First you have to make sure that you&#x27;re getting both the moisturizer &amp; the sunscreen out of the bottle, &amp; if you can, try to get more moisturizer than the sunscreen because the  sunscreen is white &amp; flaky, &amp;</li>
            <li>couple weeks worth).  </li>
            <li>but the product is worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, the scent is so nice and not over powering, and despite the 30 spf it doesn&#x27;t make my face shiny and oily like other moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I have a really oily T zone and normal in the cheek area and this works well for me - very light weight and non greasy.</li>
            <li>and this adds the right amount of moisture to my skin.</li>
            <li>Both products (green and white) came out perfectly.</li>
            <li>I really like that this moisturizer had spf 30!</li>
            <li>I need and want higher spf (I assume we all do?)</li>
            <li>Amazon has been the only place I&#x27;ve been able to find this lotion</li>
            <li>Two, I wish it had a higher spf.</li>
            <li>Just yank off the white top and pump whichever side is not pumping until it brings up the moisturizer or sunscreen and then put the top back on.. and Voilaaaa!</li>
            <li>It took me a good 5 or 6 wasted pumps of the sunscreen to get the moisturizer to come out with it.</li>
            <li>I mean, the sunscreen part is great (lightweight, etc.), but I have to use another moisturizer because the pump just doesn&#x27;t work correctly.</li>
            <li>I am very fond of biore products - they are lightweight with a subtle fragrance and perfect for my sensitive combination skin.  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin on my cheeks but very very oily skin on my t-zone.</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>However, in the process of lightly tapping the upper part of the botttle against my dresser</li>
            <li>Thanks again so much for having it in stock.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I really think this dual pump thing is a gimmick.    </li>
            <li>The two lotions really don&#x27;t mix well</li>
            <li>have very oily skin</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t tell how much is in the bottle</li>
            <li>It really wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal, and after trying so many different moisturizers I&#x27;m glad to finally find one that works for me.</li>
            <li>In combination with their mild exfoliating cleanser, it works like no other.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my face soft with just the right amount of moisture in it.</li>
            <li>at most it comes out in slightly uneven amounts, but as long as the sunscreen sides comes out more, I don&#x27;t worry about it....</li>
            <li>Now please don&#x27;t take my review or any review as the end all be all, as everyone&#x27;s skin is different and no review is going to tell you whats right for you until you try it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t leave you shiny and sinks in easily.</li>
            <li>the top white part came off exposing the two individual pumps.</li>
            <li>Then pop the white top back on and your in business.</li>
            <li>Even tapping it on a surface, I wasted a good 20 pumps of the white side (tablespoons...</li>
            <li>highly reccommed.</li>
            <li>Ive tried many drugstore moisturizer and few high end brands</li>
            <li>I bought 5 bottles since the shipping charge is just a little more with few more bottles.  </li>
            <li>It goes on really light, and sinks in well.  </li>
            <li>those are the few at the top of my reject pile under the bathroom</li>
            <li>My biggest problem with face lotions is most make my skin too oily which makes me break out, but the products with sacylic acid or anything like that, doesn&#x27;t moisturize my face enough and leaves my skin too dry which then causes my skin to overcompensate</li>
            <li>other important sunscreen info if you&#x27;re interested:&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, because I will be using this everyday!</li>
            <li>I discovered if you take the white top off, you will see two little tubes on each side where the lotion and sunscreen each come out...</li>
            <li>The bottle says to lightly tap it on a hard surface, which i&#x27;ve been doing for a whole day every time i try to test it, and it still won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>maybe the moisturizer would cool it down?).</li>
            <li>This sinks right in, does not make me greasy/</li>
            <li>This con (the only one I can think of) is very frustrating, but it&#x27;s such a great product that I deal with it</li>
            <li>But those two major issues - the pump and pilling lead me to give it 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And at amazon&#x27;s price, I will definitely be buying this frequently!</li>
            <li>As far as the bottle, as long as I don&#x27;t lay it on its side I have had very MINOR problems (without even banging it first)...</li>
            <li>I have acne prone, combination, sensitive red skin.</li>
            <li>I also happen to have sensitive skin with some products that leave my skin red, but this one doesn&#x27;t give me that problem and feels soothing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll add that I always have a problem with pumping both sides at once with every new bottle, but it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience for the benefits this moisturizer provides.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin moisturized, but not too oily and never dry.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve tried several of the major brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One, it is a small container and goes quickly with daily use.  </li>
            <li>a lot of the other comments complain that the moisturizer is good but the dispensing mechanism is flawed and doesnt work...</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft after using acne products that would normally dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>I put the white cap (not the transparent lid) back on and did some more tapping, then i pushed down on only the suncreen part (as opposed to pushing down on the middle like recommended) until some suncreen came out then when i tried pushing down on the middle part</li>

            <li> I have acne prone, combination, sensitive red skin.</li>
            <li> I also happen to have sensitive skin with some products that leave my skin red, but this one doesn&#x27;t give me that problem and feels soothing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This has to be the best moisturizer with SPF! It smells good, light-weight, not greasy and I get the right moisture that my face needs! Ive tried many drugstore moisturizer and few high end brands but this is my number 1!</li>
            <li> I really like that this moisturizer had spf 30! It is reasonably priced. It is easy to use, smells good and feels great on my face. It doesn&#x27;t make my face oily either. I bought two, so I wouldn&#x27;t run out. I&#x27;m glad I did, because I will be using this everyday!</li>
            <li> I like this product but like others mentioned both pumps didn&#x27;t work. For me only the moisturizer would come out and not the suncreeen (I bought mime at a local retail store). Anyway i tried tapping the bottle lightly as suggested to get both pumps to work but that didn&#x27;t help at all. However, in the process of lightly tapping the upper part of the botttle against my dresser the top white part came off exposing the two individual pumps. So i tried pushing down on the suncreen pump alone several time and it probably took about 20 or so tries and some suncreen finally came out. I put the white cap (not the transparent lid) back on and did some more tapping, then i pushed down on only the suncreen part (as opposed to pushing down on the middle like recommended) until some suncreen came out then when i tried pushing down on the middle part both pumps finally worked and i now get both moisturizer and suncreen. Phew! Anyway it seems like a lot of work to get the product to work but in the end i do like this product and its great for oily and combination skin. I have a really oily T zone and normal in the cheek area and this works well for me - very light weight and non greasy.</li>
            <li> So far it has been great. I had used another moisturizer with spf and was clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> I initially was angry about this product. It took me a good 5 or 6 wasted pumps of the sunscreen to get the moisturizer to come out with it. It tells you in various places to tap the bottle on a hard surface if it doesn&#x27;t start pumping with both. That led me to believe it was a common issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But once I got over the wasted couple tablespoons of product, I do really like this. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t leave you shiny and sinks in easily. It&#x27;s oil free and non-comedogenic(won&#x27;t clog pores). Very light fragrance, nothing overpowering or noticeable. Does not leave a white-cast like some sunscreen infused products can. It does seem to pill up a little(when you go back over the area you lotioned a couple minutes later, it rolls up into a little ball), and thats never good. But despite that I do still like this product and will use it. But those two major issues - the pump and pilling lead me to give it 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was specifically looking for something at least 30 SPF with UVA/UVB protection, because otherwise, it&#x27;s barely worth it. I think it&#x27;s important to wear sunscreen daily as I am fair with freckles(which keep getting darker and producing little freckle babies) so it&#x27;s a must. I also have sensitive, skin with hormonal breakouts, and my skin hasn&#x27;t become angry... we&#x27;ve got happy skin here. Also, please don&#x27;t forget to apply to the back of your hands, neck and chest area! Nothing worse then a pretty ageless face with spotted, wrinkly hands and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, just for some technical info. It says PABA free on the box. Had no clue what this meant. After some research, I found PABA is para-aminobenzoic acid and has been discontinued from use in sunscreen products due to allergic skin reactions in some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other important sunscreen info if you&#x27;re interested:&lt;br /&gt;What is the difference between a SPF 15 and a SPF 30 plus? A SPF 15 sunscreen absorbs about 93% of the UV, which means it lets 7% of  the UV through into the skin.  A SPF 30 sunscreen lets about 3.5% of the UV through.  This means a SPF 30 sunscreen reduces by half the amount of UV getting through to the skin. However, you should still re-apply a SPF30 sunscreen product every two hours, just like you do a SPF 15 sunscreen product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do UVA and UVB mean? UVA are the long wave ultraviolet rays (from 320-400nm). UVA rays can penetrate to the deeper layers of the skin and produce delayed effects leading to accelerated skin aging. UVB are the shorter wavelength rays (from 280-320nm) which can produce immediate burning of the outer layer of skin, leading to sunburn in the short term and skin cancer in the longer term.he UV through.

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I bought a faulty bottle, but I&#x27;m having trouble with this product. I don&#x27;t doubt that it works for some people, I just don&#x27;t have the money or patience to get both pumps working.    The only thing that will come out is the sunscreen, which leaves my face feeling greasy and smelling like I splashed on men&#x27;s cologne. The bottle says to lightly tap it on a hard surface, which i&#x27;ve been doing for a whole day every time i try to test it, and it still won&#x27;t work. (If this is such a common issue that they leave a warning on the label, why not have it already combined in the bottle since it will come together on your face anyway?)</li>
            <li> Best Spf AND Moisturizer thus far!!! And thats saying a lot...I have acne prone, combination, sensitive red skin. I need and want higher spf (I assume we all do?) but hate the smell, feel and look of it. None the less, I suffered all three for the benefit of sun protection. Like another reviewer, I almost did not try because of reviews, THANK GOD I tried it.   This sinks right in, does not make me greasy/oily at all, does not irritate my skin, does not make me break out, AND IS SPF 30? what??? YIPPEE!!..As far as the bottle, as long as I don&#x27;t lay it on its side I have had very MINOR problems (without even banging it first)...at most it comes out in slightly uneven amounts, but as long as the sunscreen sides comes out more, I don&#x27;t worry about it....Just give it a shot, what can you lose besides 10 bucks..</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer!!  Its so light and does not feel greasy on your face.  And has SPF in it!!  I received them promptly and exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I have always loved this produce but can never find it anywhere else except for amazon.com. I&#x27;m so thankful that I found it here at a great price. I hope to continue to buy it here where ever I run out. Thanks again so much for having it in stock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m chronically shiny, and am always looking for a moisturizer with SPF that wouldn&#x27;t turn me into an oil-well by noon.  I tried this one, and even though it doesn&#x27;t specify oil-control it does that perfectly.  It goes on really light, and sinks in well.  Plus I have dark sking, and this doesn&#x27;t go ashy on me.    I noticed the pump problem, and honestly it only takes about 3 or 4 pumps to make both sides come out.  It really wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal, and after trying so many different moisturizers I&#x27;m glad to finally find one that works for me.</li>
            <li> This product is actually two products in one bottle, a moisturizing lotion and a sun protection lotion. Instead of mixing the products together into one lotion, you get one bottle with two chambers so that the products dispense separately ... but then go together on your face. This is supposed to help preserve each product, but I&#x27;m not sure I get how this technology works to do that. It&#x27;s an interesting concept nonetheless. But it also creates a big problem for me.    As of this writing, I have pumped the bottle at least 30 times, and all that&#x27;s coming out is the green lotion (SPF). I have whacked the bottle against hard surfaces in every way and direction imaginable, stuck a thin needle down into the moisturizer side, and run water into the moisturizer side, but absolutely nothing is coming out! I have put it aside for now rather than continue to waste the green lotion, which feels hot on my face anyway (not a good sign -- maybe the moisturizer would cool it down?). I see I am not the only one with this problem.  Maybe Biore put out a batch where someone accidentally forgot to fill the moisturizer chamber. I plan to email Biore about the problem, but unfortunately their site is down at the moment. Perhaps all the customers trying to write in to complain about this product crashed it.</li>
            <li> This product is too good for me not to defend. If you&#x27;re having trouble getting both sides to pump out. Use your finger and cover up the side that does work, then keep gently pushing down the pump until the air pressure builds up and forces the other side to pump out too.</li>
            <li> (Warning: long review. I&#x27;m passionate about SPF facial lotions!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the Best SPF Facial Lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. And I&#x27;ve tried several of the major brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  - \\&quot;Neutrogena Age Shield Face\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;  - \\&quot;Aveeno Continuous Sunblock\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;  - Off-Brand \\&quot;Sheer Dry-Touch\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And those are the few at the top of my reject pile under the bathroom sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these SPF facial lotions have the same problem (at least for me personally):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after application they turn white, become blotchy and peel off of the face, leaving the wearer looking very strange, sickly even. Uck. They have often made my skin turn red and burn slightly also. Isn&#x27;t that the point of applying sunscreen? To NOT burn?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biore Dual Fusion Moisturizer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Does NOT blotch like all the others!&lt;br /&gt;- Does not burn like the others!&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves the skin feeling softer and happier, and even has some qualities that make the skin tone look clearer and more even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The container is flawed. It is made of two compartments, and often one half of the lotion will begin to come out of the nozzle while the other stays in. This can be frustrating, and wastes product, but resolves itself with a little tapping (or banging) on a hard surface to balance both sides.&lt;br /&gt;- This con (the only one I can think of) is very frustrating, but it&#x27;s such a great product that I deal with it and until I find a comparable product I&#x27;ll likely stick with it.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! It leaves my skin so soft after using acne products that would normally dry my skin out. And at amazon&#x27;s price, I will definitely be buying this frequently!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is awesome! It has a really lovely, but light scent, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and moisturizes really well. It doesn&#x27;t make me break out like other moisturizers and my skin feels soft and silky after I apply. I also have really bad combination skin and where I&#x27;m not dry, I&#x27;m super oily. This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t contribute to the oiliness at all and it even seems like it might help to reduce it. Love!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with getting both the products out at the same time. It doesn&#x27;t make your face greasy like most face lotions I have used  highly reccommed.</li>
            <li> The best! my skin breaka out over everything but this one</li>
            <li> I had received a sample of this lotion from Target.  I was immediately hooked!  I was first impressed with the fact it was a 30 spf.  SPF is SO IMPORTANT and your face is exposed to the sun always.  Also, it can help with acne and reduce scarring, which is a huge issue for me.  I also found it very moisturizing without being heavy or greasy feeling.  Light, absorbs right in and feels great! My skin improved after just using the sample packet!   Amazon has been the only place I&#x27;ve been able to find this lotion and I plan on stocking up.</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin, this is a wonderful lightweight and non greasy moisturizer.  It works great under my makeup, and also has a SPF of 30.  I sometimes have breakout issues, and this moisturizer causes me no problems.</li>
            <li> seller excellent with great service. a lot of the other comments complain that the moisturizer is good but the dispensing mechanism is flawed and doesnt work...false. i have had zero problems with the dispenser since the day i received it for one reason, when you initially pump it, it takes a few times to pump out (different for each pump inside). all you have to do to fix it is take off the head and pump each pump individually til it starts dispensing properly, then replace the head and they will dispense equally every time. makes skin feel great too.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I  have aging skin and have used many products.  I have never used anything, expensive or not that works like this.  In combination with their mild exfoliating cleanser, it works like no other.  I hate it that it&#x27;s hard to find in the stores.  As long as I can get it on line I will be happy.  Please don&#x27;t discontinue making this product.</li>
            <li> I am very fond of biore products - they are lightweight with a subtle fragrance and perfect for my sensitive combination skin.  However I am disappointed with this one because of the pump.  There are two nozzles, I am guessing one is supposed to deliver the moisturizer and the other is supposed to deliver the spf.  Only one of them is working.  The box says to tap gently on a hard surface if both sides do not work uniformly.  I have tapped and tapped to no avail!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended in a magazine as a gel moisturizer with sunscreen suitable for acne prone skin. I am in my late 30&#x27;s but still have a little acne. I looked at the previous Amazon reviews and almost didn&#x27;t purchase this because people had problems getting it out of the bottle. Would I have missed out. The first time I used the product I hit the bottle on a hard surface for about 10 seconds and then pumped as directed. Both products (green and white) came out perfectly. This is the lightest product I have ever found with a sunscreen (and it seems like I have tried everything). My face is clearing up and getting softer. I also love the refreshing scent. Go Biore.</li>
            <li> I have combo skin and could never find a good enough moisturizer that tends to both skin types perfectly. I have normal skin on my cheeks but very very oily skin on my t-zone. This is the only moisturizer that I have found that not only balances out my skin but has made my skin softer over time. I also happen to have sensitive skin with some products that leave my skin red, but this one doesn&#x27;t give me that problem and feels soothing. I hope the stores don&#x27;t stop selling this stuff because I doubt I&#x27;ll find another like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll add that I always have a problem with pumping both sides at once with every new bottle, but it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience for the benefits this moisturizer provides.</li>
            <li> I love this whole line!  I have yet to find another moisturizer with SPF that doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy.  It does feel dry from time to time, but I will take that over a heavy cakey feeling any day of the week.  I NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE PUMP if I followed the directions on the bottle.  It says bang the bottom to start and always press in the middle, and never had a problem.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have had a lot of trial and error with face lotions. I have tried dozens and this does the trick for me! It keeps my skin moisturized, but not too oily and never dry. My biggest problem with face lotions is most make my skin too oily which makes me break out, but the products with sacylic acid or anything like that, doesn&#x27;t moisturize my face enough and leaves my skin too dry which then causes my skin to overcompensate and I break out. This product is the perfect balance for me and it keeps my skin tone even. Now please don&#x27;t take my review or any review as the end all be all, as everyone&#x27;s skin is different and no review is going to tell you whats right for you until you try it! Now I hear this is being discontinued which makes me so sad, since I finally found something that works for me. So stock up!    Making the pump work... I&#x27;ve wasted time and energy and lotion pumping and pumping so both side work. I discovered if you take the white top off, you will see two little tubes on each side where the lotion and sunscreen each come out... whichever side isn&#x27;t coming out just push down on the tube over and over until that side starts pumping out. Then pop the white top back on and your in business.</li>
            <li> This has become my go-to.  I have combination skin that edges toward oily, and it is very difficult for me to find a moisturizer which doesn&#x27;t turn me into an oil slick.  This one is fantastic.  Even better it has a combined sun block.  There are only two negatives for me.  One, it is a small container and goes quickly with daily use.  Two, I wish it had a higher spf.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems getting the pump to work. My problem is this leaves white residue all over my face and seems to make some spots even drier. I&#x27;m better not putting anything on.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else, I had issues with the pump. Even tapping it on a surface, I wasted a good 20 pumps of the white side (tablespoons... couple weeks worth).  One reviewer mentions blocking the functional side and pumping until the other side starts to come out... I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t think of that. Argh. Anyway, I really think this dual pump thing is a gimmick.    I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the scent, but it was definitely doable. The two lotions really don&#x27;t mix well so you have to spend some time doing that before applying, or you will keep scooping up different amounts of each. My skin always felt dry in some spots a few minutes later and I would have to go over them with my thicker nighttime cream.    Not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for weeks and still cannot get the pump to distribute the moisturizing half of the product. I have tapped it on a hard surface over and over again to no avail. I mean, the sunscreen part is great (lightweight, etc.), but I have to use another moisturizer because the pump just doesn&#x27;t work correctly.</li>
            <li> I bought 5 bottles since the shipping charge is just a little more with few more bottles.  However, the expiration date are all December 2011/this year so I was a little disappointed as I feel pressure to use it faster before it expire. Some bottle took a little bit long to get both moisturizer and sunscreen to both come out at the same time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer!  I&#x27;ve tried soooo many, from the cheap drug store brands to all the high end brands like chanel. Nothing compares to this one, especially for my combination skin.  It&#x27;s light, the scent is so nice and not over powering, and despite the 30 spf it doesn&#x27;t make my face shiny and oily like other moisturizers.  I was sooo sad when it was yanked off the shelves in stores, so now every time I run low I purchase off amazon (thank goodness!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And about everyone who&#x27;s complained about the pumps, it&#x27;s really not that difficult! Just yank off the white top and pump whichever side is not pumping until it brings up the moisturizer or sunscreen and then put the top back on.. and Voilaaaa!</li>
            <li> Having used other products in the Biore Skin Preservation line, I expected that same level of awesomeness...What I got was a moisturizer that left my skin feeling less moisturized than Biore&#x27;s Hard Day&#x27;s Night Overnight Moisturizer. The Hard Day&#x27;s Night Moisturizer really does what it says it does, but this Dual Fusion Moisturizer didn&#x27;t come anywhere close. First you have to make sure that you&#x27;re getting both the moisturizer &amp; the sunscreen out of the bottle, &amp; if you can, try to get more moisturizer than the sunscreen because the  sunscreen is white &amp; flaky, &amp; both of them combined leaves you skin feeling slightly moisturized. Unfortunately, the flaky texture of the sunscreen doesn&#x27;t really penetrate the skin &amp; it leaves white particles on the skin&#x27;s surface, making your face look dry. This just didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped. I&#x27;d rather apply a separate sunscreen that I know penetrates the skin &amp; then apply Biore&#x27;s Overnight Moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li> I searched everywhere for this product. Stores have stopped carrying it and it was very difficult to find. I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding moisturizers that wouldn&#x27;t make my face too oily and break out. This product makes my face soft with just the right amount of moisture in it. I use it in the morning after showering and I don&#x27;t usually need to add anymore. My only complaint about this is the bottle which is why I am giving it a 4 and not 5 stars. Sometimes it is VERY hard to get both creams to come out at the same time.</li>
            <li> I love this SPF. It is a gel so it applies dry and non-greasy. The only reason I stopped using this is because I can&#x27;t find it in stores and I can&#x27;t buy thru amazon because i fear they sell expired products.&lt;br /&gt;I have very oily skin and this adds the right amount of moisture to my skin. It is also quite expensive for only 1.7 oz. I have yet to find another SPF moisturizer that can rival this product. Yes, the pump is a little hard to work but the product is worth it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy but I can&#x27;t tell how much is in the bottle and it ran out with no warning...</li>
            <li> Wish they still continued this product! The moisturizer is light and non-irritating. It feels like water going on the face. Even the sunscreen is light and non irritating, almost as if there isn&#x27;t any in there.</li>
            <li> It does not leave an oily film on your skin.  Protects against the heavy sun in the south.  I wear it playing golf all the time.</li>
            <li> I regularly buy this dual moisturizer because it isn&#x27;t greasy like sunscreen but still provides that protection. They stopped selling it in stores though so that makes it more difficult to get. I have very sensitive, dry skin. I bought a moisturizer/sunscreen in a dual formula (Neutrogena) that many friends had recommended when I ran out of Biore. Got the sensitive skin formula and had a really bad allergic reaction to it. Needless to say that me and my raw, burning face will just keep ordering this on Amazon!</li>
