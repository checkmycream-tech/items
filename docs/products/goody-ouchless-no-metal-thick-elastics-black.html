            <li>The Product That I Got Was Great</li>

            <li>great hair bands for my pony tail.</li>
            <li>However, I have a habit of counting things lol...</li>
            <li>Happy about the product.</li>
            <li>Great that they don&#x27;t have any metal</li>
            <li>Very nice hair ties.</li>
            <li>Perfect if you need one more thing to get 15% off.</li>
            <li>The Goody elastics 20 years ago had excellent tension and didn&#x27;t lose its elasticity easily..</li>
            <li>and I think this one&#x27;s actually a good set.</li>
            <li>good price, but</li>
            <li>Good ponytail holders.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Love these hair ties!</li>
            <li>She needed them and she said they were the best ;)</li>
            <li>Love these hair ties!</li>
            <li>These hold my hair up nicely.</li>
            <li>so they aren&#x27;t good for too many uses before they have to be discarded.</li>
            <li>I guess I should have bought the Scunci kind.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to not pull hair out with your hair tie when taking it out.</li>
            <li>nice and sturdy ties; hopefully won&#x27;t snap on me...</li>
            <li>These are nice and inexpensive though, so I will keep ordering them I suppose.</li>
            <li>These are nice, and very cheap.</li>
            <li>very very comfortable and nice</li>
            <li>Good price, decent item, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>They are kind of like a new shoe, it looks good and fits good</li>
            <li>Good elastics for the price, but they do stretch out fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand my hair being in my face and that&#x27;s why I buy so many bands.</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s because the ones we have here in the US are mostly Made in China.  </li>
            <li>i ordered these and am very happy with them, they are not like the ones that you buy at department stores and come apart, they actually stay together</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay</li>
            <li>but I love them.</li>

            <li>dont need to run to the store :)</li>
            <li>Received on time and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Dollar store sells better</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I love these rubber bands when I purchase at the store</li>
            <li>Great hair bands, it doesn&#x27;t really get itself caught tangled in my hair</li>
            <li>I love these rubber bands because they don&#x27;t pull your hair out</li>
            <li>Love these hair ties.</li>
            <li>Just like most hair ties, these break after one or two uses.  </li>
            <li>Great for any hair, no pull very good elastic and holds my hair firmly in place!</li>
            <li>These do the job just fine. :)</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t stretch as easily as others though which is probably why they are cheaper.</li>
            <li>These brake way to easy.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t imagine it breaking easily for human-use.</li>
            <li>, they do not break or snap as easy as the ones with metal.</li>
            <li>They break too easily</li>
            <li>These do kinda lose their stretch fairly easily, and my hair is not that thick/unruly.</li>
            <li>Like these because they are strong and they don&#x27;t slip out of my hair like some weaker elastics do</li>
            <li>Not as good as the old ones 2yr&#x27;s ago ones,But still better than the rest</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re strong and cheap and doesn&#x27;t pull hair</li>
            <li>its really good, they all have a good quality and the tight</li>
            <li>Only purchased to make my order $35 for free shipping lol</li>
            <li>cheap price and product, they must have been the rejects.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an athlete and wanted something super strong and stretchy and these do not make the cut.</li>
            <li>Ouchless yes, but most of them broke with the first use.</li>
            <li>I had somewhat better results with Scunci brand, although I still haven&#x27;t found a hair elastic that is nearly as good as an unknown brand that I bought from a subway merchant while traveling in Europe.  </li>
            <li>Sleek looking in your hair as well and the price is just right!</li>
            <li>The full and true description of the item.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product.</li>
            <li>and they stretch out pretty easily</li>
            <li>We go through elastic a quickly with three girls and a Mom.</li>
            <li>Pretty good value for the price especially since I lose mine quickly.  </li>
            <li>Easily break, fast shipping</li>
            <li>They are ouchless fabric covered elastic bands and I am certain they would be fine for anyone else.</li>
            <li>As expected good quality ouchless pony holders</li>
            <li>And was Useful</li>
            <li>I have never previously had this many issues with a pack of hair</li>
            <li>is just right for me.</li>
            <li>These are a great deal, I have really thick hair</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:75a31257d56711f32ba43756417cdd2f]] Watch it in higher quality here: http://youtu.be/fQq16KiTM7s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they work great on his thick hair.</li>
            <li>I like them because they don&#x27;t have the metal on them, and they are pretty sturdy</li>
            <li>They are as advertised yet I have had 4 of them break while attempting to use it for the first time.</li>
            <li>So make sure you all do the same.</li>
            <li>, that is way stretchier and does not break the first time you try to put it in your hair.</li>
            <li>I had 2 or three break on me when I first tried to use them.  </li>
            <li>They stretch and no longer hold hair tightly and require more looping to secure the ponytail.  </li>
            <li>usually has good products, or did anyway.  </li>
            <li>Very tight&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make too much of a difference to me though.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t really do this.</li>
            <li>The texture must be too smooth, so it doesn&#x27;t have enough grip to stay in place.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and he is very picky with what he puts in his hair.</li>
            <li>and the fabric seems to break much sooner than others I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I had to put these on much tighter than normal so that they would stay in place.  </li>
            <li>The bands stretch very easily and only last a day in my hair before I need a new one</li>
            <li>Love the &amp;#34;ouchless&amp;#34; feature and the tight hold they have on my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure these would be fine hair bands for people with regular hair, I have thick hair and these are not the bands I was looking for.</li>
            <li>My husband grows out his hair for locks for love, so when it gets long he needs it pulled back for work</li>
            <li>Just snap right open.</li>
            <li>I stretch tested these when I bought them... lost about 5 right off the bat, the other 13 are great, and haven&#x27;t broken even when stressed.</li>
            <li>This new batch, however, is basically disposable.  </li>
            <li>I have to replace very frequently because they stretch out.</li>
            <li>They break constantly and don&#x27;t have very much stretch to them</li>
            <li>These completely break and snap off!</li>
            <li>Nice and thick as well!</li>
            <li>have older versions of this same product that remain highly elastic to this day.  </li>
            <li>They tend to break if you stretch them too far</li>
            <li>I wish these would last more than a few times before snapping.</li>
            <li>I love the thick hair bands like these.</li>
            <li>Thick and strong.</li>
            <li>These are strong and they don&#x27;t pull your hair, the only complaint I would have is breaking them in.</li>
            <li>Other than that they work really well.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have enough elastic, so they barely stretch..  </li>
            <li>They arrived quickly I do feel like I got less then expected</li>
            <li>None have broken yet and they hold my hair up easily.</li>

            <li> They arrived quickly I do feel like I got less then expected</li>
            <li> None have broken yet and they hold my hair up easily.</li>
            <li> not bad, little tight</li>
            <li> This particular round of hair ties give out after only a handful of uses.  </li>
            <li> Within 24 hours of getting these one band had stretched to the point of uselessness and the second one snapped before I could even put it on.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, stretches out too quickly.</li>
            <li> None have really stretched out a lot, either.</li>
            <li> They keep their elasticity for a long time and don&#x27;t stretch out immediately.</li>
            <li> The elastic a are very durable for those with thick hair</li>
            <li> Looses elasticity really fast, I have thick curly hair and just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I do not have very thick hair, but half of them will break the very first time I use them!</li>
            <li> I have very thick straight hair, and it constantly slides off.</li>
            <li> But I am pretty tough on them.</li>
            <li> It would probably fall out or get really loose.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and if you do too, run far away from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> but you know it is a little stiff since its new</li>
            <li> You cannot pull them as tight as regular elastic bands.</li>
            <li> I pull my hair back tight and these break after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> These work, but you have to be somewhat careful with them.</li>
            <li> So far only one has broken.</li>
            <li> not very tight, so doesn&#x27;t work well for thick hair.</li>
            <li> These are poorly made and break within the first few times of use.</li>
            <li> If on the other hand you have a low impact day and want something with a little give, maybe you will like these, but they drive me a little nuts</li>
            <li> After about half an hour these start slipping off.  </li>
            <li> I would give 5 stars as I love these hair bands, however I can&#x27;t help but feel bamboozled when they post a picture of two package&#x27;s, making me think a quantity of one will have two packages of hair bands, but alas I was wrong again.</li>
            <li> Just not long and thick hair..</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there was no way to tell the thickness of these bands from the listing, and they are MUCH thicker than I thought.  </li>
            <li> I dot have thick hair and these can&#x27;t make a third twist.</li>
            <li> If you have really thick hair &amp; only need to go around it twice, this product might work.</li>
            <li> Like twice as thick as regular bands.</li>
            <li> They work well and don&#x27;t snag often, but, and maybe it&#x27;s just me overusing the hair tie, the black part starts to wear and the rubber becomes exposed.</li>
            <li> There is no metal, so less hair is lost, but they do still get caught in it a bit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not do to loss but the bands stretch beyond repair with typical use and once the elastic is exposed, it will break off your hair.</li>
            <li> With long thick hair theses are a must.</li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> So before I opened the pack, I counted and two were missing.</li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair, usually Goody products hold up well in my hair...</li>
            <li> Then, they break... usually within a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> but they stay in tight so even thick hair stays in a ponytail.</li>
            <li> Still, I offer two stars because it does what it needs to for at least a little while.</li>
            <li> No more tearing hair</li>
            <li> would only recommend this item to people with very thin hair.</li>
            <li> I HATE hair ties that stretch on first use.</li>
            <li> These are inflexible and the black part comes unglued.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and like my ponytails tight.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine working out hard with these in.</li>
            <li> Hard to stretch</li>
            <li> Big  disappointment  don&#x27;t get it just go to target.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I may have missed the warning about using this if you have thick hair, or maybe they didn&#x27;t include one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Does not work well with thick hair.</li>
            <li> Hold up well and don&#x27;t break even in my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I do not even have thick hair.</li>
            <li> Horrible snap right at poorly glued center not for thick hair.</li>
            <li> but I think that&#x27;s just mean to show two in the picture and then ship one to the customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these less than two weeks and already two have broken and three having the rubber inside showing, so they are completely useless unless I want my hair being pulled out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not yank out hair (I have thin</li>
            <li> I am not happy with these Goody elastics....</li>
            <li> The elasticity is poor!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t snag like with the metal ones which can be painful.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re terrible.  </li>
            <li> These hair twisties are awful.  </li>
            <li> Horrible purchase</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Very tight&lt;br /&gt;Like the extra thickness of the bands&lt;br /&gt;Does not yank out hair (I have thin hair)&lt;br /&gt;Would order again&lt;br /&gt;Quick delivery</li>
            <li> These are the best ouchless elastics ever!!!</li>
            <li> Durable product...satisfied</li>
            <li> Pretty good value for the price especially since I lose mine quickly.  They don&#x27;t stretch as easily as others though which is probably why they are cheaper. Doesn&#x27;t make too much of a difference to me though.</li>
            <li> Loves these will be buying them again when I need them</li>
            <li> These are a great deal, I have really thick hair and I tend to break a lot of hair goodies. These are strong and they don&#x27;t pull your hair, the only complaint I would have is breaking them in. They are kind of like a new shoe, it looks good and fits good but you know it is a little stiff since its new and once you break it in then its great.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, stretches out too quickly.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter. She likes them.</li>
            <li> These took some getting used to. You cannot pull them as tight as regular elastic bands. I will probably go back to the ones with metal. I can&#x27;t stand my hair being in my face and that&#x27;s why I buy so many bands. I also want it to stay where I put it. This doesn&#x27;t really do this. I can&#x27;t imagine working out hard with these in. It would probably fall out or get really loose. If on the other hand you have a low impact day and want something with a little give, maybe you will like these, but they drive me a little nuts and I&#x27;m going out to buy different ones.</li>
            <li> I do not have very thick hair, but half of them will break the very first time I use them! Just snap right open. Will not buy again. Not worth it!</li>
            <li> These brake way to easy. The elasticity is poor! I dot have thick hair and these can&#x27;t make a third twist. If you have really thick hair &amp; only need to go around it twice, this product might work.</li>
            <li> After about half an hour these start slipping off.  The texture must be too smooth, so it doesn&#x27;t have enough grip to stay in place.  I had to put these on much tighter than normal so that they would stay in place.  I had somewhat better results with Scunci brand, although I still haven&#x27;t found a hair elastic that is nearly as good as an unknown brand that I bought from a subway merchant while traveling in Europe.  Maybe that&#x27;s because the ones we have here in the US are mostly Made in China.  Still looking..</li>
            <li> I like these bands! They&#x27;re really stretchy, and firm. I wear them when I play a sport.</li>
            <li> i ordered these and am very happy with them, they are not like the ones that you buy at department stores and come apart, they actually stay together</li>
            <li> Easily break, fast shipping</li>
            <li> These hold my hair up nicely. My second time purchasing these. Very nice hair ties. Definitely for those with slicker hair.</li>
            <li> These are great elastics! None have broken yet and they hold my hair up easily. None have really stretched out a lot, either. Good price, decent item, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These are the best. No more tearing hair</li>
            <li> Good elastics for the price, but they do stretch out fairly quickly.  On the plus side, I haven&#x27;t snapped one yet!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay and I think this one&#x27;s actually a good set.</li>
            <li> Work well! I have a lot of hair and these hold a ponytail in well!!!</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re strong and cheap and doesn&#x27;t pull hair</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t pull your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cat destroyed like 10 of them already but I can&#x27;t imagine it breaking easily for human-use.</li>
            <li> They work well and don&#x27;t snag often, but, and maybe it&#x27;s just me overusing the hair tie, the black part starts to wear and the rubber becomes exposed. I&#x27;ve had one snap before I&#x27;ve even use it. Other than that they work really well.</li>
            <li> good price, but these were the bigger version and I prefer the skinnier ones.</li>
            <li> Love these hair ties! Great for any hair, no pull very good elastic and holds my hair firmly in place! Awesome product!</li>
            <li> great price, quality product - I have three girls: So we have lots of pony tails and pig tails. These do the job just fine. :)</li>
            <li> Like these because they are strong and they don&#x27;t slip out of my hair like some weaker elastics do</li>
            <li> they are elastics. They hold pony tails and buns and braids and also cords and cables. So far only one has broken. As expected good quality ouchless pony holders</li>
            <li> Works great. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The Goody elastics 20 years ago had excellent tension and didn&#x27;t lose its elasticity easily.. Sort of reminded me of bungee cords. All the Goody hair elastics now are so disposable.. I have to replace very frequently because they stretch out. I have very thick straight hair, and it constantly slides off. I have to redo my basic ponytail every 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li> They keep the hair in place.</li>
            <li> They break constantly and don&#x27;t have very much stretch to them</li>
            <li> I have thick hair.  I&#x27;ve been tossing my hair in a pony-tail for decades.  This particular round of hair ties give out after only a handful of uses.  They stretch and no longer hold hair tightly and require more looping to secure the ponytail.  Then, they break... usually within a few weeks of use.  I have never previously had this many issues with a pack of hair elastics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have older versions of this same product that remain highly elastic to this day.  This new batch, however, is basically disposable.  Still, I offer two stars because it does what it needs to for at least a little while.</li>
            <li> Only purchased to make my order $35 for free shipping lol but I love them. I only use ouchless so they came in very handy! Thanks</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and if you do too, run far away from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When trying to put your hair in a pony, it will snap, break and hurt you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goody usually has good products, or did anyway.  I may have missed the warning about using this if you have thick hair, or maybe they didn&#x27;t include one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would only recommend this item to people with very thin hair.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Thick and strong.</li>
            <li> These work, but you have to be somewhat careful with them. They tend to break if you stretch them too far and they stretch out pretty easily so they aren&#x27;t good for too many uses before they have to be discarded. There is no metal, so less hair is lost, but they do still get caught in it a bit. Not a bad product.</li>
            <li> Ouchless yes, but most of them broke with the first use. Does not work well with thick hair. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Long-lasting ponytail holders.  No metal - don&#x27;t pull your hair out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure these would be fine hair bands for people with regular hair, I have thick hair and these are not the bands I was looking for. They are ouchless fabric covered elastic bands and I am certain they would be fine for anyone else.</li>

            <li> My husband grows out his hair for locks for love, so when it gets long he needs it pulled back for work and he is very picky with what he puts in his hair. These he likes because they don&#x27;t pull his hair, they don&#x27;t fall out and they work great on his thick hair.</li>
            <li> I pull my hair back tight and these break after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> its really good, they all have a good quality and the tight is just right for me. dont need to run to the store :)</li>
            <li> I stretch tested these when I bought them... lost about 5 right off the bat, the other 13 are great, and haven&#x27;t broken even when stressed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t snag like with the metal ones which can be painful. Works great for thicker/heavy hair like mine. Must buy!</li>
            <li> Received on time and I love it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly I do feel like I got less then expected but I may not have read the details all the way through.</li>
            <li> These are nice, and very cheap. I like them because they don&#x27;t have the metal on them, and they are pretty sturdy, they do not break or snap as easy as the ones with metal. Will always purchase these from now on, as I lose them so often...It&#x27;s like a hair band monster steal&#x27;s them..</li>
            <li> Hold up well and don&#x27;t break even in my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Good ponytail holders.</li>
            <li> She needed them and she said they were the best ;)</li>
            <li> They break too easily</li>
            <li> Horrible snap right at poorly glued center not for thick hair. Dollar store sells better</li>
            <li> Gift - likes that there is no metal</li>
            <li> They are as advertised yet I have had 4 of them break while attempting to use it for the first time.</li>
            <li> With long thick hair theses are a must.</li>
            <li> These are poorly made and break within the first few times of use.</li>
            <li> The Product That I Got Was Great And was Useful And Great I Rate It a five for theproducts</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an athlete and wanted something super strong and stretchy and these do not make the cut. I guess I should have bought the Scunci kind. I am not happy with these Goody elastics.... These are inflexible and the black part comes unglued. These don&#x27;t even hold my medium hair.  Booo</li>
            <li> very very comfortable and nice</li>
            <li> The full and true description of the item. Good price.</li>
            <li> Great until the cat develops a hoarding problem and you can never find them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any time i stray from the goody elastics i end up regretting it!</li>
            <li> great hair bands for my pony tail. last several weeks each</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there was no way to tell the thickness of these bands from the listing, and they are MUCH thicker than I thought.  Like twice as thick as regular bands.</li>
            <li> I buy a pack through Subscribe-and-Save every month or so. Perfect if you need one more thing to get 15% off. With two females and a cat who chews and sharpens his predatory skillz on these, we need to stay well stocked!</li>
            <li> The elastic a are very durable for those with thick hair</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these. They should sell these by the barrel.</li>
            <li> I HATE hair ties that stretch on first use. These have been troopers. I love these. They keep their elasticity for a long time and don&#x27;t stretch out immediately.</li>
            <li> I like the product. However, I have a habit of counting things lol...So before I opened the pack, I counted and two were missing. So make sure you all do the same.</li>
            <li> I love these rubber bands when I purchase at the store so I didn&#x27;t think twice as getting it as an add on. But I disagree. These completely break and snap off! Big  disappointment  don&#x27;t get it just go to target.</li>
            <li> We go through elastic a quickly with three girls and a Mom. It&#x27;s not do to loss but the bands stretch beyond repair with typical use and once the elastic is exposed, it will break off your hair.</li>
            <li> Looses elasticity really fast, I have thick curly hair and just did not work for me. It would fall off or just break. Do NOT waist your money.</li>
            <li> These are just the best hands done hair binders ever. They never pull your hair! Sleek looking in your hair as well and the price is just right!</li>
            <li> Not as stretch as some of the goodys bands. Hard to stretch and the fabric seems to break much sooner than others I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for several weeks and the elastics retain its shape and doesn&#x27;t lose elasticity, .  Happy about the product.</li>
            <li> I would give 5 stars as I love these hair bands, however I can&#x27;t help but feel bamboozled when they post a picture of two package&#x27;s, making me think a quantity of one will have two packages of hair bands, but alas I was wrong again. Sorry but I think that&#x27;s just mean to show two in the picture and then ship one to the customer.</li>
            <li> The bands stretch very easily and only last a day in my hair before I need a new one</li>
            <li> Love these hair ties! It&#x27;s so nice to not pull hair out with your hair tie when taking it out.</li>
            <li> Great hair bands, it doesn&#x27;t really get itself caught tangled in my hair</li>
            <li> I love these rubber bands because they don&#x27;t pull your hair out but they stay in tight so even thick hair stays in a ponytail.</li>
            <li> I love the thick hair bands like these. These do kinda lose their stretch fairly easily, and my hair is not that thick/unruly. Still one of the best elastics on Amazon.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THESE...  they&#x27;re terrible.  These hair twisties are awful.  They don&#x27;t have enough elastic, so they barely stretch..  they just break.  I couldn&#x27;t even wrap one around my hair twice without it breaking.  they are a piece of junk.  I do not recommend these at all.  I recommend using a different brand, like scunci, that is way stretchier and does not break the first time you try to put it in your hair.</li>
            <li> Love these hair ties. Great that they don&#x27;t have any metal so they don&#x27;t snag hair. Nice and thick as well!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the old ones 2yr&#x27;s ago ones,But still better than the rest</li>
            <li> Love the &amp;#34;ouchless&amp;#34; feature and the tight hold they have on my hair.</li>
            <li> Within 24 hours of getting these one band had stretched to the point of uselessness and the second one snapped before I could even put it on. I do not even have thick hair. Horrible purchase and I wouldn&#x27;t not recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> I wish these would last more than a few times before snapping. But I am pretty tough on them. I have very thick hair and like my ponytails tight.</li>
            <li> not bad, little tight</li>
            <li> not very tight, so doesn&#x27;t work well for thick hair.</li>
            <li> nice and sturdy ties; hopefully won&#x27;t snap on me...</li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair, usually Goody products hold up well in my hair... I&#x27;ve had these less than two weeks and already two have broken and three having the rubber inside showing, so they are completely useless unless I want my hair being pulled out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would probably work well for thinner hair? Just not long and thick hair..</li>
            <li> Just like most hair ties, these break after one or two uses.  These are nice and inexpensive though, so I will keep ordering them I suppose.</li>
            <li> cheap price and product, they must have been the rejects.  I had 2 or three break on me when I first tried to use them.  and you could see the glue holding some of the ends together.  the remaining one have held up though</li>
