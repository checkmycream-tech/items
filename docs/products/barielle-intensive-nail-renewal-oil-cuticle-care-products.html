            <li>Wife Loves this &amp; it has made her nails more attractive &amp; firmer.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>, I used to be able to get it at CVS, but they stop carrying it.</li>
            <li>I love that amazon has just about everything.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product for keeping nails and cuticles and edges soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Have used this product many times and it keeps my nails healthy.</li>
            <li>My hands look fabulous!</li>
            <li>but I have fewer--would probably be eliminated if I used it more often.</li>
            <li>My nails are now healthy again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it for being all that and more.</li>
            <li>It seems to soak in better.</li>
            <li>I have used Barielle nail products for many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to &amp;#34;find&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and my nails have never looked better.</li>
            <li>All Barielle products are worth more than what they cost.</li>
            <li>I enjoy designing, drawing, jewelry making and beading</li>
            <li>I bought this item, Barielle Intensive Nail Renewal Oil, 0.5-Ounces, to help strengthen my nails, but this item seems more useful for cuticles than for nails.</li>
            <li>Barielle products are fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use--it comes with a nail-polish--like brush and is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>Product is definitely worth its price.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth the price.  </li>
            <li>so the oil has time to be absorbed.</li>
            <li>I have used many different brands of cuticle oil, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Results are very fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Luz</li>
            <li>Its not greasy, and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>this keeps my cuticuls very delicates without having to cut them of, just what i was looking for, i just wish it would work faster.</li>
            <li>I really like their cream.  </li>
            <li>I found this to really help the dryness of my cuticles and surrounding skin area.  </li>
            <li>I inevitably have to clean the oil off the lenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend sticking with the standard, tried and true oils that we already know work.</li>
            <li>Makes my hands and feet feel rejuvenated, supple and soft.</li>
            <li>I saw a marked difference in my nails within a week of using it.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to any nail polish, and both Barielle liquid and cream help with my soft nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for that use, but not sure if it will eventually improve my nails.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate the natural simple ingredients.</li>

            <li> Have been using it for a long time</li>
            <li> Each night I dutifully apply per instructions, but unlike other cuticle oils that absorb and make the cuticles noticeably softer, it floats around on the surface of the skin leaving an oily sheen.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product. Have been using it for a long time, I used to be able to get it at CVS, but they stop carrying it. I love that amazon has just about everything. Thanks, Luz</li>
            <li> I am so addicted to this nail oil. I always keep one in my bag. I wish if they make one like a pen brush to be carried daily. It is the BEST</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for keeping nails and cuticles and edges soft and smooth. All Barielle products are worth more than what they cost.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Have used this product many times and it keeps my nails healthy.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I enjoy designing, drawing, jewelry making and beading and I found it difficult to keep my nails strong. This renewal oil helps. I put in on along with my hand cream over night (I use moisture capturing gloves or gel cooling gloves). Results are very fast. Product is definitely worth its price.</li>
            <li> I have used many different brands of cuticle oil, and this is by far my favorite. I call it hand crack because I go everywhere with it, and put it on multiple times a day. Its not greasy, and absorbs fast. My hands look fabulous!</li>
            <li> this keeps my cuticuls very delicates without having to cut them of, just what i was looking for, i just wish it would work faster.</li>
            <li> I have a tendancy toward hangnails. I use this oil about once a week. It not only soothes the hangnails but I have fewer--would probably be eliminated if I used it more often. It is easy to use--it comes with a nail-polish--like brush and is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> Wife Loves this &amp; it has made her nails more attractive &amp; firmer.</li>
            <li> After wearing artificial nails for awhile, I decided to take them off and see how my natural nails were doing.  Oh my gosh, my natural nails were in horrible condition so I purchased some Barielle nail strengthening cream and nail renewal oil and have been faithful using both products.  My nails are now healthy again.</li>
            <li> Great product does as described. I&#x27;d recommend it for being all that and more. Makes my hands and feet feel rejuvenated, supple and soft. It&#x27;s a rejuvenated allover!</li>
            <li> This is the best product for nail growth and strength ever!  It absorbs quickly and my nails have never looked better.</li>
            <li> no better than any other oil. It isn&#x27;t worth the price.  I really like their cream.  It seems to soak in better.</li>
            <li> My nails are in such bad shape from false nails. I don&#x27;t think enough time has passed to rate your product..I am using it every day and several times a day..We shall see..It has only been 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I saw a marked difference in my nails within a week of using it.</li>
            <li> I have used Barielle nail products for many years. I am allergic to any nail polish, and both Barielle liquid and cream help with my soft nails.</li>
            <li> I found this to really help the dryness of my cuticles and surrounding skin area.  It is a pleasant smell.  I appreciate the natural simple ingredients.</li>
            <li> I bought this item, Barielle Intensive Nail Renewal Oil, 0.5-Ounces, to help strengthen my nails, but this item seems more useful for cuticles than for nails. It&#x27;s fine for that use, but not sure if it will eventually improve my nails.  It is somewhat of a pain as you need to apply it before bed so the oil has time to be absorbed. Using it during the day would be quite messy.</li>
            <li> Barielle products are fabulous.  I used the Barielle cream over 30 years ago, but had forgotten all about it.  I&#x27;m so glad to &amp;#34;find&amp;#34; it again.  My nails showed improvement after only one use.  I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many a cuticle oil over the years and this one is just mediocre. Each night I dutifully apply per instructions, but unlike other cuticle oils that absorb and make the cuticles noticeably softer, it floats around on the surface of the skin leaving an oily sheen. If I pick up my glasses afterward I inevitably have to clean the oil off the lenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to cling to everything but my cuticles and nail bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cuticles are in worse shape than in some time because the cuticles remain dry. I&#x27;d recommend sticking with the standard, tried and true oils that we already know work. Whatever this has to offer never gets under the skin to do what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing.</li>
