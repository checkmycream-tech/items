    <ol>
            <li> the extensions werent what i expected they dont look like they do in the picture and the color is not dark brown</li>
            <li> I like this because it gives a lot of hair more that dont have and this give my hair what I need and a different look that I like a lot.I get a lot of good compliments and people told me how different I look and how cute I look to.</li>

            <li> Good for the price - wish it last longer. I like how easy it hooked up and it did make my hair look fuller</li>
            <li> They got all tangled after 2 days so I had to throw them in the trash and now I don&#x27;t have them</li>
            <li> Very poor quality, you wear it once it gets tangled and you cant get them out by running your fingers through it.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldnt recomend buying this unless you only plan on wearing it once.</li>
            <li> looks very fake with my hair I cant even wear it, the color doesn&#x27;t match my color either me no likey</li>
            <li> I got this for Halloween. It totally matched my hair color and I was so happy with the quality.  People actually thought it was my real hair. I bought two because I wasn&#x27;t sure if one would be thick enough but one was perfect. Great price, too.</li>
            <li> Not the color I expected, and it was very thin. The price should have been the first clue.  The texture wasn&#x27;t too bad...</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  The hair was like Barbie doll hair. I would never buy this again. It is not like the hair that is on the picture.</li>
            <li> The quality of this is very low. It looks completely fake and it is not usable at all. I returned it.</li>
            <li> I was told it would be dark brown but it was definitely black. It was very heavy too. It doesn&#x27;t blend or look real like in the picture. I would only recommend to wear this at a party or something. And you shouldn&#x27;t expect it to look real. It looks fake.</li>
            <li> I didnt like the product it doensnt look llike on the picture, be more specific ln what you guys sell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what you think it tables easy and it&#x27;s really then ðŸ™…ðŸ™… DONT NOT BUY</li>
            <li> It gets tangled easy and you can&#x27;t untangle it&lt;br /&gt;Its kinda heavy..</li>
            <li> If you are black don&#x27;t buy this its just like the picture either for asian girls or white girls and remeber its a clip in not a full wig</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good wig but the slightest knot creates a giant mess. I had to brush it out and it didn&#x27;t keep its curls.</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy but no one even knows I have it in matches my hair perfect I am just no use to having that my weight on my head cuz i have very thin hair</li>
            <li> Lovely and beautiful on me, Just wish it was human hair. But still it made me look beautiful on a very important day.</li>
            <li> I felt this was very nice I just wish the combs had been a little bigger to hold in my hair : )</li>
            <li> excelent quality and excelent price.</li>
            <li> This product was nothing as described the hair was thin and looked like something from the dollar store, not only did it take long but it was not worth it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful at first, shiny and thick, second wesr looked tingled and fuzzy, after I wsdhed it it lost the shine,became unhealthy and really tingled looking</li>
            <li> This product wasnt good at all. Doesnt look like anything in the picture. It&#x27;s really thin and fake. You need to buy 3 or 4 for to actually look like some type of extension. It does not even reach around your head to look like full extensions makes you look like you have a mullet. I do not recommend this product at all!</li>
            <li> My daughter stole it yet, it looks great &amp; works well on her. Lol</li>
            <li> you just cant wear these for a long period of time as they are very heavy and begin to give you a headache. Also they tangle easily</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for looks like doll hair and useable but once but ok for one time use if your hair is freshly dyed</li>
