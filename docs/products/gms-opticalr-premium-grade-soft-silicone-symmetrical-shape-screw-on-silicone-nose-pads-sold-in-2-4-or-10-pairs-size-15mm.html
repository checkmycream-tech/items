            <li>Good price and good quality.  </li>
            <li>i recommend it , the price is really good, and i did not have with it</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>

            <li>I have replaced the pads on 5 pairs of glasses - these are pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li>this product works great, and easy to be installed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that I bought stuff like that, I love to do by my self, to many things.</li>
            <li>Excellent product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My wife and I both wear glasses, so it&#x27;s nice to have these around.  </li>
            <li>They are comfortable and fit all of our glasses perfectly.  </li>
            <li>These are the screw in kind.  </li>
            <li>Easy install, feels great, just like original.</li>
            <li>However, the good thing I can say about these so far is that the price is great compared to others listed on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Good for most glasses but don&#x27;t fit all.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>They do do the job and very comfortable will purchase again</li>
            <li>Very comfortable on my nose bridge.</li>
            <li>Worked perfectly, and now I have many extra sets just in case.</li>
            <li>It definitely is a better quality than the one&#x27;s that came with the glasses.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see if these do any better.  </li>
            <li>A better choice is to take the pin out and silicone them to your glasses, HOWEVER if you take the pin out there is a valley in the silicone</li>
            <li>They would be much better w/o the pin so you can attach to sun glasses.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, did enlarge my nose!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just be sure to pay attention to the style and size you want, as well as the mounting type (snap-in or screw-on).</li>
            <li>It fit the nose brackets on my glasses perfectly...love it!</li>
            <li>Most importantly, they are very comfortable.</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly and actually stray in much better than the original ones.</li>
            <li>These nose pads feel better than the original ones that came with my expansive frame.</li>
            <li>easy to install.</li>
            <li>It easy to put on your glasses.  </li>
            <li>Easy to attach.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easily installed with jeweler screwdriver,very confortable.</li>
            <li>Fit perfectly, easy to install.</li>
            <li>Cheap and easy to install.  </li>
            <li>Super inexpensive and a quality product!  </li>
            <li>These are nice fitting and soft.</li>
            <li>pads break they almost always break at loop that is used to secure the pad to the glasses.  </li>
            <li>And, they are extremely comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable too.</li>
            <li>I was happy enough with them that I used the spares to replace all the pads on all the glasses of all family members.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Installation is straightforward and they generally fit all types of glasses.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t do it by pulling with my fingers, I had to use a pair of needle nose pliers and apply a significant amount of force to get them to tear.  </li>
            <li>They stay in place nicely and are so much better than regular plastic ones.</li>
            <li>Fit was good, more comfortable than the original hard plastic noise pads on our glasses.</li>
            <li>First off they don&#x27;t fit any of my sun glasses, so using them w/o pin is no go.  </li>
            <li>and I received it really fast too!!</li>
            <li>I got these and they fit very well.</li>
            <li>As advertised, love these soft nose pads</li>
            <li>Everything seems OK so far.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll need a tiny screw driver and probably a magnifying glass if you&#x27;re working on your own glasses.  </li>
            <li>the price is right.  </li>
            <li>You do need a screw, if you just push them into the holder on your glasses they will fall out pretty</li>
            <li>I was able to find the piece and snap it back on, but this kept happening too often.  </li>
            <li>They were exactly what I was looking for..</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>quality product and fast delivery</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than going by the glasses store and getting them replaced...</li>
            <li>These have made a real difference.</li>
            <li>They are a notch bigger than the original eye pieces, but I really don&#x27;t notice at all.</li>
            <li>Other than it getting crushed during shipping and making a good amount unusable, they do the job and are not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>So now one of the first things I do is replace the stock nosepads with these soft silicone pads.  </li>
            <li>Item as advertised, nice clear soft plastic on contact area with stronger center attachment.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a pain to find, particularly if you drop one on a carpeted area...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this vendor</li>
            <li>Unless you get your pads caught on something while picking up your glasses, the pads should survive just about all normal use.</li>
            <li>These replacements make the glasses feel new.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to pay for a new pair of glasses and an eye appointment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them on ten different pairs and they fit every one.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy enough to change, just unscrew and remove the old ones, put these in place and screw them back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>like they&#x27;re free, you&#x27;ll go old continually buying those little repair kits from the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>As nose pads become old, they tend to harden and become brittle.  </li>
            <li>make your glasses easier to wear, the old plastic nose pieces suck.</li>
            <li>These fit one of my pair of glasses but did not fit the spare pair that I have.</li>
            <li>I thought I was just ordering one pair, so I was pleasantly surprised that there were 10.  </li>
            <li>These seem to be made very well but only time will tell.</li>
            <li>Much softer than the regular ones.</li>
            <li>These fit the sort of glasses that have a little square holder for the nosepiece that is held in with a tiny screw.  </li>

            <li> I got a pair of glasses that had two bits of wire bend to hold in the nose pads, if I bumped them or shook them, the pads would come off.. very frustrating for a $200 pair of glasses..</li>

            <li> Worked perfectly, and now I have many extra sets just in case.</li>
            <li> Served their purpose.  easy to install.</li>
            <li> Excellent price for a quality product and I received it really fast too!! It definitely is a better quality than the one&#x27;s that came with the glasses. I recommend these and the seller too!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It easy to put on your glasses.  I would definitely recommend it to other consumers.</li>
            <li> When your family goes through reading glasses like they&#x27;re free, you&#x27;ll go old continually buying those little repair kits from the grocery store.  Buy these, and a pack of eyeglass screws and be done with it.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly, easy to install. Glasses don&#x27;t slide anymore.</li>
            <li> As advertised, love these soft nose pads</li>
            <li> As nose pads become old, they tend to harden and become brittle.  I&#x27;ve had it happen with glasses that cost $10, and those that cost $200.  So now one of the first things I do is replace the stock nosepads with these soft silicone pads.  They work wonders.  They don&#x27;t become brittle (or at least haven&#x27;t in the 3+ years I&#x27;ve been using them) and are much softer on the bridge of my nose than the stock hard pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation is straightforward and they generally fit all types of glasses.  I&#x27;ve tried them on ten different pairs and they fit every one.  I generally wear medium sized glass (not too small, not too big), so your experience may differ some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When pads break they almost always break at loop that is used to secure the pad to the glasses.  Since these are relatively low cost, I tried to tear one off of the glasses after I had installed it.  It takes a lot of force to break one of these.  I couldn&#x27;t do it by pulling with my fingers, I had to use a pair of needle nose pliers and apply a significant amount of force to get them to tear.  Unless you get your pads caught on something while picking up your glasses, the pads should survive just about all normal use.</li>
            <li> There are times when you don&#x27;t realize how uncomfortable the nose pieces are on your glasses because you grow accustomed to the feel. These replacements make the glasses feel new.  Very comfortable. Easy to attach.</li>
            <li> Used to fix a broken pad on a pair of my glasses and my mom&#x27;s. Fit was good, more comfortable than the original hard plastic noise pads on our glasses. I also don&#x27;t have problems with the glasses skipping down my nose anymore. Good quality, no burrs our seems on pads to irritate. I plan on replacing pads on glasses I get in the future with this as soon as I get the glasses.</li>
            <li> make your glasses easier to wear, the old plastic nose pieces suck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that I bought stuff like that, I love to do by my self, to many things. It&#x27;s not about the money, it&#x27;s just the pleasure&lt;br /&gt;for me. Thanks</li>
            <li> Everything seems OK so far.  The order arrived in a timely manner.  I haven&#x27;t tried using the nosepads yet.  My problem with these has always been that the tiny thin edge behind the screw breaks through and the nosepad falls off.  We&#x27;ll see if these do any better.  However, the good thing I can say about these so far is that the price is great compared to others listed on Amazon.  There are twenty pads in the pack (all identical, not left- and right-oriented), and the price per pad is much, much less than in the other offers.</li>
            <li> Good price and good quality.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Good for most glasses but don&#x27;t fit all.  These fit one of my pair of glasses but did not fit the spare pair that I have.</li>
            <li> Item as advertised, nice clear soft plastic on contact area with stronger center attachment. Easily installed with jeweler screwdriver,very confortable.</li>
            <li> These are nice fitting and soft. They also help my glasses from sliding down while I&#x27;m working. Saved several pairs of glasses from the trash can.</li>
            <li> First off they don&#x27;t fit any of my sun glasses, so using them w/o pin is no go.  If you use the pin you have to drill a hole in your glasses and then glue them.  A better choice is to take the pin out and silicone them to your glasses, HOWEVER if you take the pin out there is a valley in the silicone so it would be a mess to attach.  They would be much better w/o the pin so you can attach to sun glasses.  I don&#x27;t even know if you can glue silicone.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Easy install, feels great, just like original.</li>
            <li> They are the right replacement for a failed part on my eyeglasses.  the price is right.  I like them, period.</li>
            <li> this product works great, and easy to be installed. i recommend it , the price is really good, and i did not have with it</li>
            <li> Was looking for a litlle bigger size.</li>
            <li> quality product and fast delivery</li>
            <li> They do do the job and very comfortable will purchase again</li>
            <li> These fit the sort of glasses that have a little square holder for the nosepiece that is held in with a tiny screw.  Does not come with the teeny screws so you need to still have yours or order a set (I ordered Eyeglass and Watch Repair Screw Kit SE 250 pc. for sub five bucks and it had the correct screw) of teeny screws.  None of the screws in my numerous small repair kits had that teeny one. You do need a screw, if you just push them into the holder on your glasses they will fall out pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Resurrected a pair of sunglasses with lost nosepiece.</li>
            <li> My glasses were perfect except that one of the nose pieces broke off.  I was able to find the piece and snap it back on, but this kept happening too often.  Finally, I decided to get replacements.  These nose pieces are soft and will not break in the way that the hard plastic ones do.  And, they are extremely comfortable.  I intend to replace all the hard plastic nose pieces in my family&#x27;s glasses with these.</li>
            <li> I thought I was just ordering one pair, so I was pleasantly surprised that there were 10.  I have replaced the pads on 5 pairs of glasses - these are pretty awesome.  They stay in place nicely and are so much better than regular plastic ones.</li>
            <li> Great repair kit, was able to save my glasses from having to be replaced!  Saved money and time with this</li>
            <li> Other than it getting crushed during shipping and making a good amount unusable, they do the job and are not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a reasonable price. I highly recommend this vendor</li>
            <li> It does the job, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Works great for me.  Cheap and easy to install.  Comfortable too.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, did enlarge my nose!</li>
            <li> Med-large size pad. Very comfortable on my nose bridge. Non slip. Good value.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I was looking for..I got 5 pairs used one pair with several back up pairs.Much cheaper than going by the glasses store and getting them replaced...Was the same quality as one I had got at the glasses store..</li>
            <li> I got a pair of glasses that had two bits of wire bend to hold in the nose pads, if I bumped them or shook them, the pads would come off.. very frustrating for a $200 pair of glasses.. But these saved the day!  They fit perfectly and actually stray in much better than the original ones. I recommend them</li>
            <li> I bought these to use on my prescription glasses. I&#x27;ve had the nose pads replaced by my optometrist before but their replacements kept falling apart. These seem to be made very well but only time will tell. They fit my frames perfectly.</li>
            <li> These nose pads feel better than the original ones that came with my expansive frame. Good buy!</li>
            <li> My silicone piece from my glasses tore of my glasses after wear and tear. I didn&#x27;t want to pay for a new pair of glasses and an eye appointment. I got these and they fit very well. They are a notch bigger than the original eye pieces, but I really don&#x27;t notice at all. Most importantly, they are very comfortable.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both wear glasses, so it&#x27;s nice to have these around.  They are comfortable and fit all of our glasses perfectly.  These are the screw in kind.  They&#x27;re easy enough to change, just unscrew and remove the old ones, put these in place and screw them back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need a tiny screw driver and probably a magnifying glass if you&#x27;re working on your own glasses.  The only thing to watch out for is that you don&#x27;t want to drop those tiny screws.  They&#x27;re a pain to find, particularly if you drop one on a carpeted area...</li>
            <li> These have made a real difference. Much softer than the regular ones. I will never go back.</li>
            <li> These pads work great. I was happy enough with them that I used the spares to replace all the pads on all the glasses of all family members. I then bought another package to have on hand for future use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure to pay attention to the style and size you want, as well as the mounting type (snap-in or screw-on).</li>
            <li> These are just like the ones you get fromthe opticians store. They help keep your glasses from sliding down your nose. Now I do not have to go to the store for these.</li>
            <li> Purchased these becase I lost a nose piece on my glasses.  I seem to lose a lot of them so I need to have some on hand for when I need them.  They work for me.</li>
            <li> Super inexpensive and a quality product!  It fit the nose brackets on my glasses perfectly...love it!</li>
