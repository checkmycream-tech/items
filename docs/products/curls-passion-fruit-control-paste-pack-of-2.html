            <li>This stuff is the perfect hair product except for its size and cost.</li>
            <li>It defines my 4a/4b curly hair texture perfectly!</li>
            <li>Also, sometimes I use a mixture of water and apple cider vinegar on my hair before using this pomade for the best best best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Karen&#x27;s Body Beautiful \\&quot;butter love\\</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for curl definition, not waxy at all in my hair, but there are way cheaper places to get it.</li>
            <li>The product is great.</li>
            <li>I no longer have to worry about unruly pieces deciding to stick up and fly away.  </li>
            <li>but I touch my hair so often throughout the day that it works great for me.</li>
            <li>so it is perfect for very fine Type 4 hair.  </li>

            <li>I absolutely loved the way the curl jelly defined my curls.</li>
            <li>Works for me, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>This product was suggested by my hairdresser and she is always right when it comes to choosing what&#x27;s best for my hair !</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>texture is translucent like a gel (think Kinky Curly) but with amazing hold (unlike Kinky Curly).  </li>
            <li>As a bonus it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Wish it came in a huge tub lol.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s kind of like robbery.</li>
            <li>use it to twist my dreads, as mine are curly rather than kinky, and it holds really nicely.</li>
            <li>With Curls Passion Fruit paste my hair is well defined, soft, has no flakes, and when I separate the strands I still have perfect clumping of my hair.</li>
            <li>I would love to use both the products together.  </li>
            <li>So many brands claim to have a \\&quot;pomade\\&quot; or \\&quot;hold\\&quot; but in reality none of them hold 4c hair.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>ordered this product and love it.  </li>
            <li>MAGIC in a bottle!&lt;br /&gt;KBB is second best to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is unlike Oyin&#x27;s Burnt Sugar (which many like, but it&#x27;s too strong!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>You shouldn&#x27;t pay more than 8 bucks for a 4oz jar.</li>
            <li>but before you reach the door to go out you better have more&lt;</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with the results and will definitely continue to buy it!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff dearly, but its a bit uneconomical</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product but considering you can get it for $7.99 or $8.99 at most stores</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product to use for my hair.</li>

            <li>I can finally enjoy styling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been applying it to my two strands to keep them free from flyaways.</li>

            <li>product has the hold of Karen&#x27;s body Beautiful Love butter without  the heavy feel.  </li>
            <li>Only thing is it smells good</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super defined and clumped together</li>
            <li>(nice shine initially but residue upon drying)&lt;br /&gt;and  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the 8 though...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far my favorite hair</li>
            <li>But it got a 3 star rating because I walked in Right Aid and saw it for $7.99 after I paid $35 for 2. Smh</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use gels or sprays that do not have a high content of natural products even if it&#x27;s more</li>
            <li>But the Curls Passion Fruit side almost made my hair look like curly hair when you first buy it in pack</li>
            <li>I purchased this from target after hearing about how amazing this works on slicking down edges, frizz, and your curls.  </li>
            <li>It really moisturizes my hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;that can really hurt length retention even if hair is growing at a fast rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>available,  because your baby hair will revert back to naps</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake or chg color when wet :)</li>
            <li>The product is GREAT but the price here is seriously crazyness!</li>
            <li>It smells Wonderful and the price wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li>Available online on the Curls website now only in blueberry and for now $10.99, and only comes in 4oz jars.</li>
            <li>I am natural so maybe that&#x27;s why</li>
            <li>Because long, thick and beautiful hair is more important to me than a &amp;#34;tacked down&amp;#34; hairline, I dropped this MESS like a bad habit.</li>
            <li>I have 3b/3c natural curly hair and definitely recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Even online you can get it at Sally beauty supply and other places for it normal retail price.</li>

            <li> Nothing lays my edges down than this product.  It really moisturizes my hair and scalp.  It is not greasy and a little goes a long way.  I ran out of my Shea Moisture Three Butters Utility Gel Mousse and tried this product.  I would love to use both the products together.  I have black ethnic 4a/4b hair that moisture is a must.</li>
            <li> Only thing is it smells good doesn&#x27;t keep my hair in place again I am natural so maybe that&#x27;s why</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Whether your hair is wet or dry its works. I have 4b type hair and it curls and waves my hair. No flaking</li>
            <li> So many brands claim to have a \\&quot;pomade\\&quot; or \\&quot;hold\\&quot; but in reality none of them hold 4c hair.&lt;br /&gt;And when they provide hold, moisture levels tend to suffer.  So usually one has to make a choice,&lt;br /&gt;but not with CURLS&#x27;s \\&quot;Control Paste\\&quot;.  The formula is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product and love it.  In my next order I will order 4-5 bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, I cannot run out of this perfect product.  Here is my five-part review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Hold &amp; No residue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CURLS&#x27; \\&quot;Control Paste\\&quot; has unbeatable hold.  It is  incredible!!!&lt;br /&gt;Holds the ends of the hair to avoid Fairy knots/single stranded knots&lt;br /&gt;that can really hurt length retention even if hair is growing at a fast rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Residue like Kinky Curly  (nice shine initially but residue upon drying)&lt;br /&gt;and  Shea Moisture&#x27;s Enhancing Smoothie  (hair is crunchy once cream dries!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For info, the alternatives for the combination of hold and moisture that I have tried are:&lt;br /&gt;- Karen&#x27;s Body Beautiful \\&quot;butter love\\&quot; (this is second best)&lt;br /&gt;-Curl Junkie&#x27;s butters. (third best)&lt;br /&gt;-Jane Carter&#x27;s nourish and shine (fantastic on Type 3 hair, but useless on type 4),&lt;br /&gt;-Moxie shine pomade,&lt;br /&gt;-Oyin&#x27;s \\&quot;burnt sugar\\&quot; pomade (useless and terrible smell),&lt;br /&gt;-My Honey Child &#x27;s line (Type 4 cream) which had hold and moisture but difficult smell.&lt;br /&gt;-Jessicurl&#x27;s gels&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use gels or sprays that do not have a high content of natural products even if it&#x27;s more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Moisture, no crunch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair stays moisturized even  after hours of applying the cream!&lt;br /&gt;This is not the case of any product tried so far:&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not drying like the alcohol found in some Ecostyler products.&lt;br /&gt;Hair is not left crunchy like SheaMoisture smoothie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Texture of the Paste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is translucent like a gel (think Kinky Curly) but with amazing hold (unlike Kinky Curly).  This control paste also leaves NO RESIDUE, even on the finest of hair (Mine is extremely fine!).&lt;br /&gt;It is light so it is perfect for very fine Type 4 hair.  No heavy Shea butter or other butter for hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has the hold of Karen&#x27;s body Beautiful Love butter without  the heavy feel.  MAGIC in a bottle!&lt;br /&gt;KBB is second best to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Smell&lt;br /&gt;heavenly!!!!! Like all Curls product, the smell is without reproach.&lt;br /&gt;This is unlike Oyin&#x27;s Burnt Sugar (which many like, but it&#x27;s too strong!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Shine&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to see shine lasts on my hair.&lt;br /&gt; My hair is low porosity and has been mat all my life.&lt;br /&gt;But so far, this looks like it is adding shine, which is almost impossible on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In  summary, the CURLS \\&quot;Control paste\\&quot; is the best combination of MOISTURE + HOLD I have tested on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you CURLS!

            <li> This MESS started to damage my hairline/edges.  Do NOT use it on your hairline/edges on a daily basis.  Because long, thick and beautiful hair is more important to me than a &amp;#34;tacked down&amp;#34; hairline, I dropped this MESS like a bad habit. Peace...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying it to my two strands to keep them free from flyaways. It smells Wonderful and the price wasn&#x27;t bad. I wish the jars were bigger but that&#x27;s it. I would/will buy again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I have tried just about every thing for my edges and this is the only product that does what it says it does. Unlike gel, this product can be used day after day and does not look tacky. I&#x27;m stocking up on this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for curl definition, not waxy at all in my hair, but there are way cheaper places to get it. You shouldn&#x27;t pay more than 8 bucks for a 4oz jar. It&#x27;s well worth the 8 though...</li>
            <li> listen this paste does what it says to a point, it lays the hair down but before you reach the door to go out you better have more&lt;br /&gt;past available,  because your baby hair will revert back to naps .believe me it sticks the hair. maybe for 2 to 3 minutes, if that long.&lt;br /&gt;however for a hour or two hold it just not going to happen unless your hair and body temper is ice cold.</li>
            <li> This product was suggested by my hairdresser and she is always right when it comes to choosing what&#x27;s best for my hair !</li>
            <li> The product is great. Nothing lays my hair down all day like this does. Doesn&#x27;t even require a lot. But it got a 3 star rating because I walked in Right Aid and saw it for $7.99 after I paid $35 for 2. Smh</li>
            <li> I purchased this from target after hearing about how amazing this works on slicking down edges, frizz, and your curls.  I have extremely frizzy hair in the front because it&#x27;s shorter when I pull my hair into a ponytail.  Other than gels nothing really works to tame my hair for buns/ponytails.  I tried this product and it works!! I am very impressed with the results and will definitely continue to buy it!  I no longer have to worry about unruly pieces deciding to stick up and fly away.  I have 3b/3c natural curly hair and definitely recommend this product.  Just do not buy on amazon because the price is ridiculously expensive for no reason here.  Buy at Target for way cheaper!</li>
            <li> Highway robbery because the jars were going to bigger 75.00 seriously I&#x27;m demanding a refund.</li>
            <li> They want $73.90 for a two pack of this? That&#x27;s kind of like robbery. You can by them for $7.99 at Target--that&#x27;s like $16.00 for 2. This should be removed or something...&lt;br /&gt;I use it to twist my dreads, as mine are curly rather than kinky, and it holds really nicely.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the perfect hair product except for its size and cost. Its $7.99 at target. Available online on the Curls website now only in blueberry and for now $10.99, and only comes in 4oz jars. I love this stuff dearly, but its a bit uneconomical considering I have a big thick head of 3c/4a/4b hair.</li>
            <li> This works wonders on holding my thick natural hair in place. A lil goes a long way when using this product, go to target it&#x27;s only $7.99.</li>
            <li> The product is GREAT but the price here is seriously crazyness! This is sold locally and even cheaper with the manufacturer! I absolutely loved the way the curl jelly defined my curls. This is now a STAPLE product for me!! See my youtube review !&lt;br /&gt;http://youtu.be/_PD9ql5o7Aw</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product but considering you can get it for $7.99 or $8.99 at most stores I am wondering WHY it&#x27;s so expensive here!?! It&#x27;s sold at Target, Walgreen and Rite Aid to name a few. This type of price gouging is extremely unethical and truly disgusting! Even online you can get it at Sally beauty supply and other places for it normal retail price. Horrible markup...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake or chg color when wet :)</li>
            <li> People that is for a 2- 1.5 lb. container. The ones that are for 7.99 are only 4 oz. So you are paying $95.88 for a total of 48 oz. from your stores. This is cheaper.</li>
            <li> Works for me, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product to use for my hair. It defines my 4a/4b curly hair texture perfectly! Even when I flat iron my hair I don&#x27;t have to worry about this product turning my straightened out hair curly or frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I carry it wherever I go for touch ups too because it requires no wrapping--I hate having to set my hair with a scarf with other products. It slicks down my hair great and doesn&#x27;t have horrible ingredients like mineral oil or other stuff that make my hair revert to a crazy frizzy kinky mess in a few hours. Also it doesn&#x27;t flake or make my hair hard and dry at all especially when I wet my hair first. As a bonus it smells amazing. I use it on my edges AND on the ends of my hair--wet or dry. It&#x27;s by far my favorite hair product!I buy it at Target usually. Wish it came in a huge tub lol. My tip would be to use a little and apply it evenly. Also, sometimes I use a mixture of water and apple cider vinegar on my hair before using this pomade for the best best best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add: To me, it&#x27;s better than eco styler gel for braid or twist-outs. With eco styler gel I get flakes and my hair looks slightly frizzy. With Curls Passion Fruit paste my hair is well defined, soft, has no flakes, and when I separate the strands I still have perfect clumping of my hair. I did a test on both sides of my head with each product with a twists out (wish I could add pictures). But the Curls Passion Fruit side almost made my hair look like curly hair when you first buy it in pack and it&#x27;s super defined and clumped together--some people don&#x27;t like that look but I touch my hair so often throughout the day that it works great for me.</li>
