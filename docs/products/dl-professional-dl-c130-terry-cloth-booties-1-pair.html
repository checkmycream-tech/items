            <li> Great feet mits but they need to fasten a bit smaller . I use them for paraffin wax .</li>
            <li> Very nice and useful.</li>
            <li> I really like these.  Very soft perfect for the female foot. If you are larger than size 10 it won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> These are very thin and don&#x27;t stay on my feet.  It does have Velcro closures but they are at the very end so it doesn&#x27;t help them stay on.</li>
