            <li>This thing is amazing!!</li>
            <li>Spectacular!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried curling my hair and it doesn&#x27;t do a very good job unless you want to put 500 products in your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked very good.</li>
            <li>A friend with &#x27;tons&#x27; of hair that has Great Body, has had wonderful results.    </li>
            <li>The best part about it is that it gives great volume without burning my hair.</li>
            <li>Great Amazon price - best I&#x27;ve seen</li>
            <li>Happily, I was impressed!  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s a good thing!</li>
            <li>and it was a 5 star product that i loved!</li>
            <li>Good Luck!</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>I loved it!  </li>
            <li>I watched a beautiful Hispanic woman style her hair with and InStyler at a fashion show</li>
            <li>It smooths the hair beautifully.</li>
            <li>Even if you suffered with Carole King type hair in your youth you can have beautiful shiny hair</li>
            <li>But when I use the Instyler I always get compliments on how beautiful &amp; shiny my hair is.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product and surprisingly it works just as well as seen on television.</li>
            <li>everybody knows that i have gorgeous hair and asks me how is it so perfect all the time.  </li>
            <li>I asked my hair stylist if my hair was damaged after using it for a couple of months, and she said my hair looks very healthy!  </li>
            <li>but the heat guard is great for novices.</li>
            <li>lol....</li>
            <li>Worked great.</li>
            <li>AND IT LOOKS GREAT,</li>
            <li>It was great.</li>
            <li>The company was prompt in delivery and it arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li>It gives you great height on your crown by overextending while using it.  </li>
            <li>Great price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for styling my hair when the weather is humid.</li>
            <li>But this works great for waves and curves.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>It also works great on my medium texture frizzy hair which has somewhat of a wave.</li>
            <li>Great looking until you pick it up.  </li>
            <li>The instyler works great</li>
            <li>but it works great.</li>
            <li>My device has not quit working as I saw others had experienced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it about 6 months with great results</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>but my hair looks great.</li>
            <li>this is a great concept...</li>
            <li>Great vendor.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t work great for my type of hair.</li>
            <li>I thought it looked great.</li>
            <li>My mom recommended this to me, because she has one, and it works great for her.</li>
            <li>Looked like it would be a great product.  </li>
            <li>InStyler has been a great tool for me.</li>
            <li>The InStyler is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Great product, use it every day.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s just not quality construction, but the idea of it is great.  </li>
            <li>The Instyler works great</li>
            <li>Also great for the humid Florida climate that causes the frizzies.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping it would be great for curling my hair since I saw on TV how it did great on all types of hair.  </li>
            <li>I was really happy with the way it styled my naturally-curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d keep all 3 in case something happened to the one I&#x27;m using, but it&#x27;s been 2 years and it still works great.    </li>
            <li>This is just a great product.  </li>
            <li>My hair is happy and so am I.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for years and it works great EVERY time.  </li>
            <li>This straightner does a great job on my hair.</li>
            <li>And the product did work great... for about two weeks.</li>
            <li>This works great...</li>
            <li>It creates great volume at the crown if you have shorter hair there.</li>
            <li>To all who have given this product great reviews...</li>
            <li>She did her friend&#x27;s hair with it and it turned out great.    </li>
            <li>It looked great</li>
            <li>and it worked great...</li>
            <li>: I will say this: the instyler is great at straightening hair.</li>
            <li>great...</li>
            <li>Great product...</li>
            <li>it took me a couple of times to get used to it, but it works great and curls great.  </li>
            <li>Its a great product but for $100 they need to improve the design AND their customer service.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how great it was.</li>
            <li>This works as a great substitute for that.</li>
            <li>the roller part worked great</li>
            <li>so it looks great</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>Love it !!</li>
            <li>I got this for christmas and absolutely love it!!  </li>
            <li>I recommened this product for sure!!</li>
            <li>I love this!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love mine!!</li>
            <li>and I love it!!</li>
            <li>I find the end result of the Instyler to be very nice.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product!  </li>
            <li>This is perfect because it is a straightener if that is what you want, and it can give you lovely waves if that is what you desire.  </li>
            <li>I have heard so many wonderful things.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled!  </li>
            <li>Streamlined, easy-to-use, and effective!</li>
            <li>This has been the best invention for my hair type for sure.  </li>
            <li>she was thrilled!</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t it murphy&#x27;s law that when you find the very best product that you totally love, the company will either discontinue it or go out of business?&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t it murphy&#x27;s law that when you find the very best product that you totally love, the company will either discontinue it or go out of business?&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>I read the instructions and it said to make sure that you had a good hair cut for the best results.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use - great results !  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, I love it!</li>
            <li>I have really fine wavy hair and it strengthened it perfectly.</li>
            <li>I think for someone with shorter fine hair it would work wonderful.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, it is a great tool and a great design, it could just be built better.  </li>
            <li>Another good thing about this product is that it came with a thermal shield for the barrel and now I wouldn&#x27;t get burned.  </li>
            <li>but this is a good product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen the commercials and wondered if it was as good as they said it was.  </li>
            <li>I figured I loved the immediate results</li>
            <li>I loved this.  </li>
            <li>I just have to say who ever invented this product is a Genius, this product is good for anyone with Striaght hair or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>It curls good and does add a lot of volume</li>
            <li>Good Luck.</li>
            <li>Reviews show that it does a good job on coarser hair that needs the bristles</li>
            <li>This is a good concept, but it needs work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She loved it.</li>
            <li>I use good products on my hair and I can assure you this not one of them.  </li>
            <li>Every product that induces heat on your hair will damage it, which is why it&#x27;s wise to always use thermal protectant sprays.</li>
            <li>A friend had let me try hers when we we&#x27;re at a conference weekend and was delighted to find it for the price at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Of course it isn&#x27;t like as good as</li>
            <li>Fantastic customer service, you are the best!  </li>
            <li>The wife loved it.</li>
            <li>I ordered the instyler for a good price.</li>
            <li>So Good purchase over all.</li>
            <li>However, with a good haircut every four weeks my hair looks</li>
            <li>I had heard of it, but never heard if it was a good deal or not...</li>
            <li>At this point I don&#x27;t care how good your product is, your business ethics SUCK.  </li>
            <li>and I started from the lower temperature, but it was not doing a good job.</li>
            <li>and I got a good result.</li>
            <li>It works just as good as the infomercial.  </li>
            <li>and I really loved what I managed to do with it.</li>
            <li>Good luck,     Dina\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>It is a really good product</li>
            <li>So I purchased it and loved it for 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I would have loved this product when I was</li>
            <li>Then I was told by a friend that she loved the product</li>
            <li>It works great and is easy to use!</li>
            <li>This tool is wonderful and quick to use.</li>
            <li>Great product, make sure you buy it from a authorized dealer.</li>
            <li>after 3 plus uses she is still very satisfied.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used this InStyler one time and am very pleased with the way it makes my hair look.  </li>
            <li>so I went and purchased another CHI; a product which ALWAYS performs great and will for many years to come.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>the sellers were great the product is ok not what they make it out to be</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with my order.  </li>
            <li>It is real easy to use too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shiny, glossy, has volume, and looks very very healthy.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say i loved what it did for my hair and got lots of compliments</li>
            <li>I just wanted to share how I love my instyler, it is so easy and always makes my hair perfect!</li>
            <li>I really am enjoying this iron!</li>
            <li>I love the instyler!  </li>
            <li>I think it would&#x27;ve looked better if hadn&#x27;t done it at all!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It probably works better with people who have thicker hair like me!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>&amp; I love it!</li>
            <li>To top it all off--it doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I decided against purchasing the Instyler!</li>
            <li>Love the InStyler (with painted arrows!)</li>
            <li>I would definately recommend getting this product - I love it and my hair looks amazing!</li>
            <li>and I fell in love!  </li>
            <li>I love my Instyler!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both love this product!  </li>
            <li>I love this item!  </li>
            <li>Best seller that I have deal with, at first I wasn&#x27;t completly satified with the instyler</li>
            <li>I AM IN LOVE!</li>
            <li>I am more upset with the seller than I am the product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought 3 of these they gives me the most luxurious curls ever!  </li>
            <li>one of the best and most unique feature of this styler is that it brushes your hair while curling it so you can always run your fingers through your hair.</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>The Instyler is easy to use and works great on my hair.</li>
            <li>When I bought this item I was expecting it to give me beautiful hair with just the right amount of shine!</li>
            <li>The video makes it look amazing, and was looking forward to getting two of them for my daughters for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>and it worked amazingly.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels silky smooth and my ends look and feel great.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing, not kidding.</li>
            <li>It is just an amazing tool.  </li>
            <li>give you an amazing shine look.  </li>
            <li>This appliance is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Ive had the instyler for about 6 months now and it is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>Be your own critic....</li>
            <li>and this is absolutely the best product on the market for my hair.</li>
            <li>There is one thing I read in the instrucions that said: do not use any kind of styling products if using this.</li>
            <li>I used it the way they showed and I have straight perfect hair.  </li>
            <li>:) Now, I always have a way to make it look good.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s a nice product</li>
            <li>ive heard many good things about this product im going to get it.</li>
            <li>i really think this is a perfect gift for any guy to buy a women,  </li>
            <li>i cut my own hair and used the instyler</li>
            <li>Its kinda noisy, but it was a nice product.</li>
            <li>Again, nice product but not for me.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to have done business with her.  </li>
            <li>Brush your hair well to get the product nicely distributed.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li>And I liked how this iron works</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice for smoothing and shaping the rest of my hair when I have time.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair that I&#x27;ve had relaxed and it works GREAT!!  </li>
            <li>It worked wonderfully on my hair, leaving it straight and shiny.  </li>
            <li>With this unit, it takes 5-10 minutes at my own house.</li>
            <li>This person was not as nice, so I demanded a refund number because my 30 day trial was running out.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed at how fast I got my hair done, but really it isn&#x27;t $100 impressive.</li>
            <li>It even comes with its own carrying case.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that one of these days it will just stay off for good, so I need to buy another straightener.</li>
            <li>IF YOU WANT STRAIGHT, SHINY, BEAUTIFUL NON-FRIZZY HAIR!!!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>I liked the look but not what it made my hair feel like.</li>
            <li>After using a friends instyler, I wanted one of my own</li>
            <li>I have never had any luck straightening my hair on my own..</li>
            <li>No hair product of any kind is on the non-returnable list.</li>
            <li>It did not rip or pull my hair, which was nice.</li>
            <li>but my hair seems dryer and not as nice.  </li>
            <li>, HOWEVER I WISH IT HAD SOME KIND OF RUBBER</li>
            <li>and then I use the instyler to do my bangs because it creates a nice flip.</li>
            <li>I have never gotten my hair to hold any kind of curl.</li>
            <li>You should be conditioning your hair and using some of kind of heat protectant no matter what styling tool your are using.</li>
            <li>It is a nice tool, but I would have stuck with the $20 hair styler from Wal-Mart if I had an opportunity to use the instyler before I purchased it.</li>
            <li>After 5 months, it started catching my hair and tearing it out.  </li>
            <li>It really makes my hair look great!</li>
            <li>The commercial made it seem like the greatest product on the earth that would make me happy with how my hair would turn out.</li>
            <li>I liked that there was an attachment</li>
            <li>It does appear to polish the strands as stated on TV and it does give the hair a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Like I said, it does a nice job straightening my hair</li>
            <li>My cousin bought one, I tried it &amp; liked the results.</li>
            <li>Also miss some kind of stand for it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, the InStyler is an effective product.  </li>
            <li>and it puts a nice curl on the ends.</li>
            <li>I heard so many good things about this</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE my instyler!!  </li>
            <li>My biggest gripe is that instead of the hair coming out nice and smooth as shown on TV, it seems to grab the hair underneath and pull it up backwards through the bristles, which makes a VERY nice \\&quot;rat&#x27;s nest\\&quot; for you to have to try to comb out.</li>
            <li>Plus give it more than one shot, nothing is perfect the first time you do it.</li>
            <li>If you value healthy, full hair, and good customer service, DO NOT BUY THE INSTYLER!  </li>
            <li>Well, I was blown away by how incredible easy and fun it was to use!  </li>
            <li>It was very quick and I loved it.    </li>
            <li>With the instyler everything goes quickly and my hair looks great.  </li>
            <li>Great price, Quick Shipping</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
            <li>Hair still frizzed VERY easily     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s said to protect your hair from being burned, but its still very easy to burn your hair on it.</li>
            <li>I find it very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Also the design of this makes burning yourself very easy.</li>
            <li>It has helped keep my hair more healthy and the product helps the hair shine!  </li>
            <li>AND I CAN STYLE MY HAIR PERFECTLY AND LOOKS SHINE AND FEEL SOFT.</li>
            <li>I am glad I own it</li>
            <li>I liked the way it gave volume to the top of my head but after two uses the product stopped working.  </li>
            <li>The information on it and commercials talk about how great it is for fine hair and how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li>Oh well, the fact is that this is a great styling tool and well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best styling tool i have ever owned!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite proficient with a hair brush and blow dryer, but I bought this product because it seemed like it would save time and be more effective in terms of styling.</li>
            <li>and this was the first time that I&#x27;ve done my own hair and LOVED the result and had it looking somewhat better than how the Salon does it!  </li>
            <li>Everyone said it worked great on all types of hair, when it didn&#x27;t even work right on mine.</li>
            <li>I know, great buy right?</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I have very fine, below the shoulder hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>This transaction was so easy!</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend this product for someone with very fine hair....</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!</li>
            <li>but my sister did (because i gave it to her because that&#x27;s how much i didn&#x27;t like it) and that didn&#x27;t work good for her either!</li>
            <li>It is the greatest thing since slice bread as us more mature folks would say.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>the full effect.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to burn yourself if you don&#x27;t use the heat shield!</li>
            <li>The InStyler ratating hot iron hair straightener is great.   </li>
            <li>and it worked great at first.  </li>
            <li>It worked great for the first two weeks - after that all downhill.  </li>
            <li>Product works great at first.  </li>
            <li>The inStyler is great because we got one with a protective counter topper to lie the hot styler on, and it came with an instructional DVD.</li>
            <li>You can tell it is very cheap quality when you get it.</li>
            <li>It seems like it is made very cheap.</li>
            <li>VERY IMPORTANT</li>
            <li>So far... loving the Instyler!!  </li>
            <li>This did make my hair look nice and it was easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and I loved doing it in the morning when my hair wasn&#x27;t necessarily looking its best.</li>
            <li>But as far as the product itself, it&#x27;s very good.  </li>
            <li>I definitely have to give this thing a perfect 5 out of 5.</li>
            <li>I love the Instyler.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>so make sure you hang onto it--</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t straighten well and burned my hair even more.</li>
            <li>I have a great spray on product I used before drying my hair and loved the results, but without it my hair gets the fly-aways from static &amp; low humidity.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t this precious?    </li>
            <li>AND I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I WILL SURELY ORDER ME</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s safe from ruining anything else.      </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.   </li>
            <li>I tested this many times and it was no mistake.</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments at work</li>
            <li>We all love it.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use this out of the box with no problems.  </li>
            <li>maybe I was better informed.  </li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with the Instyler from the 1st day of use.</li>
            <li>I was able to use the InStyler for 5 minutes...before it broke.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I love curling my hair with it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found within 10 to 15 minutes my hair is nice and smooth.     </li>
            <li>The best part is, I&#x27;ve been able to get away from styling it daily.</li>
            <li>:)     </li>
            <li>I get more compliments on my hair now since using the InStyler.  </li>
            <li>But I am getting better at using it.</li>
            <li>I thought it was okay.  </li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll be spending a lot of time together.</li>
            <li>For $80, you can get a hair straightener about 100x better than this one, believe me.</li>
            <li>, It is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I give this product 5 stars and hope they decide to make them in various barrel sizes for everyone to be able to experience this wonderful product!</li>
            <li>add, pleased don&#x27;t purchase this product, you will regret it,</li>
            <li>I doubt if many women need two of them.</li>
            <li>Bottom Line at the Top</li>
            <li>Would surely break in no time if I didn&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li>better then any straightener iron.</li>
            <li>I am not at all pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Until last week, my daughter had waist-length hair, and it worked wonderfully on her hair, too.  </li>
            <li>probably even better than before.  </li>
            <li>Plus I paid more.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>If the barrel is placed on top of the hair, the hair flips out.</li>
            <li>this is okay...</li>
            <li>and I love it howver</li>
            <li>More importently</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 10 months and love it for its ease of use</li>
            <li>So I am always looking for a better way to straighten and style my hair.</li>
            <li>All in all my ISO straightner is much better and much better constucted too.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better to be safe than sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the InStyler.</li>
            <li>and they are all better.  </li>
            <li>and she was so pleased.</li>
            <li>I would suggest this product if it were better designed.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Use a defrizz product to go with it - I love John Frieda \\&quot;Frizz Ease\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I gather up about the top 80% of my hair into a clip or pony tail and start with the hair underneath.  </li>
            <li>Your better off using a more reliable heating tool brand.</li>
            <li>I bought the Instyler after seeing how it \\&quot;polishes\\&quot; your hair and gives it a healthy bounce.  </li>
            <li>I have been pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>hope you have better results with it than me.</li>
            <li>I love the</li>
            <li>it did these adorable flips...</li>
            <li>and I see better results with a Target straightener than with a tv styler.</li>
            <li>Love my InStyler</li>
            <li>and i think if it were made with a ceramic roller it would be much better...</li>
            <li>I am ok with that.</li>
            <li>I love it more and more</li>
            <li>I know people prob get it most for straightening their hair</li>
            <li>I borrowed the Instyler from my friend and I am glad to say I did not purchase one.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>With this one product I&#x27;m able to put away my straightener and curling iron.</li>
            <li>Product arrived in short amount of time and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>:)      </li>
            <li>I can make my hair straight, curled under or flip up, and it has great body.    </li>
            <li>The top of the cylinder part of the iron fell off.  </li>
            <li>I think that this product could have been made with better quality.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it at walmart</li>
            <li>It worked ok.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I still use it when I am going out and want to look more finished.</li>
            <li>Her hair looks shiney, straight, and has great volume.</li>
            <li>Even during incredibly humid weather her hair holds and look good without the expected frizzies.</li>
            <li>I have tried every product on the planet to make my hair more manageable, from leave-in treatments to curlers to revolving brushes, but NOTHING comes close to the Instyler.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Instyler.  </li>
            <li>make sure it lasts longer, is made better and provide better customer service.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t even use the leftover heat to do any more hair.</li>
            <li>I got the instyler for christmas and was phsyced, but after a use or two is started making static-ey noises and wouldnt stay on for more than five seconds.</li>
            <li>simply the best and faster</li>
            <li>I think more of these \\&quot;complaints\\&quot; are user error.    </li>
            <li>Holding the rotating barrel on the top side of your hair gets rid of those fly-aways</li>
            <li>I just love this thing.  </li>
            <li>and then I will not be able to return it.</li>
            <li>Also I put the barrel on the TOP of my scalp, not on the bottom.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with it, but not in love with it.  </li>
            <li>i love this product.  </li>
            <li>but, i love it</li>
            <li>my friends say my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>Brought as a gift for my aunt and she love it.</li>
            <li>I do truly love this product.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>So all In all I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am trying all kinds of styles ALL the time now, I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I have had frizzy/wavy hair all my life and have NEVER been able to straighten it until the Instyler.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended the Instyler, she&#x27;d never been able to straighten her hair either.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t care that another style would look better on me.  </li>
            <li>This product is better than using a culing iron if you have to use heat on your hair.</li>
            <li>But the in-styler makes it look healthy.</li>
            <li>months - calling the companies themselves to try and reverse the charges, most of which they will not do.  </li>
            <li>I love it for my hair also.</li>
            <li>Most things I buy are crappy but I will say NOT this item..</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re left-handed, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a much better product then what was delivered.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I order from them because  a month after I purchased the Instyler they send me a plastic that prevents you from burning.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this styler.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, it didn&#x27;t curl at all.  </li>
            <li>I hope it works better on you than it did for me.</li>
            <li>I could wear a relaxed do which garnered many compliments.  </li>
            <li>it had all the authentic documentation; she had no comment on that.  </li>
            <li>My Instyler cannot be repaired, and my $80 is gone along with my hopes of a straighter more flattering hair style.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic</li>
            <li>The quality is top of the line.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>AND MAKES MY HAIR NICE AND SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>and then you will have better results  4.Use heat protection product when using</li>
            <li>but I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I am stil in love with it.</li>
            <li>I watched the advertisements many times and was convinced that this was a miracle hair tool.</li>
            <li>i LOVE this hair tool.  </li>
            <li>She said to make sure the iron is ceramic.</li>
            <li>So on top of using my non dominate hand, the heating element is exposed which can lead to some pain.</li>
            <li>i love flips and volume.</li>
            <li>with the InStyler, i am able to do just that.</li>
            <li>They are lightweight, they have cute colors, and it does what it is supposed to, which is straighten your hair.</li>
            <li>I think that is an a ok product.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to work</li>
            <li>When looking for a job, it is a neater more polished look than an afro-bush.   </li>
            <li>I have a short to medium length bob, so this should have been the perfect styling tool.</li>
            <li>Perhaps that is the reason it works so much better on TV.</li>
            <li>and I find that it works much better on my hair.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I purchased this item on Amazon because I am returning mine for a refund.</li>
            <li>you must have already pretty amazing hair!</li>
            <li>My hair did not look healthy or moisturized.</li>
            <li>WE ONLY WANT THE BEST</li>
            <li>and I cannot express how much I love it.  </li>
            <li>I cannot stand to spend more then fifteen minutes on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this machine.  </li>
            <li>It is so much more than a straightener.  </li>
            <li>I may end up buying it because I miss the compliments I&#x27;ve gotten... :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I love love love how my hair comes out.  </li>
            <li>I have had an Instyler for 2 years now and LOVE the results.  </li>
            <li>I am enjoying it and my hair shines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certainly glad that I didn&#x27;t pay $99.00 for this piece of junk.</li>
            <li>Love this product!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>and I love the body.</li>
            <li>It needs to spend a bit more time in the development department, though.  </li>
            <li>I love my instyler</li>
            <li>I got an Instyler from a friend &amp; I really LOVE it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great product!</li>
            <li>the amount of shine you get is believable.</li>
            <li>most of time i have curly hair</li>
            <li>I may have gotten better results if I fried my hair in it, but again this defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li>It only took me about 15 to 20 minutes and my hair looks awesome.</li>
            <li>Be sure you watch the dvd and not just hop in and start going..</li>
            <li>I bought this item more to try and curl my hair so please if you are looking to purchase to control</li>
            <li>I gave it a 3star and not a 2 because it does straighten well, but my $20 straightener does a better job.  </li>
            <li>After spending 10-15 minutes with Instyler, it looks like fantastic!</li>
            <li>My ponytail crease is gone and the back looks flawless.</li>
            <li>so I used it 3 more days and</li>
            <li>Maybe I should order two more...</li>
            <li>Maybe I should order two more...</li>
            <li>The Instyler leaves your hair with shine and volume, but make sure to use products that will protect your hair from the heat.</li>
            <li>Overall great product!</li>
            <li>With those options, you would have a better functioning straightening iron.</li>
            <li>This product fries your hair which causes more frizz.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and easy to straighten and flip.</li>
            <li>I received the instyler very quickly which was great, it didn&#x27;t power up at first and when it did, it wouldn&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li>Honestly, my $25 flat iron was more impressive.</li>
            <li>I was very excited when I bought my Instyler, but the item came incomplete.</li>
            <li>They were great &amp; I recieved my product just as they said I would; brand new and in record time!</li>
            <li>The InStyler barrel gets really hot &amp; I guess this is the reason it can work hair as effectively as it does - curls hold up amazingly.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Conair hot air curling combo with the 1.5\\&quot; barrel since 1997 ( and I have been through too many to count) and have always loved it.</li>
            <li>My hair looks better than I could have done on my own, works quickly</li>
            <li>Without reading the directions the first time my hair came out good and in 7 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job to straighten hair, looks sort of like a blow out from the salon.   </li>
            <li>The InStyler is first and foremost a straightener, so if you&#x27;re looking for a good straightener, this might be for you.</li>
            <li>It is very akward to use and seems like it is in the perspective of a person doing your hair instead of you doing your own hair!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that what I got was original!  </li>
            <li>I bought a new one at a kohls store and it works great.</li>
            <li>The styler is seriously great, its one of the few ones that straighten out your hair and make it look great.</li>
            <li>It perfectly straightening my hair (mind you when it was already dry,</li>
            <li>The insert says that you can use the iron on damp hair but they recommend it to be used on dry hair with no product in it for the best results.</li>
            <li>I was able to use it easily without even reading instructions.  </li>
            <li>This item would probably work best on a person with semi straight or straight hair.</li>
            <li>With that said, this device for MY hair is the single best thing that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I made the purchase, and at such a good price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not any more clunky than anything else I&#x27;ve used and is light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something we both enjoy :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE the way it makes my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>I have never wrote a review before but so far this tool has been great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found a faster, more efficient way to straighten my hair silky smooth without product.  </li>
            <li>It does continue to spin, and gets the job done, just with a lot of noise that seems like more than just the sound of a motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best $80 I ever spent.</li>
            <li>I loved the unit so much, though, I bought another one.</li>
            <li>It even takes my hair stylist a good 45 minutes to get my hair completely straight.  </li>
            <li>I recommend the Instyler to everone that wants gorgeous hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and quick.</li>
            <li>About a month ago my daughter bought one, works perfectly on her very fine medium lenght, wavy, limp hair.  </li>
            <li>** and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is SUPER wonderful in that they will take back a product even YEARS after you bought it, if it breaks, and with the receipt.</li>
            <li>After using the product I was pleased with how quickly it worked the magic of straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>I had so many compliments from friends and clients that I feel this product was well worth the investment I made on purchasing it!  </li>
            <li>Your product is indeed a true Hair Miracle!</li>
            <li>Other irons are easier to work with, but I like this one best.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use .</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle and operate.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.   </li>
            <li>Any humidity will curl and frizz my hair, so being able to plug this in, wait a few seconds and shape my bangs has been wonderful.  </li>
            <li>and it is so easy.</li>
            <li>and it straightens very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Easy to burn yourself.  </li>
            <li>It looks long, shiny, HEALTHY and beautiful all the time</li>
            <li>Any accidents could easily send you to a hospital.  </li>
            <li>It was really easy to use</li>
            <li>Its really easy to give it volume</li>
            <li>AND IT IS EASY TO USE</li>
            <li>and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>it seems like its easy if you&#x27;re straightening someone&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so easy to use an after watching the video I feel like a pro.</li>
            <li>The InStyler was easy to use and the styling results were just as advertised.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;2.The brush part doesnt stay in very good condition for long at all.</li>
            <li>Ok we&#x27;ve all seen the infomercial and thought right this will work for me if I had 50 people in the bathroom with me every morning!</li>
            <li>It made it smoother than it has every been (I have a lot of fine, wavy hair that dries easily).</li>
            <li>It works phenomenally &amp; I use it every day...by far the quickest most effective way I&#x27;ve found to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>buy it but make sure you can return with a full refund.  </li>
            <li>If you do not give me a FULL refund of every penny you debited from my now compromised account, I will be contacting the Better Business Bureau.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s $50 impressive, and if they ever go down to that price or lower</li>
            <li>The shipping and cost was good, the product itself didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>After I figured out that the barrel should be rotating in the direction that I was pulling it, then it worked fine.</li>
            <li>it gives my fine, wavy hair body and straightness.  </li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair that has a tendency to frizz.  </li>
            <li>I did not try any styling techniques such as flipping it out, but I will say I thought the product was pretty awesome!</li>
            <li>but it is fairly fine</li>
            <li>In fact, reading a lot of these reviews, I found that you are lucky if it lasts more than a year.</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels great and this little appliance has made my life more manageable!    </li>
            <li>I have slightly fine yet wavy hair that had so many fly aways if I tried to blow dry it.  </li>
            <li>Although sometimes I felt like a little girl with the perfect curl at the end.</li>
            <li>The likelyhood of burning yourself is very real!!  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li>I have wavy fine hair that wants to frizz and do its own thing.  </li>
            <li>I not only received the product wrapped very securely with a nice note, but a free gift as well!</li>
            <li>is SO easy and worth every penny!</li>
            <li>What a huge disapointment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge pain and has a mind of</li>
            <li>They are cheaply made and don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>and it made my hair shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>overall i am happy with it and some of the reasons why are the time and money.  </li>
            <li>The initial results are GREAT.  </li>
            <li>Great explanations on how to use it for different hairstyles.  </li>
            <li>It also leaves the hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>and you are welcome to have it back to test or</li>
            <li>At any rate, it&#x27;s a fabulous product for us.  </li>
            <li>so it will have some sound.  </li>
            <li>overall its not that great,</li>
            <li>It just doesnt give you a smooth straightening.</li>
            <li>The InStyler makes your hair silky and smooth or wavy or curly - whatever your mood.</li>
            <li>plastic switch moves around in it&#x27;s groove when lightly touched - hence could be sturdier.  </li>
            <li>The rotating bristles helps to smooth while straighten your hair, it does all the work of combing for you.</li>
            <li>For the short period of time that it worked, it worked great.</li>
            <li>The bristles are cheap plastic and just knots your hair up.</li>
            <li>and I got a ton of compliments on how smooth my hair was.</li>
            <li>Instead of the smooth, polished look</li>
            <li>My primary concern is the durability of the design and the return policies.</li>
            <li>I use it in the morning to smooth out my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair does not look as smooth and silky without the serum.    </li>
            <li>It worked great prior to breaking</li>
            <li>and it felt cheap.</li>
            <li>I was none too happy when I had to buy another entire unit just because the bristles were pooped out.    </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product because you can straighten, curl, and style your hair all in one.</li>
            <li>are too great to justify the big price tag.  </li>
            <li>had a cheap $15 hair straightener from Walgreens before this</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the quality of my item was just as nice as advertised.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that my hair looks as great as it could be because I only used it once</li>
            <li>For the price, it should spin smoothly and somewhat quieter than it</li>
            <li>An item that breaks within months of purchase is cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I need to run the Instyler through my roots twice to make it smooth.</li>
            <li>So far I have not found it too helpful with curling hair, just seems good to straighten.   </li>
            <li>I think it is a really good product so far.</li>
            <li>made my hair looked shiney and healthy, but right after I washed it</li>
            <li>When I would try using it the top would come right off while it was spinning.  </li>
            <li>Negatives: It gets AWFULLY HOT!!  </li>
            <li>Really!!!</li>
            <li>Very worth the price.  </li>
            <li>My niece who has unbelieveably long and curly hair that always looks untamed has used this and has had far more impressive results.</li>
            <li>You can do pretty much everything the instyler does with a good straightener.  </li>
            <li>The process is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>and I was able to get it very straight by using this iron.</li>
            <li>but I am excited to see the results.</li>
            <li>It was much to hot even at the lowest setting for my hair and burned it more than straightened it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results so far.      </li>
            <li>and so I was really excited to get it.</li>
            <li>My daughter was excited to get this after seeing all the advertising.  </li>
            <li>I was SO Excited to get the In-Styler.  </li>
            <li>I received this as a gift for mother&#x27;s day and was excited to try it since i have frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, but it is super fine.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have super baby fine hair...</li>
            <li>Worth it!  </li>
            <li>and they said because it was bought on Amazon the original 1 yr warrantee is not valid.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this product at first.</li>
            <li>Even if I was able to straighten it (as well as it possibly could, which isn&#x27;t really all that great)</li>
            <li>I went home that night, excited to see what the InStyler could do.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I were so excited seeing this on tv and decided to purchase two.  </li>
            <li>But for the one person using it, it&#x27;s not user friendly.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s all because that&#x27;s what it was originally made for, I believe.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE straight hair (coming from a person who&#x27;s had fuzzy hair for 64 years!)  </li>
            <li>It is unique</li>
            <li>In addition, its not user friendly.</li>
            <li>Maybe this tool was originally intended for use of DOING someone elses hair.</li>
            <li>I have one of the original</li>
            <li>super quick!    </li>
            <li>But I needed something as most hot irons were breaking and burning my hair.  </li>
            <li>I am excited beyond belief.  </li>
            <li>I got this and was so excited to get it.</li>
            <li>My wife had seen the infomercial for this item and was excited about what it offered.  </li>
            <li>but the iron is so easy to use and really works!!</li>
            <li>So the bottom line is that I get great looking hair with the most minimal effort, and that is worth the world to me since I&#x27;m a very low-maintenance person who still wants to look good.    </li>
            <li>Left my hair sleek and soft, the ends perfect!  </li>
            <li>I suppose this would be great to use after you&#x27;ve already straightened or blow dried your hair but want a more styled look.</li>
            <li>I have medium length straight hair &amp; the InStyler does a good fast job of providing curls where I need them.</li>
            <li>The Iron gets very hot so its important to put the protector on to protect your skin from burning.  </li>
            <li>The very first swipe I took with this device I knew I had made a huge mistake.</li>
            <li>I found the best price at Amazon and didn&#x27;t hesitate ordering from Amazon as I have had such good luck in the past with anything I ordered from them.  </li>
            <li>Works effectively &amp; v quickly (in seconds) in the place of having your hair in rollers (eeeeK! never!) and gets one ready for appointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does run through your hair very smoothly without any friction, but it doesnt get it as straight as it claims that it does, and THATS</li>
            <li>I have an original Instyler (Zebra print) which I bought from Canada and  love it so much.</li>
            <li>It works alright, but it isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d leave that for special</li>
            <li>If you have half a brain and want good hair, order this!</li>
            <li>so it took me 30 mins to give my self a cute full bodied straight do with the ends curled under.   </li>
            <li>I have thick, curly hair and it perfectly straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>It does not work as good as a regular straightener.   </li>
            <li>the conair infiniti red colored straighter that worked good, but took away some of the volume</li>
            <li>You can do a curl under/flip and curl the ends of any lengths you have, but full blown curls or body in your bangs is not going to happen.  </li>
            <li>short now it isn&#x27;t as good.  </li>
            <li>It is much fuller and gives  it more body.  </li>
            <li>i would love to return this to the person i bought it from it does not work as much as i paid for it</li>
            <li>So I decided to spend the extra money and get one at Wal-Mart (since they have a good return policy and don&#x27;t charge people for returning Christmas gifts that were given to them ...</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so bouncy and full of life.</li>
            <li>- my advice - don&#x27;t take too much hair, start from the most underneath hair and work up.  </li>
            <li>So my sweet daughter purchased one for me as a surprise.</li>
            <li>this iron may work better on really really curly or course hair.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good enough product.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really curl your hair with this any better than you can a regualar straightener.    </li>
            <li>I have thick and curly hair, and it makes my hair look awesome.</li>
            <li>I waited for the iron to cool and tried to fix it, but to no avail.  </li>
            <li>I can see how this would be a downfall for others with thinner hair as the intense heat does make the styling process a bit more cautionary.    </li>
            <li>and I am glad that I bought it because it really works</li>
            <li>I Wasn&#x27;t sure about paying so much for it</li>
            <li>The advertisements that are shown on tv seem to let people know it works better than what it really does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to do my whole head of hair in under an hour -- and with the Instyler, I&#x27;m done in 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it ever reached full power.</li>
            <li>So, obviously, this has not been a good experience for me.  </li>
            <li>I made sure she watched it, and after viewing that very easy-to-follow video, I let her try it out.</li>
            <li>My daughter used it herself on her hair and it didn&#x27;t look as good as with a regular straightner</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy and has so much volume.  </li>
            <li>The hair looks more naturally straight.</li>
            <li>I was standing around at Target waiting for my RX to be filled and the Instyler was right there.  </li>
            <li>Dangerously hot, the shape of this makes it easy to be flimsy and fall.</li>
            <li>First off you can get burned easily with the product.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and consistently produces salon quality results.  </li>
            <li>I have also tried using it and then quickly taking each heated hair section and rolling onto jumbo velcro roller and letting it set and cool for 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Since the barrel rotates your able to curl and do other very cute hair styles.</li>
            <li>It did/does a nice job on my fine shoulder length hair, though admittedly I do not use it daily.</li>
            <li>It looks a little bit cheaply made with the silver-painted plastic, but it has worked great for me for 6 months now with no signs of quitting.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a great addition to her other styling tools and gave it to her for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Now on full power it does get very hot</li>
            <li>It is true that it&#x27;s very hot</li>
            <li>Forgo this overpriced product and stick with a good quality flat iron.</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy a good quality flat iron instead.</li>
            <li>It lays very flat and no matter what I just can&#x27;t get any good volume on my hair.  </li>
            <li>This Rotating Hot Iron works just fine.  </li>
            <li>my hair is pretty fine</li>
            <li>It is quick.</li>
            <li>I gave it the 2 stars because it straightens and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>Her hair stayed smooth and frizz free, if not stick straight, all day.  </li>
            <li>In styler because it straighten quick</li>
            <li>I ordered my Instyler and added the quick shipping to the order to expedite the delivery.</li>
            <li>I have finally found something I love to use with my hair and love my hair all day.</li>
            <li>Neither of us has had a problem with tangling, and the results have been quick and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>The main thing I love about it is that it works on all hair types.</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;The commercials are appealing but the actual product itself needs more work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have been using for two years, it styles my hair quickly and nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I straightened that section so quickly.</li>
            <li>I DO like the way my hair looks after I&#x27;ve used it &amp; it does stay stylish for a few days (or maybe it&#x27;s the good haircut).</li>
            <li>I tried it right away because I was so excited...</li>
            <li>If mine ever breaks I will GLADLY pay full price for a new one now</li>
            <li>Even on the lowest setting, this is a very hot product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>It is very hot and applies heat from both sides.  </li>
            <li>Gets very hot on lightest setting so even with heat spray, I wonder about damage.  </li>
            <li>It holds gorgeous curls ALL NIGHT LONG even in humid temperatures.</li>
            <li>Spend the extra and make sure you get an original!</li>
            <li>It works beautifully for my thick relatively fine shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I was happy with the results enough to contemplate purchasing my own.</li>
            <li>I said, surely you can send me a new one, since you are the supervisor, and its just 13 months since purchase.  </li>
            <li>The item came brand new in the box and thought it had done an ok job.</li>
            <li>It makes it fast and easy to get my hair done in minutes.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and fast styling.</li>
            <li>When I first starting using it - I loved it.  </li>
            <li>so if one breaks I can have perfect hair as long as the 2nd one lasts.</li>
            <li>so if one breaks I can have perfect hair as long as the 2nd one lasts.</li>
            <li>the spinning side of it is the part that gets hot!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s HOT!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s maybe not as hot as most, you have to go slower and more than once on smaller sections.</li>
            <li>B002L5THSI The Original InStyler Rotating Hot Iron Hair Straightener]]</li>
            <li>and I love the InStyler for natural curves and no frizz!</li>
            <li>I get the exact same results as the salon and so many compliments on how healthy and shiny my hair looks.</li>
            <li>Hellloooooo, it&#x27;s a HOT IRON people!</li>
            <li>it is HOT!</li>
            <li>While I have been interested in this product and was ecstatic that I might have found a bargain; service from this vendor is not efficient or customer friendly.</li>
            <li>I look like I actually have shiny healthy hair!</li>
            <li>B002L5THSI The Original InStyler Rotating Hot Iron Hair Straightener]]I had seen someone else use one at the gym where I work out and it seemed to do well for her.  </li>
            <li>the original i wish i had listened to my hair stylest and bought that one in the first place.</li>
            <li>Hi,  I am a professional triathlete with shoulder length, fine and curly hair!  </li>
            <li>UNLESS you have straight, fine hair</li>
            <li>I truly appreciate this website for allowing consumers to research what their purchasing before hand, its truly worth it to know exactly what your buying!</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure that the model I purchased from Amazon is an older model.  </li>
            <li>So, my husband went and bought an InStyler for me that night, and I showered and let my hair air dry most of the way, then used the InStyler, and my hair was AMAZINGLY full, not frizzy, pretty, tamed, and AWESOME in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see a huge difference</li>
            <li>My hair did not come out smooth and straight at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had curly hair but wanted smooth, straight styles.  </li>
            <li>If you can afford to pay around 100 bucks to replace it every two weeks, then it&#x27;s a great product, otherwise don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li>makes my hair so smooth &amp; straight.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth the purchase</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I&#x27;m writing a product review, which I never do, because I want to make sure enough people buy this so that it&#x27;ll always be on the market for the times I need to replace the device.</li>
            <li>And now the compliments flow more frequently.</li>
            <li>I WOULD SAY IT&#x27;S WORTH $1.</li>
            <li>Puff it up where it needs it, straighten out some wild gray hair at my temples and add just enough curve at the bottom to be an attractive semi-pageboy style.</li>
            <li>The only drawback would be that I feel like I need to always uplug it because it always feels slightly warm if I leave it plugged.</li>
            <li>I guess that makes it worth having.</li>
            <li>I had to figure out how to use it properly,but since then I have had nothing but success with it.</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t place too much hair in the barrel, and don&#x27;t go too fast, it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>but......as far as curling my hair goes I absoluetly LOVE it</li>
            <li>I think that its worth what you pay for it because it can both straighten or curl your hair in one easy-to-use tool.</li>
            <li>Not only has this saved my money and time but it has effectively changed my life.    </li>
            <li>I regrettably ordered the in styler off the internet and while I like my curling iron, it is by no means worth the money or the headache the company has caused for me.  </li>
            <li>Instead I order the old revo styler spinner brush that had work way better for me, than this thing.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and using the instyler takes 15 minutes at the most once it&#x27;s heated up.  </li>
            <li>My hair looked unpolished, frizzy, and, to be quite honest, lion mane like which is the opposite goal of what straightening your hair is supposed to achieve.  </li>
            <li>Also make sure NOTHING is near the InStyler while it is heating up.  </li>
            <li>It is worth buying if you want to manage your hair.</li>
            <li>I am 62 years old and all my friends ask me \\&quot;what kind of shampoo I use\\&quot; because my hair really shine, so I tell them about the iron.</li>
            <li>Big barrel curling irons do give it some nice body and</li>
            <li>get a golden plated chi</li>
            <li>Then, I will get on every website and every blog on every search engine I possibly can and post this email to make sure that no other innocent consumers get ripped off by your company!     </li>
            <li>I even had my friend who is a professional hair stylist watch me to make sure I was doing it right.  </li>
            <li>this product is easy enough to use for the most part but it&#x27;s not as awesome as the tv commercials show it to be; it leaves my hair pretty much the same as when i use a flat iron.</li>
            <li>It will work fine if the hair is permed or pressed straight first, but of course applying triple heat defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li>You have to figure out how the hold it in order to get your hair to curl the way you want it to but other than it has been good.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all it&#x27;s good for really, other than damaging my already somewhat damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what I expected this curling/straightening iron to be able to do when I bought it over a year ago, but it does keep my bangs looking perfect in seconds.  </li>
            <li>and now I can do it easily, fast and friendly.</li>
            <li>OTHER WISE PRODUCT WORKS</li>
            <li>Yes the styler will get hot, it will be very hot.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t know if it would work just as good on other types of hair</li>
            <li>They were on the right path with this one...</li>
            <li>It worked for me on my right side (I&#x27;m right handed)</li>
            <li>I was right</li>
            <li>YEAH right...</li>
            <li>ELSE&#x27;S hair, which sounds right.</li>
            <li>I am right handed, so this was tricky.</li>
            <li>It was much fatter and a lot of plastic and it made a pop sound on the first try an didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I am not good at straightening my hair, but with the Instyler, I can do it and it comes out looking smooth and great.</li>
            <li>Wow, those commercials are pretty convincing, huh.</li>
            <li>It gives your hair the most beauiful wavy curls and it curls your head sooo fast once you get the hang of it unlike my normal curling iron.</li>
            <li>I dont even have to spray my hair first my hair totally holds a nice curl.</li>
            <li>In less than 10 minutes, my hair is smooth, straight, styled, shiny and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>A full refund is the only redeeming value you have at this point.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a week and finally for the first time have liked my hair.  </li>
            <li>OK, so I have a 13 year old, and this is her first time using a hair styler.</li>
            <li>It is simple to use with very easy instructions.</li>
            <li>High indicated by the number of bars that light up under the transparent switch -</li>
            <li>I found it extremely easy to to get beautiful results in less time than a hair dryer and/or regular curling iron!!!  </li>
            <li>i would rather blow dry and smooth with my Chi, it is much better results that way.</li>
            <li>The Remington wet iron i own works far better than this at straightening hair and reducing frizz.  </li>
            <li>It was worth the money to have one whole year of hair bliss!  </li>
            <li>oh and i am very care full but still burned my self</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a blonde with very fine hair.      </li>
            <li>It gets very hot, drys out your hair, it would take hours to style even shoulder length hair, and has a large warning label on the electrical cord to keep away from your eyes.</li>
            <li>Its pure Genius!</li>
            <li>so I exchanged it and the next one I got (the one I (currently own)worked great and</li>
            <li>So my hair looks really nice and shiny and straight on the outside</li>
            <li>Only time I can honestly say my hair is straight from the roots to the ends is when I&#x27;ve just gotten a relaxer...</li>
            <li>My hair is long, fine, but very shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I will say though, that my $80 straightener does just as good a job and in a lot less time.</li>
            <li>If this one breaks, I will probably order directly from the manufacturer&#x27;s website to make sure I get the real thing.</li>
            <li>If they made the instyler without the brush thing, It would be great for african american hair.</li>
            <li>It really does shine more and has a soft polished feel.</li>
            <li>I usually wash my hair natural the night before and use my InStyler on dry hair in the morning for best results for me..and it takes ONLY about 10-15 minutes to get my hair looking great too....</li>
            <li>When you release the barrel, your hair is VERY hot and tends to hang straight.    </li>
            <li>No more spending an hour or more using my old iron with my hands cramped trying to get my hair to look good.</li>
            <li>No split ends and very straight and shinny...</li>
            <li>I am still working on learning how to curl, and it&#x27;s not as easy as a regular curling iron, but once you get the hang of it is nice to have one tool for multiple uses.  </li>
            <li>The product is good - it does take a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, but it is also easy to burn yourself so be careful.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, I want a FULL refund, even the seven dollars I paid to jump to the head of the shipping line because your product is so highly in demand.      </li>
            <li>I like the InStyler, but I do wish that the rotator would rotate in both directions and that there was another setting for the heat to not be so hot.</li>
            <li>I was able to straighten my hair like a pro in about 5 minutes with the Instyler, even the back!</li>
            <li>What I like about the instyler rotating hot iron hair straightner, is the fact that it does its job.  </li>
            <li>I tried it the first day I received it</li>
            <li>This is my first can&#x27;t-live-without hair appliance ever.</li>
            <li>ok so...ive been going back and forth about getting this item....</li>
            <li>most instylers that i researched, only get as hot as 135.  </li>
            <li>u need something really hot.  </li>
            <li>Send it back to the seller and on top of that</li>
            <li>The first one would NOT turn off from the switch on the unit.</li>
            <li>The only way to be sure it cools is to unplug it from the wall.</li>
            <li>so it is hot</li>
            <li>The first one I bought at target did nothing for my hair</li>
            <li>I bought this device at the local BJ&#x27;s and have fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li>It will no longer rotate but it still turns on and gets hot.  </li>
            <li>I just used my InStyler for the first time</li>
            <li>I really like this product!  </li>
            <li>With my hair texture, I have to seperate and pin back my hair into 10 - 12 sections on the top and straighten with a hair dryer on the bottom.  </li>
            <li>I just bought the Instyler and have only used it a couple of times, but I already love it.  </li>
            <li>You do have to section your hair, but you can use bigger sections than I thought you would be able to.</li>
            <li>I am usually skeptical of any infomercial products but this one is great!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li>Mine got a tad bit crispy the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>all curling/straightening irons, it gets hot</li>
            <li>This tool is just too hot, even at the lowest setting, for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Especially for a $100 investment, it should be better quality.  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend has thick curly hair(Italian), and she has nothing but great things to say about it.</li>
            <li>This is my first time ordering from amazon, I ordered my Instyler on 1/30 and received it 2/3.</li>
            <li>Used this the first time tonight-wow</li>
            <li>I did use TIGI Catwalk Prep first.</li>
            <li>Thanks Guys for saving me $190!    </li>
            <li>ok, so I called Tre Milano who charged my card the same day</li>
            <li>I had to file a chargeback against them and refuse the item when it arrived, rather than having them just stop the shipment in the first place.  </li>
            <li>her self esteem is on the highest level and at the same time she feels sexy (which works in my favor)  </li>
            <li>It straightens but it creates more frizz than my ISO which only cost me $40.</li>
            <li>THOUGH: the rod gets REALLY HOT</li>
            <li>My daughter, who has course, very curly hair, had success with the InStyler too, with my Aveda serum.  </li>
            <li>what&#x27;s up with people complaining how hot this gets?  </li>
            <li>First off, it takes FOREVER and a day to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>Used this hot iron just once.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t take too much hair!  </li>
            <li>It does get really hot</li>
            <li>then it started to rotate but it wouldn&#x27;t get hot.  </li>
            <li>and I love that I only need one hair appliance now.</li>
            <li>I love it, but this time I purchased the instyler for my mom as a xmas present.</li>
            <li>I think the product is exactly what they advertise</li>
            <li>First let me say i do like it,</li>
            <li>The first InStyler I bought was defective.</li>
            <li>Remember, my first InStyler died.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my Instyler for 2 years now, and I absolutely adore it!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested in the InStyler for its styling or curling abilities- look on.</li>
            <li>The first, my husband got me for Christmas 2 years ago</li>
            <li>- The InStyler get EXTREMELY hot.  </li>
            <li>My first is still running like a champ but</li>
            <li>However, the first one I had stopped working after one year.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast!</li>
            <li>I was ready to give up straightening my hair until I was told about this product!</li>
            <li>It DOES get hot</li>
            <li>i received this product and tried it for the first time...</li>
            <li>SO pretty.  </li>
            <li>The advertisements indicate that you can use it for many different stylings, untrue.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I have wanted this product since it first came out</li>
            <li>Takes out the frizzies, waves and leaves pretty, silky hair.</li>
            <li>I used it today for the first time</li>
            <li>Better results than I&#x27;ve ever gotten in my entire life.</li>
            <li>Will continue to look for something similar that doesn&#x27;t have so many mechanical issues.</li>
            <li>The first one I opened didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping my 2 extra Instyler irons so that I&#x27;ll be able to use it forever.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to even attempt as the thought of bumping that hot barrel into my hand or head was too much!</li>
            <li>Really, it does!</li>
            <li>i absolutely swear by this product!</li>
            <li>anytime my sister and i meet up, the first thing she says is : \\&quot;Bring the InStyler!\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I thought since it was my first time using it</li>
            <li>She said she couldn&#x27;t figure out why it wasn&#x27;t working because I was doing everything the exact way I wassupposed to.</li>
            <li>The CHI straighteners last years and do a phenomenal job.  </li>
            <li>It does get relatively hot.</li>
            <li>I know you have to section off your hair as with any hot tool</li>
            <li>Once it does finally kick the bucket, I&#x27;m for sure going to get another one.</li>
            <li>First, it started turning itself off a minute or two after being turned on, then the barrel would no longer rotate.    </li>
            <li>My hair is completely straight and shiny in one swipe!</li>
            <li>It delivers exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great piece of equipment if you want to slowly go bald.</li>
            <li>and I can tell I need a bit of practice with it for me to get my hair to look exactly as I would like it to.</li>
            <li>At first, I had no idea what to do with it</li>
            <li>I really did get compliments on my hair after using it!     </li>
            <li>For users thinking about it, make sure you definitely READ instructions on how to use and take care of it.</li>
            <li>I went to pick it up but forgot it was hot.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this Hot Iron hair styler.</li>
            <li>I had the defective one replaced at the store, and am satisfied with the second one.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work that well, and it breaks within the first couple months of using it.  </li>
            <li>It really does the job!</li>
            <li>have left my hair looking shiney and healthy and not looking over done.</li>
            <li>The brush actually seemed to make the hair even more frizzy.  </li>
            <li>but if you make sure the barrel turns where your hair cuticles goes it will close any open cuticles as it brushes through thus</li>
            <li>Within 15 minute my hair was completely straight again!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says at the medium heat cycle.  </li>
            <li>I asked if I could try it and from the first use</li>
            <li>I purchased the Instyler when they first came out.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t turn on for more than five seconds, and I tried it in several different outlets just to be sure.</li>
            <li>That was the first thing to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i loved it, but it really dried my hair out</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and blond, and left to its own devices will be flat with a bit of scraggly wave and frizz.  </li>
            <li>I am always willing to try something new specially if it will make my life easier however this was just not that type of product.  </li>
            <li>I just hold it how it&#x27;s comfortable and deal with the fly-aways at the end with hairspray or a quick sweep with a regular straightener.    </li>
            <li>Perhaps that&#x27;s because we both have tried many, many different types of curling irons, flat irons, etc.</li>
            <li>The only positive is that he purchased it from amazon, and we were able to return it.</li>
            <li>It straightens with just one pass through my hair and leaves my hair straight smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li>and I have used MANY products to straighten my hair, like blowing it out with a hair dryer, flat irons, hot combs</li>
            <li>When I use it on other people&#x27;s hair, their hair looks beautiful - just like it does on the models in the commercial.  </li>
            <li>I was super excited to try this and finally banish my hot rollers.</li>
            <li>Now, with the Instyler, I can achive soft, smooth, large curls with just one tool.  </li>
            <li>Well, if I blow-dry my hair, I can often do a good enough job to use my usual straight-iron as a touch up - saving on damage and leaving in more bounce.</li>
            <li>If I hadn&#x27;t read the many reviews that encouraged people to be patient and DO NOT expect this to work like your flat iron, I would have returned it immediately.  </li>
            <li>I have a supply of flat irons and curling irons that I never touch anymore because this is better than any of them.  </li>
            <li>I liked the way it worked, I did not burn myself like some of the other reviewers</li>
            <li>I have a bed head flat iron and love it</li>
            <li>It is 1,000 times better than a flat iron - because it gives me body as well as making it straighter.  </li>
            <li>If you buy this production just keep in mind that if you aren&#x27;t skilled in straightening your hair with a flat iron, you are going to have to practice a bit with it before you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>Better than a flat iron it curls or straightens without leaving marks or kinks.</li>
            <li>My blow dryer and flat iron work much better.</li>
            <li>Spend your money on one of the better flat irons that have the ability to curl.</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal CHI user for years, but I decided to give this new \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; straightener a try.  </li>
            <li>I am just glad that I received this as a gift because I would be very upset if I had actually purchased it myself.</li>
            <li>I could go on and on about how much I LOVE my straight hair, but the Instyler made it possible.</li>
            <li>I can see how it may not work as well on thick, very curly hair, but on my hair type it works great.</li>
            <li>see if i liked it any better than the conventional flat irons.</li>
            <li>It did straighten my hair very fast, reduced frizz, and I learned to manuver it to create enough body and curl to make my hair look more decent than it has for a while.  </li>
            <li>I did the best I could to get the nut screwed back on, but it came loose the next time I used it.  </li>
            <li>But I love it now and am so glad I finally let loose of my wallet to purchase the Instyler.  </li>
            <li>I mean could they not coat the cord and make it more safe to use and heat resistent??</li>
            <li>I read the reviews before and I was almost positive</li>
            <li>Bottom line, use common sense and you should get amazing results!  </li>
            <li>for us blk folks, if we want our hair straight, u have to use something really hot.  </li>
            <li>and this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that absolutely straightens without flattening.</li>
            <li>Anyway, fast forward 5 months, I touched the hot barrel of the iron and dropped the instyler on the carpet.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I have straight silky hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance because my daughter and I both use it to straighten our long hair (about 6 inches below shoulders).</li>
            <li>and it didnt really get hot</li>
            <li>It is also ineffective at straightening the first few inches from the scalp (unless you don&#x27;t mind touching 375 degree metal to your skin)which is my curliest area!  </li>
            <li>My stylist actually said that she is proud when I walk in the salon because my hair is a reflection of her cutting and coloring skills, and the Instyler makes my hair look gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>First, the rotating iron doesn&#x27;t do much .</li>
            <li>I had to send mine back as the first one broke in shipping, but my replacement was fine.    </li>
            <li>I called for a refund number and the nice salesman offered me a cool tip attachment for the iron, along with a special conditioning treatment to remedy the limp hair problem, but a week later I called and customer service had not mailed it or had no record of it.  </li>
            <li>The barrel is super hot and I have had several burns on my forehead and ears but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Also, just so your aware, I made these phone calls from my office phone, which has a handy little feature called the RECORD button.  </li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to look good in less time than it would normally take you to get dressed.</li>
            <li>Because I spent what I thought was a good amount of money on this product, I tried it several times, just trying different things to see if I could get better results and nothing worked.    </li>
            <li>It works just as well on \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; hair and that is a major plus in combing hair that is sometimes not comb friendly.</li>
            <li>It was quick and easy, and now my hair is smooth and swingy - even the bangs and hard to straighten hairline.</li>
            <li>My hair is now crunchy dry, tons of split ends (which I never had in my life), it is super tangled and when you brush it out to take out the tangles (even softly) broke hairs off, and causes even more split ends.  </li>
            <li>Never have we been able to let our hair dry and then iron it to controlled.  </li>
            <li>I really liked how the Instyler made my hair look, however I had the produce LESS than two weeks before it broke.  </li>
            <li>To keep my hair healthy, I will probably always wash at night, let it air dry, and then straighten it in the morning.    </li>
            <li>My hair has more body, the unit doesn&#x27;t make my hair dry.</li>
            <li>and it does leave your hair super soft.  </li>
            <li>I have wanted one of these for a long time &amp; although the seller was great the product is so-so doesn&#x27;t work as I expected it to.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money, does exactly what it claims to do, I completely recommend getting and InStyler.</li>
            <li>I have long, very fine hair which lets put it this way, my older sister got the perfectly straight hair</li>
            <li>If you do purchase it, make certain you keep every thing in the box in tact and record your conversations when you call or confirm it in writing.  </li>
            <li>It gets very, very hot like professional grade equipment.</li>
            <li>This made my hair stick straight, super soft and it stayed for 3 days (until I had to wash it).  </li>
            <li>The return was seamless and quick and the prompt refund was appreciated.</li>
            <li>Appears not to be made for fine hair (although the commercial I saw said it was) as it doesn&#x27;t seem to grasp and hold it well unless you have a put a large amount of hair in it.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and dry, and its normal state is frizzy.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair has a fine to normal texture with a slight wave with no frizz but tangles easy.</li>
            <li>I would pair it up with a normal flat iron to make sure all that was missed with the InStyler.</li>
            <li>I can do super straight, soft and wavy  or straight with volume.  </li>
            <li>Even when my hair gets a little moist from rain, it still holds its own without frizzing up.  </li>
            <li>It didnt make my hair look sleek, and it kind of made it stick out a little bit.   </li>
            <li>The best it did was take the big waves out but still left my hair a frizzy puffball mess.      </li>
            <li>She makes my hair look fantastic, but agrees that it is too much heat for my hair to use daily.  </li>
            <li>After another month, it finally tore out a huge chunk of my hair and then the end spun off.  </li>
            <li>Using this instead of a traditional straightener/hair iron you can see a huge difference in body.</li>
            <li>When it arrived I tried it, and was very unimpressed.  </li>
            <li>The in-styler works very well.</li>
            <li>and it is the real thing from the AS SEEN ON TV programming shows.  </li>
            <li>I really like it and have already recommended it.  </li>
            <li>I will admit to having hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well, but this was a joke.</li>
            <li>The Instyler has made doing my hair much easier.</li>
            <li>It does not heat up as fast as others.   </li>
            <li>and she likes it straight.  </li>
            <li>The InStyler heats up fast and takes no time at all on her hair.  </li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>an accomplished hair styler and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it as I have to all my friends and coworkers!</li>
            <li>I even used a heat protection spray and it didn&#x27;t help much.  </li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing with my hair...straighten or curl.  </li>
            <li>and it is straight.  </li>
            <li>I do not recommend the product for curly or straight hair.</li>
            <li>She found that it made her hair frizzy rather than straight.  </li>
            <li>She is much happier.</li>
            <li>I have a feeling if your hair is course, or if it is very curly it might not work as well.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is very curly, It may take longer, or you may have to section the bottom part of your hair as well.</li>
            <li>and it really smooths it out.  </li>
            <li>I used it once, and I basically had to continually run this product over strands of my hair until it got the slightest bit of straight.   </li>
            <li>This hair straightener does not do anything that a much cheaper, store bought hair straightener can&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li>This iron is very akward to handle</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy hair and lots of it</li>
            <li>This product really does straighten the hair.  </li>
            <li>I am not happy with the performance of this item nor am I happy the the ease of trying to exchange this item at Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I could never get my hair to lay straight.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>My hair remained poofy after much labor.  </li>
            <li>We both have very frizzy, very curly hair and find that this tool does the trick.  </li>
            <li>The rotating head on mine works rather intermitently and the whole unit sometimes shuts is self off.  </li>
            <li>This really does work.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so much that it bothers me</li>
            <li>For a straight haired gal whose hair sticks out at all angles, I have found the instyler to turn my locks under neatly.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this produce to others who have chin length straight hair like mine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shiny, straight and has body.  </li>
            <li>Almost all the complaints about the Instyler say that its cheaply made and does have technical problems.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very humid.  </li>
            <li>Was a gift and the person really likes it.  </li>
            <li>it did make alot of noise-but that didnt really bother me..</li>
            <li>I guess-- Is that it doesn&#x27;t really get the roots.  </li>
            <li>I cant believe some people gave this 5 stars I would really like to see their hair (before &amp; after).</li>
            <li>I had to spend so much time for one curl</li>
            <li>Also I felt that the metal was very damaging to the hair.</li>
            <li>It is much lighter than you think, the casing being plastic &amp; rod aluminium?&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rod heats up rapidly, so a real time saver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Heats up fast.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t heat up like it promised to do fast.</li>
            <li>It flipped hair up okay, but not like expected.</li>
            <li>I would really recomment this product.</li>
            <li>I am very please with the In Styler.  </li>
            <li>If it hadn&#x27;t cost me so much I would&#x27;ve thrown it out.</li>
            <li>Very flimsey.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not stick straight.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very kinky and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>You really stand by your word.</li>
            <li>Pros - does straighten very well.   </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t curl my hair very well, but that&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I really wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>It fried my hair and didn&#x27;t make my hair straight at all.</li>
            <li>Not quite as fast, but it still does.</li>
            <li>It gets your hair straight.  </li>
            <li>The REMINGTON Straightener keeps my hair just as straight as a board all day.</li>
            <li>It does not burn or singe my hair; I&#x27;d categorize this as gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product to every woman.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it really works so well.</li>
            <li>My Instyler arrived before estamatied arrival date plus It straightend my VERY kinky curly ethnic hair.</li>
            <li>Could never get my hair really straight the way I wanted</li>
            <li>it just feels much sturdier in your hands</li>
            <li>It did not have instyler packaging, it was much louder than the one I had used before</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t pull it thru your hair too fast and you cant stuff too much of your hair in at once.  </li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>it don&#x27;t really do to well with that.</li>
            <li>I will just make your hair very puffy</li>
            <li>OF COURSE COMMUNICATE VERY WELL BEFORE SELL</li>
            <li>WE HAVE BEEN VERY BLESSED UNTIL NOW.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy-to-use.</li>
            <li>I bought this item mostly to straight my hair.</li>
            <li>When the light finally stopped flashing, I used it</li>
            <li>VERY WELL</li>
            <li>hair had a much lighter body to it even though I use a lot of oils</li>
            <li>a couple times before it&#x27;s really straight.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is one of the products that really lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li>etc.--a real</li>
            <li>They set up the return, but when they gave me the shipping info, they said I was responsible for paying the return shipping for the defective product.  </li>
            <li>I was really nervous that she would burn herself, but to my surprise she didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>and my hair still wasn&#x27;t as straight as it was with one pass through with my CHI straightener.  </li>
            <li>I had that broke that started this whole fiasco</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier just using this for a touch up versus using it to do your hair from the beginning.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item to anyone who toggles between curling and straightenign their hair!</li>
            <li>I for one have very curly spiral permed hair.</li>
            <li>Tried it out and absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I have medium length hair that is very curly.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to straighten their hair without damaging it and who doesn&#x27;t want to spend time or money in salon to have someone else straighten your hair.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t know if I want to spend that much money to buy another one.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s already on its way to being straight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The hair gets really straight</li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t get up the nerve to spend this much money on a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really care because I don&#x27;t use that type of comb.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend that you pay and get a orginal, my daughter got the real one</li>
            <li>It goes much faster than a curling iron and it keeps my hair straightened like I want it yet gives it some body.  </li>
            <li>She wants to buy a couple of them for her shop.</li>
            <li>The brush-part of the instyler didn&#x27;t polish it, separate it, or do anything, really.</li>
            <li>- say really think and really curly.</li>
            <li>I have battled the curls my whole life.  </li>
            <li>It has attracted a lot of attention in the gym lockerroom from both curlyheads and straight haired women.  </li>
            <li>It heats up extremely fast.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone with frizzy or unruly hair!  </li>
            <li>For straight hair i would recommend the brand Remington.</li>
            <li>Mine has wilted a bit and the brissels have bent and it doesnt really brush very well anymore.</li>
            <li>but recently its started to sound like it gets off track.</li>
            <li>It works great, I have longer, thick and naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that I really liked the instyler for was my bangs but my biggest issue is that the rolling part of the brush burned my forehead and it burned it in the same place twice.</li>
            <li>He exchanged my instyler for another new one without any problem and of course it was very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This one didn&#x27;t work at all like the other, and seemed very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>ONCE AGAIN DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li>Basically I think I will be able to straighten my hair with the iron in probably a half hour to forty minutes if I blow it out first.</li>
            <li>Also, if you are used to clamping onto your hair with a flat iron you will most likely burn yourself with the instyler because it is very easy to try and grab both sides as you normally would a flat iron, and</li>
            <li>I only read the &#x27;quick start&#x27; portion of the included instructions and had my hair straight in less than 20 minutes ... which is amazing.</li>
            <li>I bought this idem brand new for my girlfriend for her birthday, she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>It gets extremely hot, but InStyler has created this shield for all new InStylers that you just snap onto the rotating iron that reduces the risk of burning yourself.  </li>
            <li>I think what I miss the most is something cool at the tip I can hold onto rather than only the large wide handle.  </li>
            <li>I do not have coarse hair, and I have only used it on clean, product free hair.     </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t rate it highly because the infomercials feature an African American woman with kinkier hair than mine and show it effectively smoothing her hair without mention of pre-straightening or chemicals.</li>
            <li>but sadly it just isn&#x27;t good!  </li>
            <li>It smooths out my hair better than any other straightner I&#x27;ve tried before.  </li>
            <li>I wish, like many other reviewers, that it could rotate in both directions, as I did have some hair ripped out when trying to pull through counter to the roll.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited about this product and finally bought it a couple weeks ago</li>
            <li>If there was a way to make the barrel roll the other way, that would have been so much better.</li>
            <li>This product works better on Caucasian hair (other finer hair types as well).</li>
            <li>I so love the Instyler, especially since I was a major skeptic even when I asked for it.</li>
            <li>Went back to my original curling iron and am looking to sell my Instyler.</li>
            <li>This does make some noise while being used which surprised me, although I could live with the noise if this really was better quality and actually worked!</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised to see that this one has a Low setting, and makes my hair look very full.</li>
            <li>The product does get very hot you can get burnt the setup could be a little better for the price, as far as the polishing and shining  </li>
            <li>I have long hair on the fine side.</li>
            <li>This hair styler does not work well on long fine hair when trying to put curl into it.  </li>
            <li>Hair didn&#x27;t last nice for long.       </li>
            <li>My favorite thing to do with the InStyler is to straight it down and then turn/roll the InStyler in towards me at the bottom</li>
            <li>this ever quite straighened my hair as well as a traditional flat iron, so I cannot imagine how it could work magic on very curly, course hair!</li>
            <li>Specially because it rolls only one way</li>
            <li>Actually it was a special where I got both for $99</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to use less hair, and then more hair, but it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference.  </li>
            <li>and my hair is totally smooth, which is something that it is not naturally.</li>
            <li>Damp to dry is fine</li>
            <li>First one is that the motor is loud.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a mom), it just looks average like most women.</li>
            <li>and it was far more trouble than it was worth.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Instyler Rotating Hot Iron Hair Straightener for my 18 year old grand-daughter.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair - very curly!  </li>
            <li>I guess the HOT metal barrel (like the curling irons of old) is what makes this device curl as well as it does.</li>
            <li>I had to use my old hair straightener on my hair first and then go over it with the instyler.</li>
            <li>EXTERIOR IS SO FULL OF DAMAGES, ROTATING PART DOESN&#x27;T EVEN ROTATE, SO MUCH DIFFERENT KINDS OF HAIR IN THE BRUSH PART</li>
            <li>Plus it makes a pretty loud noise.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud, too hot and takes forever to straighten/curl my hair.</li>
            <li>It also creates a nice loose wave that doesn&#x27;t bunch up like with a standard curling iron.</li>
            <li>But after giving it the benefit of the doubt and watching some videos, I&#x27;ve gotten a technique down that I love.</li>
            <li>I love it and now have to hunt down another one as the company I got it from no longer carries it...  </li>
            <li>I generally blow dry my curly, course hair with a straightening brush and then use a ceramic flat iron to smooth and add shine... if you are trying to get to your roots, this takes much more time to do with the Instyler and</li>
            <li>and she looks like she got a new hair cut; she loves it!</li>
            <li>The InStyler is a tool I can&#x27;t live without!  </li>
            <li>Boy, if they could only see it all frizzed up and dull looking, LOL.  </li>
            <li>Instyler heats up very quickly, but start off on a lower setting than usual because it is VERY hot</li>
            <li>I had to send one of mine back because it wouldnt rotate properly but the other works great</li>
            <li>I love my flat iron, but don&#x27;t like the way it left my hair totally straight.</li>
            <li>Its soooooo amazing to have ONE hair product instead of using a dryer (hard to do when your hair is fine and long</li>
            <li>I have never been able to fix my hair so quickly until now using the new InStyler Rotating Hot Iron Hair Straightener and my daughter&#x27;s head which is thick and medium lenght was finished in 7 mins no less.  </li>
            <li>but I wanted it mainly to use traveling in Europe.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not designed for super short hair.</li>
            <li>The grip is also too big for my short fingers to handle safely...</li>
            <li>I sent it back, got my refund quickly and just ended up going to Bed, Bath, and Beyond to get one.</li>
            <li>I love the way it gives body, especially when you \\&quot;back curl\\&quot; for crown area for height.  </li>
            <li>The brush has almost no bristles and they are super short, so nothing grabbed.</li>
            <li>however, the vendor replaced the unit quickly and the 2nd unit has had no problems to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t bother with the extra cost for quick delivery -</li>
            <li>The barrel stopped rotating, which was the main functioning part that caused the volume of my style.  </li>
            <li>The good thing about it was the fact that it only took a few days to arrive.</li>
            <li>But the InStyler made everything super simple.    </li>
            <li>It took a few times for me to get used to the whirling sound of the styler, but the results are well worth it.</li>
            <li>I waited several months and decided that I like it so much that it was worth getting again.  </li>
            <li>I think this might be an older model that may have been used before, or it is just a faulty product.</li>
            <li>And then, YOU can contact the companies that you gave my personal information to, and YOU can make sure that they do NOT call or email me again and that my personal information is destroyed.    </li>
            <li>i mainly bought it so i could give my hair volume without teasing it</li>
            <li>The only problem is that the on/off switch wears out too quickly.</li>
            <li>If I knew of a similar product that was made better I would definitely buy it.</li>
            <li>I finally forked it over when I got my most recent hair cut.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately the best advice I can give you is to re-sell it here on Amazon because it has been opened and used I cannot take it back.</li>
            <li>The smaller 3/4 inch works MUCH better than the bigger 1-1/4 inch.</li>
            <li>Making curls will take a little getting used to, but I am pleased with the soft waves in my first attempt.</li>
            <li>I set it then on high and the light flashed for very long time (like 15 minutes) before to stop.</li>
            <li>Also, I find it hard to make sure I am putting in on the section with the barrel spinning the right direction.</li>
            <li>Be careful it is very hot and can easily burn you; especially when you are working with your hair underneath.</li>
            <li>Please pay attention to all the negative reviews and save yourself the money and protect your skin by using a better straightening iron!</li>
            <li>If you add up 40 minutes at least 3 times a week think about how many hours and days of my life this thing is saving me!</li>
            <li>Let me say again that the barrel gets VERY HOT - not only can it burn fingers, hands, but scalp and skin around the face if you get it too close.  </li>
            <li>I can get a fresh look to my ends, but nothing more than any other flat iron does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read some people complaining about not being able to use both hands while styling because there&#x27;s not a cool place to hold on the end.  </li>
            <li>My first complaint is that the rotation of the heating cylinder is only good if it rotates away from the hair follicle.</li>
            <li>when i called and told them they were of no help...said you had to be careful and all of their instyler rotating irons were super hot</li>
            <li>I set it on HIGH and use it..</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it to all women</li>
            <li>I had to use it on the high setting or it would not straighten my hair and on hi my hair singed a bit.</li>
            <li>to the high heat element, I do/would not use this often and do so SPARINGLY.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>The price is to high for what it does.  </li>
            <li>I think Amazon should highly consider removing Safari Store from their site since they do not want to attempt to help in resolving issues.  </li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t have to use it on high</li>
            <li>I purchased my sophomore year of high school and just broke when I was 24.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;d paid what I think is the outrageously high price on the manufacturer&#x27;s web site, I&#x27;d be furious.</li>
            <li>She uses her Instyler more than her regular flat iron.</li>
            <li>You get much better resuls with a simple flat iron or a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>We were using a regular ceramic hot iron and our hair was becoming so dry.  </li>
            <li>I have looked at reviews on this Chi flat iron, which can be found around the same price, and read much better customer reviews.</li>
            <li>and I found myself having to take multiple breaks to let my arm rest; therefore, making the process take longer, not cutting my styling time in half like the product claims to be able to do.  </li>
            <li>The instyler brand is a marketing genius &amp; it looks like there are many fake positive postings that sound like an infomercial.</li>
            <li>I can also get volume on the top of my head as well with little effort.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a little it seems more like a joke.</li>
            <li>Now the barrel was just hanging and red hot!  </li>
            <li>This product is not worth the $$$ for girls with fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>: You can buy a good curling iron AND a good flat iron for the price of this ONE equally damaging, awkward, not-so-versatile, breakable thing.</li>
            <li>It also takes FOREVER for the highest setting to turn a solid glowing red, and it doesn&#x27;t do much to my ton of fine hair.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s hard to straighten the roots with this kind of appliance...</li>
            <li>I tried it on my hair (thick medium length) and it works AMAZING.</li>
            <li>The motor that people complain about really isn&#x27;t that loud at all.  </li>
            <li>When you take the item and put it near your hair, you are really close to your body.  </li>
            <li>No frizz and not limp straight like using a flatiron.  </li>
            <li>and it did not cost near as much as this one.</li>
            <li>To me it&#x27;s worth investing in the InStyler to get the same results in a fraction of the time.    </li>
            <li>For the price I would recommend avoiding it, buying a normal straightner and a separate curler for any styles you might want to achieve.</li>
            <li>Well, normally I look like I have a lions mane of hair that&#x27;s a nightmare</li>
            <li>It took a long time to heat up, and would cool off while I used it.  </li>
            <li>Use your $80 towards a hair straightener that actually works and is worth $80.</li>
            <li>and they said it&#x27;s a treatment and use it a few more time, if i wanted treatment i would go to a salon</li>
            <li>I have always received compliments on my hair, usually only after it has been freshly washed.  </li>
            <li>Normally i used the Helen of Troy straightener.  </li>
            <li>So I give the InStyler 5 stars, since I have had lasting success with differing hair types.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s most upsetting is not the $120 wasted, but the time it will take to regrow my destroyed hair from this product.  </li>
            <li>Using this tool I can flip my somewhat long hair and it stays full all day.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time last night, and it didn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>It simply takes too long and the results are just OK.</li>
            <li>Now I am really too old to wear longer straight hair, where was this product when I was young?  </li>
            <li>I washed my hair with shampoo and conditioner and then blow-dried as I normally would.</li>
            <li>like I normally do when straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>I immediately plugged in my \\&quot;old faithful\\&quot; and I am now convinced that more expensive is not always better.</li>
            <li>but with practice you&#x27;ll be able to figure out how to keep your hands, neck, and scalp from getting a few burns.</li>
            <li>my hair didn&#x27;t have the same polished look, it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I could have lived with the little quirks and would have been happy to continue using the Instyler if it hadn&#x27;t stopped working less than thirty days after I received it</li>
            <li>Get a flat iron will be better off!now a days flat iron will curl and put volume in your hair!</li>
            <li>After trying it on both dry and wet hair she decided that her blow dryer, curling irons and hot rollers worked way better than this product.</li>
            <li>but as it turns out, you have to hold the roller really close to your scalp for a long period of time and spray this recommended spray (that the company also sells) onto your hair in order to have it work right.</li>
            <li>I brushed the hairspray out of my hair and went right to fixing my hair.  </li>
            <li>I feel such guilt for not purchasing another one right away after the one I had before it broke.</li>
            <li>If you have hair that is pretty short, though, please be aware that the roller part of this is large, so anything shorter than maybe 4 inches is going to be too short to even try to do lest</li>
            <li>I shipped the item back and he credited my account for the item right away.</li>
            <li>I was even more shocked, even pleased, that our hair stayed straight throughout the whole day.</li>
            <li>Mine did not come with a stand &amp; when I put the unit down on my bathroom counter to section out locks of hair to curl, it can ( and does) easily slip off the counter (weighted by the electrical cord).</li>
            <li>However, the barrel of this \\&quot;original\\&quot; version is metal, and the other components are smooth plastic (handle, brush bed).</li>
            <li>you are willing to pay the high price on this item because you have untamed hair, I&#x27;d suggest you buy it only if there is an acceptable return policy.</li>
            <li>and they sent me a brand new model within 3 weeks.)    </li>
            <li>A NEW ONE.</li>
            <li>So, I ordered a new one.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m just waiting for the return label so they can send me a new instyler.</li>
            <li>Positives: I live in SC</li>
            <li>I plan to buy a new one for her, from a authorized retailer that has the 1 year warrantee.</li>
            <li>, I had a wet/dry straightner by revlon that I bought new for $40.00,</li>
            <li>BTW, I bought the new tourmaline barrel one &amp; returned it --</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t live without this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I requested a new one, it turned out that the merchant had been dropped from Amazon suppliers.  </li>
            <li>The new one I bought worked just as well as my friend&#x27;s did.  </li>
            <li>and now I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>The items was brand new and worked the way it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>it would seem that you have to buy a new one every year to two years.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already ordered a new straightener, and this one isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>PS-Forgot to say that my hair is a pretty long, very curly and a frizz bomb.</li>
            <li>Notice all the 5 star reviews sound similar &amp; the last sentence ends with an !.  </li>
            <li>only a good hair dresser could style my thick, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>The instyler is so hot that it burns more quickly than any other iron i have used and by the time you feel the burn, it is way too late.  </li>
            <li>fit in the barrel - and even then it would slide right thru without any traction at all - no matter how hard I squeezed it together.</li>
            <li>She has been styling her hair since she was very young.  </li>
            <li>also makes my hair very soft.     </li>
            <li>It does leave your hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>Also, I have several burns on my hand and forehead as it is very easy to get burned, unlike a traditional flat iron where you can hold it and be protected by a handle or plastic covering, this offers you no protection from getting burned.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very dissapointed with this product and would never recommend it to others!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised this iron is allowed to remain on the market!    </li>
            <li>the roller would not return, they will not replace it due to me throwing away the original box.</li>
            <li>I have wrestled with so many hair products and straighteners and rollers and so on and so on ---- but no more.</li>
            <li>Oh wow!</li>
            <li>And my hair is so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying a second one just in case something happens to the first one.</li>
            <li>It did not get hot enough to straighten or curl hair.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny as long as you don&#x27;t expect it to do everything.  </li>
            <li>It was better than nothing, but not much better.</li>
            <li>On a normal morning, I would spend nearly an hour drying and straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t grasp my hair and didn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I tried everything to put the top back on and it did not go back the same way.  </li>
            <li>I read all the instructions first and had been using it properly, so they eventually offered me a replacement.  </li>
            <li>Safari Store even had the nerve to ask me to go back and enter a new and positive review since they are a new and upcoming store.  </li>
            <li>i only use the lowest heat setting which is recommended fpr my hair type and it is sill hot.  </li>
            <li>The Instyler&#x27;s brush straightens the hair first so it actually gets \\&quot;ironed\\</li>
            <li>It does the same thing and your life will be so much simpler!</li>
            <li>it leaves it soft and silky!</li>
            <li>This does the same exact thing as the ones that they sell in the store for $20.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>First, it takes forever to heat---then it actually does nothing.</li>
            <li>This product is very simple, so anyone can do it, even first timers.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first and second one from QVC about 4 years ago.</li>
            <li>The style stays pretty well until i wash it out, so i only have to style it after each wash.  </li>
            <li>By the next day he had sent me an email willing to work out my problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about the types of hair, but to me I feel like this would be more for styling hair</li>
            <li>they came out so natural and bouncy!   </li>
            <li>The noise of the motor is what gets their attention, and then they all want to see it in action!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really simple to use after your first try, the first try never turns out as well as after you&#x27;ve had some practice.&lt;br /&gt;There are two different sizes.</li>
            <li>My hair curls really easily and will stay with little hairspray until I wash it out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thing, very flat, split ends, and very puffy.</li>
            <li>To me, the Instyler feels cheap (lightweight and plastic) and does not clamp down on the hair.</li>
            <li>I run it down the section of hair a couple of times to smooth it</li>
            <li>Major Fire hazzard!!!    </li>
            <li>with the brush, just like any other brush hair gets caught in it, so the problem is i always forget to clean it</li>
            <li>It does a nice job on my hair, however I am a little concerned with how long it will hold up.</li>
            <li>It is unique in how it styles, but it is clumsy to get the right hand motion.&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li>The guard, however, gives a false sense of security and actually increases your likelihood to burn yourself because it appears that the guard will protect you, but in reality, the guard is located on the top of the iron, not the side where you are most likely to burn yourself.    </li>
            <li>I had to take HUGE sections of hair (practically half of the side of my head)to</li>
            <li>With the inStyler it cuts the time in half and comes out so smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I ended up cutting the top half of my hair into layers since that seems to be the only part that gets uncontrolably wavy and frizzy and now my hair is beautiful.</li>
            <li>I have pretty coarse naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li>However, I quickly realized that it didn&#x27;t do anymore for my hair than if I had just spent the time using a hair dryer and a brush.  </li>
            <li>I knew I would have to straighten my hair a lot more at this length and bought the item but made sure I could return it as I am very skeptical of anything that claims to straighten hair.</li>
            <li>Also it was not hard at all to straight the hair in the back of my head.</li>
            <li>Nothing could&#x27;ve been further from the truth: this is, hands down, the most abysmal styling product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>When I use a regular flatiron, I hold it in my right hand and pull it through the left side of my head, and then hold it in my left hand and pull it through the right side of my head.  </li>
            <li>Be careful, it gets very hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve burnt my scalp a couple of times but the same thing happened when I used flat irons, even more so often with the flat irons.</li>
            <li>Apparently this is a new seller!</li>
            <li>You also have to be very careful not to burn yourself, but that is true for any iron.    </li>
            <li>I use it right after I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li>I do like that you can really style you&#x27;re hair as you go in one go versus other hot tools that you have to use interchangeably.</li>
            <li>I was excited at first to find a product that will work on my thick hair.</li>
            <li>Wish I&#x27;d been smart enough to read some customer reviews beforehand!</li>
            <li>Oh, and it takes a few tries to get it right, but once you do it&#x27;s so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>She donated 11 inches of hair to Locks of Love last week, leaving her with hair a little longer than shoulder-length hair and it works SO well with it now, too...</li>
            <li>gave my hair a little shine, because of the rotation.&lt;br /&gt;I am able to straighten larger sections of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Gives volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I keep one on my bathroom counter at all times for quick styling and touch-ups, and keep the other one in my suitcase for traveling.  </li>
            <li>She has paid more for professional type flat irons that fried her hair and didn&#x27;t do half the job.  </li>
            <li>I have to say, I was a complete skeptic on this product.</li>
            <li>They just talk to the customers any old way with no qualified information about my product.</li>
            <li>Much tweaking is necessary.</li>
            <li>It is LOUD, and I like to do my hair while watching a movie, etc.  </li>
            <li>You can not get the InStyler close enough to your scalp to really achieve these styles because it will burn you.  </li>
            <li>Its squeaks so loud.</li>
            <li>This is such a versatile product that you can go from wavey to straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and have worn it for the longest time in a curly style.  </li>
            <li>Makes returns far easier.    </li>
            <li>I have the old one</li>
            <li>it does not fit in my hand securely as I try to style.  </li>
            <li>I have shorter strands of hair near the front of my head and, when I went to straighten those, I burned my forehead.  </li>
            <li>And when I went to straighten the side near my ear, I burned my neck.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sensitive to noise.  </li>
            <li>(Do not allow young children to use.)  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly and frizzy hair</li>
            <li>It has a loud motor, nothing you can&#x27;t get used to though.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll notice how much work you put in using a regular hair straightener versus using the InStyler.   </li>
            <li>My hair was extremely soft after each run through.</li>
            <li>I completely regret buying this crappy dresser accessory.</li>
            <li>She is only really using it for its curling capabilities, but</li>
            <li>I have tried every straightening product out there, including chemical ones like a professional salon Keratin treatment.</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s not frustrating enough I used it for 2 wks</li>
            <li>I bought the Instyler for my 13 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>but i have to admit it doesnt work well on mine as far as straightening goes</li>
            <li>I thought it was a real instyler until I actually purchased one from ULTA.</li>
            <li>If I want to curl my hair, I just use a regular iron, but I don&#x27;t curl my hair very often.    </li>
            <li>Once you get used to holding it correctly and using smaller sections of hair, it does work very well.  </li>
            <li>(my $30 straight iron delivers the same results).</li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to as far as using the tool without burning yourself</li>
            <li>While it wont get your hair stick straight if you&#x27;re a mixed chick like me or</li>
            <li>and I got all the natural curls.  </li>
            <li>the bristles on the brush end look like a 30 year old abused broom - they&#x27;re all frayed and pushedapart.  </li>
            <li>I have different lengths of hair and it all looks sleek and straight when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair every day, straight hair stays the same even after sleeping on it!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care that I&#x27;m too old</li>
            <li>I am completely furious about this.  </li>
            <li>I have had the InStyler for nearly 3 months now.  </li>
            <li>I was completely surprised at the packaging...</li>
            <li>Of all the ones I&#x27;ve used, this is by far the easiest.</li>
            <li>Having said that, it works for me so far (used it for a week so far).  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li>Between 2 daughters &amp; myself-with different hair textures &amp; straight</li>
            <li>I got mine direct from the infomercial on the buy</li>
            <li>So far the product lives up to what they say it does.</li>
            <li>There is some truth to this save for the fact that the rotating iron burns your scalp and forehead if you try to get it anywhere near your roots.</li>
            <li>I was told I had to go through the InStyler manufacturer directly.  </li>
            <li>In conclusion, do not waste your time, efforts, or money on the InStyler Rotating Iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fighting to get my money back from a very irresponsible vendor.</li>
            <li>I finally surprised her with it</li>
            <li>It would straighten my hair, sort of, but left it very frizzy</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li>So I thought the InStyler would be the same principle and work really well...</li>
            <li>And i guarantee you any professional hair stylist will recommend it and they&#x27;re probably using it too.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair &amp; the Instyler</li>
            <li>It takes absolutely FOREVER to heat up, definitely not something that would be used in a rush.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did not listen to all of the negative things people had to say about the InStyler..</li>
            <li>I actually found this so much easier because I like to flip my hair under</li>
            <li>and I could do that with one hand by just pulling my hair straight back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had natural frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product after my 10 year old Infrashine straightened kicked the bucket.</li>
            <li>loud but bearable</li>
            <li>The roller is too big to straighten bangs very well.</li>
            <li>i cant return it because i really dont feel like paying shipping back.</li>
            <li>The flat plate also heats up very hot on the outside, so all of your styling will be with the one hand</li>
            <li>One more thing about a few days prior to this, the company sent me a plastic shield to go over the barrel as to prevent burning...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sorry to read the reviews by those who didn&#x27;t have good luck with the Instyler, because it has completely revitalized my look.  </li>
            <li>This was even worse on my own.</li>
            <li>I have read the instructions and am still confused about when it is the hottest and why it flashes with three lights and never gets warm.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many straighteners on my thick, coarse hair over the years and this is by far the least effective one of all.</li>
            <li>For each section of hair, I run it through twice - barrel side out first to smooth down the outer frizzies and then run it through the same section of hair a second time with the barrel side inside curling it under at the ends giving my hair some body.</li>
            <li>As I said, my super thick hair with a wave straight from the Pacific Coast, I didn&#x27;t have my sights set too high for this thing.  </li>
            <li>I dry it very fast just using a comb</li>
            <li>And I live in a humid climate, which normally frizzes my hair as soon as I walk outside.  </li>
            <li>so you have to hold it in the same direction for your right and left side.</li>
            <li>I went back to my standard flat iron to get the smooth cuticle</li>
            <li>Apparently if you burn your hand drop it and want to fix it you must buy a new one.</li>
            <li>With a rotating curling iron on one side, and a brush on the other side, it gives you such a smooth look.</li>
            <li>I can see where it can easily fall on a dog or a small child that may be hanging about you (as dogs and children do) &amp; burn them.</li>
            <li>My naturally curly frizzy hair is straightened but bouncy unlike flat irons that leave my hair too straight and the ends looking pointy.    </li>
            <li>but when i straighten them I prefer a more bouncy/bombshell look than 100% flat &amp; straight hair if you know what i mean.</li>
            <li>&quot; straight instead of wavy like a flat iron.</li>
            <li>My hair does not look straight every time I use it I have to use a flat iron to finish it.</li>
            <li>I think people you use flat irons are going to find this product to work very well for them.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;ve got a hundred bucks to blow then it is does a fine job, but if you are like me and on a super tight budget you will more than likely feel guilty for spending that much money on something that doesn&#x27;t WOW you like expected</li>
            <li>The bigger one gives extremely loose curls that fall out quickly.</li>
            <li>It does get hot, but there are heat adjustments on the knob, so you can start off a little cooler than the other settings until you get comfortable with using it.  </li>
            <li>I could have lived with this sorta straight style because it went way quicker than using a flat iron, but then I noticed the bristles were bent and melting!  </li>
            <li>If you have short or mid length, loose curly or wavy hair you will be able to straighten your hair in less than a half hour for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many split ends because of this, it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li>but they should&#x27;ve redesigned it to make it less awkward and more user-friendly for people doing their own hair.    </li>
            <li>My only con is the fact that it gets so hot and has the potential to inflict heat induced discomfort.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and it takes half the time it used to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>It has never failed to come back on after pressing the power button to bring it back to life.</li>
            <li>My first unit was faulty - did not light up (hence can&#x27;t say much about its quality ctrl - 1 star) -</li>
            <li>It does come with a \\&quot;thermal shield\\&quot; to protect you from this but the shield only protects one small &lt;1\\&quot; area on top of the rotator... which if you are straightening/ lifting your roots, it is the side of the rotator that burns you.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;ve only used this product for curling and NOT straightening, so I can only attest for curling.</li>
            <li>i must admit that i&#x27;m very handy with a flat iron, but i don&#x27;t like that slick straight look (though i have thick hair to pull it off</li>
            <li>- When I would use regular straighteners before, it would take me at least an hour to get my whole head done and to be sure there weren&#x27;t any pieces left unstraightened.  </li>
            <li>but it for me only works on the high setting</li>
            <li>I have curly thin hair and most straightners run too hot and make my hair very flat.</li>
            <li>With the Instyler I still put in minimal effort (still letting it air dry overnight), but now I get fabulous results after spending 15 minutes styling my hair in the morning with the device.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I had used one that worked previous, so I knew my product was not working properly.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate, buy this tool now if you&#x27;re like me and have very little time everyday but LOVE having straight and managed hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a \\&quot;mature\\&quot; gal with curly, frizzy grey hair and was feeling very frumpy until I bought the Instyler (I bought \\&quot;the original\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li>Plus, on humid days a serum and my curling brush still wasn&#x27;t enough to tame my fine, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m wearing long straight hair just for a year or so</li>
            <li>when I&#x27;m done it&#x27;s slick and smooth.</li>
            <li>If you have long somewhat already straight hair</li>
            <li>I have waited 50 long years to get my hair as it is now, thanks to the Instyler, I just can&#x27;t do without it and will be buying a spare so as never to be without it.</li>
            <li>yet it took a really long time to do my whole head that way</li>
            <li>It also works really well if I want to put long curls in.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still hot, just carefully place in the bag</li>
            <li>Yes, it is a hot iron and you have to be careful.  </li>
            <li>i currently have an ISO ceramic 1\\&quot; flat iron that works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It does get very hot and you definitely need to be careful so that you don&#x27;t burn yourself.</li>
            <li>Only con Is It didn&#x27;t come with the spary that It normally comes with It.</li>
            <li>I normally would straighten my hair once or twice a week since last fall or so.</li>
            <li>It took a year to grow out my hair and get it back to normal.  </li>
            <li>does get hot, so BE CAREFUL.</li>
            <li>:  Since I wasn&#x27;t able to return the item after it had been used, per store policy, I improved the product by cutting the brisles as low as I could cut them, and it made the item somewhat of a better flat iron, which is what I need to use it for.  </li>
            <li>Also it is a little hard to use on my hair because you have to make sure its rotating in the proper direction, but I&#x27;ve always had trouble straightening my hair on my own</li>
            <li>I received my In-Styler several days ago - and tried it today - New Year&#x27;s Eve</li>
            <li>so it really wasnt on for very long each time i used it, and the motor burnt out...</li>
            <li>It is much easier to have your hair completely dry.    </li>
            <li>But since I got it for only about half the retail price, I&#x27;m just disgruntled and indignant enough to go on record with my opinion in the hopes that somebody will read it, choose not to buy this item and save their money for something more worthy--like a product that actually performs according to its claims.</li>
            <li>Revo Styler is a rotating brush that allows you to blow dry your hair straight with a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>In the middle of doing my hair it will click off and won&#x27;t go back on until it wants to.</li>
            <li>I called the customer service and not only was the person I spoke to incredibly rude, but after I asked to speak to a manager I was even more offended.</li>
            <li>younger and straight hair was the ONLY option.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job as it says it should (minus bangs and short hair), but the hardware issues just weren&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li>its possible, but difficult and i&#x27;ve burned myself a good bit.</li>
            <li>and I told him now my hair can blow and it will just fall right down into place.  </li>
            <li>I think that for someone who has thick hair such as myself it is more time consuming to have to really put small sections at a time versus a very hot flat iron.</li>
            <li>check out my other reviews for hot hair items that work.</li>
            <li>i always have to restraighten with my normal flat iron...</li>
            <li>It used to be a major undertaking to straighten my hair</li>
            <li>Have gotten nothing but compliments from not only family, friends, and co-workers ... but complete strangers as well!</li>
            <li>Not only is the thing loud, it didnt get the job done at all!   </li>
            <li>If you are not careful you will burn your fingers!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t and copuldn&#x27;t use any other hot iron anymore</li>
            <li>1.It does get hot like any other tool</li>
            <li>After a few uses I noticed that it never got very hot and as soon as I started using it</li>
            <li>you end up with major burns.     </li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels great,for the first time without putting any other products on it apart from shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It does get hot, but no hotter than any of the other tools I have used.  </li>
            <li>My hair is medium length very curly and normally takes an hour an a half to straighten.</li>
            <li>As one review stated, you have to be very careful because it does get quite HOT and</li>
            <li>The InStyler physical composition is o.k., but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be worth the hefty price tag when I look at comparably priced items such as my pricey hair dryer or facial scrubber which scream &#x27;made to last&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Even after I washed my hair, it was still straight for a while afterwards and it never left any creases like my flat iron did.</li>
            <li>It seems the InStyler was originally designed for professional hair stylists and just got passed to us common folk.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, wavy hair with a fine texture.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m african american with a decent grade of hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this as long as you buy from somewhere</li>
            <li>I have very thick mostly frizzy hair and have been using a straightner since 7th grade.  </li>
            <li>:) I have very thick hair</li>
            <li>I have used the In-Styler now and find it very slick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone and the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I would be tentative buying it through amazon since returns are such a pain.</li>
            <li>Then once I unplugged it, plugged it back up, fondle with the heater setting (low, med, high, and off)</li>
            <li>I just happened across the reviews on a website when I was looking for a new flat iron for my daughter and couldn&#x27;t believe this product was almost $100!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take long, and the brush makes it simple; my hair comes out looking put together much faster than if I use a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I have long, blonde, fine hair with a slight wave.</li>
            <li>really am not sure I needed to spend this much money for something I don&#x27;t use that much.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the wet iron is a lot easier to use and much safer.    </li>
            <li>As far as I am conceerned you can throw away your curling iron and your hair straightener and use only the Instyler.  </li>
            <li>At first I was skeptical about trying the instyler, but I finally caved hoping it would work better then my current iron.</li>
            <li>I use CHI&#x27;s Iron Guard spray with the InStyler and my split ends are kept at the absolute minimal.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do anything to your hair and barely heats up.</li>
            <li>After inspecting the unit, it appears that it is not the heat that broke my hair, but it is actually the rotating action with the nylon bristles that actually pull and snag the hair, resulting in severe damage and breakage near the root.  </li>
            <li>If you pay that much for something it should last much longer than a few months.</li>
            <li>They were barely even brushing my hair as I was straightening anymore</li>
            <li>it is far too short.  </li>
            <li>Instyler covers only products purchased directly from the company, from the TV station, or from a store (I assume that means a building you can visit).  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased and received the Instyler directly from the company.</li>
            <li>So when I was about 75% complete with straightening my hair, I blew out the rest of my curls briefly and then used the iron.</li>
            <li>I prefer my wet 2 straight $25 straightener over this one.</li>
            <li>It definitely gets hot, and you have to be careful getting used to it or setting it too close to anything that might melt.  </li>
            <li>Even more frustrating, however, is the propensity the instyler has to burn the user.  </li>
            <li>The rolling heater part was turning slowly and had a grinding sound.</li>
            <li>It is difficult to straighten your own hair with it because of the brush</li>
            <li>And the instructions even say that if it&#x27;s too hot turn it down.  </li>
            <li>I have natural african american hair: very curly in spots and some frizzy dry spots.</li>
            <li>Though I only paid half of the retail price, I still do not think it is worth even that.</li>
            <li>Another reason I&#x27;m returning it is because I&#x27;ve read a whole bunch of reviews saying that they break easy, that is disturbing for me to see.</li>
            <li>I would strongly advise anyone with even moderately thick or coarse hair against buying this straightener.</li>
            <li>I mean, I&#x27;d rather have my hair up instead of a huge ball of frizz.</li>
            <li>I found blow-drying and other flatirons difficult to use and usually gave up, but the Instyler is so easy and gives such good results, I do it all the time.  </li>
            <li>I feel I should be able to return it and get my money back if the product did not successfully perform the one task it is designated to do.  </li>
            <li>Sadly, that has been my experience, even with &#x27;tons&#x27; of product in my fine, straight, graying-blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>It took me about a couple a months to really get used to using it and I won&#x27;t look at any other straightening product.</li>
            <li>Other than that it works very well.</li>
            <li>Though at first it would just make my hair a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t take long at all to style, and the ceramic barrel and low heat setting was enough to keep my hair straight even on a humid June day in Iowa.  </li>
            <li>My old flat iron doesn&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li>I woke up to a hot mess.</li>
            <li>no where near the look you get from a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I made it work due to the fact I had paid so much for it.    </li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t have nearly the amount of damage I did when using a flat iron every day</li>
            <li>I manipulate it much like I did my other irons.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend spending the $100 bucks on a CHI flat iron or a IZUNAMI flat iron.</li>
            <li>No single product will work for everyone.</li>
            <li>Since Amazon has one for half the price, if you really need two of them, just buy two from Amazon, and it will cost the same as buying directly from the site.  </li>
            <li>Without half a gallon of hairspray, it only stayed straight for about an hour or so and then returned to its natural state.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and never can find a product that works well for straightening, always just ended up using a larger barrel curling iron that ultimately damages my hair.  </li>
            <li>Even when I go back to shorter curly hair (only cuz I&#x27;m old)</li>
            <li>This is not worth for free, dries up &amp; ruins the texture of the hair.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a well made item and feels consistent to any other curling / flat iron I have held.  </li>
            <li>Probably I need more practice in how to use this item, but so far I am not impressed with it.    </li>
            <li>and it will not dry your roots</li>
            <li>I have really thick hair and this product did not get my hair smooth enough.  </li>
            <li>it doesnt clamp on tight enough to really smooth the hair, and if you use it on damp hair you have to go over it several times until its dry</li>
            <li>My hair is already pretty straight (some weird waves or tangles here and there), so I used it mainly just to make it look neater.</li>
            <li>Normally, I wash it and let it dry for the next day.</li>
            <li>The only thing I can say is that my hair seems a bit less susceptible to humidity and thus, the style lasts longer (even till I wash despite sleeping on it or breaking a sweat on a hot day).</li>
            <li>If I do not receive my prepaid envelope within the next week I will be contacting the Attorney General&#x27;s Office to have this issue handled.</li>
            <li>I have to go back to my old flat and curling irons.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no excuse for this level of negligence and lack of concern for customer safety.</li>
            <li>After starting the process over again, it finally started to heat up but not as hot as it was the day before and not hot enough to make any difference in her hair.  </li>
            <li>Not too long ago I noticed that the company now offers the Instyler in 2 sizes and a 14-day trial.</li>
            <li>This made my hair look dead and burnt my ears because there is no gaurd on the end of the hot roller.</li>
            <li>I rated it only four stars because of the fact that it took some time to figure out how to get the back of my head without my hair getting snagged, and the fact that they don&#x27;t provide anything to put it down on while it&#x27;s hot.  </li>
            <li>my hair doesnt come out straight down and silky like the informercials ...</li>
            <li>The barrel only turns one way, and while I have no problems positioning it on my right side, I have a lot of trouble using it on my left.    </li>
            <li>My hair is thick, coarse, and LONG ... not to mention that I have always had to wait until I got to my hair styled at the salon (which usually takes two people brushing and blowing to get manageable) to have my hair look this good.</li>
            <li>that hair - start at the scalp and smooth down - holding the ends a little longer if I want them to flip.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>I did not give it 5 stars because: it breaks down fairly quickly (according to other reviewers)</li>
            <li>I have very very long wild and unmanageable curly hair.</li>
            <li>If I let my hair dry naturally, it just looks parched and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I used black nail polish to draw 3 big arrows on brush side so it was easy to tell which direction the barrel was rolling, helps eliminate wasted time and frustration trying to figure which way to hold InStyler.</li>
            <li>I tried it out as soon as I received it, and had my hair straight in less than 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly, frizzy, dry, etc.</li>
            <li>&quot; This lead me to think it was ceramic coated (which is much safer and less damaging to your hair...</li>
            <li>In real life, it made my bangs stick out at odd angles and it made them look like they were fried...</li>
            <li>Especially when you get near the roots.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a long time to heat up.&lt;br /&gt;Laves my hair</li>
            <li>The iron itself is fine, but the control switch is very confusing.  </li>
            <li>I can take my hair from a frizzy mess to beautifully straight and shiny in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>My bangs are bleaced white and then redyed every week pink, and it polishes them like new.  </li>
            <li>It also claimed that it would dry your hair, and that was very misleading also because it you used it on wet hair with product</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it everyday but it does make hair much less frizzy, smooth &amp; gives it body.</li>
            <li>If you hold the InStyler closed tight and firm and pull down the length of the hair slow, it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>and I mean quick.  </li>
            <li>Looks very cheap and fake.</li>
            <li>and maybe it did; she has thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair that is shoulder length.  </li>
            <li>Save your money and buy a large, round curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Yes there is a learning curve because the Instyler should be held a certain way to get the results your are looking for, but it took me a few days getting used to my straightener</li>
            <li>Normally, with my Chi or other hair straightener, I would need my husband to help me straighten the back properly, and it would take around 45 minutes to do.</li>
            <li>Although I am very right handed and pretty inept with the left, I did not find it too hard to use the Instyler, which some reviewers complained about.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fairly limp; and wanted to give it some body and lift... needless to say I could have achieved better results with a large curling</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried curling my hair and it doesn&#x27;t do a very good job unless you want to put 500 products in your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked very good.</li>
            <li> A friend with &#x27;tons&#x27; of hair that has Great Body, has had wonderful results.    </li>

            <li> Good luck!</li>
            <li> I loved it!  </li>
            <li> I watched a beautiful Hispanic woman style her hair with and InStyler at a fashion show</li>
            <li> It smooths the hair beautifully.</li>
            <li> Even if you suffered with Carole King type hair in your youth you can have beautiful shiny hair</li>
            <li> But when I use the Instyler I always get compliments on how beautiful &amp; shiny my hair is.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and surprisingly it works just as well as seen on television.</li>
            <li> everybody knows that i have gorgeous hair and asks me how is it so perfect all the time.  </li>
            <li> I asked my hair stylist if my hair was damaged after using it for a couple of months, and she said my hair looks very healthy!  </li>
            <li> but the heat guard is great for novices.</li>
            <li> lol....</li>
            <li> Worked great.</li>
            <li> AND IT LOOKS GREAT,</li>
            <li> It was great.</li>
            <li> The company was prompt in delivery and it arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li> It gives you great height on your crown by overextending while using it.  </li>
            <li> Great price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for styling my hair when the weather is humid.</li>
            <li> But this works great for waves and curves.</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> It also works great on my medium texture frizzy hair which has somewhat of a wave.</li>
            <li> Great looking until you pick it up.  </li>
            <li> The instyler works great</li>
            <li> but it works great.</li>
            <li> My device has not quit working as I saw others had experienced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it about 6 months with great results</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> but my hair looks great.</li>
            <li> this is a great concept...</li>
            <li> Great vendor.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work great for my type of hair.</li>
            <li> I thought it looked great.</li>
            <li> My mom recommended this to me, because she has one, and it works great for her.</li>
            <li> Looked like it would be a great product.  </li>
            <li> InStyler has been a great tool for me.</li>
            <li> The InStyler is a great product.  </li>
            <li> Great product, use it every day.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just not quality construction, but the idea of it is great.  </li>
            <li> The Instyler works great</li>
            <li> Also great for the humid Florida climate that causes the frizzies.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would be great for curling my hair since I saw on TV how it did great on all types of hair.  </li>
            <li> I was really happy with the way it styled my naturally-curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d keep all 3 in case something happened to the one I&#x27;m using, but it&#x27;s been 2 years and it still works great.    </li>
            <li> This is just a great product.  </li>
            <li> My hair is happy and so am I.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and it works great EVERY time.  </li>
            <li> This straightner does a great job on my hair.</li>
            <li> And the product did work great... for about two weeks.</li>
            <li> This works great...</li>
            <li> It creates great volume at the crown if you have shorter hair there.</li>
            <li> To all who have given this product great reviews...</li>
            <li> She did her friend&#x27;s hair with it and it turned out great.    </li>
            <li> It looked great</li>
            <li> and it worked great...</li>
            <li> : I will say this: the instyler is great at straightening hair.</li>
            <li> great...</li>
            <li> Great product...</li>
            <li> it took me a couple of times to get used to it, but it works great and curls great.  </li>
            <li> Its a great product but for $100 they need to improve the design AND their customer service.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how great it was.</li>
            <li> This works as a great substitute for that.</li>
            <li> the roller part worked great</li>
            <li> so it looks great</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> Love it !!</li>
            <li> I got this for christmas and absolutely love it!!  </li>

            <li> I absolutely love mine!!</li>
            <li> and I love it!!</li>
            <li> I find the end result of the Instyler to be very nice.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product!  </li>
            <li> This is perfect because it is a straightener if that is what you want, and it can give you lovely waves if that is what you desire.  </li>
            <li> I have heard so many wonderful things.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled!  </li>
            <li> Streamlined, easy-to-use, and effective!</li>
            <li> This has been the best invention for my hair type for sure.  </li>
            <li> she was thrilled!</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t it murphy&#x27;s law that when you find the very best product that you totally love, the company will either discontinue it or go out of business?&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t it murphy&#x27;s law that when you find the very best product that you totally love, the company will either discontinue it or go out of business?&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and it said to make sure that you had a good hair cut for the best results.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use - great results !  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, I love it!</li>
            <li> I have really fine wavy hair and it strengthened it perfectly.</li>
            <li> I think for someone with shorter fine hair it would work wonderful.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, it is a great tool and a great design, it could just be built better.  </li>
            <li> Another good thing about this product is that it came with a thermal shield for the barrel and now I wouldn&#x27;t get burned.  </li>
            <li> but this is a good product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen the commercials and wondered if it was as good as they said it was.  </li>
            <li> I figured I loved the immediate results</li>
            <li> I loved this.  </li>
            <li> I just have to say who ever invented this product is a Genius, this product is good for anyone with Striaght hair or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It curls good and does add a lot of volume</li>
            <li> Good Luck.</li>
            <li> Reviews show that it does a good job on coarser hair that needs the bristles</li>
            <li> This is a good concept, but it needs work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She loved it.</li>
            <li> I use good products on my hair and I can assure you this not one of them.  </li>
            <li> Every product that induces heat on your hair will damage it, which is why it&#x27;s wise to always use thermal protectant sprays.</li>
            <li> A friend had let me try hers when we we&#x27;re at a conference weekend and was delighted to find it for the price at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Of course it isn&#x27;t like as good as</li>
            <li> Fantastic customer service, you are the best!  </li>
            <li> The wife loved it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the instyler for a good price.</li>
            <li> So Good purchase over all.</li>
            <li> However, with a good haircut every four weeks my hair looks</li>
            <li> I had heard of it, but never heard if it was a good deal or not...</li>
            <li> At this point I don&#x27;t care how good your product is, your business ethics SUCK.  </li>
            <li> and I started from the lower temperature, but it was not doing a good job.</li>
            <li> and I got a good result.</li>
            <li> It works just as good as the infomercial.  </li>
            <li> and I really loved what I managed to do with it.</li>
            <li> Good luck,     Dina\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> It is a really good product</li>
            <li> So I purchased it and loved it for 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I would have loved this product when I was</li>
            <li> Then I was told by a friend that she loved the product</li>
            <li> It works great and is easy to use!</li>
            <li> This tool is wonderful and quick to use.</li>
            <li> Great product, make sure you buy it from a authorized dealer.</li>
            <li> after 3 plus uses she is still very satisfied.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used this InStyler one time and am very pleased with the way it makes my hair look.  </li>
            <li> so I went and purchased another CHI; a product which ALWAYS performs great and will for many years to come.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> the sellers were great the product is ok not what they make it out to be</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my order.  </li>
            <li> It is real easy to use too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shiny, glossy, has volume, and looks very very healthy.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say i loved what it did for my hair and got lots of compliments</li>
            <li> I just wanted to share how I love my instyler, it is so easy and always makes my hair perfect!</li>
            <li> I really am enjoying this iron!</li>
            <li> I love the instyler!  </li>
            <li> I think it would&#x27;ve looked better if hadn&#x27;t done it at all!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> It probably works better with people who have thicker hair like me!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> &amp; I love it!</li>
            <li> To top it all off--it doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I decided against purchasing the Instyler!</li>
            <li> Love the InStyler (with painted arrows!)</li>
            <li> I would definately recommend getting this product - I love it and my hair looks amazing!</li>
            <li> and I fell in love!  </li>
            <li> I love my Instyler!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love this product!  </li>
            <li> I love this item!  </li>
            <li> Best seller that I have deal with, at first I wasn&#x27;t completly satified with the instyler</li>
            <li> I AM IN LOVE!</li>
            <li> I am more upset with the seller than I am the product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 of these they gives me the most luxurious curls ever!  </li>
            <li> one of the best and most unique feature of this styler is that it brushes your hair while curling it so you can always run your fingers through your hair.</li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> The Instyler is easy to use and works great on my hair.</li>
            <li> When I bought this item I was expecting it to give me beautiful hair with just the right amount of shine!</li>
            <li> The video makes it look amazing, and was looking forward to getting two of them for my daughters for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> and it worked amazingly.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels silky smooth and my ends look and feel great.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing, not kidding.</li>
            <li> It is just an amazing tool.  </li>
            <li> give you an amazing shine look.  </li>
            <li> This appliance is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Ive had the instyler for about 6 months now and it is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> Be your own critic....</li>
            <li> and this is absolutely the best product on the market for my hair.</li>
            <li> There is one thing I read in the instrucions that said: do not use any kind of styling products if using this.</li>
            <li> I used it the way they showed and I have straight perfect hair.  </li>
            <li> :) Now, I always have a way to make it look good.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s a nice product</li>
            <li> ive heard many good things about this product im going to get it.</li>
            <li> i really think this is a perfect gift for any guy to buy a women,  </li>
            <li> i cut my own hair and used the instyler</li>
            <li> Its kinda noisy, but it was a nice product.</li>
            <li> Again, nice product but not for me.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to have done business with her.  </li>
            <li> Brush your hair well to get the product nicely distributed.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> And I liked how this iron works</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice for smoothing and shaping the rest of my hair when I have time.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair that I&#x27;ve had relaxed and it works GREAT!!  </li>
            <li> It worked wonderfully on my hair, leaving it straight and shiny.  </li>
            <li> With this unit, it takes 5-10 minutes at my own house.</li>
            <li> This person was not as nice, so I demanded a refund number because my 30 day trial was running out.  </li>
            <li> I was impressed at how fast I got my hair done, but really it isn&#x27;t $100 impressive.</li>
            <li> It even comes with its own carrying case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that one of these days it will just stay off for good, so I need to buy another straightener.</li>
            <li> IF YOU WANT STRAIGHT, SHINY, BEAUTIFUL NON-FRIZZY HAIR!!!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> I liked the look but not what it made my hair feel like.</li>
            <li> After using a friends instyler, I wanted one of my own</li>
            <li> I have never had any luck straightening my hair on my own..</li>
            <li> No hair product of any kind is on the non-returnable list.</li>
            <li> It did not rip or pull my hair, which was nice.</li>
            <li> but my hair seems dryer and not as nice.  </li>
            <li> , HOWEVER I WISH IT HAD SOME KIND OF RUBBER</li>
            <li> and then I use the instyler to do my bangs because it creates a nice flip.</li>
            <li> I have never gotten my hair to hold any kind of curl.</li>
            <li> You should be conditioning your hair and using some of kind of heat protectant no matter what styling tool your are using.</li>
            <li> It is a nice tool, but I would have stuck with the $20 hair styler from Wal-Mart if I had an opportunity to use the instyler before I purchased it.</li>
            <li> After 5 months, it started catching my hair and tearing it out.  </li>
            <li> It really makes my hair look great!</li>
            <li> The commercial made it seem like the greatest product on the earth that would make me happy with how my hair would turn out.</li>
            <li> I liked that there was an attachment</li>
            <li> It does appear to polish the strands as stated on TV and it does give the hair a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Like I said, it does a nice job straightening my hair</li>
            <li> My cousin bought one, I tried it &amp; liked the results.</li>
            <li> Also miss some kind of stand for it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, the InStyler is an effective product.  </li>
            <li> and it puts a nice curl on the ends.</li>
            <li> I heard so many good things about this</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE my instyler!!  </li>
            <li> My biggest gripe is that instead of the hair coming out nice and smooth as shown on TV, it seems to grab the hair underneath and pull it up backwards through the bristles, which makes a VERY nice \\&quot;rat&#x27;s nest\\&quot; for you to have to try to comb out.</li>
            <li> Plus give it more than one shot, nothing is perfect the first time you do it.</li>
            <li> If you value healthy, full hair, and good customer service, DO NOT BUY THE INSTYLER!  </li>
            <li> Well, I was blown away by how incredible easy and fun it was to use!  </li>
            <li> It was very quick and I loved it.    </li>
            <li> With the instyler everything goes quickly and my hair looks great.  </li>
            <li> Great price, Quick Shipping</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
            <li> Hair still frizzed VERY easily     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s said to protect your hair from being burned, but its still very easy to burn your hair on it.</li>
            <li> I find it very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Also the design of this makes burning yourself very easy.</li>
            <li> It has helped keep my hair more healthy and the product helps the hair shine!  </li>
            <li> AND I CAN STYLE MY HAIR PERFECTLY AND LOOKS SHINE AND FEEL SOFT.</li>
            <li> I am glad I own it</li>
            <li> I liked the way it gave volume to the top of my head but after two uses the product stopped working.  </li>
            <li> The information on it and commercials talk about how great it is for fine hair and how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> Oh well, the fact is that this is a great styling tool and well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best styling tool i have ever owned!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite proficient with a hair brush and blow dryer, but I bought this product because it seemed like it would save time and be more effective in terms of styling.</li>
            <li> and this was the first time that I&#x27;ve done my own hair and LOVED the result and had it looking somewhat better than how the Salon does it!  </li>
            <li> Everyone said it worked great on all types of hair, when it didn&#x27;t even work right on mine.</li>
            <li> I know, great buy right?</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> I have very fine, below the shoulder hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> This transaction was so easy!</li>
            <li> Easy to use!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product for someone with very fine hair....</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!</li>
            <li> but my sister did (because i gave it to her because that&#x27;s how much i didn&#x27;t like it) and that didn&#x27;t work good for her either!</li>
            <li> It is the greatest thing since slice bread as us more mature folks would say.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> the full effect.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to burn yourself if you don&#x27;t use the heat shield!</li>
            <li> The InStyler ratating hot iron hair straightener is great.   </li>
            <li> and it worked great at first.  </li>
            <li> It worked great for the first two weeks - after that all downhill.  </li>
            <li> Product works great at first.  </li>
            <li> The inStyler is great because we got one with a protective counter topper to lie the hot styler on, and it came with an instructional DVD.</li>
            <li> You can tell it is very cheap quality when you get it.</li>
            <li> It seems like it is made very cheap.</li>
            <li> VERY IMPORTANT</li>
            <li> So far... loving the Instyler!!  </li>
            <li> This did make my hair look nice and it was easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and I loved doing it in the morning when my hair wasn&#x27;t necessarily looking its best.</li>
            <li> But as far as the product itself, it&#x27;s very good.  </li>
            <li> I definitely have to give this thing a perfect 5 out of 5.</li>
            <li> I love the Instyler.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li> so make sure you hang onto it--</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t straighten well and burned my hair even more.</li>
            <li> I have a great spray on product I used before drying my hair and loved the results, but without it my hair gets the fly-aways from static &amp; low humidity.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t this precious?    </li>
            <li> AND I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I WILL SURELY ORDER ME</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s safe from ruining anything else.      </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.   </li>
            <li> I tested this many times and it was no mistake.</li>
            <li> I got so many compliments at work</li>
            <li> We all love it.  </li>
            <li> I was able to use this out of the box with no problems.  </li>
            <li> maybe I was better informed.  </li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with the Instyler from the 1st day of use.</li>
            <li> I was able to use the InStyler for 5 minutes...before it broke.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love curling my hair with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found within 10 to 15 minutes my hair is nice and smooth.     </li>
            <li> The best part is, I&#x27;ve been able to get away from styling it daily.</li>
            <li> :)     </li>
            <li> I get more compliments on my hair now since using the InStyler.  </li>
            <li> But I am getting better at using it.</li>
            <li> I thought it was okay.  </li>
            <li> :)    </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll be spending a lot of time together.</li>
            <li> For $80, you can get a hair straightener about 100x better than this one, believe me.</li>
            <li> , It is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars and hope they decide to make them in various barrel sizes for everyone to be able to experience this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> add, pleased don&#x27;t purchase this product, you will regret it,</li>
            <li> I doubt if many women need two of them.</li>
            <li> Bottom Line at the Top</li>
            <li> Would surely break in no time if I didn&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> better then any straightener iron.</li>
            <li> I am not at all pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Until last week, my daughter had waist-length hair, and it worked wonderfully on her hair, too.  </li>
            <li> probably even better than before.  </li>
            <li> Plus I paid more.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> If the barrel is placed on top of the hair, the hair flips out.</li>
            <li> this is okay...</li>
            <li> and I love it howver</li>
            <li> More importently</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 10 months and love it for its ease of use</li>
            <li> So I am always looking for a better way to straighten and style my hair.</li>
            <li> All in all my ISO straightner is much better and much better constucted too.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better to be safe than sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the InStyler.</li>
            <li> and they are all better.  </li>
            <li> and she was so pleased.</li>
            <li> I would suggest this product if it were better designed.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Use a defrizz product to go with it - I love John Frieda \\&quot;Frizz Ease\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I gather up about the top 80% of my hair into a clip or pony tail and start with the hair underneath.  </li>
            <li> Your better off using a more reliable heating tool brand.</li>
            <li> I bought the Instyler after seeing how it \\&quot;polishes\\&quot; your hair and gives it a healthy bounce.  </li>
            <li> I have been pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> hope you have better results with it than me.</li>
            <li> I love the</li>
            <li> it did these adorable flips...</li>
            <li> and I see better results with a Target straightener than with a tv styler.</li>
            <li> Love my InStyler</li>
            <li> and i think if it were made with a ceramic roller it would be much better...</li>
            <li> I am ok with that.</li>
            <li> I love it more and more</li>
            <li> I know people prob get it most for straightening their hair</li>
            <li> I borrowed the Instyler from my friend and I am glad to say I did not purchase one.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> With this one product I&#x27;m able to put away my straightener and curling iron.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in short amount of time and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> :)      </li>
            <li> I can make my hair straight, curled under or flip up, and it has great body.    </li>
            <li> The top of the cylinder part of the iron fell off.  </li>
            <li> I think that this product could have been made with better quality.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it at walmart</li>
            <li> It worked ok.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I still use it when I am going out and want to look more finished.</li>
            <li> Her hair looks shiney, straight, and has great volume.</li>
            <li> Even during incredibly humid weather her hair holds and look good without the expected frizzies.</li>
            <li> I have tried every product on the planet to make my hair more manageable, from leave-in treatments to curlers to revolving brushes, but NOTHING comes close to the Instyler.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Instyler.  </li>
            <li> make sure it lasts longer, is made better and provide better customer service.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t even use the leftover heat to do any more hair.</li>
            <li> I got the instyler for christmas and was phsyced, but after a use or two is started making static-ey noises and wouldnt stay on for more than five seconds.</li>
            <li> simply the best and faster</li>
            <li> I think more of these \\&quot;complaints\\&quot; are user error.    </li>
            <li> Holding the rotating barrel on the top side of your hair gets rid of those fly-aways</li>
            <li> I just love this thing.  </li>
            <li> and then I will not be able to return it.</li>
            <li> Also I put the barrel on the TOP of my scalp, not on the bottom.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with it, but not in love with it.  </li>
            <li> i love this product.  </li>
            <li> but, i love it</li>
            <li> my friends say my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Brought as a gift for my aunt and she love it.</li>
            <li> I do truly love this product.  </li>
            <li> I am glad that I did.  </li>
            <li> So all In all I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am trying all kinds of styles ALL the time now, I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I have had frizzy/wavy hair all my life and have NEVER been able to straighten it until the Instyler.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended the Instyler, she&#x27;d never been able to straighten her hair either.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t care that another style would look better on me.  </li>
            <li> This product is better than using a culing iron if you have to use heat on your hair.</li>
            <li> But the in-styler makes it look healthy.</li>
            <li> months - calling the companies themselves to try and reverse the charges, most of which they will not do.  </li>
            <li> I love it for my hair also.</li>
            <li> Most things I buy are crappy but I will say NOT this item..</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re left-handed, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a much better product then what was delivered.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I order from them because  a month after I purchased the Instyler they send me a plastic that prevents you from burning.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this styler.  </li>
            <li> On top of that, it didn&#x27;t curl at all.  </li>
            <li> I hope it works better on you than it did for me.</li>
            <li> I could wear a relaxed do which garnered many compliments.  </li>
            <li> it had all the authentic documentation; she had no comment on that.  </li>
            <li> My Instyler cannot be repaired, and my $80 is gone along with my hopes of a straighter more flattering hair style.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s magic</li>
            <li> The quality is top of the line.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> AND MAKES MY HAIR NICE AND SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> and then you will have better results  4.Use heat protection product when using</li>
            <li> but I love it.  </li>
            <li> and I am stil in love with it.</li>
            <li> I watched the advertisements many times and was convinced that this was a miracle hair tool.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this hair tool.  </li>
            <li> She said to make sure the iron is ceramic.</li>
            <li> So on top of using my non dominate hand, the heating element is exposed which can lead to some pain.</li>
            <li> i love flips and volume.</li>
            <li> with the InStyler, i am able to do just that.</li>
            <li> They are lightweight, they have cute colors, and it does what it is supposed to, which is straighten your hair.</li>
            <li> I think that is an a ok product.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to work</li>
            <li> When looking for a job, it is a neater more polished look than an afro-bush.   </li>
            <li> I have a short to medium length bob, so this should have been the perfect styling tool.</li>
            <li> Perhaps that is the reason it works so much better on TV.</li>
            <li> and I find that it works much better on my hair.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I purchased this item on Amazon because I am returning mine for a refund.</li>
            <li> you must have already pretty amazing hair!</li>
            <li> My hair did not look healthy or moisturized.</li>
            <li> WE ONLY WANT THE BEST</li>
            <li> and I cannot express how much I love it.  </li>
            <li> I cannot stand to spend more then fifteen minutes on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this machine.  </li>
            <li> It is so much more than a straightener.  </li>
            <li> I may end up buying it because I miss the compliments I&#x27;ve gotten... :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I love love love how my hair comes out.  </li>
            <li> I have had an Instyler for 2 years now and LOVE the results.  </li>
            <li> I am enjoying it and my hair shines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certainly glad that I didn&#x27;t pay $99.00 for this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Love this product!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> and I love the body.</li>
            <li> It needs to spend a bit more time in the development department, though.  </li>
            <li> I love my instyler</li>
            <li> I got an Instyler from a friend &amp; I really LOVE it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great product!</li>
            <li> the amount of shine you get is believable.</li>
            <li> most of time i have curly hair</li>
            <li> I may have gotten better results if I fried my hair in it, but again this defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> It only took me about 15 to 20 minutes and my hair looks awesome.</li>
            <li> Be sure you watch the dvd and not just hop in and start going..</li>
            <li> I bought this item more to try and curl my hair so please if you are looking to purchase to control</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3star and not a 2 because it does straighten well, but my $20 straightener does a better job.  </li>
            <li> After spending 10-15 minutes with Instyler, it looks like fantastic!</li>
            <li> My ponytail crease is gone and the back looks flawless.</li>
            <li> so I used it 3 more days and</li>
            <li> Maybe I should order two more...</li>
            <li> Maybe I should order two more...</li>
            <li> The Instyler leaves your hair with shine and volume, but make sure to use products that will protect your hair from the heat.</li>
            <li> Overall great product!</li>
            <li> With those options, you would have a better functioning straightening iron.</li>
            <li> This product fries your hair which causes more frizz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and easy to straighten and flip.</li>
            <li> I received the instyler very quickly which was great, it didn&#x27;t power up at first and when it did, it wouldn&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li> Honestly, my $25 flat iron was more impressive.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I bought my Instyler, but the item came incomplete.</li>
            <li> They were great &amp; I recieved my product just as they said I would; brand new and in record time!</li>
            <li> The InStyler barrel gets really hot &amp; I guess this is the reason it can work hair as effectively as it does - curls hold up amazingly.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Conair hot air curling combo with the 1.5\\&quot; barrel since 1997 ( and I have been through too many to count) and have always loved it.</li>
            <li> My hair looks better than I could have done on my own, works quickly</li>
            <li> Without reading the directions the first time my hair came out good and in 7 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job to straighten hair, looks sort of like a blow out from the salon.   </li>
            <li> The InStyler is first and foremost a straightener, so if you&#x27;re looking for a good straightener, this might be for you.</li>
            <li> It is very akward to use and seems like it is in the perspective of a person doing your hair instead of you doing your own hair!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that what I got was original!  </li>
            <li> I bought a new one at a kohls store and it works great.</li>
            <li> The styler is seriously great, its one of the few ones that straighten out your hair and make it look great.</li>
            <li> It perfectly straightening my hair (mind you when it was already dry,</li>
            <li> The insert says that you can use the iron on damp hair but they recommend it to be used on dry hair with no product in it for the best results.</li>
            <li> I was able to use it easily without even reading instructions.  </li>
            <li> This item would probably work best on a person with semi straight or straight hair.</li>
            <li> With that said, this device for MY hair is the single best thing that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad that I made the purchase, and at such a good price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not any more clunky than anything else I&#x27;ve used and is light.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something we both enjoy :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE the way it makes my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> I have never wrote a review before but so far this tool has been great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a faster, more efficient way to straighten my hair silky smooth without product.  </li>
            <li> It does continue to spin, and gets the job done, just with a lot of noise that seems like more than just the sound of a motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best $80 I ever spent.</li>
            <li> I loved the unit so much, though, I bought another one.</li>
            <li> It even takes my hair stylist a good 45 minutes to get my hair completely straight.  </li>
            <li> I recommend the Instyler to everone that wants gorgeous hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and quick.</li>
            <li> About a month ago my daughter bought one, works perfectly on her very fine medium lenght, wavy, limp hair.  </li>
            <li> ** and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is SUPER wonderful in that they will take back a product even YEARS after you bought it, if it breaks, and with the receipt.</li>
            <li> After using the product I was pleased with how quickly it worked the magic of straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I had so many compliments from friends and clients that I feel this product was well worth the investment I made on purchasing it!  </li>
            <li> Your product is indeed a true Hair Miracle!</li>
            <li> Other irons are easier to work with, but I like this one best.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use .</li>
            <li> It is easy to handle and operate.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to use.   </li>
            <li> Any humidity will curl and frizz my hair, so being able to plug this in, wait a few seconds and shape my bangs has been wonderful.  </li>
            <li> and it is so easy.</li>
            <li> and it straightens very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Easy to burn yourself.  </li>
            <li> It looks long, shiny, HEALTHY and beautiful all the time</li>
            <li> Any accidents could easily send you to a hospital.  </li>
            <li> It was really easy to use</li>
            <li> Its really easy to give it volume</li>
            <li> AND IT IS EASY TO USE</li>
            <li> and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> it seems like its easy if you&#x27;re straightening someone&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so easy to use an after watching the video I feel like a pro.</li>
            <li> The InStyler was easy to use and the styling results were just as advertised.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;2.The brush part doesnt stay in very good condition for long at all.</li>
            <li> Ok we&#x27;ve all seen the infomercial and thought right this will work for me if I had 50 people in the bathroom with me every morning!</li>
            <li> It made it smoother than it has every been (I have a lot of fine, wavy hair that dries easily).</li>
            <li> It works phenomenally &amp; I use it every day...by far the quickest most effective way I&#x27;ve found to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> buy it but make sure you can return with a full refund.  </li>
            <li> If you do not give me a FULL refund of every penny you debited from my now compromised account, I will be contacting the Better Business Bureau.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s $50 impressive, and if they ever go down to that price or lower</li>
            <li> The shipping and cost was good, the product itself didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> After I figured out that the barrel should be rotating in the direction that I was pulling it, then it worked fine.</li>
            <li> it gives my fine, wavy hair body and straightness.  </li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair that has a tendency to frizz.  </li>
            <li> I did not try any styling techniques such as flipping it out, but I will say I thought the product was pretty awesome!</li>
            <li> but it is fairly fine</li>
            <li> In fact, reading a lot of these reviews, I found that you are lucky if it lasts more than a year.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels great and this little appliance has made my life more manageable!    </li>
            <li> I have slightly fine yet wavy hair that had so many fly aways if I tried to blow dry it.  </li>
            <li> Although sometimes I felt like a little girl with the perfect curl at the end.</li>
            <li> The likelyhood of burning yourself is very real!!  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> I have wavy fine hair that wants to frizz and do its own thing.  </li>
            <li> I not only received the product wrapped very securely with a nice note, but a free gift as well!</li>
            <li> is SO easy and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> What a huge disapointment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge pain and has a mind of</li>
            <li> They are cheaply made and don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> and it made my hair shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li> overall i am happy with it and some of the reasons why are the time and money.  </li>
            <li> The initial results are GREAT.  </li>
            <li> Great explanations on how to use it for different hairstyles.  </li>
            <li> It also leaves the hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> and you are welcome to have it back to test or</li>
            <li> At any rate, it&#x27;s a fabulous product for us.  </li>
            <li> so it will have some sound.  </li>
            <li> overall its not that great,</li>
            <li> It just doesnt give you a smooth straightening.</li>
            <li> The InStyler makes your hair silky and smooth or wavy or curly - whatever your mood.</li>
            <li> plastic switch moves around in it&#x27;s groove when lightly touched - hence could be sturdier.  </li>
            <li> The rotating bristles helps to smooth while straighten your hair, it does all the work of combing for you.</li>
            <li> For the short period of time that it worked, it worked great.</li>
            <li> The bristles are cheap plastic and just knots your hair up.</li>
            <li> and I got a ton of compliments on how smooth my hair was.</li>
            <li> Instead of the smooth, polished look</li>
            <li> My primary concern is the durability of the design and the return policies.</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning to smooth out my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair does not look as smooth and silky without the serum.    </li>
            <li> It worked great prior to breaking</li>
            <li> and it felt cheap.</li>
            <li> I was none too happy when I had to buy another entire unit just because the bristles were pooped out.    </li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great product because you can straighten, curl, and style your hair all in one.</li>
            <li> are too great to justify the big price tag.  </li>
            <li> had a cheap $15 hair straightener from Walgreens before this</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the quality of my item was just as nice as advertised.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that my hair looks as great as it could be because I only used it once</li>
            <li> For the price, it should spin smoothly and somewhat quieter than it</li>
            <li> An item that breaks within months of purchase is cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I need to run the Instyler through my roots twice to make it smooth.</li>
            <li> So far I have not found it too helpful with curling hair, just seems good to straighten.   </li>
            <li> I think it is a really good product so far.</li>
            <li> made my hair looked shiney and healthy, but right after I washed it</li>
            <li> When I would try using it the top would come right off while it was spinning.  </li>
            <li> Negatives: It gets AWFULLY HOT!!  </li>
            <li> Really!!!</li>
            <li> Very worth the price.  </li>
            <li> My niece who has unbelieveably long and curly hair that always looks untamed has used this and has had far more impressive results.</li>
            <li> You can do pretty much everything the instyler does with a good straightener.  </li>
            <li> The process is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> and I was able to get it very straight by using this iron.</li>
            <li> but I am excited to see the results.</li>
            <li> It was much to hot even at the lowest setting for my hair and burned it more than straightened it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results so far.      </li>
            <li> and so I was really excited to get it.</li>
            <li> My daughter was excited to get this after seeing all the advertising.  </li>
            <li> I was SO Excited to get the In-Styler.  </li>
            <li> I received this as a gift for mother&#x27;s day and was excited to try it since i have frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, but it is super fine.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have super baby fine hair...</li>
            <li> Worth it!  </li>
            <li> and they said because it was bought on Amazon the original 1 yr warrantee is not valid.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product at first.</li>
            <li> Even if I was able to straighten it (as well as it possibly could, which isn&#x27;t really all that great)</li>
            <li> I went home that night, excited to see what the InStyler could do.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I were so excited seeing this on tv and decided to purchase two.  </li>
            <li> But for the one person using it, it&#x27;s not user friendly.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s all because that&#x27;s what it was originally made for, I believe.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE straight hair (coming from a person who&#x27;s had fuzzy hair for 64 years!)  </li>
            <li> It is unique</li>
            <li> In addition, its not user friendly.</li>
            <li> Maybe this tool was originally intended for use of DOING someone elses hair.</li>
            <li> I have one of the original</li>
            <li> super quick!    </li>
            <li> But I needed something as most hot irons were breaking and burning my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am excited beyond belief.  </li>
            <li> I got this and was so excited to get it.</li>
            <li> My wife had seen the infomercial for this item and was excited about what it offered.  </li>
            <li> but the iron is so easy to use and really works!!</li>
            <li> So the bottom line is that I get great looking hair with the most minimal effort, and that is worth the world to me since I&#x27;m a very low-maintenance person who still wants to look good.    </li>
            <li> Left my hair sleek and soft, the ends perfect!  </li>
            <li> I suppose this would be great to use after you&#x27;ve already straightened or blow dried your hair but want a more styled look.</li>
            <li> I have medium length straight hair &amp; the InStyler does a good fast job of providing curls where I need them.</li>
            <li> The Iron gets very hot so its important to put the protector on to protect your skin from burning.  </li>
            <li> The very first swipe I took with this device I knew I had made a huge mistake.</li>
            <li> I found the best price at Amazon and didn&#x27;t hesitate ordering from Amazon as I have had such good luck in the past with anything I ordered from them.  </li>
            <li> Works effectively &amp; v quickly (in seconds) in the place of having your hair in rollers (eeeeK! never!) and gets one ready for appointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does run through your hair very smoothly without any friction, but it doesnt get it as straight as it claims that it does, and THATS</li>
            <li> I have an original Instyler (Zebra print) which I bought from Canada and  love it so much.</li>
            <li> It works alright, but it isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d leave that for special</li>
            <li> If you have half a brain and want good hair, order this!</li>
            <li> so it took me 30 mins to give my self a cute full bodied straight do with the ends curled under.   </li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair and it perfectly straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> It does not work as good as a regular straightener.   </li>
            <li> the conair infiniti red colored straighter that worked good, but took away some of the volume</li>
            <li> You can do a curl under/flip and curl the ends of any lengths you have, but full blown curls or body in your bangs is not going to happen.  </li>
            <li> short now it isn&#x27;t as good.  </li>
            <li> It is much fuller and gives  it more body.  </li>
            <li> i would love to return this to the person i bought it from it does not work as much as i paid for it</li>
            <li> So I decided to spend the extra money and get one at Wal-Mart (since they have a good return policy and don&#x27;t charge people for returning Christmas gifts that were given to them ...</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so bouncy and full of life.</li>
            <li> - my advice - don&#x27;t take too much hair, start from the most underneath hair and work up.  </li>
            <li> So my sweet daughter purchased one for me as a surprise.</li>
            <li> this iron may work better on really really curly or course hair.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good enough product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really curl your hair with this any better than you can a regualar straightener.    </li>
            <li> I have thick and curly hair, and it makes my hair look awesome.</li>
            <li> I waited for the iron to cool and tried to fix it, but to no avail.  </li>
            <li> I can see how this would be a downfall for others with thinner hair as the intense heat does make the styling process a bit more cautionary.    </li>
            <li> and I am glad that I bought it because it really works</li>
            <li> I Wasn&#x27;t sure about paying so much for it</li>
            <li> The advertisements that are shown on tv seem to let people know it works better than what it really does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to do my whole head of hair in under an hour -- and with the Instyler, I&#x27;m done in 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it ever reached full power.</li>
            <li> So, obviously, this has not been a good experience for me.  </li>
            <li> I made sure she watched it, and after viewing that very easy-to-follow video, I let her try it out.</li>
            <li> My daughter used it herself on her hair and it didn&#x27;t look as good as with a regular straightner</li>
            <li> My hair looks healthy and has so much volume.  </li>
            <li> The hair looks more naturally straight.</li>
            <li> I was standing around at Target waiting for my RX to be filled and the Instyler was right there.  </li>
            <li> Dangerously hot, the shape of this makes it easy to be flimsy and fall.</li>
            <li> First off you can get burned easily with the product.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and consistently produces salon quality results.  </li>
            <li> I have also tried using it and then quickly taking each heated hair section and rolling onto jumbo velcro roller and letting it set and cool for 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Since the barrel rotates your able to curl and do other very cute hair styles.</li>
            <li> It did/does a nice job on my fine shoulder length hair, though admittedly I do not use it daily.</li>
            <li> It looks a little bit cheaply made with the silver-painted plastic, but it has worked great for me for 6 months now with no signs of quitting.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great addition to her other styling tools and gave it to her for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Now on full power it does get very hot</li>
            <li> It is true that it&#x27;s very hot</li>
            <li> Forgo this overpriced product and stick with a good quality flat iron.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy a good quality flat iron instead.</li>
            <li> It lays very flat and no matter what I just can&#x27;t get any good volume on my hair.  </li>
            <li> This Rotating Hot Iron works just fine.  </li>
            <li> my hair is pretty fine</li>
            <li> It is quick.</li>
            <li> I gave it the 2 stars because it straightens and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> Her hair stayed smooth and frizz free, if not stick straight, all day.  </li>
            <li> In styler because it straighten quick</li>
            <li> I ordered my Instyler and added the quick shipping to the order to expedite the delivery.</li>
            <li> I have finally found something I love to use with my hair and love my hair all day.</li>
            <li> Neither of us has had a problem with tangling, and the results have been quick and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> The main thing I love about it is that it works on all hair types.</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;The commercials are appealing but the actual product itself needs more work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have been using for two years, it styles my hair quickly and nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I straightened that section so quickly.</li>
            <li> I DO like the way my hair looks after I&#x27;ve used it &amp; it does stay stylish for a few days (or maybe it&#x27;s the good haircut).</li>
            <li> I tried it right away because I was so excited...</li>
            <li> If mine ever breaks I will GLADLY pay full price for a new one now</li>
            <li> Even on the lowest setting, this is a very hot product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> It is very hot and applies heat from both sides.  </li>
            <li> Gets very hot on lightest setting so even with heat spray, I wonder about damage.  </li>
            <li> It holds gorgeous curls ALL NIGHT LONG even in humid temperatures.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra and make sure you get an original!</li>
            <li> It works beautifully for my thick relatively fine shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I was happy with the results enough to contemplate purchasing my own.</li>
            <li> I said, surely you can send me a new one, since you are the supervisor, and its just 13 months since purchase.  </li>
            <li> The item came brand new in the box and thought it had done an ok job.</li>
            <li> It makes it fast and easy to get my hair done in minutes.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and fast styling.</li>
            <li> When I first starting using it - I loved it.  </li>
            <li> so if one breaks I can have perfect hair as long as the 2nd one lasts.</li>
            <li> so if one breaks I can have perfect hair as long as the 2nd one lasts.</li>
            <li> the spinning side of it is the part that gets hot!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s HOT!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s maybe not as hot as most, you have to go slower and more than once on smaller sections.</li>
            <li> B002L5THSI The Original InStyler Rotating Hot Iron Hair Straightener]]</li>
            <li> and I love the InStyler for natural curves and no frizz!</li>
            <li> I get the exact same results as the salon and so many compliments on how healthy and shiny my hair looks.</li>
            <li> Hellloooooo, it&#x27;s a HOT IRON people!</li>
            <li> it is HOT!</li>
            <li> While I have been interested in this product and was ecstatic that I might have found a bargain; service from this vendor is not efficient or customer friendly.</li>
            <li> I look like I actually have shiny healthy hair!</li>
            <li> B002L5THSI The Original InStyler Rotating Hot Iron Hair Straightener]]I had seen someone else use one at the gym where I work out and it seemed to do well for her.  </li>
            <li> the original i wish i had listened to my hair stylest and bought that one in the first place.</li>
            <li> Hi,  I am a professional triathlete with shoulder length, fine and curly hair!  </li>
            <li> UNLESS you have straight, fine hair</li>
            <li> I truly appreciate this website for allowing consumers to research what their purchasing before hand, its truly worth it to know exactly what your buying!</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure that the model I purchased from Amazon is an older model.  </li>
            <li> So, my husband went and bought an InStyler for me that night, and I showered and let my hair air dry most of the way, then used the InStyler, and my hair was AMAZINGLY full, not frizzy, pretty, tamed, and AWESOME in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see a huge difference</li>
            <li> My hair did not come out smooth and straight at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had curly hair but wanted smooth, straight styles.  </li>
            <li> If you can afford to pay around 100 bucks to replace it every two weeks, then it&#x27;s a great product, otherwise don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> makes my hair so smooth &amp; straight.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth the purchase</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I&#x27;m writing a product review, which I never do, because I want to make sure enough people buy this so that it&#x27;ll always be on the market for the times I need to replace the device.</li>
            <li> And now the compliments flow more frequently.</li>
            <li> I WOULD SAY IT&#x27;S WORTH $1.</li>
            <li> Puff it up where it needs it, straighten out some wild gray hair at my temples and add just enough curve at the bottom to be an attractive semi-pageboy style.</li>
            <li> The only drawback would be that I feel like I need to always uplug it because it always feels slightly warm if I leave it plugged.</li>
            <li> I guess that makes it worth having.</li>
            <li> I had to figure out how to use it properly,but since then I have had nothing but success with it.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t place too much hair in the barrel, and don&#x27;t go too fast, it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> but......as far as curling my hair goes I absoluetly LOVE it</li>
            <li> I think that its worth what you pay for it because it can both straighten or curl your hair in one easy-to-use tool.</li>
            <li> Not only has this saved my money and time but it has effectively changed my life.    </li>
            <li> I regrettably ordered the in styler off the internet and while I like my curling iron, it is by no means worth the money or the headache the company has caused for me.  </li>
            <li> Instead I order the old revo styler spinner brush that had work way better for me, than this thing.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and using the instyler takes 15 minutes at the most once it&#x27;s heated up.  </li>
            <li> My hair looked unpolished, frizzy, and, to be quite honest, lion mane like which is the opposite goal of what straightening your hair is supposed to achieve.  </li>
            <li> Also make sure NOTHING is near the InStyler while it is heating up.  </li>
            <li> It is worth buying if you want to manage your hair.</li>
            <li> I am 62 years old and all my friends ask me \\&quot;what kind of shampoo I use\\&quot; because my hair really shine, so I tell them about the iron.</li>
            <li> Big barrel curling irons do give it some nice body and</li>
            <li> get a golden plated chi</li>
            <li> Then, I will get on every website and every blog on every search engine I possibly can and post this email to make sure that no other innocent consumers get ripped off by your company!     </li>
            <li> I even had my friend who is a professional hair stylist watch me to make sure I was doing it right.  </li>
            <li> this product is easy enough to use for the most part but it&#x27;s not as awesome as the tv commercials show it to be; it leaves my hair pretty much the same as when i use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> It will work fine if the hair is permed or pressed straight first, but of course applying triple heat defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> You have to figure out how the hold it in order to get your hair to curl the way you want it to but other than it has been good.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all it&#x27;s good for really, other than damaging my already somewhat damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expected this curling/straightening iron to be able to do when I bought it over a year ago, but it does keep my bangs looking perfect in seconds.  </li>
            <li> and now I can do it easily, fast and friendly.</li>
            <li> OTHER WISE PRODUCT WORKS</li>
            <li> Yes the styler will get hot, it will be very hot.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t know if it would work just as good on other types of hair</li>
            <li> They were on the right path with this one...</li>
            <li> It worked for me on my right side (I&#x27;m right handed)</li>
            <li> I was right</li>
            <li> YEAH right...</li>
            <li> ELSE&#x27;S hair, which sounds right.</li>
            <li> I am right handed, so this was tricky.</li>
            <li> It was much fatter and a lot of plastic and it made a pop sound on the first try an didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I am not good at straightening my hair, but with the Instyler, I can do it and it comes out looking smooth and great.</li>
            <li> Wow, those commercials are pretty convincing, huh.</li>
            <li> It gives your hair the most beauiful wavy curls and it curls your head sooo fast once you get the hang of it unlike my normal curling iron.</li>
            <li> I dont even have to spray my hair first my hair totally holds a nice curl.</li>
            <li> In less than 10 minutes, my hair is smooth, straight, styled, shiny and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> A full refund is the only redeeming value you have at this point.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a week and finally for the first time have liked my hair.  </li>
            <li> OK, so I have a 13 year old, and this is her first time using a hair styler.</li>
            <li> It is simple to use with very easy instructions.</li>
            <li> High indicated by the number of bars that light up under the transparent switch -</li>
            <li> I found it extremely easy to to get beautiful results in less time than a hair dryer and/or regular curling iron!!!  </li>
            <li> i would rather blow dry and smooth with my Chi, it is much better results that way.</li>
            <li> The Remington wet iron i own works far better than this at straightening hair and reducing frizz.  </li>
            <li> It was worth the money to have one whole year of hair bliss!  </li>
            <li> oh and i am very care full but still burned my self</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blonde with very fine hair.      </li>
            <li> It gets very hot, drys out your hair, it would take hours to style even shoulder length hair, and has a large warning label on the electrical cord to keep away from your eyes.</li>
            <li> Its pure Genius!</li>
            <li> so I exchanged it and the next one I got (the one I (currently own)worked great and</li>
            <li> So my hair looks really nice and shiny and straight on the outside</li>
            <li> Only time I can honestly say my hair is straight from the roots to the ends is when I&#x27;ve just gotten a relaxer...</li>
            <li> My hair is long, fine, but very shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I will say though, that my $80 straightener does just as good a job and in a lot less time.</li>
            <li> If this one breaks, I will probably order directly from the manufacturer&#x27;s website to make sure I get the real thing.</li>
            <li> If they made the instyler without the brush thing, It would be great for african american hair.</li>
            <li> It really does shine more and has a soft polished feel.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair natural the night before and use my InStyler on dry hair in the morning for best results for me..and it takes ONLY about 10-15 minutes to get my hair looking great too....</li>
            <li> When you release the barrel, your hair is VERY hot and tends to hang straight.    </li>
            <li> No more spending an hour or more using my old iron with my hands cramped trying to get my hair to look good.</li>
            <li> No split ends and very straight and shinny...</li>
            <li> I am still working on learning how to curl, and it&#x27;s not as easy as a regular curling iron, but once you get the hang of it is nice to have one tool for multiple uses.  </li>
            <li> The product is good - it does take a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, but it is also easy to burn yourself so be careful.</li>
            <li> In conclusion, I want a FULL refund, even the seven dollars I paid to jump to the head of the shipping line because your product is so highly in demand.      </li>
            <li> I like the InStyler, but I do wish that the rotator would rotate in both directions and that there was another setting for the heat to not be so hot.</li>
            <li> I was able to straighten my hair like a pro in about 5 minutes with the Instyler, even the back!</li>
            <li> What I like about the instyler rotating hot iron hair straightner, is the fact that it does its job.  </li>
            <li> I tried it the first day I received it</li>
            <li> This is my first can&#x27;t-live-without hair appliance ever.</li>
            <li> ok so...ive been going back and forth about getting this item....</li>
            <li> most instylers that i researched, only get as hot as 135.  </li>
            <li> u need something really hot.  </li>
            <li> Send it back to the seller and on top of that</li>
            <li> The first one would NOT turn off from the switch on the unit.</li>
            <li> The only way to be sure it cools is to unplug it from the wall.</li>
            <li> so it is hot</li>
            <li> The first one I bought at target did nothing for my hair</li>
            <li> I bought this device at the local BJ&#x27;s and have fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li> It will no longer rotate but it still turns on and gets hot.  </li>
            <li> I just used my InStyler for the first time</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  </li>
            <li> With my hair texture, I have to seperate and pin back my hair into 10 - 12 sections on the top and straighten with a hair dryer on the bottom.  </li>
            <li> I just bought the Instyler and have only used it a couple of times, but I already love it.  </li>
            <li> You do have to section your hair, but you can use bigger sections than I thought you would be able to.</li>
            <li> I am usually skeptical of any infomercial products but this one is great!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li> Mine got a tad bit crispy the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> all curling/straightening irons, it gets hot</li>
            <li> This tool is just too hot, even at the lowest setting, for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Especially for a $100 investment, it should be better quality.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend has thick curly hair(Italian), and she has nothing but great things to say about it.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering from amazon, I ordered my Instyler on 1/30 and received it 2/3.</li>
            <li> Used this the first time tonight-wow</li>
            <li> I did use TIGI Catwalk Prep first.</li>
            <li> Thanks Guys for saving me $190!    </li>
            <li> ok, so I called Tre Milano who charged my card the same day</li>
            <li> I had to file a chargeback against them and refuse the item when it arrived, rather than having them just stop the shipment in the first place.  </li>
            <li> her self esteem is on the highest level and at the same time she feels sexy (which works in my favor)  </li>
            <li> It straightens but it creates more frizz than my ISO which only cost me $40.</li>
            <li> THOUGH: the rod gets REALLY HOT</li>
            <li> My daughter, who has course, very curly hair, had success with the InStyler too, with my Aveda serum.  </li>
            <li> what&#x27;s up with people complaining how hot this gets?  </li>
            <li> First off, it takes FOREVER and a day to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> Used this hot iron just once.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t take too much hair!  </li>
            <li> It does get really hot</li>
            <li> then it started to rotate but it wouldn&#x27;t get hot.  </li>
            <li> and I love that I only need one hair appliance now.</li>
            <li> I love it, but this time I purchased the instyler for my mom as a xmas present.</li>
            <li> I think the product is exactly what they advertise</li>
            <li> First let me say i do like it,</li>
            <li> The first InStyler I bought was defective.</li>
            <li> Remember, my first InStyler died.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Instyler for 2 years now, and I absolutely adore it!  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested in the InStyler for its styling or curling abilities- look on.</li>
            <li> The first, my husband got me for Christmas 2 years ago</li>
            <li> - The InStyler get EXTREMELY hot.  </li>
            <li> My first is still running like a champ but</li>
            <li> However, the first one I had stopped working after one year.  </li>
            <li> Heats up fast!</li>
            <li> I was ready to give up straightening my hair until I was told about this product!</li>
            <li> It DOES get hot</li>
            <li> i received this product and tried it for the first time...</li>
            <li> SO pretty.  </li>
            <li> The advertisements indicate that you can use it for many different stylings, untrue.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I have wanted this product since it first came out</li>
            <li> Takes out the frizzies, waves and leaves pretty, silky hair.</li>
            <li> I used it today for the first time</li>
            <li> Better results than I&#x27;ve ever gotten in my entire life.</li>
            <li> Will continue to look for something similar that doesn&#x27;t have so many mechanical issues.</li>
            <li> The first one I opened didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping my 2 extra Instyler irons so that I&#x27;ll be able to use it forever.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to even attempt as the thought of bumping that hot barrel into my hand or head was too much!</li>
            <li> Really, it does!</li>
            <li> i absolutely swear by this product!</li>
            <li> anytime my sister and i meet up, the first thing she says is : \\&quot;Bring the InStyler!\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I thought since it was my first time using it</li>
            <li> She said she couldn&#x27;t figure out why it wasn&#x27;t working because I was doing everything the exact way I wassupposed to.</li>
            <li> The CHI straighteners last years and do a phenomenal job.  </li>
            <li> It does get relatively hot.</li>
            <li> I know you have to section off your hair as with any hot tool</li>
            <li> Once it does finally kick the bucket, I&#x27;m for sure going to get another one.</li>
            <li> First, it started turning itself off a minute or two after being turned on, then the barrel would no longer rotate.    </li>
            <li> My hair is completely straight and shiny in one swipe!</li>
            <li> It delivers exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great piece of equipment if you want to slowly go bald.</li>
            <li> and I can tell I need a bit of practice with it for me to get my hair to look exactly as I would like it to.</li>
            <li> At first, I had no idea what to do with it</li>
            <li> I really did get compliments on my hair after using it!     </li>
            <li> For users thinking about it, make sure you definitely READ instructions on how to use and take care of it.</li>
            <li> I went to pick it up but forgot it was hot.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this Hot Iron hair styler.</li>
            <li> I had the defective one replaced at the store, and am satisfied with the second one.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work that well, and it breaks within the first couple months of using it.  </li>
            <li> It really does the job!</li>
            <li> have left my hair looking shiney and healthy and not looking over done.</li>
            <li> The brush actually seemed to make the hair even more frizzy.  </li>
            <li> but if you make sure the barrel turns where your hair cuticles goes it will close any open cuticles as it brushes through thus</li>
            <li> Within 15 minute my hair was completely straight again!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says at the medium heat cycle.  </li>
            <li> I asked if I could try it and from the first use</li>
            <li> I purchased the Instyler when they first came out.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t turn on for more than five seconds, and I tried it in several different outlets just to be sure.</li>
            <li> That was the first thing to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i loved it, but it really dried my hair out</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and blond, and left to its own devices will be flat with a bit of scraggly wave and frizz.  </li>
            <li> I am always willing to try something new specially if it will make my life easier however this was just not that type of product.  </li>
            <li> I just hold it how it&#x27;s comfortable and deal with the fly-aways at the end with hairspray or a quick sweep with a regular straightener.    </li>
            <li> Perhaps that&#x27;s because we both have tried many, many different types of curling irons, flat irons, etc.</li>
            <li> The only positive is that he purchased it from amazon, and we were able to return it.</li>
            <li> It straightens with just one pass through my hair and leaves my hair straight smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li> and I have used MANY products to straighten my hair, like blowing it out with a hair dryer, flat irons, hot combs</li>
            <li> When I use it on other people&#x27;s hair, their hair looks beautiful - just like it does on the models in the commercial.  </li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this and finally banish my hot rollers.</li>
            <li> Now, with the Instyler, I can achive soft, smooth, large curls with just one tool.  </li>
            <li> Well, if I blow-dry my hair, I can often do a good enough job to use my usual straight-iron as a touch up - saving on damage and leaving in more bounce.</li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t read the many reviews that encouraged people to be patient and DO NOT expect this to work like your flat iron, I would have returned it immediately.  </li>
            <li> I have a supply of flat irons and curling irons that I never touch anymore because this is better than any of them.  </li>
            <li> I liked the way it worked, I did not burn myself like some of the other reviewers</li>
            <li> I have a bed head flat iron and love it</li>
            <li> It is 1,000 times better than a flat iron - because it gives me body as well as making it straighter.  </li>
            <li> If you buy this production just keep in mind that if you aren&#x27;t skilled in straightening your hair with a flat iron, you are going to have to practice a bit with it before you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> Better than a flat iron it curls or straightens without leaving marks or kinks.</li>
            <li> My blow dryer and flat iron work much better.</li>
            <li> Spend your money on one of the better flat irons that have the ability to curl.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal CHI user for years, but I decided to give this new \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; straightener a try.  </li>
            <li> I am just glad that I received this as a gift because I would be very upset if I had actually purchased it myself.</li>
            <li> I could go on and on about how much I LOVE my straight hair, but the Instyler made it possible.</li>
            <li> I can see how it may not work as well on thick, very curly hair, but on my hair type it works great.</li>
            <li> see if i liked it any better than the conventional flat irons.</li>
            <li> It did straighten my hair very fast, reduced frizz, and I learned to manuver it to create enough body and curl to make my hair look more decent than it has for a while.  </li>
            <li> I did the best I could to get the nut screwed back on, but it came loose the next time I used it.  </li>
            <li> But I love it now and am so glad I finally let loose of my wallet to purchase the Instyler.  </li>
            <li> I mean could they not coat the cord and make it more safe to use and heat resistent??</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before and I was almost positive</li>
            <li> Bottom line, use common sense and you should get amazing results!  </li>
            <li> for us blk folks, if we want our hair straight, u have to use something really hot.  </li>
            <li> and this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that absolutely straightens without flattening.</li>
            <li> Anyway, fast forward 5 months, I touched the hot barrel of the iron and dropped the instyler on the carpet.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I have straight silky hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance because my daughter and I both use it to straighten our long hair (about 6 inches below shoulders).</li>
            <li> and it didnt really get hot</li>
            <li> It is also ineffective at straightening the first few inches from the scalp (unless you don&#x27;t mind touching 375 degree metal to your skin)which is my curliest area!  </li>
            <li> My stylist actually said that she is proud when I walk in the salon because my hair is a reflection of her cutting and coloring skills, and the Instyler makes my hair look gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> First, the rotating iron doesn&#x27;t do much .</li>
            <li> I had to send mine back as the first one broke in shipping, but my replacement was fine.    </li>
            <li> I called for a refund number and the nice salesman offered me a cool tip attachment for the iron, along with a special conditioning treatment to remedy the limp hair problem, but a week later I called and customer service had not mailed it or had no record of it.  </li>
            <li> The barrel is super hot and I have had several burns on my forehead and ears but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Also, just so your aware, I made these phone calls from my office phone, which has a handy little feature called the RECORD button.  </li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to look good in less time than it would normally take you to get dressed.</li>
            <li> Because I spent what I thought was a good amount of money on this product, I tried it several times, just trying different things to see if I could get better results and nothing worked.    </li>
            <li> It works just as well on \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; hair and that is a major plus in combing hair that is sometimes not comb friendly.</li>
            <li> It was quick and easy, and now my hair is smooth and swingy - even the bangs and hard to straighten hairline.</li>
            <li> My hair is now crunchy dry, tons of split ends (which I never had in my life), it is super tangled and when you brush it out to take out the tangles (even softly) broke hairs off, and causes even more split ends.  </li>
            <li> Never have we been able to let our hair dry and then iron it to controlled.  </li>
            <li> I really liked how the Instyler made my hair look, however I had the produce LESS than two weeks before it broke.  </li>
            <li> To keep my hair healthy, I will probably always wash at night, let it air dry, and then straighten it in the morning.    </li>
            <li> My hair has more body, the unit doesn&#x27;t make my hair dry.</li>
            <li> and it does leave your hair super soft.  </li>
            <li> I have wanted one of these for a long time &amp; although the seller was great the product is so-so doesn&#x27;t work as I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money, does exactly what it claims to do, I completely recommend getting and InStyler.</li>
            <li> I have long, very fine hair which lets put it this way, my older sister got the perfectly straight hair</li>
            <li> If you do purchase it, make certain you keep every thing in the box in tact and record your conversations when you call or confirm it in writing.  </li>
            <li> It gets very, very hot like professional grade equipment.</li>
            <li> This made my hair stick straight, super soft and it stayed for 3 days (until I had to wash it).  </li>
            <li> The return was seamless and quick and the prompt refund was appreciated.</li>
            <li> Appears not to be made for fine hair (although the commercial I saw said it was) as it doesn&#x27;t seem to grasp and hold it well unless you have a put a large amount of hair in it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and dry, and its normal state is frizzy.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair has a fine to normal texture with a slight wave with no frizz but tangles easy.</li>
            <li> I would pair it up with a normal flat iron to make sure all that was missed with the InStyler.</li>
            <li> I can do super straight, soft and wavy  or straight with volume.  </li>
            <li> Even when my hair gets a little moist from rain, it still holds its own without frizzing up.  </li>
            <li> It didnt make my hair look sleek, and it kind of made it stick out a little bit.   </li>
            <li> The best it did was take the big waves out but still left my hair a frizzy puffball mess.      </li>
            <li> She makes my hair look fantastic, but agrees that it is too much heat for my hair to use daily.  </li>
            <li> After another month, it finally tore out a huge chunk of my hair and then the end spun off.  </li>
            <li> Using this instead of a traditional straightener/hair iron you can see a huge difference in body.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I tried it, and was very unimpressed.  </li>
            <li> The in-styler works very well.</li>
            <li> and it is the real thing from the AS SEEN ON TV programming shows.  </li>
            <li> I really like it and have already recommended it.  </li>
            <li> I will admit to having hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well, but this was a joke.</li>
            <li> The Instyler has made doing my hair much easier.</li>
            <li> It does not heat up as fast as others.   </li>
            <li> and she likes it straight.  </li>
            <li> The InStyler heats up fast and takes no time at all on her hair.  </li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> an accomplished hair styler and</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it as I have to all my friends and coworkers!</li>
            <li> I even used a heat protection spray and it didn&#x27;t help much.  </li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing with my hair...straighten or curl.  </li>
            <li> and it is straight.  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend the product for curly or straight hair.</li>
            <li> She found that it made her hair frizzy rather than straight.  </li>
            <li> She is much happier.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling if your hair is course, or if it is very curly it might not work as well.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is very curly, It may take longer, or you may have to section the bottom part of your hair as well.</li>
            <li> and it really smooths it out.  </li>
            <li> I used it once, and I basically had to continually run this product over strands of my hair until it got the slightest bit of straight.   </li>
            <li> This hair straightener does not do anything that a much cheaper, store bought hair straightener can&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li> This iron is very akward to handle</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair and lots of it</li>
            <li> This product really does straighten the hair.  </li>
            <li> I am not happy with the performance of this item nor am I happy the the ease of trying to exchange this item at Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I could never get my hair to lay straight.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> My hair remained poofy after much labor.  </li>
            <li> We both have very frizzy, very curly hair and find that this tool does the trick.  </li>
            <li> The rotating head on mine works rather intermitently and the whole unit sometimes shuts is self off.  </li>
            <li> This really does work.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so much that it bothers me</li>
            <li> For a straight haired gal whose hair sticks out at all angles, I have found the instyler to turn my locks under neatly.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this produce to others who have chin length straight hair like mine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shiny, straight and has body.  </li>
            <li> Almost all the complaints about the Instyler say that its cheaply made and does have technical problems.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very humid.  </li>
            <li> Was a gift and the person really likes it.  </li>
            <li> it did make alot of noise-but that didnt really bother me..</li>
            <li> I guess-- Is that it doesn&#x27;t really get the roots.  </li>
            <li> I cant believe some people gave this 5 stars I would really like to see their hair (before &amp; after).</li>
            <li> I had to spend so much time for one curl</li>
            <li> Also I felt that the metal was very damaging to the hair.</li>
            <li> It is much lighter than you think, the casing being plastic &amp; rod aluminium?&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rod heats up rapidly, so a real time saver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t heat up like it promised to do fast.</li>
            <li> It flipped hair up okay, but not like expected.</li>
            <li> I would really recomment this product.</li>
            <li> I am very please with the In Styler.  </li>
            <li> If it hadn&#x27;t cost me so much I would&#x27;ve thrown it out.</li>
            <li> Very flimsey.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not stick straight.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very kinky and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> You really stand by your word.</li>
            <li> Pros - does straighten very well.   </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t curl my hair very well, but that&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I really wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> It fried my hair and didn&#x27;t make my hair straight at all.</li>
            <li> Not quite as fast, but it still does.</li>
            <li> It gets your hair straight.  </li>
            <li> The REMINGTON Straightener keeps my hair just as straight as a board all day.</li>
            <li> It does not burn or singe my hair; I&#x27;d categorize this as gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product to every woman.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it really works so well.</li>
            <li> My Instyler arrived before estamatied arrival date plus It straightend my VERY kinky curly ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> Could never get my hair really straight the way I wanted</li>
            <li> it just feels much sturdier in your hands</li>
            <li> It did not have instyler packaging, it was much louder than the one I had used before</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t pull it thru your hair too fast and you cant stuff too much of your hair in at once.  </li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> it don&#x27;t really do to well with that.</li>
            <li> I will just make your hair very puffy</li>
            <li> OF COURSE COMMUNICATE VERY WELL BEFORE SELL</li>
            <li> WE HAVE BEEN VERY BLESSED UNTIL NOW.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy-to-use.</li>
            <li> I bought this item mostly to straight my hair.</li>
            <li> When the light finally stopped flashing, I used it</li>
            <li> VERY WELL</li>
            <li> hair had a much lighter body to it even though I use a lot of oils</li>
            <li> a couple times before it&#x27;s really straight.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is one of the products that really lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li> etc.--a real</li>
            <li> They set up the return, but when they gave me the shipping info, they said I was responsible for paying the return shipping for the defective product.  </li>
            <li> I was really nervous that she would burn herself, but to my surprise she didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and my hair still wasn&#x27;t as straight as it was with one pass through with my CHI straightener.  </li>
            <li> I had that broke that started this whole fiasco</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier just using this for a touch up versus using it to do your hair from the beginning.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item to anyone who toggles between curling and straightenign their hair!</li>
            <li> I for one have very curly spiral permed hair.</li>
            <li> Tried it out and absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair that is very curly.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to straighten their hair without damaging it and who doesn&#x27;t want to spend time or money in salon to have someone else straighten your hair.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t know if I want to spend that much money to buy another one.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s already on its way to being straight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The hair gets really straight</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get up the nerve to spend this much money on a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really care because I don&#x27;t use that type of comb.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend that you pay and get a orginal, my daughter got the real one</li>
            <li> It goes much faster than a curling iron and it keeps my hair straightened like I want it yet gives it some body.  </li>
            <li> She wants to buy a couple of them for her shop.</li>
            <li> The brush-part of the instyler didn&#x27;t polish it, separate it, or do anything, really.</li>
            <li> - say really think and really curly.</li>
            <li> I have battled the curls my whole life.  </li>
            <li> It has attracted a lot of attention in the gym lockerroom from both curlyheads and straight haired women.  </li>
            <li> It heats up extremely fast.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone with frizzy or unruly hair!  </li>
            <li> For straight hair i would recommend the brand Remington.</li>
            <li> Mine has wilted a bit and the brissels have bent and it doesnt really brush very well anymore.</li>
            <li> but recently its started to sound like it gets off track.</li>
            <li> It works great, I have longer, thick and naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that I really liked the instyler for was my bangs but my biggest issue is that the rolling part of the brush burned my forehead and it burned it in the same place twice.</li>
            <li> He exchanged my instyler for another new one without any problem and of course it was very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t work at all like the other, and seemed very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> ONCE AGAIN DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> Basically I think I will be able to straighten my hair with the iron in probably a half hour to forty minutes if I blow it out first.</li>
            <li> Also, if you are used to clamping onto your hair with a flat iron you will most likely burn yourself with the instyler because it is very easy to try and grab both sides as you normally would a flat iron, and</li>
            <li> I only read the &#x27;quick start&#x27; portion of the included instructions and had my hair straight in less than 20 minutes ... which is amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this idem brand new for my girlfriend for her birthday, she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> It gets extremely hot, but InStyler has created this shield for all new InStylers that you just snap onto the rotating iron that reduces the risk of burning yourself.  </li>
            <li> I think what I miss the most is something cool at the tip I can hold onto rather than only the large wide handle.  </li>
            <li> I do not have coarse hair, and I have only used it on clean, product free hair.     </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rate it highly because the infomercials feature an African American woman with kinkier hair than mine and show it effectively smoothing her hair without mention of pre-straightening or chemicals.</li>
            <li> but sadly it just isn&#x27;t good!  </li>
            <li> It smooths out my hair better than any other straightner I&#x27;ve tried before.  </li>
            <li> I wish, like many other reviewers, that it could rotate in both directions, as I did have some hair ripped out when trying to pull through counter to the roll.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product and finally bought it a couple weeks ago</li>
            <li> If there was a way to make the barrel roll the other way, that would have been so much better.</li>
            <li> This product works better on Caucasian hair (other finer hair types as well).</li>
            <li> I so love the Instyler, especially since I was a major skeptic even when I asked for it.</li>
            <li> Went back to my original curling iron and am looking to sell my Instyler.</li>
            <li> This does make some noise while being used which surprised me, although I could live with the noise if this really was better quality and actually worked!</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised to see that this one has a Low setting, and makes my hair look very full.</li>
            <li> The product does get very hot you can get burnt the setup could be a little better for the price, as far as the polishing and shining  </li>
            <li> I have long hair on the fine side.</li>
            <li> This hair styler does not work well on long fine hair when trying to put curl into it.  </li>
            <li> Hair didn&#x27;t last nice for long.       </li>
            <li> My favorite thing to do with the InStyler is to straight it down and then turn/roll the InStyler in towards me at the bottom</li>
            <li> this ever quite straighened my hair as well as a traditional flat iron, so I cannot imagine how it could work magic on very curly, course hair!</li>
            <li> Specially because it rolls only one way</li>
            <li> Actually it was a special where I got both for $99</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use less hair, and then more hair, but it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is totally smooth, which is something that it is not naturally.</li>
            <li> Damp to dry is fine</li>
            <li> First one is that the motor is loud.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a mom), it just looks average like most women.</li>
            <li> and it was far more trouble than it was worth.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Instyler Rotating Hot Iron Hair Straightener for my 18 year old grand-daughter.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair - very curly!  </li>
            <li> I guess the HOT metal barrel (like the curling irons of old) is what makes this device curl as well as it does.</li>
            <li> I had to use my old hair straightener on my hair first and then go over it with the instyler.</li>
            <li> EXTERIOR IS SO FULL OF DAMAGES, ROTATING PART DOESN&#x27;T EVEN ROTATE, SO MUCH DIFFERENT KINDS OF HAIR IN THE BRUSH PART</li>
            <li> Plus it makes a pretty loud noise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud, too hot and takes forever to straighten/curl my hair.</li>
            <li> It also creates a nice loose wave that doesn&#x27;t bunch up like with a standard curling iron.</li>
            <li> But after giving it the benefit of the doubt and watching some videos, I&#x27;ve gotten a technique down that I love.</li>
            <li> I love it and now have to hunt down another one as the company I got it from no longer carries it...  </li>
            <li> I generally blow dry my curly, course hair with a straightening brush and then use a ceramic flat iron to smooth and add shine... if you are trying to get to your roots, this takes much more time to do with the Instyler and</li>
            <li> and she looks like she got a new hair cut; she loves it!</li>
            <li> The InStyler is a tool I can&#x27;t live without!  </li>
            <li> Boy, if they could only see it all frizzed up and dull looking, LOL.  </li>
            <li> Instyler heats up very quickly, but start off on a lower setting than usual because it is VERY hot</li>
            <li> I had to send one of mine back because it wouldnt rotate properly but the other works great</li>
            <li> I love my flat iron, but don&#x27;t like the way it left my hair totally straight.</li>
            <li> Its soooooo amazing to have ONE hair product instead of using a dryer (hard to do when your hair is fine and long</li>
            <li> I have never been able to fix my hair so quickly until now using the new InStyler Rotating Hot Iron Hair Straightener and my daughter&#x27;s head which is thick and medium lenght was finished in 7 mins no less.  </li>
            <li> but I wanted it mainly to use traveling in Europe.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not designed for super short hair.</li>
            <li> The grip is also too big for my short fingers to handle safely...</li>
            <li> I sent it back, got my refund quickly and just ended up going to Bed, Bath, and Beyond to get one.</li>
            <li> I love the way it gives body, especially when you \\&quot;back curl\\&quot; for crown area for height.  </li>
            <li> The brush has almost no bristles and they are super short, so nothing grabbed.</li>
            <li> however, the vendor replaced the unit quickly and the 2nd unit has had no problems to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t bother with the extra cost for quick delivery -</li>
            <li> The barrel stopped rotating, which was the main functioning part that caused the volume of my style.  </li>
            <li> The good thing about it was the fact that it only took a few days to arrive.</li>
            <li> But the InStyler made everything super simple.    </li>
            <li> It took a few times for me to get used to the whirling sound of the styler, but the results are well worth it.</li>
            <li> I waited several months and decided that I like it so much that it was worth getting again.  </li>
            <li> I think this might be an older model that may have been used before, or it is just a faulty product.</li>
            <li> And then, YOU can contact the companies that you gave my personal information to, and YOU can make sure that they do NOT call or email me again and that my personal information is destroyed.    </li>
            <li> i mainly bought it so i could give my hair volume without teasing it</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the on/off switch wears out too quickly.</li>
            <li> If I knew of a similar product that was made better I would definitely buy it.</li>
            <li> I finally forked it over when I got my most recent hair cut.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the best advice I can give you is to re-sell it here on Amazon because it has been opened and used I cannot take it back.</li>
            <li> The smaller 3/4 inch works MUCH better than the bigger 1-1/4 inch.</li>
            <li> Making curls will take a little getting used to, but I am pleased with the soft waves in my first attempt.</li>
            <li> I set it then on high and the light flashed for very long time (like 15 minutes) before to stop.</li>
            <li> Also, I find it hard to make sure I am putting in on the section with the barrel spinning the right direction.</li>
            <li> Be careful it is very hot and can easily burn you; especially when you are working with your hair underneath.</li>
            <li> Please pay attention to all the negative reviews and save yourself the money and protect your skin by using a better straightening iron!</li>
            <li> If you add up 40 minutes at least 3 times a week think about how many hours and days of my life this thing is saving me!</li>
            <li> Let me say again that the barrel gets VERY HOT - not only can it burn fingers, hands, but scalp and skin around the face if you get it too close.  </li>
            <li> I can get a fresh look to my ends, but nothing more than any other flat iron does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some people complaining about not being able to use both hands while styling because there&#x27;s not a cool place to hold on the end.  </li>
            <li> My first complaint is that the rotation of the heating cylinder is only good if it rotates away from the hair follicle.</li>
            <li> when i called and told them they were of no help...said you had to be careful and all of their instyler rotating irons were super hot</li>
            <li> I set it on HIGH and use it..</li>
            <li> i highly recommend it to all women</li>
            <li> I had to use it on the high setting or it would not straighten my hair and on hi my hair singed a bit.</li>
            <li> to the high heat element, I do/would not use this often and do so SPARINGLY.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The price is to high for what it does.  </li>
            <li> I think Amazon should highly consider removing Safari Store from their site since they do not want to attempt to help in resolving issues.  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t have to use it on high</li>
            <li> I purchased my sophomore year of high school and just broke when I was 24.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;d paid what I think is the outrageously high price on the manufacturer&#x27;s web site, I&#x27;d be furious.</li>
            <li> She uses her Instyler more than her regular flat iron.</li>
            <li> You get much better resuls with a simple flat iron or a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> We were using a regular ceramic hot iron and our hair was becoming so dry.  </li>
            <li> I have looked at reviews on this Chi flat iron, which can be found around the same price, and read much better customer reviews.</li>
            <li> and I found myself having to take multiple breaks to let my arm rest; therefore, making the process take longer, not cutting my styling time in half like the product claims to be able to do.  </li>
            <li> The instyler brand is a marketing genius &amp; it looks like there are many fake positive postings that sound like an infomercial.</li>
            <li> I can also get volume on the top of my head as well with little effort.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a little it seems more like a joke.</li>
            <li> Now the barrel was just hanging and red hot!  </li>
            <li> This product is not worth the $$$ for girls with fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> : You can buy a good curling iron AND a good flat iron for the price of this ONE equally damaging, awkward, not-so-versatile, breakable thing.</li>
            <li> It also takes FOREVER for the highest setting to turn a solid glowing red, and it doesn&#x27;t do much to my ton of fine hair.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to straighten the roots with this kind of appliance...</li>
            <li> I tried it on my hair (thick medium length) and it works AMAZING.</li>
            <li> The motor that people complain about really isn&#x27;t that loud at all.  </li>
            <li> When you take the item and put it near your hair, you are really close to your body.  </li>
            <li> No frizz and not limp straight like using a flatiron.  </li>
            <li> and it did not cost near as much as this one.</li>
            <li> To me it&#x27;s worth investing in the InStyler to get the same results in a fraction of the time.    </li>
            <li> For the price I would recommend avoiding it, buying a normal straightner and a separate curler for any styles you might want to achieve.</li>
            <li> Well, normally I look like I have a lions mane of hair that&#x27;s a nightmare</li>
            <li> It took a long time to heat up, and would cool off while I used it.  </li>
            <li> Use your $80 towards a hair straightener that actually works and is worth $80.</li>
            <li> and they said it&#x27;s a treatment and use it a few more time, if i wanted treatment i would go to a salon</li>
            <li> I have always received compliments on my hair, usually only after it has been freshly washed.  </li>
            <li> Normally i used the Helen of Troy straightener.  </li>
            <li> So I give the InStyler 5 stars, since I have had lasting success with differing hair types.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s most upsetting is not the $120 wasted, but the time it will take to regrow my destroyed hair from this product.  </li>
            <li> Using this tool I can flip my somewhat long hair and it stays full all day.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time last night, and it didn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> It simply takes too long and the results are just OK.</li>
            <li> Now I am really too old to wear longer straight hair, where was this product when I was young?  </li>
            <li> I washed my hair with shampoo and conditioner and then blow-dried as I normally would.</li>
            <li> like I normally do when straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> I immediately plugged in my \\&quot;old faithful\\&quot; and I am now convinced that more expensive is not always better.</li>
            <li> but with practice you&#x27;ll be able to figure out how to keep your hands, neck, and scalp from getting a few burns.</li>
            <li> my hair didn&#x27;t have the same polished look, it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I could have lived with the little quirks and would have been happy to continue using the Instyler if it hadn&#x27;t stopped working less than thirty days after I received it</li>
            <li> Get a flat iron will be better off!now a days flat iron will curl and put volume in your hair!</li>
            <li> After trying it on both dry and wet hair she decided that her blow dryer, curling irons and hot rollers worked way better than this product.</li>
            <li> but as it turns out, you have to hold the roller really close to your scalp for a long period of time and spray this recommended spray (that the company also sells) onto your hair in order to have it work right.</li>
            <li> I brushed the hairspray out of my hair and went right to fixing my hair.  </li>
            <li> I feel such guilt for not purchasing another one right away after the one I had before it broke.</li>
            <li> If you have hair that is pretty short, though, please be aware that the roller part of this is large, so anything shorter than maybe 4 inches is going to be too short to even try to do lest</li>
            <li> I shipped the item back and he credited my account for the item right away.</li>
            <li> I was even more shocked, even pleased, that our hair stayed straight throughout the whole day.</li>
            <li> Mine did not come with a stand &amp; when I put the unit down on my bathroom counter to section out locks of hair to curl, it can ( and does) easily slip off the counter (weighted by the electrical cord).</li>
            <li> However, the barrel of this \\&quot;original\\&quot; version is metal, and the other components are smooth plastic (handle, brush bed).</li>
            <li> you are willing to pay the high price on this item because you have untamed hair, I&#x27;d suggest you buy it only if there is an acceptable return policy.</li>
            <li> and they sent me a brand new model within 3 weeks.)    </li>
            <li> A NEW ONE.</li>
            <li> So, I ordered a new one.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m just waiting for the return label so they can send me a new instyler.</li>
            <li> Positives: I live in SC</li>
            <li> I plan to buy a new one for her, from a authorized retailer that has the 1 year warrantee.</li>
            <li> , I had a wet/dry straightner by revlon that I bought new for $40.00,</li>
            <li> BTW, I bought the new tourmaline barrel one &amp; returned it --</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t live without this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I requested a new one, it turned out that the merchant had been dropped from Amazon suppliers.  </li>
            <li> The new one I bought worked just as well as my friend&#x27;s did.  </li>
            <li> and now I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> The items was brand new and worked the way it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> it would seem that you have to buy a new one every year to two years.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already ordered a new straightener, and this one isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> PS-Forgot to say that my hair is a pretty long, very curly and a frizz bomb.</li>
            <li> Notice all the 5 star reviews sound similar &amp; the last sentence ends with an !.  </li>
            <li> only a good hair dresser could style my thick, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> The instyler is so hot that it burns more quickly than any other iron i have used and by the time you feel the burn, it is way too late.  </li>
            <li> fit in the barrel - and even then it would slide right thru without any traction at all - no matter how hard I squeezed it together.</li>
            <li> She has been styling her hair since she was very young.  </li>
            <li> also makes my hair very soft.     </li>
            <li> It does leave your hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> Also, I have several burns on my hand and forehead as it is very easy to get burned, unlike a traditional flat iron where you can hold it and be protected by a handle or plastic covering, this offers you no protection from getting burned.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very dissapointed with this product and would never recommend it to others!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised this iron is allowed to remain on the market!    </li>
            <li> the roller would not return, they will not replace it due to me throwing away the original box.</li>
            <li> I have wrestled with so many hair products and straighteners and rollers and so on and so on ---- but no more.</li>
            <li> Oh wow!</li>
            <li> And my hair is so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying a second one just in case something happens to the first one.</li>
            <li> It did not get hot enough to straighten or curl hair.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny as long as you don&#x27;t expect it to do everything.  </li>
            <li> It was better than nothing, but not much better.</li>
            <li> On a normal morning, I would spend nearly an hour drying and straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t grasp my hair and didn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I tried everything to put the top back on and it did not go back the same way.  </li>
            <li> I read all the instructions first and had been using it properly, so they eventually offered me a replacement.  </li>
            <li> Safari Store even had the nerve to ask me to go back and enter a new and positive review since they are a new and upcoming store.  </li>
            <li> i only use the lowest heat setting which is recommended fpr my hair type and it is sill hot.  </li>
            <li> The Instyler&#x27;s brush straightens the hair first so it actually gets \\&quot;ironed\\</li>
            <li> It does the same thing and your life will be so much simpler!</li>
            <li> it leaves it soft and silky!</li>
            <li> This does the same exact thing as the ones that they sell in the store for $20.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> First, it takes forever to heat---then it actually does nothing.</li>
            <li> This product is very simple, so anyone can do it, even first timers.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first and second one from QVC about 4 years ago.</li>
            <li> The style stays pretty well until i wash it out, so i only have to style it after each wash.  </li>
            <li> By the next day he had sent me an email willing to work out my problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the types of hair, but to me I feel like this would be more for styling hair</li>
            <li> they came out so natural and bouncy!   </li>
            <li> The noise of the motor is what gets their attention, and then they all want to see it in action!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really simple to use after your first try, the first try never turns out as well as after you&#x27;ve had some practice.&lt;br /&gt;There are two different sizes.</li>
            <li> My hair curls really easily and will stay with little hairspray until I wash it out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thing, very flat, split ends, and very puffy.</li>
            <li> To me, the Instyler feels cheap (lightweight and plastic) and does not clamp down on the hair.</li>
            <li> I run it down the section of hair a couple of times to smooth it</li>
            <li> Major Fire hazzard!!!    </li>
            <li> with the brush, just like any other brush hair gets caught in it, so the problem is i always forget to clean it</li>
            <li> It does a nice job on my hair, however I am a little concerned with how long it will hold up.</li>
            <li> It is unique in how it styles, but it is clumsy to get the right hand motion.&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li> The guard, however, gives a false sense of security and actually increases your likelihood to burn yourself because it appears that the guard will protect you, but in reality, the guard is located on the top of the iron, not the side where you are most likely to burn yourself.    </li>
            <li> I had to take HUGE sections of hair (practically half of the side of my head)to</li>
            <li> With the inStyler it cuts the time in half and comes out so smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting the top half of my hair into layers since that seems to be the only part that gets uncontrolably wavy and frizzy and now my hair is beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have pretty coarse naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li> However, I quickly realized that it didn&#x27;t do anymore for my hair than if I had just spent the time using a hair dryer and a brush.  </li>
            <li> I knew I would have to straighten my hair a lot more at this length and bought the item but made sure I could return it as I am very skeptical of anything that claims to straighten hair.</li>
            <li> Also it was not hard at all to straight the hair in the back of my head.</li>
            <li> Nothing could&#x27;ve been further from the truth: this is, hands down, the most abysmal styling product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> When I use a regular flatiron, I hold it in my right hand and pull it through the left side of my head, and then hold it in my left hand and pull it through the right side of my head.  </li>
            <li> Be careful, it gets very hot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve burnt my scalp a couple of times but the same thing happened when I used flat irons, even more so often with the flat irons.</li>
            <li> Apparently this is a new seller!</li>
            <li> You also have to be very careful not to burn yourself, but that is true for any iron.    </li>
            <li> I use it right after I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I do like that you can really style you&#x27;re hair as you go in one go versus other hot tools that you have to use interchangeably.</li>
            <li> I was excited at first to find a product that will work on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d been smart enough to read some customer reviews beforehand!</li>
            <li> Oh, and it takes a few tries to get it right, but once you do it&#x27;s so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> She donated 11 inches of hair to Locks of Love last week, leaving her with hair a little longer than shoulder-length hair and it works SO well with it now, too...</li>
            <li> gave my hair a little shine, because of the rotation.&lt;br /&gt;I am able to straighten larger sections of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Gives volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I keep one on my bathroom counter at all times for quick styling and touch-ups, and keep the other one in my suitcase for traveling.  </li>
            <li> She has paid more for professional type flat irons that fried her hair and didn&#x27;t do half the job.  </li>
            <li> I have to say, I was a complete skeptic on this product.</li>
            <li> They just talk to the customers any old way with no qualified information about my product.</li>
            <li> Much tweaking is necessary.</li>
            <li> It is LOUD, and I like to do my hair while watching a movie, etc.  </li>
            <li> You can not get the InStyler close enough to your scalp to really achieve these styles because it will burn you.  </li>
            <li> Its squeaks so loud.</li>
            <li> This is such a versatile product that you can go from wavey to straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and have worn it for the longest time in a curly style.  </li>
            <li> Makes returns far easier.    </li>
            <li> I have the old one</li>
            <li> it does not fit in my hand securely as I try to style.  </li>
            <li> I have shorter strands of hair near the front of my head and, when I went to straighten those, I burned my forehead.  </li>
            <li> And when I went to straighten the side near my ear, I burned my neck.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sensitive to noise.  </li>
            <li> (Do not allow young children to use.)  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly and frizzy hair</li>
            <li> It has a loud motor, nothing you can&#x27;t get used to though.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll notice how much work you put in using a regular hair straightener versus using the InStyler.   </li>
            <li> My hair was extremely soft after each run through.</li>
            <li> I completely regret buying this crappy dresser accessory.</li>
            <li> She is only really using it for its curling capabilities, but</li>
            <li> I have tried every straightening product out there, including chemical ones like a professional salon Keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s not frustrating enough I used it for 2 wks</li>
            <li> I bought the Instyler for my 13 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li> but i have to admit it doesnt work well on mine as far as straightening goes</li>
            <li> I thought it was a real instyler until I actually purchased one from ULTA.</li>
            <li> If I want to curl my hair, I just use a regular iron, but I don&#x27;t curl my hair very often.    </li>
            <li> Once you get used to holding it correctly and using smaller sections of hair, it does work very well.  </li>
            <li> (my $30 straight iron delivers the same results).</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to as far as using the tool without burning yourself</li>
            <li> While it wont get your hair stick straight if you&#x27;re a mixed chick like me or</li>
            <li> and I got all the natural curls.  </li>
            <li> the bristles on the brush end look like a 30 year old abused broom - they&#x27;re all frayed and pushedapart.  </li>
            <li> I have different lengths of hair and it all looks sleek and straight when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair every day, straight hair stays the same even after sleeping on it!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care that I&#x27;m too old</li>
            <li> I am completely furious about this.  </li>
            <li> I have had the InStyler for nearly 3 months now.  </li>
            <li> I was completely surprised at the packaging...</li>
            <li> Of all the ones I&#x27;ve used, this is by far the easiest.</li>
            <li> Having said that, it works for me so far (used it for a week so far).  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li> Between 2 daughters &amp; myself-with different hair textures &amp; straight</li>
            <li> I got mine direct from the infomercial on the buy</li>
            <li> So far the product lives up to what they say it does.</li>
            <li> There is some truth to this save for the fact that the rotating iron burns your scalp and forehead if you try to get it anywhere near your roots.</li>
            <li> I was told I had to go through the InStyler manufacturer directly.  </li>
            <li> In conclusion, do not waste your time, efforts, or money on the InStyler Rotating Iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fighting to get my money back from a very irresponsible vendor.</li>
            <li> I finally surprised her with it</li>
            <li> It would straighten my hair, sort of, but left it very frizzy</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li> So I thought the InStyler would be the same principle and work really well...</li>
            <li> And i guarantee you any professional hair stylist will recommend it and they&#x27;re probably using it too.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair &amp; the Instyler</li>
            <li> It takes absolutely FOREVER to heat up, definitely not something that would be used in a rush.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did not listen to all of the negative things people had to say about the InStyler..</li>
            <li> I actually found this so much easier because I like to flip my hair under</li>
            <li> and I could do that with one hand by just pulling my hair straight back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had natural frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product after my 10 year old Infrashine straightened kicked the bucket.</li>
            <li> loud but bearable</li>
            <li> The roller is too big to straighten bangs very well.</li>
            <li> i cant return it because i really dont feel like paying shipping back.</li>
            <li> The flat plate also heats up very hot on the outside, so all of your styling will be with the one hand</li>
            <li> One more thing about a few days prior to this, the company sent me a plastic shield to go over the barrel as to prevent burning...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to read the reviews by those who didn&#x27;t have good luck with the Instyler, because it has completely revitalized my look.  </li>
            <li> This was even worse on my own.</li>
            <li> I have read the instructions and am still confused about when it is the hottest and why it flashes with three lights and never gets warm.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many straighteners on my thick, coarse hair over the years and this is by far the least effective one of all.</li>
            <li> For each section of hair, I run it through twice - barrel side out first to smooth down the outer frizzies and then run it through the same section of hair a second time with the barrel side inside curling it under at the ends giving my hair some body.</li>
            <li> As I said, my super thick hair with a wave straight from the Pacific Coast, I didn&#x27;t have my sights set too high for this thing.  </li>
            <li> I dry it very fast just using a comb</li>
            <li> And I live in a humid climate, which normally frizzes my hair as soon as I walk outside.  </li>
            <li> so you have to hold it in the same direction for your right and left side.</li>
            <li> I went back to my standard flat iron to get the smooth cuticle</li>
            <li> Apparently if you burn your hand drop it and want to fix it you must buy a new one.</li>
            <li> With a rotating curling iron on one side, and a brush on the other side, it gives you such a smooth look.</li>
            <li> I can see where it can easily fall on a dog or a small child that may be hanging about you (as dogs and children do) &amp; burn them.</li>
            <li> My naturally curly frizzy hair is straightened but bouncy unlike flat irons that leave my hair too straight and the ends looking pointy.    </li>
            <li> but when i straighten them I prefer a more bouncy/bombshell look than 100% flat &amp; straight hair if you know what i mean.</li>
            <li> &quot; straight instead of wavy like a flat iron.</li>
            <li> My hair does not look straight every time I use it I have to use a flat iron to finish it.</li>
            <li> I think people you use flat irons are going to find this product to work very well for them.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;ve got a hundred bucks to blow then it is does a fine job, but if you are like me and on a super tight budget you will more than likely feel guilty for spending that much money on something that doesn&#x27;t WOW you like expected</li>
            <li> The bigger one gives extremely loose curls that fall out quickly.</li>
            <li> It does get hot, but there are heat adjustments on the knob, so you can start off a little cooler than the other settings until you get comfortable with using it.  </li>
            <li> I could have lived with this sorta straight style because it went way quicker than using a flat iron, but then I noticed the bristles were bent and melting!  </li>
            <li> If you have short or mid length, loose curly or wavy hair you will be able to straighten your hair in less than a half hour for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many split ends because of this, it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> but they should&#x27;ve redesigned it to make it less awkward and more user-friendly for people doing their own hair.    </li>
            <li> My only con is the fact that it gets so hot and has the potential to inflict heat induced discomfort.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and it takes half the time it used to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> It has never failed to come back on after pressing the power button to bring it back to life.</li>
            <li> My first unit was faulty - did not light up (hence can&#x27;t say much about its quality ctrl - 1 star) -</li>
            <li> It does come with a \\&quot;thermal shield\\&quot; to protect you from this but the shield only protects one small &lt;1\\&quot; area on top of the rotator... which if you are straightening/ lifting your roots, it is the side of the rotator that burns you.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve only used this product for curling and NOT straightening, so I can only attest for curling.</li>
            <li> i must admit that i&#x27;m very handy with a flat iron, but i don&#x27;t like that slick straight look (though i have thick hair to pull it off</li>
            <li> - When I would use regular straighteners before, it would take me at least an hour to get my whole head done and to be sure there weren&#x27;t any pieces left unstraightened.  </li>
            <li> but it for me only works on the high setting</li>
            <li> I have curly thin hair and most straightners run too hot and make my hair very flat.</li>
            <li> With the Instyler I still put in minimal effort (still letting it air dry overnight), but now I get fabulous results after spending 15 minutes styling my hair in the morning with the device.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I had used one that worked previous, so I knew my product was not working properly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate, buy this tool now if you&#x27;re like me and have very little time everyday but LOVE having straight and managed hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a \\&quot;mature\\&quot; gal with curly, frizzy grey hair and was feeling very frumpy until I bought the Instyler (I bought \\&quot;the original\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li> Plus, on humid days a serum and my curling brush still wasn&#x27;t enough to tame my fine, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m wearing long straight hair just for a year or so</li>
            <li> when I&#x27;m done it&#x27;s slick and smooth.</li>
            <li> If you have long somewhat already straight hair</li>
            <li> I have waited 50 long years to get my hair as it is now, thanks to the Instyler, I just can&#x27;t do without it and will be buying a spare so as never to be without it.</li>
            <li> yet it took a really long time to do my whole head that way</li>
            <li> It also works really well if I want to put long curls in.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still hot, just carefully place in the bag</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a hot iron and you have to be careful.  </li>
            <li> i currently have an ISO ceramic 1\\&quot; flat iron that works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It does get very hot and you definitely need to be careful so that you don&#x27;t burn yourself.</li>
            <li> Only con Is It didn&#x27;t come with the spary that It normally comes with It.</li>
            <li> I normally would straighten my hair once or twice a week since last fall or so.</li>
            <li> It took a year to grow out my hair and get it back to normal.  </li>
            <li> does get hot, so BE CAREFUL.</li>
            <li> :  Since I wasn&#x27;t able to return the item after it had been used, per store policy, I improved the product by cutting the brisles as low as I could cut them, and it made the item somewhat of a better flat iron, which is what I need to use it for.  </li>
            <li> Also it is a little hard to use on my hair because you have to make sure its rotating in the proper direction, but I&#x27;ve always had trouble straightening my hair on my own</li>
            <li> I received my In-Styler several days ago - and tried it today - New Year&#x27;s Eve</li>
            <li> so it really wasnt on for very long each time i used it, and the motor burnt out...</li>
            <li> It is much easier to have your hair completely dry.    </li>
            <li> But since I got it for only about half the retail price, I&#x27;m just disgruntled and indignant enough to go on record with my opinion in the hopes that somebody will read it, choose not to buy this item and save their money for something more worthy--like a product that actually performs according to its claims.</li>
            <li> Revo Styler is a rotating brush that allows you to blow dry your hair straight with a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> In the middle of doing my hair it will click off and won&#x27;t go back on until it wants to.</li>
            <li> I called the customer service and not only was the person I spoke to incredibly rude, but after I asked to speak to a manager I was even more offended.</li>
            <li> younger and straight hair was the ONLY option.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job as it says it should (minus bangs and short hair), but the hardware issues just weren&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li> its possible, but difficult and i&#x27;ve burned myself a good bit.</li>
            <li> and I told him now my hair can blow and it will just fall right down into place.  </li>
            <li> I think that for someone who has thick hair such as myself it is more time consuming to have to really put small sections at a time versus a very hot flat iron.</li>
            <li> check out my other reviews for hot hair items that work.</li>
            <li> i always have to restraighten with my normal flat iron...</li>
            <li> It used to be a major undertaking to straighten my hair</li>
            <li> Have gotten nothing but compliments from not only family, friends, and co-workers ... but complete strangers as well!</li>
            <li> Not only is the thing loud, it didnt get the job done at all!   </li>
            <li> If you are not careful you will burn your fingers!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t and copuldn&#x27;t use any other hot iron anymore</li>
            <li> 1.It does get hot like any other tool</li>
            <li> After a few uses I noticed that it never got very hot and as soon as I started using it</li>
            <li> you end up with major burns.     </li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels great,for the first time without putting any other products on it apart from shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It does get hot, but no hotter than any of the other tools I have used.  </li>
            <li> My hair is medium length very curly and normally takes an hour an a half to straighten.</li>
            <li> As one review stated, you have to be very careful because it does get quite HOT and</li>
            <li> The InStyler physical composition is o.k., but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be worth the hefty price tag when I look at comparably priced items such as my pricey hair dryer or facial scrubber which scream &#x27;made to last&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Even after I washed my hair, it was still straight for a while afterwards and it never left any creases like my flat iron did.</li>
            <li> It seems the InStyler was originally designed for professional hair stylists and just got passed to us common folk.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair with a fine texture.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m african american with a decent grade of hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this as long as you buy from somewhere</li>
            <li> I have very thick mostly frizzy hair and have been using a straightner since 7th grade.  </li>
            <li> :) I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I have used the In-Styler now and find it very slick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone and the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I would be tentative buying it through amazon since returns are such a pain.</li>
            <li> Then once I unplugged it, plugged it back up, fondle with the heater setting (low, med, high, and off)</li>
            <li> I just happened across the reviews on a website when I was looking for a new flat iron for my daughter and couldn&#x27;t believe this product was almost $100!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long, and the brush makes it simple; my hair comes out looking put together much faster than if I use a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I have long, blonde, fine hair with a slight wave.</li>
            <li> really am not sure I needed to spend this much money for something I don&#x27;t use that much.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the wet iron is a lot easier to use and much safer.    </li>
            <li> As far as I am conceerned you can throw away your curling iron and your hair straightener and use only the Instyler.  </li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about trying the instyler, but I finally caved hoping it would work better then my current iron.</li>
            <li> I use CHI&#x27;s Iron Guard spray with the InStyler and my split ends are kept at the absolute minimal.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything to your hair and barely heats up.</li>
            <li> After inspecting the unit, it appears that it is not the heat that broke my hair, but it is actually the rotating action with the nylon bristles that actually pull and snag the hair, resulting in severe damage and breakage near the root.  </li>
            <li> If you pay that much for something it should last much longer than a few months.</li>
            <li> They were barely even brushing my hair as I was straightening anymore</li>
            <li> it is far too short.  </li>
            <li> Instyler covers only products purchased directly from the company, from the TV station, or from a store (I assume that means a building you can visit).  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased and received the Instyler directly from the company.</li>
            <li> So when I was about 75% complete with straightening my hair, I blew out the rest of my curls briefly and then used the iron.</li>
            <li> I prefer my wet 2 straight $25 straightener over this one.</li>
            <li> It definitely gets hot, and you have to be careful getting used to it or setting it too close to anything that might melt.  </li>
            <li> Even more frustrating, however, is the propensity the instyler has to burn the user.  </li>
            <li> The rolling heater part was turning slowly and had a grinding sound.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to straighten your own hair with it because of the brush</li>
            <li> And the instructions even say that if it&#x27;s too hot turn it down.  </li>
            <li> I have natural african american hair: very curly in spots and some frizzy dry spots.</li>
            <li> Though I only paid half of the retail price, I still do not think it is worth even that.</li>
            <li> Another reason I&#x27;m returning it is because I&#x27;ve read a whole bunch of reviews saying that they break easy, that is disturbing for me to see.</li>
            <li> I would strongly advise anyone with even moderately thick or coarse hair against buying this straightener.</li>
            <li> I mean, I&#x27;d rather have my hair up instead of a huge ball of frizz.</li>
            <li> I found blow-drying and other flatirons difficult to use and usually gave up, but the Instyler is so easy and gives such good results, I do it all the time.  </li>
            <li> I feel I should be able to return it and get my money back if the product did not successfully perform the one task it is designated to do.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, that has been my experience, even with &#x27;tons&#x27; of product in my fine, straight, graying-blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> It took me about a couple a months to really get used to using it and I won&#x27;t look at any other straightening product.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works very well.</li>
            <li> Though at first it would just make my hair a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t take long at all to style, and the ceramic barrel and low heat setting was enough to keep my hair straight even on a humid June day in Iowa.  </li>
            <li> My old flat iron doesn&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li> I woke up to a hot mess.</li>
            <li> no where near the look you get from a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I made it work due to the fact I had paid so much for it.    </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t have nearly the amount of damage I did when using a flat iron every day</li>
            <li> I manipulate it much like I did my other irons.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend spending the $100 bucks on a CHI flat iron or a IZUNAMI flat iron.</li>
            <li> No single product will work for everyone.</li>
            <li> Since Amazon has one for half the price, if you really need two of them, just buy two from Amazon, and it will cost the same as buying directly from the site.  </li>
            <li> Without half a gallon of hairspray, it only stayed straight for about an hour or so and then returned to its natural state.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and never can find a product that works well for straightening, always just ended up using a larger barrel curling iron that ultimately damages my hair.  </li>
            <li> Even when I go back to shorter curly hair (only cuz I&#x27;m old)</li>
            <li> This is not worth for free, dries up &amp; ruins the texture of the hair.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a well made item and feels consistent to any other curling / flat iron I have held.  </li>
            <li> Probably I need more practice in how to use this item, but so far I am not impressed with it.    </li>
            <li> and it will not dry your roots</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and this product did not get my hair smooth enough.  </li>
            <li> it doesnt clamp on tight enough to really smooth the hair, and if you use it on damp hair you have to go over it several times until its dry</li>
            <li> My hair is already pretty straight (some weird waves or tangles here and there), so I used it mainly just to make it look neater.</li>
            <li> Normally, I wash it and let it dry for the next day.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say is that my hair seems a bit less susceptible to humidity and thus, the style lasts longer (even till I wash despite sleeping on it or breaking a sweat on a hot day).</li>
            <li> If I do not receive my prepaid envelope within the next week I will be contacting the Attorney General&#x27;s Office to have this issue handled.</li>
            <li> I have to go back to my old flat and curling irons.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no excuse for this level of negligence and lack of concern for customer safety.</li>
            <li> After starting the process over again, it finally started to heat up but not as hot as it was the day before and not hot enough to make any difference in her hair.  </li>
            <li> Not too long ago I noticed that the company now offers the Instyler in 2 sizes and a 14-day trial.</li>
            <li> This made my hair look dead and burnt my ears because there is no gaurd on the end of the hot roller.</li>
            <li> I rated it only four stars because of the fact that it took some time to figure out how to get the back of my head without my hair getting snagged, and the fact that they don&#x27;t provide anything to put it down on while it&#x27;s hot.  </li>
            <li> my hair doesnt come out straight down and silky like the informercials ...</li>
            <li> The barrel only turns one way, and while I have no problems positioning it on my right side, I have a lot of trouble using it on my left.    </li>
            <li> My hair is thick, coarse, and LONG ... not to mention that I have always had to wait until I got to my hair styled at the salon (which usually takes two people brushing and blowing to get manageable) to have my hair look this good.</li>
            <li> that hair - start at the scalp and smooth down - holding the ends a little longer if I want them to flip.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> I did not give it 5 stars because: it breaks down fairly quickly (according to other reviewers)</li>
            <li> I have very very long wild and unmanageable curly hair.</li>
            <li> If I let my hair dry naturally, it just looks parched and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I used black nail polish to draw 3 big arrows on brush side so it was easy to tell which direction the barrel was rolling, helps eliminate wasted time and frustration trying to figure which way to hold InStyler.</li>
            <li> I tried it out as soon as I received it, and had my hair straight in less than 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, frizzy, dry, etc.</li>
            <li> &quot; This lead me to think it was ceramic coated (which is much safer and less damaging to your hair...</li>
            <li> In real life, it made my bangs stick out at odd angles and it made them look like they were fried...</li>
            <li> Especially when you get near the roots.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a long time to heat up.&lt;br /&gt;Laves my hair</li>
            <li> The iron itself is fine, but the control switch is very confusing.  </li>
            <li> I can take my hair from a frizzy mess to beautifully straight and shiny in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> My bangs are bleaced white and then redyed every week pink, and it polishes them like new.  </li>
            <li> It also claimed that it would dry your hair, and that was very misleading also because it you used it on wet hair with product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday but it does make hair much less frizzy, smooth &amp; gives it body.</li>
            <li> If you hold the InStyler closed tight and firm and pull down the length of the hair slow, it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> and I mean quick.  </li>
            <li> Looks very cheap and fake.</li>
            <li> and maybe it did; she has thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair that is shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and buy a large, round curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Yes there is a learning curve because the Instyler should be held a certain way to get the results your are looking for, but it took me a few days getting used to my straightener</li>
            <li> Normally, with my Chi or other hair straightener, I would need my husband to help me straighten the back properly, and it would take around 45 minutes to do.</li>
            <li> Although I am very right handed and pretty inept with the left, I did not find it too hard to use the Instyler, which some reviewers complained about.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fairly limp; and wanted to give it some body and lift... needless to say I could have achieved better results with a large curling</li>
            <li> I have really thick, curly hair and therefore rarely straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> This product caught my interest because I wanted something that would reduce the frizz aspect and provide loose curls or other styles that weren&#x27;t just ironing board straight.  </li>
            <li> The InStyler doesn&#x27;t dry my hair as fast as other flat irons I have used.  </li>
            <li> But wait I happened to see this thing in a store and thought it could work not so much to straighten my hair but to give it a little bend on the ends and some body that you just don&#x27;t get with a flat iron, and it does just that.</li>
            <li> I am completely a hair style failure - using any kind of styling tool just ends up making my hair look worse than it did before.  </li>
            <li> I bought my inStyler a couple months ago really confident it would tame my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I loved my InStyler for the curling and smoothing results, but it has DANGEROUS electrical issues, proven because I purchased 2 of them and other reviewers complain about the same dangers.</li>
            <li> This is not worth buying a new one.</li>
            <li> With half my hair straightened and the other half curly, the rotating iron portion came loose, the top cap popped off, and screws came out.  </li>
            <li> it makes them all pointy and stiff so stick to a real blower for that.</li>
            <li> I am used to using larger sections with my regular flat iron.    </li>
            <li> I bought it for my mid-length hair and the resutls are no different from a standard flat iron.  </li>
            <li> The product heats up quick and straightens curly hair but leave it dull and dry looking, basically it burns the hair.</li>
            <li> For the past several years I used a large barrel curling iron (2 inches) plus a flat iron for final smoothing.  </li>
            <li> As long as you use small layers of hair at a time, the InStyler works exactly like it does on the commercial.    </li>
            <li> It also left a burn mark on my natural blond highlights on the small section I tested near my face.  </li>
            <li> She used this instead of the regular flat irons</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be going back to my $25.00 Flat iron.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, I&#x27;m back using my flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use a flat iron or regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> My suggestion is save a buck and buy a regular flat iron which can do</li>
            <li> I am back to using my flat iron now.</li>
            <li> Curling irons would just flaten my frizz into flat waves and each hair would go in a different direction.  </li>
            <li> I never had this issue with a regular flat iron.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll stick to my regular flat iron.</li>
            <li> Though, you could use the Instyler initially and then flatten the ends with a flat iron I suppose.      </li>
            <li> I am debating if I should return it and just buy a regular flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Even with proper instructions, over-directing, etc., this tool is simply a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> and the same problem with straightening irons, yes they remove the frizz but leave my hair flat and darken the blond, leaving it greasy looking.  </li>
            <li> While I cannot speak to whether or not it will last (a concern raised in other reviews), I can tell you it worked very well on what my friends kindly call my crazy hair!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair with tight \\&quot;S\\&quot; curls that frizzs easily.</li>
            <li> This is not true because the barrel gets very hot and you need to be careful to not burn 1) your hands; 2) your scalp; 3) your eyes; 4) your hair!!!</li>
            <li> so you have to make sure each time you place down that the cord is not touching, started to melt my cord!!   </li>
            <li> Despite being pretty skeptical, based on very differing reviews of this item, I went ahead and bought it as a gift for my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> However, I did pay extra for faster delivery and it took just as long as if I hadn&#x27;t paid the extra</li>
            <li> Let me just say that the first one I got was defected, because it just turned off after a few seconds of using it, and would not really straighten anything.</li>
            <li> Makes it fast to straighten hair or put a little curl into it!</li>
            <li> (I guess other customers also had issues with the hot barrel), but it&#x27;s useless/cumbersome (if you used the shield you would need to remove it every time you lifted the device to straighten/curl hair, and put it back on when you put it down - you would need morehands than you had!).</li>
            <li> I was using my \\&quot;old faithful\\&quot; $45 Remington wet to dry 2 \\&quot; flat iron which I purchased at Walmart 3 years ago prior to this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought the bogo free deal and gave the other one to my mother-in-law who has long thick hair.</li>
            <li> With my hair slightly damp it completely straightens and conditions!</li>
            <li> For as expensive as this tool is, I would think they would sell replacement parts, such as the bristles, that you can easily slide in and out when needed.  </li>
            <li> It took me LESS THAN TEN MINUTES to completely straighten my hair with a flip and framing.</li>
            <li> It comes in a black carrying case to lie it down on when hot, or when you&#x27;re finished using it</li>
            <li> My friend felt the same way about hers, but still continued to use it, because it does make her hair straight, but now she says her hair has split ends and looks damaged, but it&#x27;s too late for her to send hers back.</li>
            <li> The first time I saw the InStyler on a late night infomercial I thought...</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product and the return process takes a long time and you have to pay for the shipping and handeling there and back!!</li>
            <li> I saw the commercials and thought it would be easier than a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It is at the \\&quot;in between\\&quot; stage between long and short.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my ends and my hair looked longer and straighter, laying flat.  </li>
            <li> I hope they improve the quality in the future because I will definately want to use this tool for a long time.</li>
            <li> my hair just looked flat.  </li>
            <li> The latter would take to long and you risk damaging your hair.</li>
            <li> I prefer my solia flat iron any day</li>
            <li> and she used a Steam Flat Iron on my hair.</li>
            <li> Seems to last a long time too.  </li>
            <li> As a result, all the hair around my scalp is now only about 1 inch long.  </li>
            <li> Repeated use of a flat iron damages my hair.  </li>
            <li> And its not as damaging as the flat iron.</li>
            <li> but you DO with InStyler) flat iron etc.  </li>
            <li> I´ve wanted this beatiful tool for a long time, and finally got it.</li>
            <li> - My long hair takes about 1-2 hours to iron initially.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s BS if you are starting from scratch andespecially if you have long hair like I do.    </li>
            <li> and now I do not have to worry about my hair breaking off and burning from curling or flat irons.</li>
            <li> Basically its an overpriced Flat iron.</li>
            <li> I use an ion flat iron to get shorter sections and underneath</li>
            <li> if you want a flat look, this will not be the tool for you.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended that I go to a beauty supply store or look into buying a ceramic Chi flat iron online.</li>
            <li> Long story short, it&#x27;s being returned.</li>
            <li> I have used flat irons and they were just ruining my hair</li>
            <li> --also I couldn&#x27;t get a \\&quot;volume look\\&quot;, but just flat.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t look flat).</li>
            <li> your hair won&#x27;t be long enough and you&#x27;ll burn yourself.</li>
            <li> After years of trying to balance flat irons and curlers I decided to try the instyler.</li>
            <li> Start to finish, it used to take me an hour to do my hair with my flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a stand or prop or flat surface</li>
            <li> so I would suggest not leaving it on a specific section for too long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried curling irons and flat irons.  </li>
            <li> With a flat iron it takes me about 20 minutes to do my hair, with the InStyler</li>
            <li> Her hair is curly &amp; she&#x27;s been using a flat iron to straighten it.  </li>
            <li> She does have pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> It really took me a while to do my hair because I had to be very careful in not getting burned!!!</li>
            <li> I have burned myself though quite a few times, pretty painful and easy to do!  </li>
            <li> I bought a thermal pouch from Sally Beauty so that I could put it in something that would be safer as it cools down (have a young child in the house).</li>
            <li> I never had a problem with it - it has been working properly so far, doesn&#x27;t shut down or anything.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying this product is made with cheap plastics and even cheaper screws, so you have to be a little delicate with it.  </li>
            <li> Regular flat irons just dry out my hair, including this one.</li>
            <li> wrong spelling on the label, the heating element doesn&#x27;t do what the instructions say, there are two different versions of the instructions and one seems more legit than the other.  </li>
            <li> I came in a new box with instructions for diffrent styles and now she uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> NOW: The iron itself does not last very long at all when ordered from the in-styler company themselves....</li>
            <li> The last thing is that my hair has to be fully dry in order to fully get the results I want.</li>
            <li> With this I can dry my hair and use the Instyler to do several things.</li>
            <li> The only real problem I have is that the chord is very short, and the first one I got, the chord was really long, so that&#x27;s disappointing.</li>
            <li> My hair is frizzy from a previous old perm on my ends</li>
            <li> I paid $50 for it, which is a lot less than the retail price, but as I found it to be completely ineffective, I may as well have thrown that money in the trash.</li>
            <li> far less than I would spend at the salon.</li>
            <li> let it dry during the night &amp; straighten my hair the next day in 20 mins!!  </li>
            <li> Overall, it is the most disappointing purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> My old straightening iron was ceramic and would only straighten it for a few hours.</li>
            <li> The stylist used one of those big round brushes while blow drying, and pulled out all my natural waves.  </li>
            <li> trying it the first time and suffering two burns, I assumed (stupidly) that it was just a matter of being more careful.  </li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for my thick, long blonde hair, at all.</li>
            <li> It does do what it says it will do but a regular ceramic flat iron does the same thing in half the time for a third of the price.</li>
            <li> It does get hot, but not very fast, and if you take super tiny sections the tangles aren&#x27;t quite so bad.</li>
            <li> The second drawback is that is says that it could dry your hair when it is damp, takes too long.  </li>
            <li> I finally find it for less than $140.00 and it only worked properly once.  </li>
            <li> I spent about ten minutes on my hair and then went over it with a flat iron to make it sleek.   </li>
            <li> I have coarse, wavy, color treated hair and have had minimal luck with flat irons.</li>
            <li> It is a little loud when you are using it</li>
            <li> Will be looking into a warranty replacement, but in the mean time, will need to buy another one, as the 14 year old in the house is now in major break-down mode because she can&#x27;t straighten her hair!</li>
            <li> and you really don&#x27;t have to work as hard at getting the style you choose.</li>
            <li> and it really wasn&#x27;t hard at all to \\&quot;get it down\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christamas present from my husband after a few major hints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty hard on hair straightners, I must admit, but the InStyler is not a very durable one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to use when iron is hot and doesn&#x27;t hold the iron in a fully closed position.</li>
            <li> I remained skeptical until my boss came in after Christmas break with smooth,</li>
            <li> but that is more awkward.</li>
            <li> In Stylers,  My Biggest disappointment was that my hand kept touching the off button; I think it is located in an impractical place</li>
            <li> I sent this product back, it was not worth the money, you can buy a roller blow dryer for 20.00 and it does just the same thing.</li>
            <li> It maybe gave a small amount of volume at the roots, but that is probably only because it frizzed the hair near my scalp just before burning it.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take that long to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> One of my friends has thinnish long hair and it didn&#x27;t work on her hair at all.</li>
            <li> my hair is not that long</li>
            <li> but if you can detangle your hair with a normal brush, this thing is pointless.    </li>
            <li> (I have long hair).</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I just went to the salon and spent hours and $$$ to look this way\\&quot; hair... and for a week, it was the same.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would be an alternative to style my long hair without having to cut it to make it easier.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not loud, it has a motor</li>
            <li> - so be careful especially around the ears!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for self, I have long length relaxed hair.  </li>
            <li> the noise everyone is complaining about is not loud at all.</li>
            <li> All in all, I recommend this for people with long hair who want to straighten or flip their hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a long time for me to style my hair.</li>
            <li> because I&#x27;ve coveted it for so long.  </li>
            <li> We will see how long this lasts.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not stringy or clumpy after styling, holds all day long with no frizz.</li>
            <li> i always have friends and co-workers thinking that i pay to get my hair blown dried by a professional.</li>
            <li> The only issues were be careful of burning.  </li>
            <li> but I am still taking a long time to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for medium to long length hair.</li>
            <li> I guess because my hair is long it is a lot easier for me to use this as I have never burned myself with the Instyler.</li>
            <li> I have a LOT of long hair, nearly to my waist,takes about 30 minutes to straighten my hair from towel dried with this.</li>
            <li> , i prefer my regular straightening iron, it may be because I have sorta thin hair that i do get pretty staight from just drying it...</li>
            <li> Maybe because my hair isn&#x27;t really thick or curly, but the InStyler didn&#x27;t really straighten my hair.   </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that gets very frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have very course, thick hair and</li>
            <li> I have used this on my friend&#x27;s very thin, fine hair and it didnt burn off her hair.</li>
            <li> God blessed me with very thick frizzy hair that I have spent the better part of my 30+ years trying to tame.</li>
            <li> The cons - The on/off button right in front on the bottom, and I keep accidently turning it off, not a good spot or should be harder to push so this would not happen.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it last year for a Christmas present and in less then a year it has fallen apart</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair every three days, and I only have to touch up my hair slightly each day with the InStyler.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m racially mixed, black and white; my hair is on the coarser side of things</li>
            <li> I have been wanting this product for so long now and finally went out and bought it the other day.  </li>
            <li> I tried it a few times, but the result on my shoulder-length, baby-fine, naturally straight but highlighted hair was a frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li> Either it looked too dry or took way too long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to use as a curling iron, but it does work really well to tame wild/ coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It still works but it has an annoying popping sound every time the roller hits a certain spot.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> The rotater is not hot enough.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cheaper to go the other route, although you probably can&#x27;t get 2 instylers for the same amount of money</li>
            <li> The round portion of the styler is the part that goes toward your body if you want your hair to either be straight or to curl in a little, as I was looking to do.  </li>
            <li> Actually she works at a daycare and already has two other women looking to buy this product.</li>
            <li> And yes, the iron is hot (DUH!)</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, daily use with this item can fry your hair; but I have not found any heating element claiming to curl/straighten hair that does not (over time).</li>
            <li> It looked simple enough to repair, but I did not have a tool that was small and compact enough to fix it.  </li>
            <li> I have totally  stopped using any hair products other than shampoo and conditioner.   </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying this product after reading many of the reviews, but curious enough to go ahead and buy ONE at Bed, Bath and Beyond with a 20% off coupon.  </li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to holding it differently than other irons.</li>
            <li> Unfornately the other day in the middle of doing my hair -</li>
            <li> The only real issue with the item is that there is no guard ar anything to keep you from getting burned so it is tough to get the areas close to your ears and the nape of your neck.  </li>
            <li> but i can get the same results from a flat iron for half the price.</li>
            <li> at least I would&#x27;ve tried to find a new home for it rather than throw it out, had I known!</li>
            <li> First - there&#x27;s no safe way to put it down!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t maneuver a brush and dryer for very long.</li>
            <li> it takes a very long time to heat</li>
            <li> I have very long, curly hair (a lot of it too)</li>
            <li> I have very long, curly, somewhat frizzy hair</li>
            <li> As long as you work with small sections at a time,just as you do with a plain straightener you will not be damaging your hair because it works on the first try.</li>
            <li> But when I let it air dry and don&#x27;t style it, which is 70% of the time</li>
            <li> However, I do have to say that even my dry split ends looked healthier and smoother after using the InStyler.  </li>
            <li> Have to use as directed with 2 - 3\\&quot; strands of dry hair without any products applied.  </li>
            <li> And your hair has to be completely dry.</li>
            <li> blow-dry my hair, just use the InStyler when my hair is mostly dry.  </li>
            <li> But I never got the chance, it&#x27;s a shame that they charge so much for a product that has serious defects.</li>
            <li> when I just air dry it with a volumnizer at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;Really have not had any problem with the replacement InStyler.</li>
            <li> The cons are:  -I have split ends and my hair can feel dry sometimes.  </li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair before I use it.  </li>
            <li> I am biracial with course dry hair</li>
            <li> With the InStyler, I can blow dry my hair to mostly dry, run the Instyler through it and go.  </li>
            <li> Bought the Instyler after using the Revo Styler for years to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It will dry it out.</li>
            <li> She said that it didn&#x27;t dry or straighten.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I can say is that I have trouble getting use the using only one hand.  </li>
            <li> It turns back on, then a few seconds later, off it goes again.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse and naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I thought what kind of IDIOT seller won&#x27;t let you open something and try it out(just</li>
            <li> I am one of those who hates my hair, long or short it ges heavy and becomes flat fast, I am never happy and always pull back in a pony tail, well not anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought mine at Wal-mart knowing I could return if it did not live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> It gets every single bit of frizz out, but also adds curl and body.  </li>
            <li> My long, think hair takes forever to straighten, but with the instyler it totally cut my time in half.</li>
            <li> I bought this brand new a little less than a year ago, I found it on sale for $50.</li>
            <li> not sure why people are surprised by this fact.  </li>
            <li> I have tried straightening perms and other flat irons.  </li>
            <li> I actually looked everywhere in the instructions, on the box, and even searched the internet to find out what the barrel was comprised of... no success.</li>
            <li> I checked the return policy for Amazon and found that there are only a few items that are generally not returnable, those items involving skin of blood.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago and I am african american, my hair is thick and coarse.</li>
            <li> About 2 months ago, the nut at the end of the shaft came off, and the heating cylinder came loose.  </li>
            <li> The end piece that held the barrel on always came loose and my hair would become tangled around it.  </li>
            <li> The loose end cap causes a gap at the end of the roller.  </li>
            <li> Thank God for American Express chasing down these unauthorized charges.  </li>
            <li> The only time it is down is after it is washed or I re-wet it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like it that it seems unstable when you set it down.  </li>
            <li> I have hair halfway down my back</li>
            <li> the potential to burn yourself (like with any other iron) is there!  </li>
            <li> Highly not recommended</li>
            <li> I consider myself to be reasonably agile but this product was so cumbersome that it was almost impossible to use with ease.  </li>
            <li> Being her first time (and mine), I was shocked at how fast it was to straighten our hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite happy actually as I normally hate curling irons and usually avoid doing anything to my hair.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that after discontinued use of the regular curling iron that my hair shows less damage.  </li>
            <li> So in my girlfriend praises this product simply because if you have curly hair, you can straighten her hair in half the time.</li>
            <li> When I wash my hair, I use the Instyler on the wet hair instead of blow drying, but I don&#x27;t use it to completely dry the hair, if that&#x27;s what you are expecting to do.</li>
            <li> She has long thick hair and her hair is naturally wavy.</li>
            <li> It does straighten my hair well (long, thick hair with natural wave).</li>
            <li> so I can use their 5 EasyPays (less of a financial blow that way) as I never want to be without mine ever again!</li>
            <li> what used to take me 20 minutes+ to do with a regular iron, i can now do in 10 minutes or less with the instyler.  </li>
            <li> Personally I felt this was a terrific waste of money!</li>
            <li> The information about this product is slightly misleading, because you are still pressing your hair in between two metal plates, so it does the same thing as a straightening or curling iron.</li>
            <li> It makes sense because I tried it on my slightly damp hair last night</li>
            <li> Compared to the previous InStyler I bought from the InStyler website, this one never reached the proper heat level.</li>
            <li> The ONLY thing I did not like was that it did leave my hair just slightly frizzy.</li>
            <li> and I hoped this iron wouldn&#x27;t dry out my hair and possibly give it a little shine.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I was very surprised that it got any negative reviews. . .  </li>
            <li> Plus, the whole thing is really heavy on the wrist since you are lifting a curler (round iron) and the heavy metal flat part (brush side).</li>
            <li> In summery, the quality is not great because they break too easily, and you will have a hard time returning it.</li>
            <li> Stupid me should have known better!  </li>
            <li> Another con is that if you leave it too long in your hair it will fry your hair but some of the other irons are like this as well.  </li>
            <li> A collegue of mine had used it on her neice&#x27;s thick naturally curly hair and it worked wonders!  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t close tight enough to iron the hair.</li>
            <li> I have very short curly hair and my bangs tend to curl up into little sausages after one day.</li>
            <li> I still have a little difficulty with the back of my head.</li>
            <li> As for getting the little curl under or flip up at the end, well, that created an even bigger tangle for me to deal with.    </li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is heavy and difficult to \\&quot;lift\\&quot; on top without creating a lot of damage by teasing, and this product has been my solution!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make it shiny, and only straightened it a little bit.</li>
            <li> The instyler came with a very small and optional guard, which i installed because i always try to be cautious when trying out a new product.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and was afraid it would be hard to manage, but it glides through my hair very easily.  </li>
            <li> Previously I would use a flat iron to straighten out the waves and curls and then a curling iron to put a little curl back on the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> It would be worth the money if only they would work at least a year!!!</li>
            <li> the *shine results are less with it than with a ceramic flat iron.</li>
            <li> But if it&#x27;s short and thick or just thick in general then i would recommend just a regular flat</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it gets so many bad reviews</li>
            <li> I never know if I&#x27;ll wake up looking great or awful.</li>
            <li> So maybe for someone with awfully curly hair, this might be a great tool.</li>
            <li> However, their customer service is the worst I have experienced.  </li>
            <li> But this morning I went to use it and the barrel was stone cold even though the LCD light was lit.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s why: in order for me to get similar results with my hair, I have to go to the salon, which requires making an appointment, driving there, waiting, and then spending at least 30 minutes with the stylist, paying, and then driving back</li>
            <li> You have to hold it with the handle facing the BACK of your head, at least on the left side of your head.</li>
            <li> It arrived today which surprised me because I didn&#x27;t expect it until at least tomorrow, but all that means is I got to use it before I went out to dinner today.</li>
            <li> I have zero patience for blow drying and only have it blown dried and styled after my haircuts, after which I&#x27;m showered with compliments about my hair (which people will compare to Maria Shriver&#x27;s, Dana Delany&#x27;s or Cindy Crawfords).  </li>
            <li> , feels like a big waste of time, and it exhausts your arm trying to straighten all your hair.</li>
            <li> The InStyler CAN do some styles with careful practice.  </li>
            <li> I go carefully</li>
            <li> I really do not see that \\&quot;polish\\&quot; or \\&quot;shine\\</li>
            <li> The cuticle of my hair was still frizzy, so I still look like a puff ball after all the time spent straightening with the Instyler.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re still curious...</li>
            <li> When I had a demonstration at the store the lady spent a while for a curl to form.</li>
            <li> but think I&#x27;d like to try the Chi as this was a big waste of money</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The product works for me, although I am EXTREMELY careful &amp; focused when I use it.</li>
            <li> And be careful -</li>
            <li> This so-called straightener, which I bought secondhand from a coworker who was having a moving sale, is one of the crappiest products I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I received the InStyler as a gift last Christmas, and I am embarrassed that the purchaser wasted their money.  </li>
            <li> This gives salon quality styling with minimal effort and minimal time.</li>
            <li> But like I said, for me, I get the same results from a hairdryer and round brush.  </li>
            <li> when wet it took forever) and made it look shiny.  </li>
            <li> Sent the dead InStyler back and got a replacement.</li>
            <li> I spent 2 hours in the bathroom styling my hair within a inch of its life</li>
            <li> but I have used it on wet hair as well</li>
            <li> and it works wonders wet too.</li>
            <li> I personally think this item is not comfortable.</li>
            <li> but I bought mine from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, and it&#x27;s lasted longer than expected</li>
            <li> When I called them, they said there was nothing they could do so now I have spent hours - and</li>
            <li> and it just didnt work the way i expected it to i.e. the way they said it would.</li>
            <li> I do use it nearly everyday though, so I suppose I did get my money back out of them.</li>
            <li> and it still was not straight, nor shiny...</li>
            <li> I was at a salon recently and all the operators using a blow dryer and a round brush.</li>
            <li> I have definitely changed my mind after using for a few months.</li>
            <li> Some reviews said they had trouble straightening the back of their hair.</li>
            <li> You need to be careful.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally wavy hair and did not feel like</li>
            <li> an African woman with thick coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> I have medium lenght hair that is not frizzy or thick, just somewhat naturally wavy.</li>
            <li> My hair is somewhat coarse naturally, but my hair felt worse after using it.</li>
            <li> and I was just an incredibly slow learner; even though I have been using hair straighteners since I was thirteen years old.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, thick hair that is shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> It took a few tries to teach myself how to work it for the different styles but eventually I got the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Endcap was loose due to an untightened nut.  </li>
            <li> However, just keep in mind that I am comparing this to my old conair flat iron which was just downright terrible. :)</li>
            <li> I love this straightner but was getting a little sick of how flat (lacking volume)it was leaving my hair.</li>
            <li> If I hold the Instyler in my right hand, the roller turns the wrong way.</li>
            <li> It takes me less than 15 minutes to straighten my medium long hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long with just a slight wave</li>
            <li> I can straighten my thick frizzy hair faster vs a regular flat iron  </li>
            <li> It took over 30 to 45 minutes longer than usual to style my hair from wet and dry &amp; I had to do it over again with my flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I used it a few times and it seemed to make my hair a lot frizzer than I flat iron did.  </li>
            <li> I did straighten may hair, but it was limp; nothing like the texture I get after using my FHI flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I put a little finishing smoothing spray on the ends of my hair which fixed the issue immediately and with absolutely no more need of the tool.</li>
            <li> The brush part is not good for african american hair.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair that is very difficult to style.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly med long hair and wanted a different look now and then</li>
            <li> The main reason I purchased this product is because having thin hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling my long, thick, curly hair for years and have found a simple solution.</li>
            <li> And it took such a little amount of time!  </li>
            <li> Just like any other thing you use heat with on your hair though, you should use something like the Got2Be heat protection spray so it doesn&#x27;t fry your hair.</li>
            <li> I did not get to look at the product due to delievery time.</li>
            <li> The one drawback I&#x27;ve found is that it must be handled with extreme care or else it will break, as mine did after six months of twice-weekly use, even though I never dropped it or otherwise manhandled it.  </li>
            <li> I do wish that it had the option to make the barrel spin the other way, but other than that</li>
            <li> Again, as other reviewers report, this one powers itself on and off at will.</li>
            <li> and they are supposed to be sending me a replacement for the other one.</li>
            <li> so this dosen&#x27;t happen to other folks.    </li>
            <li> It straightens but to an extreme frizziness on me.  </li>
            <li> I ordered one, and I have thrown away all of the other tools that claimed to do what the InStyler does do.</li>
            <li> Place the strands of hair between the tongs and you will find that as you clutch/hold the tongs together, the rod begins to rotate, polishing the hair against the brush on the other side.  </li>
            <li> I recommended it to one of my other friends who also has hair  frizzines.</li>
            <li> well otherwise I attributed it to the extreme heat being put out by my curling brush.  </li>
            <li> I order this iron because a friend buy whith other seller   </li>
            <li> My bangs have always been a challenge, since I usually pull my hair back and</li>
            <li> I reach for this almost every day while my other stylers/irons gather dust.</li>
            <li> Hey how about BE CAREFUL!</li>
            <li> In doing a side by side comparision, there were several small differences that makes me think this is a knock-off.  </li>
            <li> So I am keeping the one from the department store and trying to return the other, but seller has not responded to my emails as of yet, go figure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering why the prices i see on Amazon, and other sites are $65 and up, and the tv ad is 2 for $15.00.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve always used the serum, even with other tools).  </li>
            <li> ive seen it for 79.00 dollars on other sites</li>
            <li> I can see why this is a problem for other irons</li>
            <li> Be Careful!</li>
            <li> I was advised that they cannot accept a return or refund my charge due to it being a hygienic product.</li>
            <li> but I felt that the product did the same job as my 25$ straightener, and no better.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t tell if its as damaging as the other straighteners I&#x27;ve tried, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is.  </li>
            <li> If you do it the other way, the hair gets kicked out.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t spin \\&quot;against the grain\\&quot; or your hair, and once you get to the other side of your head and want to switch hands, you can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I got used to using my other hand though,</li>
            <li> I sectioned my hair off as I usually do for a regular straightner</li>
            <li> Plus I like that I can create curls and other styles with it.  </li>
            <li> Even my hair stylist is now recommending the Instyler to her other customers.</li>
            <li> I sold 2 that day and the other buyer had no issues.</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive if you ask me.</li>
            <li> My hair is usually frizzy after I use a regular straightener though, so I doubt this can be attributed to the Instyler.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t stop working in 6 months like other reviewers have written, and</li>
            <li> so it may work for other folks.  </li>
            <li> I just wash my hair, towel dry, put a little product in it, and style.  </li>
            <li> so it takes a little time (but lots less than blow dry styling with a round brush followed by flat iron).  </li>
            <li> So to properly get your hair done - you gotta take the chance of a few little burns.  </li>
            <li> My hair, when it is straightened, is very soft, but very thick and out of control if I just let it go.  </li>
            <li> With the instyler it took me 20 minutes to completely dry and straighten my towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> This thing is a total pain to even attempt to curl with (I&#x27;ll definitely stick with a traditional curling iron); you have to actually wrap your hair manually around the barrel, making it nearly impossible not to burn yourself.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, a piece was broken off; I emailed the seller the next day, and he asked me to mail it back to him.</li>
            <li> or it is an imitation.</li>
            <li> SINCE IT IS HOT ALL OVER IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO PUT DOWN ON SOMETHING WHILE USING (FURNITURE OR VANITY).</li>
            <li> I usually have to flat iron my hair and then curl it to get the look I am looking for.  </li>
            <li> (Which would usually take having to purchase a flat iron and curling iron.)</li>
            <li> This is because I am not skilled in using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how sraight is got her hair in a matter of minutes with no burning smell or any of the usual problems we used to get with flat iron and straightening combs.</li>
            <li> I have been straightening my hair for a good 8 years now and was very disappointed when i tried this product.    </li>
            <li> it is a bit noisier than other irons because others dont make any noise but its really not annoying or that bad.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair (quite a few inches past my shoulders) and if I start with dry hair, I can get it done in 15 minutes max.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first because I used a flat iron before</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t a major issue (though my husband thought so) since it did straighten my thick shoulder length hair in less than a half hour.  </li>
            <li> My hair is VERY thick, course, and has some natural curl to it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first and the price scared me a  little at the thought of buying another product that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time holding a brush and hair dryer at the same time, but this item is a time saver.  </li>
            <li> DEFINETLY NOT WORTH $100</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint about the instyler is that the barrel only rotates one way.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the $99.00 price tag, even with the 20% discount.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is Amazon (ahem) raised the price, but I still would recommend it.</li>
            <li> After reading all the negative posts regarding this product I purchased a similar knock off product instead.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I had seen the InStyler on TV, and it seemed promising, but I try to stay skeptical</li>
            <li> But definitely the quality was horrible, it just felt cheaply made, especially for the amount of money it cost.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately by the 5th time of using it, my hair gets puffy, frizzy and very damaged.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> This is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;ve only used the least #3.</li>
            <li> The InStyler is not worth the money and it doesn&#x27;t work for all hair types.  </li>
            <li> For the price though not worth it to me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely not worth the money they charge for it.</li>
            <li> Shuts off if your hair is tiny bit thick.</li>
            <li> I bought the instyler 1 week ago and returned it one week after, i have thick coarse hair</li>
            <li> When you buy directly from the Instyler site, you get two, but that is no great bargain.  </li>
            <li> i have medium length hair,a soft curl, and not a lot of hair, thin too.  </li>
            <li> I personally have thick wavy hair, and this iron does wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend having this product around small children, or anyone who is not at least 16 years old.</li>
            <li> When it did work I loved it...very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair about shoulder length</li>
            <li> I used a straightening iron on my thick, frizzy hair for years, and often I would still have to pin it back to keep it from frizzing.  </li>
            <li> It was the biggest waste of money that I have ever spent.  </li>
            <li> Love the idea, hate the quality.  </li>
            <li> It is wavy and thick, but I sectioned it off into smaller pieces</li>
            <li> I would only recomend this product if you&#x27;re going to use it on someone else&#x27;s hair or have REALLY thick hair yourself.</li>
            <li> I have natural wavy, but somewhat frizzy, thin hair.</li>
            <li> It seems to do less damage than a conventional straightening iron.</li>
            <li> I have thick black (Asian) hair</li>
            <li> place it down on the counter</li>
            <li> Let hair down - release about another 20 percent and repeat with that layer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have ( mine came with a guard to put over the barrel) and it also came with a mat to lay the iron down on.</li>
            <li> Nothing came with it on which to place the styler when you need to put it down, so I am using a towel under mine so as not to burn my counter.   </li>
            <li> If you want hair that looks like it just happened but still pulled together get this thing, its cut my styling time down to 15-20mins.</li>
            <li> I just hope that the brush doesnt wear down because of the heat.</li>
            <li> Of note they have taken this item down from their storefront.</li>
            <li> I can put it down and not have it laying and burning on the countertop.</li>
            <li> You put it down and it just falls over so the barrel is on the counter.  </li>
            <li> If you put any amount of pressure while clamping down on your hair it makes a dragging/clunking noise.</li>
            <li> I wanted longer hair to wear it down.  </li>
            <li> Now when it is down you can see the layers of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use to use a flat iron to straighten my hair, but it always looked dull.</li>
            <li> Used it on Christmas day on my hair which is thick and coarse and on my duaghter&#x27;s hair which is thick, long and extremely curly and wavey!</li>
            <li> my only real complaint is, for a professional type product, the cord should be at least one foot longer.</li>
            <li> You just use the tool like a flat iron by slowly running it through your hair.</li>
            <li> It used to take me 1.5 hours to blowdry &amp; then flat iron my course, thick and curly hair.  </li>
            <li> usually to straighten my hair, but sometimes I use it for loose curls as well</li>
            <li> I have flat irons, but when I straighten my hair it takes me at least one hour and half to straighten.  </li>
            <li> They told me it would take less than a week.</li>
            <li> My Instyler stopped working after making electrical clicking sounds less than 6 months after purchase.</li>
            <li> Two of us have thick curly hair and two with thin straight hair.</li>
            <li> I bought my InStyler less than 8 months ago and it broke this week.  </li>
            <li> all the thinks the instyler claims for less money.</li>
            <li> I bought a slightly used one off ebay for $40.00 and took a chance.</li>
            <li> I can do my hair in 20 minutes and it looks just like a blowout at the salon that takes them an hour and half to do.</li>
            <li> Well when I went to use it again it started making this odd popping noise when the barrel rotated and the side the brush was on began rubbing on the barrel and it caused a groove.  </li>
            <li> both ARE ceramic and are half the price.</li>
            <li> I can curl and straighten my hair in half the time with litte or no work on my part.  </li>
            <li> The reason why I order from Amazon is to pay less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> The InStyler has litterally cut the styling time in half.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the second one is starting to show a bit of use as well in the bristles</li>
            <li> A pro to this con is once it is ironed, during the week before work in the morning the touch-ups take up 10 minutes or less.  </li>
            <li> And the spinning pulls the hair slightly also to straighten it.  </li>
            <li> I will not settle for anything less, and I don&#x27;t want any apologetic emails or phone calls.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit less time too.</li>
            <li> The Instyler does have 3 heat settings and the finer your hair the less heat you probably need.</li>
            <li> giving you less breakage and split ends.)</li>
            <li> My hair is not super curly.  </li>
            <li> It says it can be used on slightly damp hair..</li>
            <li> The cost on Amazon was about $40 less than WalMart.</li>
            <li> It lays on the counter (no damage yet) but seems odd just laying there on its side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because you can buy it half the price on ebay.</li>
            <li> few weeks ago a co-worker complained that she had gotten the InStyler and it didn&#x27;t work for her hair (too short) and</li>
            <li> Takes less than 5 minutes to style my medium length hair.  </li>
            <li> I thought long and hard about getting another one since appox.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get the same results if you blow dry your hair and then use less expensive straighteners and such, which for me would take at least an hour.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s awkward to use at first</li>
            <li> And the things I purchase there are usually no more than twenty dollars, not the one hundred dollars I spent on the InStyler.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> However I have long thick hair the spinning cylinder caught my hair in it and pulled it out, even when I reduced the amount of hair I was trying to straighten.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, course and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have long or thick hair, so I can&#x27;t blame it on that.  </li>
            <li> I have long, curly, thick hair</li>
            <li> It does not work with my long thick hair.</li>
            <li> The claims are a little less than trueful.</li>
            <li> Once I purchased the In Styler I wear my hair down everyday.</li>
            <li> I think if you want tight curls, you should use a curling iron.</li>
            <li> eventhough you pull it tight.</li>
            <li> The appliance&#x27;s motor was too weak to deal with my thin hair, and the whole thing was NOT worth the price</li>
            <li> My hair is a little longer than shoulder length and medium wavy, so its not even tight curls.  </li>
            <li> , this takes half the time is does to style with a round brush and hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I always think that if something is expensive, it is well made and will last long.</li>
            <li> Since I have long, curly, thick hair, going forward I am going to blow out my towel dried hair using a comb attachment and then use the Instyler.</li>
            <li> The InStyler took a little while to learn how to use, but once I got the knack of it my hair has a shape and smoothness like I&#x27;ve never had before.    </li>
            <li> First of all, get it at a store (sorry, Amazon!).</li>
            <li> Yes, it straightens my hair, but it makes it a little fly-away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other straighteners in the past without ever getting burned.  </li>
            <li> A little tricky to get the hang of</li>
            <li> Just was not worth the money!</li>
            <li> a little aloe/80 styling gel keeps it looking neat, I don&#x27;t have to have my hair styled all over.  </li>
            <li> However, if you switch sides of your head the rotation is up the hair shaft, and causes a little tangled or frizzy bump.</li>
            <li> If you hold the rotating barrel on the under side of your hair, you&#x27;ll end up with little fly-aways.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing a little hairspray at the end can&#x27;t handle</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten burned a little twice, but I&#x27;ve learned to use it</li>
            <li> It does take a little getting used to, but I am a \\&quot;pro\\&quot; at it</li>
            <li> but I must put a lot of product in it to get it to even hold what little curl it has.</li>
            <li> so I think a couple of uses and a little patience is all you need.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no better than any other straightener, curling iron, blow dryer brush, etc.</li>
            <li> The one thing I will say is, while it does straighten your hair, it will always leave it with a little texture (bounce and volume) -</li>
            <li> I am a little bit worried about burning myself though.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that it does not have a tip at the end to help  you to guide it easier.. but even with that said I have never had these results with any flattening iron I have ever used and that says a lot!</li>
            <li> It is a little noisy</li>
            <li> I washed my hair last night and let it air dry (my hair has a weird wave).</li>
            <li> The only negative thing   I can say about the product is that its hard getting into the roots, I think its because I&#x27;m scared to get burned.</li>
            <li> I have numerous other stylers all of which are less expensive than this</li>
            <li> Big hopes, big disappointment.</li>
            <li> Very misleading and disappointing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, buy something else.</li>
            <li> This was with everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got shoulder length hair that&#x27;s frizzy and which is medium heavy in density.</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday....</li>
            <li> Well....it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with my hands and fatigue.  </li>
            <li> For those reviewers who said they couldn&#x27;t use the InStyler because the barrel only rotates in one direction--you didn&#x27;t figure out the secret.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s heavy, mosey, and the bristles on the brush wears out after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I received this item with part of the packaging missing.  </li>
            <li> Waste of my $$</li>
            <li> I had seen this item almost everywhere almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> I tried to use it a few times and I kept burning myself</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my InStyler for a few months.</li>
            <li> I went from straightening my hair once a month tops to everyday.</li>
            <li> The round plate doesnt heat up.</li>
            <li> Do Not Buy this piece of cheap crap made in China...</li>
            <li> I used to have to blow out my hair with a round brush, straighten it</li>
            <li> it does take a few days to get used to.  </li>
            <li> I curl it everyday, and I have over processed (over color-treated) hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin short hair</li>
            <li> It takes a few times on my hair to straighten it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this thing.</li>
            <li> There are a few drawbacks that kept me from giving it 5 stars though.  </li>
            <li> Not smooth and polished like the product claims.  </li>
            <li> The InStyler was heavy</li>
            <li> Saw it on TV and finally bought it, not happy with the results.      </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste a minute on this product.</li>
            <li> Watching a few videos for tips works well too.</li>
            <li> When I called the call center, the person I spoke with was rude, and the supervisor with whom I was connected was inept.  </li>
            <li> It dried the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I even used a heat protection serum before using this and it still dried my hair.</li>
            <li> It could work for those who have short thin hair.</li>
            <li> I bought it a few years ago to see if it&#x27;d do as it claimed.  </li>
            <li> I just bought this item a few hours ago and came home to try it out immediately.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Please dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> Her hair is long and thick, but she also does not like the effects of the excessive heat on her hair.  </li>
            <li> and got a return authorization, although the operator tried hard to sell me the Instylers at a lower price and also include other free worthless stuff.  </li>
            <li> It usually takes me an hour to straighten slightly damp hair.</li>
            <li> After contacting Amazon &amp; the seller a number of times, they both are not ready to stand behind the warranty due to amazon not being an authorized dealer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sad because I don&#x27;t know how to do the same thing to my hair so efficiently with any other product.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t have anything other negative comments to make about it.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of the other negative reviews - and here is my advise:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought the InStyler, first I was afraid to do something wrong</li>
            <li> I got tired of spend 5 hours to straighten my hair with flat irons and then curling it with curling irons....</li>
            <li> straight in it but even with product in my hair it turn poofy and weird about 10 min after not sure why i have thick wavy hair bu never frizzy.</li>
            <li> but these definitely helps to get my relaxed dramatic bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> This product is not easy to use at all.</li>
            <li> It is definitely not easy for one person to use.</li>
            <li> However, about a year ago I noticed my hair was getting a little too dry on the ends, and I had a lot of broken strands close to the roots.  </li>
            <li> I did burn my forehead pretty badly by accidently tapping it with the InStyler.</li>
            <li> i have a bad burn on my face and people should be aware of this item...</li>
            <li> Not ideal as within 30 minutes, even this is already starting to flatten out.</li>
            <li> I used the Instyler hoping for a little lift at the root, and what I&#x27;ve gotten after using it for several weeks is a bunch of broken hair at the root all over my scalp!    </li>
            <li> I even asked my hairdresser who was not very enthusiastic about it.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, very tight waves (had loose waves about 10 yrs ago, how it happened</li>
            <li> I turned it off and left it on my counter, then hours later I touched it and was badly burned.</li>
            <li> and my daughter got a third degree burn that left an ugly scar on her forehead.  </li>
            <li> However, I do not have thick hair and it takes me less than 10 minutes to use.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in it. :-)</li>
            <li> To get a semi-decent style, you have to take very small sections and go very slow to style it properly.  </li>
            <li> However, I was credited  for the defective item with very little hassle.  </li>
            <li> They also said that the retailer we bought it from packages the product themselves (which is blatantly false information) and because they \\&quot;package the product\\&quot; they could open another Instyler and take the heat resistant pad from another box -a ridiculous solution.</li>
            <li> , that was hard earned money that i wasted.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I do not find it hard to handle once you have used it a few times.  </li>
            <li> It is very awkward always holding the iron in a way so that the barrel is rolling in the right direction.  </li>
            <li> usually I just wash and go.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money and time!</li>
            <li> : /</li>
            <li> Also, the styles possible with this product are greatly exaggerated.  </li>
            <li> For the past two days, I&#x27;ve managed to flatten and somewhat curl my hair.</li>
            <li> But, I was not able to get it to fix my hair as advertised on TV.</li>
            <li> Also, someone stole my credit card last year and ordered one of these (sent to me), weird, but</li>
            <li> * Not a safe design in this regard (exposed</li>
            <li> but no more so than that of a curling iron.</li>
            <li> but no this is a horrible straightener you will be better off investing in a CHI</li>
            <li> I got the instyler as a gift this past Christmas.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure I understand the thought process that went into the manufacturing of the switch.  </li>
            <li> However, it failed to work properly while I was straighting my hair one day.  </li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t noted excessive heating or burning when she uses it.</li>
            <li> I also think the price is excessive based on quality.</li>
            <li> All in all, I am not satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> No more....    </li>
            <li> so i will continue to use it religiously everyday!  </li>
            <li> I know some think it is difficult to use, but I find that once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature.</li>
            <li> im not sure what all the complainers are going on about.   </li>
            <li> no more gels, mouse, cream, shiners.   </li>
            <li> Sharing peoples personal information without their permission is ILLEGAL.</li>
            <li> This will just lead to excessive damage.</li>
            <li> Not sure how you could burn yourself as it comes with a heat shield.</li>
            <li> The individual I received it from is not someone who ordinarily gives expensive gifts, and I had never heard of the product before.  </li>
            <li> , that goes past my belly button.  </li>
            <li> This is not ok.</li>
            <li> AND THIS PAST</li>
            <li> I have always had a really difficult time straightening it properly.  </li>
            <li> I am not satisfied yet as this item has not been received by me yet.</li>
            <li> if not better.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;burn guard&#x27; makes the product hard to manage through the hair and just plain gets in the way.  </li>
            <li> However, after only a few months of actively using it, it just went dead. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed and very upset at buying this the way I did since I can&#x27;t even send it back for a refund, but am stuck with it until I throw it away.</li>
            <li> 3 uses and 13 months later, and your $140 is in the toilet :(</li>
            <li> not to mention i used mine maybe every other day for 6 months and my hair is thin</li>
            <li> Instead of attempting to help resolve problems due to their false advertising, they attempt to wipe their hands of any problem their product may have.</li>
            <li> So not only did I waste my money on this horrible product, but I then had to go and buy a new blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not very good at using styling tools, it will take some time to get used to</li>
            <li> no more i hardly use it like seirously this suxed</li>
            <li> It is expensive... and according to the other reviews on here, it stops working after a few months.</li>
            <li> I have returned this item because I really was disappointed in the product.  </li>
            <li> I ordered one on Amazon from Select electronics for my sister, but disappointed so much.</li>
            <li> she was miffed because she waited too long to return it so was stuck with an expensive mistake.  </li>
            <li> This item worked for approximately one minute and then shut down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very very hard to work with side-swept bangs and little hair because of the curvature.</li>
            <li> so I hardly get to do my hair now...</li>
            <li> (Hard to explain the issue</li>
            <li> Hard to handle.</li>
            <li> Hardly used.</li>
            <li> I know how to use tools and found this one hard to handle</li>
            <li> *Hard to straighten roots  </li>
            <li> Hard to believe they are still on market.  </li>
            <li> Can be hard on the wrist when trying to twist.</li>
            <li> I have curly thick course hair thats very hard to tame.</li>
            <li> Sold me at least.</li>
            <li> off course they wouldn&#x27;t post negative reviews on their website so customers can see the truth.</li>
            <li> complaint is the cover to use for packing or storing.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t do that with this  sucker.</li>
            <li> I have read lots of negative feedback on the Instyler.</li>
            <li> At least it works well.</li>
            <li> and I have not had any of the negative issues.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of horrible cheap materials.</li>
            <li> Duh.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, they refused to take any information about my complaint and refused to accept a return.  </li>
            <li> Despite reading the negative reviews I bought it at Walgreens</li>
            <li> so now of course it&#x27;s too late to submit a claim on it.  </li>
            <li> I have to hold it with the handle pointing to the back of my head which is really really awkward.    </li>
            <li> but you honestly do not need 2 hands for this.  </li>
            <li> - It can be awkward to get used to, especially after learning that you have to hold it so that it rotates with your hair instead of against it.  </li>
            <li> Or at least it is for me.  </li>
            <li> postpone job interviews ALL because my hair dresser was late to work or wasn&#x27;t around.  </li>
            <li> I was already running late and thought maybe I shouldn&#x27;t try and style my hair</li>
            <li> but it sounds as though the proper way to use it would&#x27;ve been so awkward</li>
            <li> I am afraid it will not work properly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one complaint that I may have is that I can&#x27;t get as close to my roots</li>
            <li> least I&#x27;ll have two</li>
            <li> least I&#x27;ll have two</li>
            <li> I have really thick, wavy/curly hair that tends to frizz.  </li>
            <li> I have thick semi-wavy hair and</li>
            <li> its thick and course and wavy</li>
            <li> just slow</li>
            <li> I have thick frizzy (not curly) hair.  </li>
            <li> and I have a lot of thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> If you have thin, limp hair then this might work.</li>
            <li> I have below shoulder length thick course wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, frizzy-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using super-hot products for years, since that&#x27;s what&#x27;s needed on my thick, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> is a learning curve - go slowly when learning  3.Help your hair out by styling it in layers (bottom up)</li>
            <li> so I have extremely thick and curly hair</li>
            <li> So I ordered one with the reasoning that I&#x27;ve wasted $15 on much worse in my life.</li>
            <li> and she has thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have THICK and LONd hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair and</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I guess I can live without them... but still. :(</li>
            <li> I have used CHIs as well as other expensive ones and the remington blows the pants off those.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll see what I mean when you get one.  </li>
            <li> That battle is no more!  </li>
            <li> I have VERY thick, past bra strap lenght hair.    </li>
            <li> Now about the instyler, it was very awkward to use, but I figured since it was so new to me, I would get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> 3 - You need to use very small sections of hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and usually use my Paul Mitchell straightener at 400 degrees to straighten my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what technology is behind this, speaking from experience.  </li>
            <li> It literally cut styling my hair by half which is everything if you are a working mother trying to get out the door on time!!!  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, below shoulder, very wavy layered Caucasian hair and have an awful time straightening all my hair with a conventional straightening iron.</li>
            <li> so, this was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I have serious reservations about the safety of this product because of the burning incident; you&#x27;d think that they could come up with something safer.</li>
            <li> I think I hoped I could use it to curl as well as straighten, and for me, it just straightens and gives a subtle curl/shape.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed and to top it off, I have burned myself with this styler, Its completely dangerous!</li>
            <li> Seriously thinking of buying another one to have for my travel bag, and as a back-up.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I cannot consider ever going without an instyler now.</li>
            <li> This being said the motor is very loud and annoying.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try this product for about a year but was afraid that it would not live up to the hype on the infomercials and it does not!</li>
            <li> It can be a little difficult rotating your hand if its waves you want.  </li>
            <li> The voltage requirements were met but the manufacturers of this product failed this customer&#x27;s requirements!It is not worth the risk or dissapointment!</li>
            <li> WE FINALLY GOT A BAD SEED.</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t get my money back though...</li>
            <li> , the lack of a burn guard causes burns to face and hands, it is not good for use on bangs.</li>
            <li> My hair is so thick and wavy that a flat iron would just make my hair worse, and it would be so frustrating and uncomfortable!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t complain, but this unit has chronic DANGEROUS issues and it is NOT cheap.</li>
            <li> this piece of crap is not worth the money spent on it...</li>
            <li> Annoying loud, my neighbor can hear it through our apartment walls</li>
            <li> There are three heat settings each going up to thin to thick hair.</li>
            <li> The loudness of the machine which has been complained about in other reviews is a little annoying, but nothing that would keep me from using it.</li>
            <li> I am so sick of cleaning out my brush and giving the vacuum cleaner rollers a hair cut.  </li>
            <li> They sent me a thing that looked like an instyler, it was the exact thing but BOOTLEG!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried it on my hair with is not super thick with an annoying wave, my moms waist length curly hair and my little brothers shoulder length rat tail; after those 3 uses the combing bristles were already fraying.</li>
            <li> I hardly use it because it doesn&#x27;t get the job done in a timely or efficient manner!</li>
            <li> On the official webiste they are being sold for almost $190 which is really ridiculous for a poorly made product(that is a rip off).</li>
            <li> For this to not curl my hair and as expensive as it is, that was a big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I spent about an hour doing my hair this morning and it had since been up in a pony tail for work with an awful crease and curls starting to show themselves all over again.  </li>
            <li> long, curly hair &amp; this thing make it realy bad.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive when compared to other straighteners, so I am really angry at myself for this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product if there is a chance you will be distracted (by family, children, pets, whatever)or have small children - it can cause a sad accident.</li>
            <li> When I used it the first time, my hair looked frizzy and terrible, but I figured out that the barrel was rotating upwards</li>
            <li> TOO Expensive for no more than what it does.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to say, I was not pleased with it at all.</li>
            <li> Once I sleep on it, my hair is very hard to brush so it always goes up in a pony tail.</li>
            <li> Very hard to manipulate a twist at the wrist and lift.   </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was very hard to use at all.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very hard to style, but this product could work even on the tough hair.      </li>
            <li> but when I did my left side I had to hold it very awkwardly</li>
            <li> The supervisor was very rude.  </li>
            <li> have very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I am trying to grow it out &amp; it is curly &amp; very thick.</li>
            <li> have to go very slowly through each section to get</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for people who don&#x27;t have very thick hair because it would be a breeze for you to do your hair.</li>
            <li> It is a little awkward to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little awkward because you have to hold it to go one direction</li>
            <li> I have curly frizzy thin hair</li>
            <li> Sadly, the inStyler sucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to use this anymore though because each time I use it it make my hair worse and worse.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thin but frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Awkward + heavy.</li>
            <li> Or worse?</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I think it does that by DRYING IT OUT (which explains why my split-ends got worse).</li>
            <li> i dont see that where that matters, they cant resell something that is broken.</li>
            <li> And believe me, we have tried everything on that poor girl.  </li>
            <li> and the company does not stand behind it&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> I used it twice for minutes, it sat around and now it&#x27;s broken.  </li>
            <li> Now i&#x27;m stuck with a broken styler and if i try and return it</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> I was tired of the Instyler and bought a Remington Frizz Therapy 1\\&quot; Straightener.</li>
            <li> If it does not suit your needs or you are not happy with it, return it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I received being a bootleg:  </li>
            <li> So I set it on medium temperature,and still I was not happy with the result.</li>
            <li> I almost tought it was broken.</li>
            <li> Poor customer service, I guess they don&#x27;t count on repeat customers.</li>
            <li> I WAS NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> I have medium length, thin to medium hair thickness.</li>
            <li> I used it approximately once a week.  </li>
            <li> Figures, after using it for two months, the brush on the Instyler fell off, and every time I try to use it again, it just gets worse.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse, when I attempted to have the situation rectified, customer service ignored my email.  </li>
            <li> Their claims that you will not burn your hair are false.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with high hopes, but I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I went to the salon today, and since I hate sitting under the dryer, my stylist blow drys, flat iron and bumps the ends of my hair for shape.</li>
            <li> There is no cool tip at the end to hold while straigthening your hair, which makes it very awkward &amp; hard to use</li>
            <li> it was ridiculous!   </li>
            <li> Well I ordered a new one from a third-party seller and was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My husband is sick of hearing about it--it was windy the other day</li>
            <li> Too bad, it worked so well for months....but just not worth the damage.</li>
            <li> Even if your hair is a bit wet, it tends to damage ur ends really bad and flips ur hair in the wrong direction.</li>
            <li> Which is not only inconvenient but bad customer service.</li>
            <li> Especially since Amazon is awful about charging shipping fees for any and all returns (at least that I&#x27;ve dealt with).</li>
            <li> This is the WORST product I have ever encountered &amp; a total waste of money!!</li>
            <li> In my mind, after having so few \\&quot;bad hair days\\&quot; since I&#x27;ve bought this, I would probably have to try to come up with another $80 if it broke on me after the one year warranty expired.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed, and my experience is very typical, from what I&#x27;ve read online about the instyler.</li>
            <li> but when I open   The box and saw the iron I feel very disappointed because looks like  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste yoaur money!!!!</li>
            <li> it will just make u angry.  </li>
            <li> My husband got it for me this past mother&#x27;s day and what a disappointment!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad to say that all the production in China gets us cheaper products but without the quality assurance we expect from US products.</li>
            <li> This may be a knock off or a fake.</li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong.  </li>
            <li> Sorry not for me.</li>
            <li> Negates need for expensive hair products for straightening and smoothing hair</li>
            <li> if i dont like it, ill return it</li>
            <li> To style each curl takes mere seconds say 5-7secs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li> Guys, this product is not perfect.</li>
            <li> Alternatively, it can fall on your foot, or as I did, in trying to coordinate holding my sectioned hair with one hand to wrap around the InStyler and grabbing for the Instyler itself, grab the wrong end of the device (both barrel &amp; handle are silver colored) ending up with burned fingers.</li>
            <li> it was a fake.</li>
            <li> but once it broke I was unable to use it anymore.  </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t all that complicated.  </li>
            <li> I figured they couldn&#x27;t fake everything this hair straightener was doing.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is over rated.  </li>
            <li> He told me he was \\&quot;sorry</li>
            <li> She was not impressed however with it&#x27;s results.</li>
            <li> I guess they realize they are wrong in their preseentation, but still refuse to refund me.</li>
            <li> but from QVC (sorry amazon)and got the stand that the styler sits in as part of the package and it is so helpful when styling so</li>
            <li> because then the barrel will spin the wrong way...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sad about it though...</li>
            <li> I still use a big curling iron along with this, and I still say it&#x27;s horribly overpriced, but it works well.</li>
            <li> But because it was curly and damaged it was difficult and time consuming to blow it out.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I think this observation applies to the InStyler.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Hello Rhonda,     I am so sorry for the inconvenience.</li>
            <li> If your not getting results your doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but tried anyway as I needed a shorter morning hair regime.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical just like everyone else.</li>
            <li> I was still skeptical that maybe it was the weather or a fluke</li>
            <li> Needless to say I bought it from my co-worker, and I&#x27;m on here now to buy another</li>
            <li> Very poor quality for the money.</li>
            <li> Very poorly made.  </li>
            <li> We were both disappointed to say the least.  </li>
            <li> horrible product i must say, my parents had boughten me this for christmas this year (finally getting around to telling you how bad this is)</li>
            <li> Needless to say unless I take the time to style it, it looks bad.</li>
            <li> I have had frizzy, crazily misshaped hair for years.  </li>
            <li> I might consider giving the instyler another chance if they come out with a button or something that reverses the rotation so it&#x27;s not so awkward.</li>
            <li> I was totally cutting it before I bought the instyler.  </li>
            <li> Based on all the reviews I was afraid it was going to be another addition to my hairstyling junk yard.</li>
            <li> I was afraid my hair would get caught in the rotating barrel but that has never happened.  </li>
            <li> I agree it is dangerous, when you are holding your hair to pull it through is almost a reflex to grab the bottom of your hair.</li>
            <li> but still a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really awkward to style that.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been reading reviews that it&#x27;s awkward to hold.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry if you purchase an Instyler!</li>
            <li> You will be sorry like me!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am returning it as soon as the store opens!</li>
            <li> - it was expensive!</li>
            <li> Yes, there was no way (no matter how hard I tried and what I used) I could keep my hair from not looking like a horrible, ratted, before picture ....</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use as a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I was debating on buying this product for a while because I read some bad reviews...</li>
            <li> I DONT UNDERSTAND THE BAD REVIEWS.</li>
            <li> I rent so it would be a bad idea to let the sink get scorched</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews for this.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product, I love it! I have thick, curly hair and it perfectly straighten my hair. I read reviews about the noise and how it didn&#x27;t work but I don&#x27;t have any complaints. I brought my instyler from the company and got the extended warranty. I got tired of spend 5 hours to straighten my hair with flat irons and then curling it with curling irons....with the instyler, it only took about an hour. Be your own critic....everyone&#x27;s hair is not the same. It took me about a couple a months to really get used to using it and I won&#x27;t look at any other straightening product. I&#x27;ve burnt my scalp a couple of times but the same thing happened when I used flat irons, even more so often with the flat irons.</li>
            <li> I have been using the instyler for about two years.  I have curly frizzy thin hair and this is absolutely the best product on the market for my hair. I gave one to my daughter who has wavy hair and she also loves it. The instyler seals my hair and now I can go out in the rain and mist and my hair does not shrink. Even when my hair gets a little moist from rain, it still holds its own without frizzing up.  It takes me about 10 minutes to do my shoulder length hair.  I can do super straight, soft and wavy  or straight with volume.  The only thing that bothers me is that I didn&#x27;t invent it!</li>
            <li> I have to say, I was a complete skeptic on this product. But, after using it I&#x27;m a believer. My hair looks incredible  - shiny and bouncy! It&#x27;s very easy to use and quick. This will save me a lot of styling time on my hair in the morning. If you&#x27;re not very good at using styling tools, it will take some time to get used to but the heat guard is great for novices. I haven&#x27;t tried curling yet but I am excited to see the results. This product is definitely worth the purchase and I would recommend it to anyone with unruly curly hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Instyler from their website.  The video makes it look amazing, and was looking forward to getting two of them for my daughters for Christmas.  When it arrived I tried it, and was very unimpressed.  The appliance&#x27;s motor was too weak to deal with my thin hair, and the whole thing was NOT worth the price charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called (20 minutes on hold!) and got a return authorization, although the operator tried hard to sell me the Instylers at a lower price and also include other free worthless stuff.  I returned the Instylers (insured), and later my credit card was charged twice.  Thank God for American Express chasing down these unauthorized charges.  I think they make their money from charging people for returned items!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you order these - don&#x27;t!  They are cheaply made and don&#x27;t work.  Once you supply your credit card number you WILL be charged. Repeatedly.</li>
            <li> I have pretty coarse naturally wavy hair and I&#x27;ve used almost every styling product out there to try to straighten it. My old straightening iron was ceramic and would only straighten it for a few hours. The Instyler is the best thing I ever invested in. I put it on medium setting and straightened my hair and it worked amazingly. Even after I washed my hair, it was still straight for a while afterwards and it never left any creases like my flat iron did. Just like any other thing you use heat with on your hair though, you should use something like the Got2Be heat protection spray so it doesn&#x27;t fry your hair. It is a little awkward to use but if you use it a couple times, you get the hang of it. I definitely have to give this thing a perfect 5 out of 5.</li>
            <li> I like the InStyler, but I do wish that the rotator would rotate in both directions and that there was another setting for the heat to not be so hot. Other than that it works very well.</li>
            <li> I have returned this item because I really was disappointed in the product.  It was much to hot even at the lowest setting for my hair and burned it more than straightened it.  It also claimed that it would dry your hair, and that was very misleading also because it you used it on wet hair with product it simply melted your hair.  I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it gets so many bad reviews - I can&#x27;t believe how terrific this thing is! I have very thick, below shoulder, very wavy layered Caucasian hair and have an awful time straightening all my hair with a conventional straightening iron. I was able to straighten my hair like a pro in about 5 minutes with the Instyler, even the back! It was quick and easy, and now my hair is smooth and swingy - even the bangs and hard to straighten hairline. The hardest part was sectioning off my hair as I went. I needed a third hand but eventually got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> The shipping and cost was good, the product itself didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> Probably I need more practice in how to use this item, but so far I am not impressed with it.    Lidia</li>
            <li> I did not get to look at the product due to delievery time.They told me it would take less than a week. I never recieved it on time. It took me 1 month wait to get a second reply from seller. The shipping service was of no help because there was no tracking number avalable online. Bronx postal customer service was the worst. They just talk to the customers any old way with no qualified information about my product. I was disappointed but i will still buy at amazon.</li>
            <li> The in-styler works very well. Be careful it is very hot and can easily burn you; especially when you are working with your hair underneath.</li>
            <li> What I like about the instyler rotating hot iron hair straightner, is the fact that it does its job.  I tried it the first day I received it and it made my hair shiny and smooth.  Another good thing about this product is that it came with a thermal shield for the barrel and now I wouldn&#x27;t get burned.  The title of my review is \\&quot;Somewhat like it\\&quot; because there are three drawbacks.  First one is that the motor is loud.  The second drawback is that is says that it could dry your hair when it is damp, takes too long.  The last thing is that my hair has to be fully dry in order to fully get the results I want.</li>
            <li> I have not bought this product yet but it did the job. I went to the salon today, and since I hate sitting under the dryer, my stylist blow drys, flat iron and bumps the ends of my hair for shape. She used this instead of the regular flat irons and she didn&#x27;t have to use the curling iron and it turned out great! My only con is the fact that it gets so hot and has the potential to inflict heat induced discomfort. Other than that, I was happy with the results enough to contemplate purchasing my own.</li>
            <li> I love the Instyler.It is easy to use and does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do. I wish they would make a smaller size for shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I was debating on buying this product for a while because I read some bad reviews...overall i am happy with it and some of the reasons why are the time and money.  It is cheaper here and it is the real thing from the AS SEEN ON TV programming shows.  It takes me less than 15 minutes to straighten my medium long hair.  It is quick. it is a bit noisier than other irons because others dont make any noise but its really not annoying or that bad.  I really like it and have already recommended it.  Another con is that if you leave it too long in your hair it will fry your hair but some of the other irons are like this as well.  so just watch the video and follow it...I really am enjoying this iron!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  I love it so much that I&#x27;m writing a product review, which I never do, because I want to make sure enough people buy this so that it&#x27;ll always be on the market for the times I need to replace the device. The one drawback I&#x27;ve found is that it must be handled with extreme care or else it will break, as mine did after six months of twice-weekly use, even though I never dropped it or otherwise manhandled it.  If the makers could come out with a sturdier model, then it would be perfect. (When mine broke I returned to to the manufacturer--you&#x27;ll need to include your receipt so make sure you hang onto it--and they sent me a brand new model within 3 weeks.)    I have thick, coarse and naturally wavy hair.  I have zero patience for blow drying and only have it blown dried and styled after my haircuts, after which I&#x27;m showered with compliments about my hair (which people will compare to Maria Shriver&#x27;s, Dana Delany&#x27;s or Cindy Crawfords).  But when I let it air dry and don&#x27;t style it, which is 70% of the time (I&#x27;m a mom), it just looks average like most women. With the Instyler I still put in minimal effort (still letting it air dry overnight), but now I get fabulous results after spending 15 minutes styling my hair in the morning with the device. And now the compliments flow more frequently. So the bottom line is that I get great looking hair with the most minimal effort, and that is worth the world to me since I&#x27;m a very low-maintenance person who still wants to look good.    You&#x27;ll get the same results if you blow dry your hair and then use less expensive straighteners and such, which for me would take at least an hour.  To me it&#x27;s worth investing in the InStyler to get the same results in a fraction of the time.    Oh, and it takes a few tries to get it right, but once you do it&#x27;s so easy to use.  This is my first can&#x27;t-live-without hair appliance ever.</li>
            <li> I love the instyler!  I usually have to flat iron my hair and then curl it to get the look I am looking for.  I had a baby this year- so I hardly get to do my hair now... usually I just wash and go.  I got my instyler for christmas and I am sooo impressed!  I can do my hair in 10 minutes and it looks like I took a lot of time to style it!  This product is a winner!</li>
            <li> Wow, those commercials are pretty convincing, huh. Sold me at least. I bought my inStyler a couple months ago really confident it would tame my thick hair. I read directions thouroughly and plugged it in. Sadly, the inStyler sucks. Honestly, my $25 flat iron was more impressive. It didn&#x27;t straighten well and burned my hair even more. It didnt make my hair look sleek, and it kind of made it stick out a little bit.   I will admit to having hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well, but this was a joke. I think it would&#x27;ve looked better if hadn&#x27;t done it at all! It definetly did not curl it or straighten it....... What is the point of this noisy, idiodic, overpriced iron.  DEFINETLY NOT WORTH $100.... I WOULD SAY IT&#x27;S WORTH $1.</li>
            <li> The Instyler has made doing my hair much easier. I am in my 60&#x27;s and have neck and shoulder problems. I can&#x27;t maneuver a brush and dryer for very long. With this I can dry my hair and use the Instyler to do several things. Puff it up where it needs it, straighten out some wild gray hair at my temples and add just enough curve at the bottom to be an attractive semi-pageboy style. There is one thing I read in the instrucions that said: do not use any kind of styling products if using this. Could I have misunderstood what it said? I have a great spray on product I used before drying my hair and loved the results, but without it my hair gets the fly-aways from static &amp; low humidity. I&#x27;d have given it 5 stars if styling products could be used. I&#x27;ll read the instructions again to see if I missed something...but this is a good product and I&#x27;d by it again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Amazon last year and it stopped working while under manufacturer warranty. I contacted the seller but since I did not get a response, the next thing was to contact the manufacturer. The manufacturer is telling me that the seller is not authorized so I need to go via the seller. Isn&#x27;t this precious?    Update: After contacting Amazon &amp; the seller a number of times, they both are not ready to stand behind the warranty due to amazon not being an authorized dealer.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!  It does not work as good as a regular straightener.   Very awkward to hold, to use, and to even lay on your counter.  You need to hold it in your left hand for the roller to roll the correct way.  The roller is noisy and annoying.  Also. It does not heat up as fast as others.   I set it on HIGH and use it.. place it down on the counter and it is already blinking and acting like It needs to heat up again.      Hair didn&#x27;t last nice for long.       They were on the right path with this one... but sadly it just isn&#x27;t good!  Much tweaking is necessary.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THE INSTYLER FOR A YEAR AND I LOVE IT. I HAVE A CURLY HAIR AND I CAN STYLE MY HAIR PERFECTLY AND LOOKS SHINE AND FEEL SOFT. IF MINE STOP WORKING I WILL SURELY ORDER ME A NEW ONE. I DO MY HAIR IN 20 MINUTES. IS THE BEST OF THE BEST. I DONT UNDERSTAND THE BAD REVIEWS. THE ONLY THING THAT I DIDN&#x27;T LIKE WAS THE PRICE. BUT IS JUST PRICELESS!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try this product for about a year but was afraid that it would not live up to the hype on the infomercials and it does not! The 2nd day of using this product the barrel portion broke off and my hair got caught inside of the barrel.  I will be returning this ASAP.  Also, I have several burns on my hand and forehead as it is very easy to get burned, unlike a traditional flat iron where you can hold it and be protected by a handle or plastic covering, this offers you no protection from getting burned. This does make some noise while being used which surprised me, although I could live with the noise if this really was better quality and actually worked! I have thick, naturally wavy hair and did not feel like this ever quite straighened my hair as well as a traditional flat iron, so I cannot imagine how it could work magic on very curly, course hair!</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this would work but I wanted it mainly to use traveling in Europe. The site does not tell you that you can not use product with a voltage converter but the instructions included states do not use with converter so it will not do for me &amp; am returning today.</li>
            <li> ok so...ive been going back and forth about getting this item....i decided against it. lol....but wait, let me tell you why. im an African woman with thick coarse hair.  i know, its all in the heat.  for us blk folks, if we want our hair straight, u have to use something really hot.  most instylers that i researched, only get as hot as 135.  thats nothing.  that will not get our hair straighten. it will just make u angry.  u need something really hot.  check out my other reviews for hot hair items that work.</li>
            <li> This product is not easy to use at all. Does not do what is claims it does on the infomercials either. Very difficult to use as a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Instyler will not honor warranty claims on the product when you purchase it from Amazon, they say they are an unauthorized retailer. My Instyler stopped working after making electrical clicking sounds less than 6 months after purchase. Don&#x27;t waste your money, buy something else.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It&#x27;s long with just a slight wave and she likes it straight.  The InStyler heats up fast and takes no time at all on her hair.  I&#x27;ve tried using it on mine, but haven&#x27;t achieved the look I wanted.  It would be great if you could hold the end of the styler without burning yourself!</li>
            <li> I sent this product back, it was not worth the money, you can buy a roller blow dryer for 20.00 and it does just the same thing.</li>
            <li> I saw the informercial for this product two years ago and asked for it for every gift giving occasion ever since. My husband got it for me this past mother&#x27;s day and what a disappointment! I tried it right away because I was so excited... It does do what it says it will do but a regular ceramic flat iron does the same thing in half the time for a third of the price. A waste of money and time!</li>
            <li> I was very happy to purchase this product at amazon.  The price on t.v. was a bit out of reach for me!  So far... loving the Instyler!!  I&#x27;m african american with a decent grade of hair and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results so far.      It does get hot, but there are heat adjustments on the knob, so you can start off a little cooler than the other settings until you get comfortable with using it.  It comes in a black carrying case to lie it down on when hot, or when you&#x27;re finished using it and it&#x27;s still hot, just carefully place in the bag and it&#x27;s safe from ruining anything else.      Very happy to bought it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I got the instyler for Christmas last year. I had wanted it for a while and so I was really excited to get it. Let me just say that the first one I got was defected, because it just turned off after a few seconds of using it, and would not really straighten anything. So, I ordered a new one. I love it! It works really well and it doesn&#x27;t take that long to straighten my hair. The only real problem I have is that the chord is very short, and the first one I got, the chord was really long, so that&#x27;s disappointing. However, I don&#x27;t have anything other negative comments to make about it. However, just keep in mind that I am comparing this to my old conair flat iron which was just downright terrible. :)</li>
            <li> I finally gave in and bought the InStyler after considering it for over a year and I&#x27;m so glad I did.   I&#x27;ve got wavy/frizzy hair and this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that absolutely straightens without flattening. And my hair is actually shiny after I use it.    Yes, it&#x27;s awkward to use at first and yes, I burned the hell out of my forehead once or twice, but the results make up for the difficulty of use. It heats up quickly and it takes half the time it used to straighten my hair. As long as you use small layers of hair at a time, the InStyler works exactly like it does on the commercial.    I do wish that it had the option to make the barrel spin the other way, but other than that, I would recommend this to anybody who has frizzy hair like mine.</li>
            <li> This thing was so laud and horrible that i thought it was a joke when i got it . Send it back to the seller and on top of that now he claims i never send it back . I wont event keep it for what decoration ? don&#x27;t buy it horrible ........: /</li>
            <li> Got this as a present. Worked great. I have really fine wavy hair and it strengthened it perfectly. Although sometimes I felt like a little girl with the perfect curl at the end. Anyway, fast forward 5 months, I touched the hot barrel of the iron and dropped the instyler on the carpet. It broke immediately. The cap on the end broke off and well the spinning divice then stopped. I emailed the company several times and called asking where I could get replacement parts. Replacement parts, Oh no they do not sell those. Apparently if you burn your hand drop it and want to fix it you must buy a new one. This is not worth buying a new one. Horrible customer service. Sticking to my Chi Straightner which I have had 6 years without one problem! Save your money people!</li>
            <li> I loved my InStyler for the curling and smoothing results, but it has DANGEROUS electrical issues, proven because I purchased 2 of them and other reviewers complain about the same dangers. The first one would NOT turn off from the switch on the unit. I turned it off and left it on my counter, then hours later I touched it and was badly burned. I tested this many times and it was no mistake. The unit stays ON when the switch is OFF. The only way to be sure it cools is to unplug it from the wall. I loved the unit so much, though, I bought another one. Again, as other reviewers report, this one powers itself on and off at will. In the middle of doing my hair it will click off and won&#x27;t go back on until it wants to. Who makes electrical items like this anymore? I&#x27;m sad to say that all the production in China gets us cheaper products but without the quality assurance we expect from US products. I usually don&#x27;t complain, but this unit has chronic DANGEROUS issues and it is NOT cheap. There&#x27;s no excuse for this level of negligence and lack of concern for customer safety. Do not buy it. It should, in fact, be taken off the market for being proven unsafe, as shown by all the complaints about this same electrical problem.</li>
            <li> I had to create this review even though I did not buy it on Amazon because I LOVE this product!!!  I was standing around at Target waiting for my RX to be filled and the Instyler was right there.  I&#x27;ve seen the commercials and wondered if it was as good as they said it was.  I even asked my hairdresser who was not very enthusiastic about it.  On a whim, I bought it, figuring that if I did not like it, I would just return it.  Well, I was blown away by how incredible easy and fun it was to use!  It literally cut styling my hair by half which is everything if you are a working mother trying to get out the door on time!!!  I got so many compliments at work and my husband noticed. . .  I told my coworkers at work and they bought it as well.  We all love it.  Frankly, I was very surprised that it got any negative reviews. . .  It IS a curling iron so it is hot and you will burn yourself if you touch the rod. . . not sure why people are surprised by this fact.  All curling irons will burn you if you touch it!!!  I don&#x27;t consider myself in any way an accomplished hair styler and I was able to use this out of the box with no problems.  I did watch the video before using it so maybe I was better informed.  I found it extremely easy to to get beautiful results in less time than a hair dryer and/or regular curling iron!!!  I always use a heat protector on my hair so I have no issues with dryness or damage.  My hair is silky and shiny.  Bottom line, use common sense and you should get amazing results!  I highly recommend it as I have to all my friends and coworkers!</li>
            <li> I have really thick, wavy/curly hair that tends to frizz.  I;ve used the conair infiniti red colored straighter that worked good, but took away some of the volume so I thought this would help.  The first one I bought at target did nothing for my hair so I exchanged it and the next one I got (the one I (currently own)worked great and made my hair looked shiney and healthy, but right after I washed it I could feel my hair was dryer than before I used it.  I even used a heat protection spray and it didn&#x27;t help much.  I figured I loved the immediate results so I would just torture my hair with it on speacial occasions.  I&#x27;m not going to use this anymore though because each time I use it it make my hair worse and worse.  My hair is now crunchy dry, tons of split ends (which I never had in my life), it is super tangled and when you brush it out to take out the tangles (even softly) broke hairs off, and causes even more split ends.  UHHH, THIS IS LIKE A DRUG! YOU USE IT ONCE AND IT LOOKS GREAT, BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO KEEP USING IT BECAUSE YOUR HAIR WILL LOOK AWFUL IF YOU DON&#x27;T!  AND EVEN WHEN YOU DO IT STILL DOESN&#x27;T LOOK SO GREAT!</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with the Instyler from the 1st day of use. I would suggest this product to anyone looking into purching one. It is so easy to use .</li>
            <li> Love it !!&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair.  This gives me the polissshed look that I want.  Your hair can even be damp to use</li>
            <li> I was able to use the InStyler for 5 minutes...before it broke.  Prior to that, it did not work as was seen on TV.  It did absolutely nothing with my hair...straighten or curl.  Overall, I am very dissapointed with this product and would never recommend it to others!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the INSTYLER!!!! I tried it on my hair (thick medium length) and it works AMAZING. One of my friends has thinnish long hair and it didn&#x27;t work on her hair at all. I love curling my hair with it. I straighten it every day now and I recommend it!! It probably works better with people who have thicker hair like me!</li>
            <li> I have 3 daughters and we all have an instyler. Two of us have thick curly hair and two with thin straight hair. We all love our Instylers!!!</li>
            <li> It worked for 5 minutes outta the box. It turned itself off and never turned on again. This may be a knock off or a fake. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have had frizzy, crazily misshaped hair for years.  I have tried straightening perms and other flat irons.  I have tried everything.  I was skeptical at first and the price scared me a  little at the thought of buying another product that didn&#x27;t work.  I loved this.  Without reading the directions the first time my hair came out good and in 7 minutes.  I was impressed.  The second time i played with this product I watched the instructional video and was amazed.  I used it the way they showed and I have straight perfect hair.  Nobody recognized me.  It was great.I love this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this thing after being suckered in by the infomercial. I have thick semi-wavy hair and this product just did not work for me. it doesnt clamp on tight enough to really smooth the hair, and if you use it on damp hair you have to go over it several times until its dry and it will not dry your roots, feels like a big waste of time, and it exhausts your arm trying to straighten all your hair. i would rather blow dry and smooth with my Chi, it is much better results that way. Also, if you are used to clamping onto your hair with a flat iron you will most likely burn yourself with the instyler because it is very easy to try and grab both sides as you normally would a flat iron, and the spinning side of it is the part that gets hot! I am returning this to Costco tomorrow.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint about the instyler is that the barrel only rotates one way.  It worked for me on my right side (I&#x27;m right handed) but when I did my left side I had to hold it very awkwardly so my hair would go through properly and not backwards and it was far more trouble than it was worth.  (Hard to explain the issue but I hope that makes sense!)  You can do pretty much everything the instyler does with a good straightener.  I might consider giving the instyler another chance if they come out with a button or something that reverses the rotation so it&#x27;s not so awkward.</li>
            <li> I just have to say who ever invented this product is a Genius, this product is good for anyone with Striaght hair or frizzy hair. my hair is not that long but yet it works great on it! i highly recommend it to all women</li>
            <li> I have very thick mostly frizzy hair and have been using a straightner since 7th grade.  This product caught my interest because I wanted something that would reduce the frizz aspect and provide loose curls or other styles that weren&#x27;t just ironing board straight.  The InStyler CAN do some styles with careful practice.  It did straighten my hair very fast, reduced frizz, and I learned to manuver it to create enough body and curl to make my hair look more decent than it has for a while.  There are several drawbacks.  It is LOUD, and I like to do my hair while watching a movie, etc.  This wasn&#x27;t a major issue (though my husband thought so) since it did straighten my thick shoulder length hair in less than a half hour.  Also, the styles possible with this product are greatly exaggerated.  You can do a curl under/flip and curl the ends of any lengths you have, but full blown curls or body in your bangs is not going to happen.  You can not get the InStyler close enough to your scalp to really achieve these styles because it will burn you.  On a lower setting, nothing will happen.  I did burn my forehead pretty badly by accidently tapping it with the InStyler. The flat plate also heats up very hot on the outside, so all of your styling will be with the one hand you are holding it in.  I bought my InStyler less than 8 months ago and it broke this week.  This was with everyday use.  The end of the rotating component just tumbled off and there is no way to get it back on because the washer for the connecting screw just rattles around in the end piece with no way to hold it still.  I had already been considering replacing the InStyler because the bristles had bent and seemed to not be doing their job anymore.  I&#x27;m pretty hard on hair straightners, I must admit, but the InStyler is not a very durable one.  For the price I would recommend avoiding it, buying a normal straightner and a separate curler for any styles you might want to achieve.</li>
            <li> This is the worst product out there! I bought it off TV for my short poofy hair. This made my hair look dead and burnt my ears because there is no gaurd on the end of the hot roller. I bought the bogo free deal and gave the other one to my mother-in-law who has long thick hair. She hated it as well. So I let my sister try it who has longer and thinner hair than me. She also hated it and it burnt her as well.     Do not buy this product and the return process takes a long time and you have to pay for the shipping and handeling there and back!!</li>
            <li> I like the instyler but with my hair short now it isn&#x27;t as good.  it isbetteron longer hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this device at the local BJ&#x27;s and have fallen in love with it. I&#x27;ve got shoulder length hair that&#x27;s frizzy and which is medium heavy in density. Well, normally I look like I have a lions mane of hair that&#x27;s a nightmare and I end up with it in a ponytail. For the past two days, I&#x27;ve managed to flatten and somewhat curl my hair. I go carefully but I&#x27;ve found within 10 to 15 minutes my hair is nice and smooth.     The moving roller seems to work well and I&#x27;ve had no faulty issues with it. I&#x27;m quite happy actually as I normally hate curling irons and usually avoid doing anything to my hair. Normally, I wash it and let it dry for the next day. I never know if I&#x27;ll wake up looking great or awful. :) Now, I always have a way to make it look good. The best part is, I&#x27;ve been able to get away from styling it daily. :)     I would definitely buy this again.     I must say though - don&#x27;t buy this device if you have really short hair. It&#x27;s not designed for super short hair. Also, Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply sells a glove to protect your hand so you can wrap hair around the iron without burning yourself.    Monica</li>
            <li> This was all my daughter wanted for her Birthday. What a huge disapointment. Its squeaks so loud. Hard to handle. Shuts off if your hair is tiny bit thick. DONT WAIST YOU MONEY!!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and it is straight.  I get more compliments on my hair now since using the InStyler.  It is much fuller and gives  it more body.  The only thing I can say is that I have trouble getting use the using only one hand.  You can&#x27;t touch the iron anywhere to hold.  But I am getting better at using it.</li>
            <li> I saw the commercials and thought it would be easier than a flat iron.  Maybe because my hair isn&#x27;t really thick or curly, but the InStyler didn&#x27;t really straighten my hair.   It took a long time to heat up, and would cool off while I used it.  Definitely not worth the $99.00 price tag, even with the 20% discount.  I&#x27;ll be going back to my $25.00 Flat iron.</li>
            <li> I thought it was okay.  I bought it because I wanted to use it for straightening and curling.  It curls good and does add a lot of volume but it doesn&#x27;t straighten that well on my hair.  I also only had it for a couple months and it broke.  It will no longer rotate but it still turns on and gets hot.  You can tell it is very cheap quality when you get it.</li>
            <li> The product heats up quick and straightens curly hair but leave it dull and dry looking, basically it burns the hair. I gave it the 2 stars because it straightens and heats up quickly. I do not recommend the product for curly or straight hair.</li>
            <li> I just used my InStyler for the first time and I&#x27;m a believer.  The motor that people complain about really isn&#x27;t that loud at all.  My hair is thin but frizzy.  It lays very flat and no matter what I just can&#x27;t get any good volume on my hair.  The InStyler took a little while to learn how to use, but once I got the knack of it my hair has a shape and smoothness like I&#x27;ve never had before.    I rated it only four stars because of the fact that it took some time to figure out how to get the back of my head without my hair getting snagged, and the fact that they don&#x27;t provide anything to put it down on while it&#x27;s hot.  I rent so it would be a bad idea to let the sink get scorched :)    Otherwise it&#x27;s a nice product and I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll be spending a lot of time together.</li>
            <li> My daughter was excited to get this after seeing all the advertising.  She was very disappointed after receiving it.  The iron was bulky to use and made a lot of noise.  She found that it made her hair frizzy rather than straight.  We sold it after only 2 uses and went with a Chi.  She is much happier.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  It smooths out my hair better than any other straightner I&#x27;ve tried before.  I have thick, wavy hair with a fine texture.  I have a feeling if your hair is course, or if it is very curly it might not work as well.  With my hair texture, I have to seperate and pin back my hair into 10 - 12 sections on the top and straighten with a hair dryer on the bottom.  It works well and takes about 30 min.  If your hair is very curly, It may take longer, or you may have to section the bottom part of your hair as well.</li>
            <li> The company does not stand by their product!  I purchased it last year for a Christmas present and in less then a year it has fallen apart and they refused to do anything about it!!! Don&#x27;t buy this!!</li>
            <li> I just bought the Instyler and have only used it a couple of times, but I already love it.  I have very coarse, frizzy hair and it really smooths it out.  I have long hair and was afraid it would be hard to manage, but it glides through my hair very easily.  You do have to section your hair, but you can use bigger sections than I thought you would be able to.</li>
            <li> I used it once, and I basically had to continually run this product over strands of my hair until it got the slightest bit of straight.   The rotater is not hot enough. It does run through your hair very smoothly without any friction, but it doesnt get it as straight as it claims that it does, and THATS A PROMISE..  For $80, you can get a hair straightener about 100x better than this one, believe me. Do not blow your money on this product, you have been warned. Use your $80 towards a hair straightener that actually works and is worth $80. Not this piece of junk...</li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong.  I love this product!!! BUT...if you have the money to just go out and buy it off the shelf..DO IT.  They end up charging you close to 28.00 just to ship the things and it&#x27;s cheaper to go the other route, although you probably can&#x27;t get 2 instylers for the same amount of money so I guess technically it all works out.  But as far as the product itself, it&#x27;s very good.  I had to send one of mine back because it wouldnt rotate properly but the other works great and they are supposed to be sending me a replacement for the other one.</li>
            <li> The product is made well but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. The company was prompt in delivery and it arrived in great condition. However I have long thick hair the spinning cylinder caught my hair in it and pulled it out, even when I reduced the amount of hair I was trying to straighten. It didn&#x27;t close tight enough to iron the hair. And it hurt like heck when it pulled my hair out!   Sorry not for me.</li>
            <li> I got this for christmas and absolutely love it!!  I have naturally curly hair and never can find a product that works well for straightening, always just ended up using a larger barrel curling iron that ultimately damages my hair.  Granted I have only used my instyler twice but I dont know how I lived with out it, It is fabulous! It straightens with just one pass through my hair and leaves my hair straight smooth and soft!  I am hoping that after discontinued use of the regular curling iron that my hair shows less damage.  However, I do have to say that even my dry split ends looked healthier and smoother after using the InStyler.  I am usually skeptical of any infomercial products but this one is great! A collegue of mine had used it on her neice&#x27;s thick naturally curly hair and it worked wonders!  I give this product 5 stars and hope they decide to make them in various barrel sizes for everyone to be able to experience this wonderful product! KUDOS!</li>
            <li> This hair straightener does not do anything that a much cheaper, store bought hair straightener can&#x27;t do.  It works alright, but it isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li> I was SO Excited to get the In-Styler.  I have &#x27;baby&#x27; hair.  The initial results are GREAT.  But fifteen minutes later, you&#x27;d never know I have an In-Styler.  Sadly, that has been my experience, even with &#x27;tons&#x27; of product in my fine, straight, graying-blonde hair.  A friend with &#x27;tons&#x27; of hair that has Great Body, has had wonderful results.    Good Luck.</li>
            <li> I bought the Instyler Rotating Hot Iron Hair Straightener for my 18 year old grand-daughter.  She has been styling her hair since she was very young.  I thought this would be a great addition to her other styling tools and gave it to her for Christmas.  After trying it on both dry and wet hair she decided that her blow dryer, curling irons and hot rollers worked way better than this product. We were both disappointed to say the least.  I had been thinking about buying one for myself and have since decided not to.  I ended up giving it to a friend who was about to buy one.  Hope it works for her!     The best thing about this acquisition was purchasing through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what the doctor ordered. My wife loves this item in fact my two daughters are going to get themselves one.</li>
            <li> I bought the instyler 1 week ago and returned it one week after, i have thick coarse hair and it DID NOT straighten my hair, contacted customer service and they said it&#x27;s a treatment and use it a few more time, if i wanted treatment i would go to a salon, my hair was still poofy and when i sent it back they charged me 19.99 for them sending it to me, they dont disclose all this on there add, pleased don&#x27;t purchase this product, you will regret it, off course they wouldn&#x27;t post negative reviews on their website so customers can see the truth.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and have to do it in sections.  The InStyler doesn&#x27;t dry my hair as fast as other flat irons I have used.  Also, I find it hard to make sure I am putting in on the section with the barrel spinning the right direction.</li>
            <li> I would not know what to do without my Instyler.  It makes it fast and easy to get my hair done in minutes.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift for mother&#x27;s day and was excited to try it since i have frizzy hair.  I was so disappointed in its performance, though.  The Remington wet iron i own works far better than this at straightening hair and reducing frizz.  Additionally, the wet iron is a lot easier to use and much safer.    Even more frustrating, however, is the propensity the instyler has to burn the user.  The instyler came with a very small and optional guard, which i installed because i always try to be cautious when trying out a new product.  The guard, however, gives a false sense of security and actually increases your likelihood to burn yourself because it appears that the guard will protect you, but in reality, the guard is located on the top of the iron, not the side where you are most likely to burn yourself.    Both my daughter and I now have horrible burns where the instyler touched our skin.  The instyler is so hot that it burns more quickly than any other iron i have used and by the time you feel the burn, it is way too late.  I had a second degree burn and my daughter got a third degree burn that left an ugly scar on her forehead.  I&#x27;m surprised this iron is allowed to remain on the market!    Please pay attention to all the negative reviews and save yourself the money and protect your skin by using a better straightening iron!</li>
            <li> This iron is very akward to handle and I did not like it at all, also very damaging to the hair, leaving it dried out.  I sent it back.  My friend felt the same way about hers, but still continued to use it, because it does make her hair straight, but now she says her hair has split ends and looks damaged, but it&#x27;s too late for her to send hers back.</li>
            <li> This is such a versatile product that you can go from wavey to straight hair.  I have naturally curly hair, and have worn it for the longest time in a curly style.  I wanted something different, but did not want to totally straighten my hair.  This is perfect because it is a straightener if that is what you want, and it can give you lovely waves if that is what you desire.  With a rotating curling iron on one side, and a brush on the other side, it gives you such a smooth look. It gives you great height on your crown by overextending while using it.  Great explanations on how to use it for different hairstyles.  May I warn you ladies beward of the tips of your ears while using this product.  Mine got a tad bit crispy the first time I used it. It can be a little difficult rotating your hand if its waves you want.  As far as I am conceerned you can throw away your curling iron and your hair straightener and use only the Instyler.  Great price on Amazon.  When you buy directly from the Instyler site, you get two, but that is no great bargain.  Since Amazon has one for half the price, if you really need two of them, just buy two from Amazon, and it will cost the same as buying directly from the site.  I doubt if many women need two of them.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Have to use as directed with 2 - 3\\&quot; strands of dry hair without any products applied.  I have very frizzy hair and lots of it so it takes a little time (but lots less than blow dry styling with a round brush followed by flat iron).  Negates need for expensive hair products for straightening and smoothing hair so will pay for itself in no time.  Best of all, my arms don&#x27;t ache after styling my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all curling/straightening irons, it gets hot so practice proper precautions when heating it up and when using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is the cover to use for packing or storing. It&#x27;s hard to use when iron is hot and doesn&#x27;t hold the iron in a fully closed position.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my InStyler for 2 years now.  I keep one at home and am now buying another one to leave at work.  It&#x27;s great for styling my hair when the weather is humid.</li>
            <li> First of all, get it at a store (sorry, Amazon!). Makes returns far easier.    Bottom Line at the Top: You can buy a good curling iron AND a good flat iron for the price of this ONE equally damaging, awkward, not-so-versatile, breakable thing. Reviews show that it does a good job on coarser hair that needs the bristles but if you can detangle your hair with a normal brush, this thing is pointless.    Awkward + heavy. Not sure why this thing is promoted as \\&quot;the tool that won&#x27;t damage your hair like regular hot irons\\&quot;. It&#x27;s HOT! And b/c it&#x27;s maybe not as hot as most, you have to go slower and more than once on smaller sections. Isn&#x27;t that the same? Or worse? My wavy/curly/frizzy fine-but-voluminous hair remains quite frizzy at the ends no matter what I do. Hair looks like a used up broom. Forget about the curling -waves, at best. No traction for thinner bangs. The only thing I can say is that my hair seems a bit less susceptible to humidity and thus, the style lasts longer (even till I wash despite sleeping on it or breaking a sweat on a hot day). HOWEVER, I think it does that by DRYING IT OUT (which explains why my split-ends got worse). I really do not see that \\&quot;polish\\&quot; or \\&quot;shine\\&quot; they rave about. And your hair has to be completely dry. Well, if I blow-dry my hair, I can often do a good enough job to use my usual straight-iron as a touch up - saving on damage and leaving in more bounce. You can&#x27;t do that with this  sucker. It&#x27;s not a touch-up tool. And the motor is flimsy. Would surely break in no time if I didn&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> When has a product from an infommercial ever worked like it did on TV? The Instyler did straighten my hair which was the reason I bought it but it was nothing like the results seen on TV. The cuticle of my hair was still frizzy, so I still look like a puff ball after all the time spent straightening with the Instyler. I went back to my standard flat iron to get the smooth cuticle I thought I would get with the Instyler.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even want to rate this as a 1 star...this piece of crap is not worth the money spent on it...used 4 times, then stopped working...SAVE YOUR MONEY...BUY A CHI!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the InStyler for almost a year &amp; I love it! I use it almost everyday.... usually to straighten my hair, but sometimes I use it for loose curls as well (I have long hair). The best part about it is that it gives great volume without burning my hair. The only drawback would be that I feel like I need to always uplug it because it always feels slightly warm if I leave it plugged.</li>
            <li> This product really does straighten the hair.  I received it in record time and it performs as advertised. I have very short curly hair and my bangs tend to curl up into little sausages after one day. This in styler is a wonderful product..better then any straightener iron. It also leaves the hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased as a gift and stopped working only after @ 30 days. I am not happy with the performance of this item nor am I happy the the ease of trying to exchange this item at Amazon. I want a replacemet sent and I do not want to be charged for it.  I have the old one and you are welcome to have it back to test or whatever so this dosen&#x27;t happen to other folks.    Signed,    James A. Brown</li>
            <li> This tool is just too hot, even at the lowest setting, for my hair.  I have a lot of hair, but it is super fine.  The grip is also too big for my short fingers to handle safely...it does not fit in my hand securely as I try to style.  I have not had the mechanical problems that have disappointed others.  I gave my \\&quot;free\\&quot; InStyler to the the woman who actually does my hair.  She makes my hair look fantastic, but agrees that it is too much heat for my hair to use daily.  Her hair is long and thick, but she also does not like the effects of the excessive heat on her hair.  And yes...it does BURN at the slightest, briefest touch to the skin!!</li>
            <li> i would love to return this to the person i bought it from it does not work as much as i paid for it the barrel should turn like it is supposed too</li>
            <li> My hair is frizzy from a previous old perm on my ends and I could never get my hair to lay straight.  It is at the \\&quot;in between\\&quot; stage between long and short.  I purchased this product for my ends and my hair looked longer and straighter, laying flat.  I had so many compliments from friends and clients that I feel this product was well worth the investment I made on purchasing it!  Amazon offered it at the cheapest price and I could not be happier!  I rate this as a 5 star product and wish I had bought it sooner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to read the reviews by those who didn&#x27;t have good luck with the Instyler, because it has completely revitalized my look.  I&#x27;m a \\&quot;mature\\&quot; gal with curly, frizzy grey hair and was feeling very frumpy until I bought the Instyler (I bought \\&quot;the original\\&quot;).  Yes, it is a hot iron and you have to be careful.  Mine came with a plastic guide that holds it away from your face, like training wheels.  As for rotating in just one direction, I use it in both directions and it seems to work either way, surprisingly enough.  I found blow-drying and other flatirons difficult to use and usually gave up, but the Instyler is so easy and gives such good results, I do it all the time.  For the first time in my life I have straight silky hair and I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner!  It&#x27;s like a miracle!  Only negative is Amazon (ahem) raised the price, but I still would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product has no protection from the heated portion.  The round portion of the styler is the part that goes toward your body if you want your hair to either be straight or to curl in a little, as I was looking to do.  That is the portion that heats.  There&#x27;s nothing on the outside of that protecting from the heat.  When you take the item and put it near your hair, you are really close to your body.  I have shorter strands of hair near the front of my head and, when I went to straighten those, I burned my forehead.  I burned my hand once by accident.  And when I went to straighten the side near my ear, I burned my neck.  Even on the lowest setting, this is a very hot product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying it the first time and suffering two burns, I assumed (stupidly) that it was just a matter of being more careful.  This was why I tried the product again and burned myself twice.  I then decided that was enough.  The product works only moderately well.  Yes, it straightens my hair, but it makes it a little fly-away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other straighteners in the past without ever getting burned.  This is a good concept, but it needs work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, however, that I like Amazon.  I explained to them what I did not like about the product.  They sent me a return shipping label and they are taking it back for me.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am not at all pleased with this purchase.  I read all of the reviews (did my homework) and decided to try this product because I have been searching for a way to make it easier to dry/straighten/curl my hair.  I have very fine, below the shoulder hair.  I consider myself to be reasonably agile but this product was so cumbersome that it was almost impossible to use with ease.  The likelyhood of burning yourself is very real!!  To top it all off--it doesn&#x27;t work! My hair remained poofy after much labor.  This product is expensive when compared to other straighteners, so I am really angry at myself for this purchase.  Meanwhile, I&#x27;m back using my flat iron.  Do yourself a favor. Ignore the hype. Save your money!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this and finally banish my hot rollers. I have heard so many wonderful things.  Well....it was a waste of money. I have long hair on the fine side. I had to take HUGE sections of hair (practically half of the side of my head)to fit in the barrel - and even then it would slide right thru without any traction at all - no matter how hard I squeezed it together. I don&#x27;t have super baby fine hair...so, this was ridiculous. So, I give it 1 star because it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure that the model I purchased from Amazon is an older model.  My sister bought one retail and we found some definate differences.  We both have very frizzy, very curly hair and find that this tool does the trick.  Never have we been able to let our hair dry and then iron it to controlled.  With this tool we can.  It is very hot and applies heat from both sides.  The rotating head on mine works rather intermitently and the whole unit sometimes shuts is self off.  It has never failed to come back on after pressing the power button to bring it back to life. Bottom line, it is a great tool and a great design, it could just be built better.  Especially for a $100 investment, it should be better quality.  I hope they improve the quality in the future because I will definately want to use this tool for a long time.</li>
            <li> It turned itself off after ~ 90 seconds and made a buzzing noise. I returned it for a refund.</li>
            <li> Excellent product !  Easy to use - great results !  Just as advertised.  Great Amazon price - best I&#x27;ve seen</li>
            <li> The InStyler is a product I&#x27;d always thought would be just an overpriced curler/straightener like all the others I&#x27;ve discarded, even though the commercials and infomercials seemed to show otherwise.  I remained skeptical until my boss came in after Christmas break with smooth, \\&quot;I just went to the salon and spent hours and $$$ to look this way\\&quot; hair... and for a week, it was the same.  I finally asked her what she&#x27;s been doing differently, and she said her husband bought her an InStyler for Christmas and she LOVES it.  She brought it for me to try the next day.  I was on 2nd day CURLY hairsprayed hair, so I thought, \\&quot;Nahhh... not today!\\&quot;, but she encouraged me to try it.  I brushed the hairspray out of my hair and went right to fixing my hair.  It looked great!  And it took such a little amount of time!  So, my husband went and bought an InStyler for me that night, and I showered and let my hair air dry most of the way, then used the InStyler, and my hair was AMAZINGLY full, not frizzy, pretty, tamed, and AWESOME in just a few minutes.  I&#x27;ve not used ANYTHING but my InStyler since that day!  I use it every morning, NEVER blow-dry my hair, just use the InStyler when my hair is mostly dry.  I always condition and use Chi serum or Coconut oil in my hair daily... I&#x27;m a blonde with very fine hair.      Until last week, my daughter had waist-length hair, and it worked wonderfully on her hair, too.  She donated 11 inches of hair to Locks of Love last week, leaving her with hair a little longer than shoulder-length hair and it works SO well with it now, too... probably even better than before.  At any rate, it&#x27;s a fabulous product for us.  YMMV!</li>
            <li> I have read lots of negative feedback on the Instyler. My girlfriend has thick curly hair(Italian), and she has nothing but great things to say about it. Actually she works at a daycare and already has two other women looking to buy this product. So in my girlfriend praises this product simply because if you have curly hair, you can straighten her hair in half the time.</li>
            <li> I like the InStyler a lot, however the unit shipped to me was defective. The rolling heater part was turning slowly and had a grinding sound. Fortunately I had used one that worked previous, so I knew my product was not working properly. I sent it back, got my refund quickly and just ended up going to Bed, Bath, and Beyond to get one. I didn&#x27;t want to wait for another one to be shipped, take the chance that it would be defective again and have to return it. The one I got from BB&amp;B did not have the canvas storage bag, however. Plus I paid more. Oh well. At least it works well.</li>
            <li> I bought the InStyler for my girlfriend for her birthday. She loved it. It was everything that she hoped for. I ordered it and recieved it in the time that they said I would. I came in a new box with instructions for diffrent styles and now she uses it everyday. She loves it!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering from amazon, I ordered my Instyler on 1/30 and received it 2/3. I didn&#x27;t actually try it till 2/6 and it worked but after 5 minutes it stopped working. I immediately emailed stonewall with the problem and received an immediate response considering it was the weekend. Now I&#x27;m just waiting for the return label so they can send me a new instyler. This is one of the reasons why I don&#x27;t buy online but we&#x27;ll see how this works out for me. I&#x27;ll give an update soon...</li>
            <li> This really does work.  I have trouble with my hands and fatigue.  I thought this would be an alternative to style my long hair without having to cut it to make it easier.  I was right, this takes half the time is does to style with a round brush and hair dryer.  It does the work for me so I&#x27;m not worn out by the time I&#x27;m done with my hair.  It&#x27;s not any more clunky than anything else I&#x27;ve used and is light.  It does make some noise but not a lot.  It&#x27;s not so much that it bothers me and I&#x27;m sensitive to noise.  Overall I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> For a straight haired gal whose hair sticks out at all angles, I have found the instyler to turn my locks under neatly. I wish I had know that the iron could be a bit cumbersome to maneuver, but practice is helping. I still have a little difficulty with the back of my head. I would recommend this produce to others who have chin length straight hair like mine.</li>
            <li> Used this the first time tonight-wow my hair looks awesome! No frizz and not limp straight like using a flatiron.  A little tricky to get the hang of but if I can handle it ANYONE can! Only burned myself once-I am using the guard. Worth it!  PS-Forgot to say that my hair is a pretty long, very curly and a frizz bomb. I did use TIGI Catwalk Prep first.</li>
            <li> I received the instyler very quickly which was great, it didn&#x27;t power up at first and when it did, it wouldn&#x27;t stay on so I was told to send it back and they would replace it. I sent it back (at my cost) and received insyler #2 which does turn on but has no power to turn the cylinder. Very poor quality for the money. I can&#x27;t afford to keep sending them back. I will continue to use a flat iron or regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> I bought mine at Wal-mart knowing I could return if it did not live up to the hype. Well, it DID!  I have bra strap length hair. It is layered but the longest layer is only about 2 - 3\\&quot; from the bottom. I have very thick, very tight waves (had loose waves about 10 yrs ago, how it happened I don&#x27;t know)and is color-treated every six weeks.  I have always received compliments on my hair, usually only after it has been freshly washed.  Once I sleep on it, my hair is very hard to brush so it always goes up in a pony tail. The only time it is down is after it is washed or I re-wet it. I was totally cutting it before I bought the instyler.  I am so sick of cleaning out my brush and giving the vacuum cleaner rollers a hair cut.  I am guessing it takes 20 - 25 min to straighten my hair with the instyler (sometimes I did a section 3 times although it didn&#x27;t need it).  I absolutely love how my hair looks.  It&#x27;s shiny, straight and has body.  I feel like I lost 20 lbs of hair! I have read a lot of the reviews here and I have not had any of the negative issues. It&#x27;s not loud, it has a motor so it will have some sound.  A hair dryer is way louder!  My hair did not get stuck, ever. I use it on the highest setting and have not seen any damage to my hair.  A colleague at work was so impressed with the job it did on my hair, she went and purchased one.  I did my daughter&#x27;s nape length hair and she looks like she got a new hair cut; she loves it! So I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be returning this to Wal-mart.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I decided against purchasing the Instyler! After reading all the negative posts regarding this product I purchased a similar knock off product instead. Almost all the complaints about the Instyler say that its cheaply made and does have technical problems. On the official webiste they are being sold for almost $190 which is really ridiculous for a poorly made product(that is a rip off). That explains the company tricking you into having to purchase two with their \\&quot;buy 1, get 1 free\\&quot; gimick. I truly appreciate this website for allowing consumers to research what their purchasing before hand, its truly worth it to know exactly what your buying! Thanks Guys for saving me $190!    [[ASIN:B002L5THSI The Original InStyler Rotating Hot Iron Hair Straightener]]</li>
            <li> Negatives: It gets AWFULLY HOT!!  (Do not allow young children to use.)  Appears not to be made for fine hair (although the commercial I saw said it was) as it doesn&#x27;t seem to grasp and hold it well unless you have a put a large amount of hair in it.  When you release the barrel, your hair is VERY hot and tends to hang straight.    Positives: I live in SC, it&#x27;s very humid.  Even though it doesn&#x27;t put much curl or lift in my hair, my hair remains \\&quot;frizz free\\&quot; and doesn&#x27;t go totally limp as happens with a curling iron or styling brush.  I guess that makes it worth having.</li>
            <li> For those reviewers who said they couldn&#x27;t use the InStyler because the barrel only rotates in one direction--you didn&#x27;t figure out the secret. It doesn&#x27;t matter which way it rotates. You just use the tool like a flat iron by slowly running it through your hair. The curl is created by the way you manage the styler, not by the way it rotates. If the barrel is placed underneath the hair, the hair curves under. If the barrel is placed on top of the hair, the hair flips out. You control the direction and tightness of the curl by the technique you use. I think if you want tight curls, you should use a curling iron. But this works great for waves and curves. I love my flat iron, but don&#x27;t like the way it left my hair totally straight. I have naturally curly and frizzy hair and I love the InStyler for natural curves and no frizz!</li>
            <li> I purchased from infomercial.  I love the way it gives body, especially when you \\&quot;back curl\\&quot; for crown area for height.  BIG PROBLEM is that it quits working between 2-6 months.  I have been through the TWO (2) I bought in about a years time, because they both just stopped working one day. It would be worth the money if only they would work at least a year!!!</li>
            <li> Was a gift and the person really likes it.  Had one before and used it a lot.  This is a replacement.</li>
            <li> This Rotating Hot Iron works just fine.  But, I was not able to get it to fix my hair as advertised on TV.</li>
            <li> ive heard many good things about this product im going to get it. if i dont like it, ill return it</li>
            <li> this is okay... not as i thought it would be, i don&#x27;t use it anymore because i dont feel it does anything for my hair... my hair doesnt come out straight down and silky like the informercials ... i always have to restraighten with my normal flat iron...it did make alot of noise-but that didnt really bother me..overall its not that great, but i guess it depends on your hair type..</li>
            <li> This is an AWESOME product. I&#x27;m African American and I have used MANY products to straighten my hair, like blowing it out with a hair dryer, flat irons, hot combs and this was the first time that I&#x27;ve done my own hair and LOVED the result and had it looking somewhat better than how the Salon does it!  Yes!  The Only thing I Don&#x27;t like-- and it&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault-- I guess-- Is that it doesn&#x27;t really get the roots.  So my hair looks really nice and shiny and straight on the outside but it&#x27;s hard to straighten the roots with this kind of appliance... Only time I can honestly say my hair is straight from the roots to the ends is when I&#x27;ve just gotten a relaxer... but beware if you&#x27;re going to use this product 1-2 weeks before your touch up lol</li>
            <li> I am always willing to try something new specially if it will make my life easier however this was just not that type of product.  i have medium length hair,a soft curl, and not a lot of hair, thin too.  i tried the Instyler because a friend had it and she was not using it, I thought maybe I could make use of it,,WRONG! It just doesnt give you a smooth straightening. my hair just looked flat.  I use good products on my hair and I can assure you this not one of them.  I cant believe some people gave this 5 stars I would really like to see their hair (before &amp; after). if you&#x27;re still curious...buy it but make sure you can return with a full refund.  Also, I straighten my hair every week once or twice and do it with a REVO-Styler this was also an info mercial item.  i bought it years ago and I love it howver, its not made anymore.</li>
            <li> When I had a demonstration at the store the lady spent a while for a curl to form. But I thought I would give this a try anyway... This was even worse on my own. Didn&#x27;t wor for me at all.. I have very fine hair. The brush has almost no bristles and they are super short, so nothing grabbed. I had to spend so much time for one curl it was ridiculous!   Plus, the whole thing is really heavy on the wrist since you are lifting a curler (round iron) and the heavy metal flat part (brush side). Very hard to manipulate a twist at the wrist and lift.   Also I felt that the metal was very damaging to the hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter got me this on Amazon for Christmas last year.  I tried it, it didn&#x27;t work for me, was cumbersome, just didn&#x27;t like it.  So it sat in the bedroom for a year, and I decided to sell it on ebay.  Tre Milano had my auction pulled off ebay 3 times and would not reply why.  Ebay told me not to relist it.  Also, someone stole my credit card last year and ordered one of these (sent to me), weird, but ok, so I called Tre Milano who charged my card the same day (I get emails when charges are made to this card).  They would not stop the processing of the order, even though it had not shipped.  I had to file a chargeback against them and refuse the item when it arrived, rather than having them just stop the shipment in the first place.  This company STINKS, and so does the product!</li>
            <li> Alot of these reveiws are basesd on women who use the product or men who used the product and wont admit to that,  So what do i think of this since im the one who bought it for a gift for my girlfriend,  Let me start by saying it&#x27;s one of the the gifts she loves and she looks great !!!  More importently she has cofidence with &amp; her self esteem is on the highest level and at the same time she feels sexy (which works in my favor)  i really think this is a perfect gift for any guy to buy a women,  It&#x27;s something we both enjoy :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 10 months and love it for its ease of use and it actually works! Based on all the reviews I was afraid it was going to be another addition to my hairstyling junk yard. I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance because my daughter and I both use it to straighten our long hair (about 6 inches below shoulders). My daughter&#x27;s hair has a fine to normal texture with a slight wave with no frizz but tangles easy. It also works great on my medium texture frizzy hair which has somewhat of a wave. If I let my hair dry naturally, it just looks parched and frizzy. However, I do not have thick hair and it takes me less than 10 minutes to use. I use it right after I blow dry my hair. Work from the inside of your hair to the outer part. For each section of hair, I run it through twice - barrel side out first to smooth down the outer frizzies and then run it through the same section of hair a second time with the barrel side inside curling it under at the ends giving my hair some body. I always use the highest heat setting. Be careful, it gets very hot. My son tripped on the cord and the iron touched his calf and burned him bad!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, but it is also easy to burn yourself so be careful. The InStyler is okay, but way too expensive.</li>
            <li> Been wanting it for over a year--used amazon gift cards to purchase.  It straightens but to an extreme frizziness on me.  I have thick curly med long hair and wanted a different look now and then but think I&#x27;d like to try the Chi as this was a big waste of money</li>
            <li> I used this brush once and it didnt really get hot and when I tried to use it again it would not heat up or the roller would not return, they will not replace it due to me throwing away the original box. i dont see that where that matters, they cant resell something that is broken. I will never buy from this company again if they cant replace something that was broke and they wont refund or resend another item, that was hard earned money that i wasted.</li>
            <li> I have only had the instyler a short while and it fell apart. I contacted the place where I made my purchased for a refund and never heard anything back. DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> I have wrestled with so many hair products and straighteners and rollers and so on and so on ---- but no more. I watched a beautiful Hispanic woman style her hair with and InStyler at a fashion show we were both in recently, and I was sold. I ordered one, and I have thrown away all of the other tools that claimed to do what the InStyler does do. The InStyler makes your hair silky and smooth or wavy or curly - whatever your mood. It is expensive, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have curly thick course hair thats very hard to tame. So I am always looking for a better way to straighten and style my hair. i currently have an ISO ceramic 1\\&quot; flat iron that works pretty well. At first I was skeptical about trying the instyler, but I finally caved hoping it would work better then my current iron. It does not. It straightens but it creates more frizz than my ISO which only cost me $40. To me this iron seemed to be singing my hair a bit too. I had to use it on the high setting or it would not straighten my hair and on hi my hair singed a bit. Their claims that you will not burn your hair are false. All in all my ISO straightner is much better and much better constucted too. My suggestion is save a buck and buy a regular flat iron which can do all the thinks the instyler claims for less money.</li>
            <li> I bought this idem brand new for my girlfriend for her birthday, she absolutely loves it! But then it broke. I called Instyler company and they said because it was bought on Amazon the original 1 yr warrantee is not valid. Then I called Amazon and they said because it was purchased over 2 months ago we can only give you 50% back. Oh and I am still waiting on the money back. I plan to buy a new one for her, from a authorized retailer that has the 1 year warrantee. Hope this helps. Great product, make sure you buy it from a authorized dealer.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I bought my Instyler, but the item came incomplete. It had neither the heat resistant pad or the travel bag that was advertised on the video and was said that it was suppose to come with the item. I called the customer service and not only was the person I spoke to incredibly rude, but after I asked to speak to a manager I was even more offended. After paying $100 for my Instyler the only solution they gave me was to either buy another Instyler, or buy a heat resistant pad from them, even though it was suppose to be with the product I had already bought. They also said that the retailer we bought it from packages the product themselves (which is blatantly false information) and because they \\&quot;package the product\\&quot; they could open another Instyler and take the heat resistant pad from another box -a ridiculous solution. The Instyler customer service does not support their product, nor do they attempt to even be cordial to their customers. Instead of attempting to help resolve problems due to their false advertising, they attempt to wipe their hands of any problem their product may have.</li>
            <li> My first unit was faulty - did not light up (hence can&#x27;t say much about its quality ctrl - 1 star) - however, the vendor replaced the unit quickly and the 2nd unit has had no problems to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impressions:  Great looking until you pick it up.  It is much lighter than you think, the casing being plastic &amp; rod aluminium?&lt;br /&gt;The plastic switch moves around in it&#x27;s groove when lightly touched - hence could be sturdier.  You will find there are 3 settings - Low . Med . High indicated by the number of bars that light up under the transparent switch - this commensurate the number of \\&quot;presses on the switch\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rod heats up rapidly, so a real time saver.&lt;br /&gt;**CAUTION THOUGH: the rod gets REALLY HOT - so be careful especially around the ears!!! Don&#x27;t sear them.** Not a safe design in this regard (exposed rod)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TO USE: Place the strands of hair between the tongs and you will find that as you clutch/hold the tongs together, the rod begins to rotate, polishing the hair against the brush on the other side.  Works effectively &amp; v quickly (in seconds) in the place of having your hair in rollers (eeeeK! never!) and gets one ready for appointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This is FOR STYLING - NOT for drying your hair. The latter would take to long and you risk damaging your hair. To style each curl takes mere seconds say 5-7secs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the high heat element, I do/would not use this often and do so SPARINGLY. Though claims are that it would not damage your hair ... it&#x27;s better to be safe than sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this? ... mmm.</li>
            <li> Guys, this product is not perfect. It is flawed in many ways,  *It has a loud motor, nothing you can&#x27;t get used to though.  *It gets extremely hot, but InStyler has created this shield for all new InStylers that you just snap onto the rotating iron that reduces the risk of burning yourself.  *It&#x27;s bulky, takes time to get used to  *IT&#x27;S NOT FOR EVERYONE, BUT THIS PRODUCT DOES WORK!  I personally have thick wavy hair, and this iron does wonders for me. The rotating bristles helps to smooth while straighten your hair, it does all the work of combing for you. You&#x27;ll notice how much work you put in using a regular hair straightener versus using the InStyler.   Every product that induces heat on your hair will damage it, which is why it&#x27;s wise to always use thermal protectant sprays. I use CHI&#x27;s Iron Guard spray with the InStyler and my split ends are kept at the absolute minimal.  For the people who give this product a chance and patiently take the time to understand how to work around the flaws, results will show!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair - very curly!  This made my hair stick straight, super soft and it stayed for 3 days (until I had to wash it).  It works wonderful, is SO easy and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> well this straightner works well for me. Though at first it would just make my hair a frizzy mess. I ended up cutting the top half of my hair into layers since that seems to be the only part that gets uncontrolably wavy and frizzy and now my hair is beautiful. Once my friend asked me if i had gone to a salon to get my hair done and i told her no i cut my own hair and used the instyler and she wouldnt believe me. I recommended it to one of my other friends who also has hair  frizzines.</li>
            <li> Oh wow! I never buy things from an infomercial but i had to do something for my hair. its thick and course and wavy, I had a wet/dry straightner by revlon that I bought new for $40.00, when I left that at a hotel I decided to try the instyler. I bought a slightly used one off ebay for $40.00 and took a chance. IT IS THE BEST! It usually takes me an hour to straighten slightly damp hair. With the instyler it took me 20 minutes to completely dry and straighten my towel dried hair. And my hair is so soft and shiny! If you add up 40 minutes at least 3 times a week think about how many hours and days of my life this thing is saving me! If mine ever breaks I will GLADLY pay full price for a new one now that I know how great it is!</li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t read the many reviews that encouraged people to be patient and DO NOT expect this to work like your flat iron, I would have returned it immediately.  I almost did.  Then I decided not to compare it to something it was not.  Took my time, got used to it and now it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever discovered for my hair.    I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now and it&#x27;s amazing.  It used to be a major undertaking to straighten my hair and now it&#x27;s \\&quot;cake\\&quot;!  I have long hair (quite a few inches past my shoulders) and if I start with dry hair, I can get it done in 15 minutes max.  My hair looks and feels great and this little appliance has made my life more manageable!    Bottom line - give it a chance.  You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Had this product for several months. Purchased it in-store.  For the short period of time that it worked, it worked great. However, after about 6 months of use, it began making cracking/popping sounds, and then died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a product that cost almost $100, I fully expect longevity.  Will be looking into a warranty replacement, but in the mean time, will need to buy another one, as the 14 year old in the house is now in major break-down mode because she can&#x27;t straighten her hair!</li>
            <li> Very worth the price.  I use it daily.It is easy to handle and operate. I highly recommend it. A friend had let me try hers when we we&#x27;re at a conference weekend and was delighted to find it for the price at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I almost didn&#x27;t get this wonderful machine. Like you, I shopped around for the best price; read review after review and was almost scared away. Especially since Amazon is awful about charging shipping fees for any and all returns (at least that I&#x27;ve dealt with). So I decided to spend the extra money and get one at Wal-Mart (since they have a good return policy and don&#x27;t charge people for returning Christmas gifts that were given to them ... but I diagress).  I only read the &#x27;quick start&#x27; portion of the included instructions and had my hair straight in less than 20 minutes ... which is amazing. My hair is thick, coarse, and LONG ... not to mention that I have always had to wait until I got to my hair styled at the salon (which usually takes two people brushing and blowing to get manageable) to have my hair look this good. Yes, there was no way (no matter how hard I tried and what I used) I could keep my hair from not looking like a horrible, ratted, before picture .... that was until I got the InStyler!  It is simple to use with very easy instructions. And yes, the iron is hot (DUH!) but no more so than that of a curling iron. Plus there is a wonderful guard that clips on to help keep it away from your skin. Not to mention you can heat it up to different temperatures depending on your hair type. And the instructions even say that if it&#x27;s too hot turn it down.  I love the InStyler. Have gotten nothing but compliments from not only family, friends, and co-workers ... but complete strangers as well! I would highly recommend this to anyone and the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I would be tentative buying it through amazon since returns are such a pain.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work and is a rip off.  I have numerous other stylers all of which are less expensive than this and they are all better.  It is horrible.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> horrible product i must say, my parents had boughten me this for christmas this year (finally getting around to telling you how bad this is) and ive used it maybe 5 times. because it rolls it pulls on your hair almost tessing it eventhough you pull it tight. left my hair big and not anything close to how they show it on tv. I&#x27;ve even looked up youtub videos on how to use it thinking maybe im just slow but no this is a horrible straightener you will be better off investing in a CHI like i have now.</li>
            <li> I have medium length straight hair &amp; the InStyler does a good fast job of providing curls where I need them. As other reviewers have noted, daily use with this item can fry your hair; but I have not found any heating element claiming to curl/straighten hair that does not (over time). The InStyler barrel gets really hot &amp; I guess this is the reason it can work hair as effectively as it does - curls hold up amazingly. However, the barrel of this \\&quot;original\\&quot; version is metal, and the other components are smooth plastic (handle, brush bed). I would not recommend having this product around small children, or anyone who is not at least 16 years old. Mine did not come with a stand &amp; when I put the unit down on my bathroom counter to section out locks of hair to curl, it can ( and does) easily slip off the counter (weighted by the electrical cord). I can see where it can easily fall on a dog or a small child that may be hanging about you (as dogs and children do) &amp; burn them. Alternatively, it can fall on your foot, or as I did, in trying to coordinate holding my sectioned hair with one hand to wrap around the InStyler and grabbing for the Instyler itself, grab the wrong end of the device (both barrel &amp; handle are silver colored) ending up with burned fingers. Let me say again that the barrel gets VERY HOT - not only can it burn fingers, hands, but scalp and skin around the face if you get it too close.  The product works for me, although I am EXTREMELY careful &amp; focused when I use it. I would not recommend this product if there is a chance you will be distracted (by family, children, pets, whatever)or have small children - it can cause a sad accident. The company sent me a plastic shield, after I bought the product (I guess other customers also had issues with the hot barrel), but it&#x27;s useless/cumbersome (if you used the shield you would need to remove it every time you lifted the device to straighten/curl hair, and put it back on when you put it down - you would need morehands than you had!). I have serious reservations about the safety of this product because of the burning incident; you&#x27;d think that they could come up with something safer. BTW, I bought the new tourmaline barrel one &amp; returned it -- it&#x27;s performance was dismal. I guess the HOT metal barrel (like the curling irons of old) is what makes this device curl as well as it does. However, users beware!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of horrible cheap materials. I could smell my hair burning when I used it. The bristles are cheap plastic and just knots your hair up.</li>
            <li> I returned this product because it just didnt straighten my hair like I was thinking it would. Its kinda noisy, but it was a nice product. It made me nervous because I kept thinking I was gonna burn myself. Me, I just didnt care for it. Again, nice product but not for me.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the money. It is unique in how it styles, but it is clumsy to get the right hand motion.&lt;br /&gt;Mine broke after 4 months of infrequent use.  I am about to return it!</li>
            <li> I have been straightening my hair for a good 8 years now and was very disappointed when i tried this product.    Normally i used the Helen of Troy straightener.  I love this straightner but was getting a little sick of how flat (lacking volume)it was leaving my hair. (i know comes with the territory of straightening)      After i saw the InStyler advertised a lot i decided to try it and see if i liked it any better than the conventional flat irons. Not only is the thing loud, it didnt get the job done at all!   My hair is a little longer than shoulder length and medium wavy, so its not even tight curls.  The best it did was take the big waves out but still left my hair a frizzy puffball mess.      Forgo this overpriced product and stick with a good quality flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Conair hot air curling combo with the 1.5\\&quot; barrel since 1997 ( and I have been through too many to count) and have always loved it. However, about a year ago I noticed my hair was getting a little too dry on the ends, and I had a lot of broken strands close to the roots.  Since I treat my hair well otherwise I attributed it to the extreme heat being put out by my curling brush.  Plus, on humid days a serum and my curling brush still wasn&#x27;t enough to tame my fine, naturally curly hair.  I had seen the InStyler on TV, and it seemed promising, but I try to stay skeptical so I won&#x27;t spend a fortune on stuff that doesn&#x27;t work.  Even though the InStyler is spendy compared to my Conair, I finally made the investment and purchased the InStyler.  Happily, I was impressed!  My hair didn&#x27;t take long at all to style, and the ceramic barrel and low heat setting was enough to keep my hair straight even on a humid June day in Iowa.  My daughter, who has course, very curly hair, had success with the InStyler too, with my Aveda serum.  Her hair stayed smooth and frizz free, if not stick straight, all day.  And believe me, we have tried everything on that poor girl.  So I give the InStyler 5 stars, since I have had lasting success with differing hair types.</li>
            <li> The InStyler ratating hot iron hair straightener is great.   It is wonderful.  It works well and it&#x27;s easy to use.   Heats up fast.</li>
            <li> I tried it on myself and my daughters. It didn&#x27;t heat up like it promised to do fast. It flipped hair up okay, but not like expected. My hair got  tangled in it a couple of times. Just was not worth the money! I sent it back.    LL</li>
            <li> I would really recomment this product. My wife loves it! I gave it to her as a birthday gift and she was so pleased.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews for this. This is the best hair iron that I&#x27;ve ever used. I have long, thick, course and frizzy hair. This is a dream product. I can do my hair in 20 minutes and it looks just like a blowout at the salon that takes them an hour and half to do. I get the exact same results as the salon and so many compliments on how healthy and shiny my hair looks. Boy, if they could only see it all frizzed up and dull looking, LOL.  No, I don&#x27;t work for the company and am not affiliated in any way. I&#x27;m buying a second one just in case something happens to the first one. This is not a product for short hair though. I really can&#x27;t live without this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what&#x27;s up with people complaining how hot this gets?  Hellloooooo, it&#x27;s a HOT IRON people!</li>
            <li> I got the instyler as a gift this past Christmas.  I used it a few times and it seemed to make my hair a lot frizzer than I flat iron did.  I read the instructions and it said to make sure that you had a good hair cut for the best results.  It had been awhile since I had a hair cut so I decided to wait until then to try it again.  Well when I went to use it again it started making this odd popping noise when the barrel rotated and the side the brush was on began rubbing on the barrel and it caused a groove.  I called the instyler customer service as the instructions said in the package.  They would not take it back because I no longer had the box it came in. I asked for a supervisor.  The supervisor was very rude.  He told me that I was waisting his time and hung up on me.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product.  It doesn&#x27;t work that well and the company does not stand behind it&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> The product is good - it does take a little getting used to.  You have to figure out how the hold it in order to get your hair to curl the way you want it to but other than it has been good.  However, I did pay extra for faster delivery and it took just as long as if I hadn&#x27;t paid the extra so I wouldn&#x27;t bother with the extra cost for quick delivery - it isn&#x27;t any quicker.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for self, I have long length relaxed hair.  I really didn&#x27;t see a huge difference, it&#x27;s heavy, mosey, and the bristles on the brush wears out after a few uses.  I prefer my solia flat iron any day</li>
            <li> I am very please with the In Styler.  It does everything a straightening iron does, plus you can make your hair waivy or even add curls.  It seems to do less damage than a conventional straightening iron.</li>
            <li> I received this item with part of the packaging missing.  When I went to plug the InStyler in the rotating head didn&#x27;t work even when I pressed the rotating head and the brush together. I returned and will never buy from Amazon.com again.</li>
            <li> I really liked how the Instyler made my hair look, however I had the produce LESS than two weeks before it broke.  The barrel stopped rotating, which was the main functioning part that caused the volume of my style.  I would suggest this product if it were better designed.  I am back to using my flat iron now.</li>
            <li> Regular flat irons just dry out my hair, including this one. I went to a stylist in China Town in Houston, TX and she used a Steam Flat Iron on my hair. It made it smoother than it has every been (I have a lot of fine, wavy hair that dries easily). It lasted for 3 days and I got a ton of compliments on how smooth my hair was. She used NO PRODUCT in my hair, only the steam iron. It was very quick and I loved it.    Going to sell my instyler :D</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product at first. My hair was extremely soft after each run through.This product does not do roots though. I would pair it up with a normal flat iron to make sure all that was missed with the InStyler.</li>
            <li> I like the Instyler I had to figure out how to use it properly,but since then I have had nothing but success with it. It makes my hair so bouncy and full of life. I can straighten or curl it up and it always looks great! I recommened this product for sure!!</li>
            <li> do what it actually says it could. First off, it takes FOREVER and a day to straighten my hair. Even if I was able to straighten it (as well as it possibly could, which isn&#x27;t really all that great) it frizzes up. Badly. I mean, I&#x27;d rather have my hair up instead of a huge ball of frizz. I completely regret buying this crappy dresser accessory. That&#x27;s all it&#x27;s good for really, other than damaging my already somewhat damaged hair. If it hadn&#x27;t cost me so much I would&#x27;ve thrown it out. Oh well.</li>
            <li> This transaction was so easy! The seller was great!! I not only received the product wrapped very securely with a nice note, but a free gift as well! I am thrilled to have done business with her.  The instyler works great and I&#x27;m glad that I made the purchase, and at such a good price!</li>
            <li> I bought this and tried it a couple of times on my longish hair.  It did nothing.  So then, a couple of months later I got a short hair cut.  I went home that night, excited to see what the InStyler could do.  Plug it in, and nothing.  The darn thing broke.  I used it twice for minutes, it sat around and now it&#x27;s broken.  What a piece of junk.  Another too-good-to-be-true infomercial product.  Boo.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to share how I love my instyler, it is so easy and always makes my hair perfect! I always get compliments on my hair. I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I dont even turn the power to the instyler on, if its plugged it, it automatically heats up without pushing the button on.  I have grandkids here, i keep it unplugged and wont use it.</li>
            <li> Used this hot iron just once. It did not get hot enough to straighten or curl hair. The next time I attempted to use the iron it just broke. Very flimsey. I sent the product back immediately to the seller (Boom Boom Audio) and still after 4 monthes they have not refunded my card. When I attempted to email them to see what the hold up was their email address was no longer a valid email.</li>
            <li> The item was defective.  When I requested a new one, it turned out that the merchant had been dropped from Amazon suppliers.  However, I was credited  for the defective item with very little hassle.  I feel the reliability of Amazon would make it a place that I would always want to do business with.</li>
            <li> I have had my instyler about a year and I absolutely love it.  It works beautifully for my thick relatively fine shoulder length hair.  My hair has a lot of wave and can look &#x27;fuzzy&#x27;.  There are a couple of keys to using it - I read a lot of the other negative reviews - and here is my advise:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Use a defrizz product to go with it - I love John Frieda \\&quot;Frizz Ease\\&quot; wherer I take a dollop about the size of a quarter - rub in on my hands and between my fingers and run them through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Brush your hair well to get the product nicely distributed.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Don&#x27;t take too much hair!  I gather up about the top 80% of my hair into a clip or pony tail and start with the hair underneath.  Then I take about a fourth of that hair - start at the scalp and smooth down - holding the ends a little longer if I want them to flip.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Finish that layer - brush.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Let hair down - release about another 20 percent and repeat with that layer.&lt;br /&gt;6.  Continue through all the layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this sounds like a lot of work - it takes me about 15 minutes on the morning after a hairwash.  The next day - its a 5 minute touchup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - my advice - don&#x27;t take too much hair, start from the most underneath hair and work up.  And be careful - it is HOT!</li>
            <li> The iron itself is fine, but the control switch is very confusing.  I am not sure I understand the thought process that went into the manufacturing of the switch.  I have read the instructions and am still confused about when it is the hottest and why it flashes with three lights and never gets warm.  I like the iron, but just don&#x27;t like the control function.  I use it often and like the results.</li>
            <li> I order this iron because a friend buy whith other seller   And I liked how this iron works and I order but when I open   The box and saw the iron I feel very disappointed because looks like  Used so I decide returned ad now I&#x27;m waiting for my refund</li>
            <li> Worth every penny as long as you don&#x27;t expect it to do everything.  I have wavy fine hair that wants to frizz and do its own thing.  I&#x27;m not sure what I expected this curling/straightening iron to be able to do when I bought it over a year ago, but it does keep my bangs looking perfect in seconds.  My bangs have always been a challenge, since I usually pull my hair back and a little aloe/80 styling gel keeps it looking neat, I don&#x27;t have to have my hair styled all over.  Any humidity will curl and frizz my hair, so being able to plug this in, wait a few seconds and shape my bangs has been wonderful.  Seems to last a long time too.  It&#x27;s also nice for smoothing and shaping the rest of my hair when I have time.  It doesn&#x27;t take long, and the brush makes it simple; my hair comes out looking put together much faster than if I use a curling iron.  I think I hoped I could use it to curl as well as straighten, and for me, it just straightens and gives a subtle curl/shape.  The auto shut-off is a must.  I reach for this almost every day while my other stylers/irons gather dust.</li>
            <li> A friend gave me this product. &amp; it doesn&#x27;t work. Doesn&#x27;t do anything to your hair and barely heats up. Your better off using a more reliable heating tool brand.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my Instyler.  I&#x27;ve had it for well over a year and have not had one problem with it.  As one review stated, you have to be very careful because it does get quite HOT and the potential to burn yourself (like with any other iron) is there!  I have very curly hair that I&#x27;ve had relaxed and it works GREAT!!  You won&#x27;t be sorry if you purchase an Instyler!</li>
            <li> I love this!! Of course it isn&#x27;t like as good as a  brazilian blow out but it works great. I don&#x27;t get how people can give this a bad review or burn themselves. Hey how about BE CAREFUL! Duh. It does get really hot but that&#x27;s a good thing! If you have half a brain and want good hair, order this!</li>
            <li> This so-called straightener, which I bought secondhand from a coworker who was having a moving sale, is one of the crappiest products I&#x27;ve ever owned. I paid $50 for it, which is a lot less than the retail price, but as I found it to be completely ineffective, I may as well have thrown that money in the trash. My coworker claimed that it worked for her and maybe it did; she has thin, fine hair. She also said that she only used it once, and when I got it, it did look brand-new.     I would strongly advise anyone with even moderately thick or coarse hair against buying this straightener. I have tried many straighteners on my thick, coarse hair over the years and this is by far the least effective one of all. I set it on the highest heat setting and it did not straighten my hair. It was better than nothing, but not much better. It worked about as well as a blow dryer alone. Instead of the smooth, polished look you&#x27;re going for when using a straightener, this one creates the opposite: big, frizzy hair. I&#x27;m very disappointed and very upset at buying this the way I did since I can&#x27;t even send it back for a refund, but am stuck with it until I throw it away. Wish I&#x27;d been smart enough to read some customer reviews beforehand!</li>
            <li> I received the InStyler as a gift last Christmas, and I am embarrassed that the purchaser wasted their money.  My first complaint is that the rotation of the heating cylinder is only good if it rotates away from the hair follicle. It smooths the hair beautifully. However, if you switch sides of your head the rotation is up the hair shaft, and causes a little tangled or frizzy bump. I do not have coarse hair, and I have only used it on clean, product free hair.     My primary concern is the durability of the design and the return policies. I have only used this product about 10-15 times. About 2 months ago, the nut at the end of the shaft came off, and the heating cylinder came loose.  It looked simple enough to repair, but I did not have a tool that was small and compact enough to fix it.  I did the best I could to get the nut screwed back on, but it came loose the next time I used it.  So, I called customer service, and they will not do anything for you unless you purchased it within a year, you have the receipt, and you purchased it from a licensed vendor.    If you do buy this product, keep your receipt!  If you give it as a gift, give them your receipt!  And do not expect to get the quality that you paid for.</li>
            <li> I have owned the Instyler for about one year now. I am glad I own it and it works well for me. I have long, blonde, fine hair with a slight wave. I use it in the morning to smooth out my hair. When I wash my hair, I use the Instyler on the wet hair instead of blow drying, but I don&#x27;t use it to completely dry the hair, if that&#x27;s what you are expecting to do. I like it. That said, the roller only turns one direction. I am right-handed and I prefer to flip my hair under at the ends. If I hold the Instyler in my right hand, the roller turns the wrong way. In spite of this, it does work to curl my hair but the roller does try to push out the bottom layer of hiar just a bit. I can use my left hand to hold it but that is more awkward. It gets very, very hot like professional grade equipment. I have burned myself on the neck before. It came with a \\&quot;heat guard\\&quot; which was a plastic piece that attached to the barrel. The heat guard seemed to be intended to keep you from getting it too close to your skin but I never figured out how to use it so I don&#x27;t. I put the Instyler on a silicon pad (for a clothing iron) so I don&#x27;t set a fire in the bathroom. My device has not quit working as I saw others had experienced.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased in April 2010.  Hardly used. Once every two weeks.  Fell apart November. Terrible product. Waste of my $$</li>
            <li> I had seen this item almost everywhere almost everyday.  My boyfriend was bugging me about purchasing this to use for my daughter.  I finally find it for less than $140.00 and it only worked properly once.  I received it on Thurseday afternoon, used it on my daughters hair on Friday morning, went to use it on her hair this evening before a party and the rotating iron wouldn&#x27;t rotate.  Then once I unplugged it, plugged it back up, fondle with the heater setting (low, med, high, and off) then it started to rotate but it wouldn&#x27;t get hot.  After starting the process over again, it finally started to heat up but not as hot as it was the day before and not hot enough to make any difference in her hair.  I have to go back to my old flat and curling irons.  The good thing about it was the fact that it only took a few days to arrive.</li>
            <li> I bought the Instyler after seeing how it \\&quot;polishes\\&quot; your hair and gives it a healthy bounce.  What a disappointment!  My hair is long, fine, but very shiny and healthy.  I used the Instyler hoping for a little lift at the root, and what I&#x27;ve gotten after using it for several weeks is a bunch of broken hair at the root all over my scalp!    As a result, all the hair around my scalp is now only about 1 inch long.  I called the company to complain, and what they&#x27;ve said is that they \\&quot;never heard of the Instyler breaking a customer&#x27;s hair.\\&quot;  Well if anyone there uses Google then they&#x27;d know that is a blatent lie.  Furthermore, they refused to take any information about my complaint and refused to accept a return.  What&#x27;s most upsetting is not the $120 wasted, but the time it will take to regrow my destroyed hair from this product.  After inspecting the unit, it appears that it is not the heat that broke my hair, but it is actually the rotating action with the nylon bristles that actually pull and snag the hair, resulting in severe damage and breakage near the root.  If you value healthy, full hair, and good customer service, DO NOT BUY THE INSTYLER!  You will be sorry like me!</li>
            <li> Despite being pretty skeptical, based on very differing reviews of this item, I went ahead and bought it as a gift for my girlfriend. (She had already said she wanted it and had a girl friend that swore by it.)  She is only really using it for its curling capabilities, but after 3 plus uses she is still very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My friend has an InStyler and loves it, so she brought it with her during her visit for me to try.  I have thick curly hair that gets very frizzy.  On a normal morning, I would spend nearly an hour drying and straightening my hair.  I knew I wanted one immediately.  It worked wonderfully on my hair, leaving it straight and shiny.  I didn&#x27;t think it was very hard to use at all.  Well I ordered a new one from a third-party seller and was very disappointed.  This one didn&#x27;t work at all like the other, and seemed very cheaply made.  It wouldn&#x27;t grasp my hair and didn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything to my hair.  I ended up going to a local department store and bought another one, to have something to compare it to.  The new one I bought worked just as well as my friend&#x27;s did.  In doing a side by side comparision, there were several small differences that makes me think this is a knock-off.  But definitely the quality was horrible, it just felt cheaply made, especially for the amount of money it cost.  So I am keeping the one from the department store and trying to return the other, but seller has not responded to my emails as of yet, go figure.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with this product.  Despite reading the negative reviews I bought it at Walgreens knowing I could return it.  I&#x27;ve had it about 6 months with great results and now I can&#x27;t live without it.  I have a supply of flat irons and curling irons that I never touch anymore because this is better than any of them.  I have thick frizzy (not curly) hair.  Repeated use of a flat iron damages my hair.  The Instyler doesn&#x27;t severely straighten the hair; it smooths it.  And you can give it some bend on the ends so it&#x27;s not stick straight.  It does take some practice.  You have to learn where to place your hand so that it&#x27;s not backwards.  I was afraid my hair would get caught in the rotating barrel but that has never happened.  As long as you don&#x27;t place too much hair in the barrel, and don&#x27;t go too fast, it works beautifully.  I have used it almost every day for 6 months and it&#x27;s still working.  Even if it eventually breaks, I&#x27;ll buy another because I haven&#x27;t found anything else that works so well on my hair.  I have only used the lowest heat setting and it has not damaged my hair at all.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this as long as you buy from somewhere you can return it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Easy to use and fast styling. Would reccommend this product for anyone with any type of hair.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it a few times and I kept burning myself so I will no longer use it.  I have a flatiron and I have never been burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you have better results with it than me.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the In styler and I have a lot of thick curly hair.  I have flat irons, but when I straighten my hair it takes me at least one hour and half to straighten.  I love the In styler because it straighten quick and I mean quick.  I spent about ten minutes on my hair and then went over it with a flat iron to make it sleek.   Great tool!</li>
            <li> I recently got this and in the beginning it did these adorable flips...unfortunately by the 5th time of using it, my hair gets puffy, frizzy and very damaged. I&#x27;ve gotten so many split ends because of this, it&#x27;s ridiculous. Even if your hair is a bit wet, it tends to damage ur ends really bad and flips ur hair in the wrong direction. I&#x27;m so disappointed and to top it off, I have burned myself with this styler, Its completely dangerous! Ive gone back to my hair straigthener and I see better results with a Target straightener than with a tv styler.</li>
            <li> Love my InStyler but the thing is a flame thrower.  Have burned myself several times when doing my bangs.  I may die using it but my hair looks great.</li>
            <li> this is a great concept...i loved it, but it really dried my hair out and i think if it were made with a ceramic roller it would be much better...not to mention i used mine maybe every other day for 6 months and my hair is thin so it really wasnt on for very long each time i used it, and the motor burnt out...im going with the iso version this go around, or the paris hilton version...both ARE ceramic and are half the price.</li>
            <li> My hair is very kinky and frizzy.  I have a hard time holding a brush and hair dryer at the same time, but this item is a time saver.  I can curl and straighten my hair in half the time with litte or no work on my part.  Curler does all the twirling.</li>
            <li> HELPFUL HINT: I used black nail polish to draw 3 big arrows on brush side so it was easy to tell which direction the barrel was rolling, helps eliminate wasted time and frustration trying to figure which way to hold InStyler. Love the InStyler (with painted arrows!) I have tried every straightening product out there, including chemical ones like a professional salon Keratin treatment. I have a LOT of long hair, nearly to my waist,takes about 30 minutes to straighten my hair from towel dried with this. Lasts days! And I live in a humid climate, which normally frizzes my hair as soon as I walk outside.  But not with the InStyler.  Seriously thinking of buying another one to have for my travel bag, and as a back-up.</li>
            <li> This gives salon quality styling with minimal effort and minimal time. It is expensive... and according to the other reviews on here, it stops working after a few months. I am ok with that. Here&#x27;s why: in order for me to get similar results with my hair, I have to go to the salon, which requires making an appointment, driving there, waiting, and then spending at least 30 minutes with the stylist, paying, and then driving back (I would estimate the total cost to be around $30, and that&#x27;s if I don&#x27;t take time off from work to do it). With this unit, it takes 5-10 minutes at my own house. So, if I use it 80 times and it cost $80, it&#x27;s only $1 per use....far less than I would spend at the salon. Plus, I can get salon looking hair every day with this, instead of once of month with the salon.     I did not give it 5 stars because: it breaks down fairly quickly (according to other reviewers), the lack of a burn guard causes burns to face and hands, it is not good for use on bangs.</li>
            <li> I ordered my Instyler and added the quick shipping to the order to expedite the delivery. A month later i was emailing them to find out where my order was. If that&#x27;s not frustrating enough I used it for 2 wks and now it won&#x27;t stay on for longer than 5 minutes.   I can honestly say i loved what it did for my hair and got lots of compliments but i can get the same results from a flat iron for half the price. Now i&#x27;m stuck with a broken styler and if i try and return it i&#x27;m likely in for a battle also and i&#x27;m just not going to hassle it.    My opinion Do Not Buy It. It&#x27;s just not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering why the prices i see on Amazon, and other sites are $65 and up, and the tv ad is 2 for $15.00.  I&#x27;m wondering if the is the same rotating iron, tho it does have the same name.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair with tight \\&quot;S\\&quot; curls that frizzs easily. I did straighten may hair, but it was limp; nothing like the texture I get after using my FHI flat iron.  There is no cool tip at the end to hold while straigthening your hair, which makes it very awkward &amp; hard to use and I burned the tip of my ear in the process.  It took over 30 to 45 minutes longer than usual to style my hair from wet and dry &amp; I had to do it over again with my flat iron.  The materail feels and appears cheaper than what it sold for.  I called for a refund number and the nice salesman offered me a cool tip attachment for the iron, along with a special conditioning treatment to remedy the limp hair problem, but a week later I called and customer service had not mailed it or had no record of it.  This person was not as nice, so I demanded a refund number because my 30 day trial was running out.  I can imagine that is how they get a lot of sales, by hoping we will either forget or lose something.  I returned it and promptly got a refund; however, I would not recommend this one to any one with my type hair.  If you do purchase it, make certain you keep every thing in the box in tact and record your conversations when you call or confirm it in writing.  As I said, they did not have any record of the agreement to mail additional items to me or even that my 30 day trail period was extended.</li>
            <li> I bought the Instyler for my 13 yr old daughter. She has long thick hair and her hair is naturally wavy. She loves it. She uses her Instyler more than her regular flat iron. And its not as damaging as the flat iron. Her hair is softer and she says its easier to use. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am one of those who hates my hair, long or short it ges heavy and becomes flat fast, I am never happy and always pull back in a pony tail, well not anymore. Using this tool I can flip my somewhat long hair and it stays full all day. No kidding even without anytype of product or hair spray. Everytime I use this tool I love it more and more and it is so easy. I have finally found something I love to use with my hair and love my hair all day.</li>
            <li> When I bought this item I was expecting it to give me beautiful hair with just the right amount of shine! I liked the way it worked, I did not burn myself like some of the other reviewers have ( mine came with a guard to put over the barrel) and it also came with a mat to lay the iron down on. This did make my hair look nice and it was easy to use.  However, I quickly realized that it didn&#x27;t do anymore for my hair than if I had just spent the time using a hair dryer and a brush.  I have medium lenght hair that is not frizzy or thick, just somewhat naturally wavy. So maybe for someone with awfully curly hair, this might be a great tool. But like I said, for me, I get the same results from a hairdryer and round brush.  Returned it and got my money back.</li>
            <li> I wanted this instlyer so bad but could not afford to buy it myself.  So my sweet daughter purchased one for me as a surprise. I was thrilled!  I liked the way it gave volume to the top of my head but after two uses the product stopped working.  We contacted the seller and they were no longer doing business with Amazon.  So we put in a A-Z claim and Amazon refunded my daughter her entire purchase price, including shipping.  Amazon..Thank you! You really stand by your word. Fantastic customer service, you are the best!  Now about the instyler, it was very awkward to use, but I figured since it was so new to me, I would get the hang of it. But I never got the chance, it&#x27;s a shame that they charge so much for a product that has serious defects.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting this product for so long now and finally went out and bought it the other day.  I know people prob get it most for straightening their hair but i have to admit it doesnt work well on mine as far as straightening goes, i prefer my regular straightening iron, it may be because I have sorta thin hair that i do get pretty staight from just drying it...this iron may work better on really really curly or course hair.....but......as far as curling my hair goes I absoluetly LOVE it and i will be keeping it for that purpose.  It gives your hair the most beauiful wavy curls and it curls your head sooo fast once you get the hang of it unlike my normal curling iron. I dont even have to spray my hair first my hair totally holds a nice curl. So if you are looking for a great curling iron i would def recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I borrowed the Instyler from my friend and I am glad to say I did not purchase one. For it to even come close to straightening your hair you have to turn it all the way up, medium and low are worthless. I agree it is dangerous, when you are holding your hair to pull it through is almost a reflex to grab the bottom of your hair. If you are not careful you will burn your fingers! I have a bed head flat iron and love it and it did not cost near as much as this one. If you have thin, limp hair then this might work. Otherwise, look for something else!</li>
            <li> I love this product. My hair is VERY thick, course, and has some natural curl to it. Needless to say unless I take the time to style it, it looks bad. With this one product I&#x27;m able to put away my straightener and curling iron. Depending on the look I want I can achieve both. It&#x27;s very easy to use and I love that I only need one hair appliance now. It does get very hot and you definitely need to be careful so that you don&#x27;t burn yourself. For me it works just as described on the infomercial.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in short amount of time and in excellent condition. The wife loved it. Great vendor.</li>
            <li> These people are liars. I ordered the instyler for a good price. The reason why I order from Amazon is to pay less. I love it, but this time I purchased the instyler for my mom as a xmas present. The sellers are GDHDMI. They sent me a thing that looked like an instyler, it was the exact thing but BOOTLEG!!!! it was a fake. It was much fatter and a lot of plastic and it made a pop sound on the first try an didn&#x27;t work. I thought it was a real instyler until I actually purchased one from ULTA. I noticed it wasn&#x27;t. It was a rip off. No one sould order from them.</li>
            <li> The product worked excellent for the 3 months that it worked... I don&#x27;t think that what I got was original!  It blew out after only having used it for 3 months.  I didn&#x27;t even use it but 6 times in those 3 months... so now of course it&#x27;s too late to submit a claim on it.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!  Spend the extra and make sure you get an original!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I were so excited seeing this on tv and decided to purchase two.  This hair styler does not work well on long fine hair when trying to put curl into it.  Very disappointed in it. :-)</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job to straighten hair, looks sort of like a blow out from the salon.   The cons - The on/off button right in front on the bottom, and I keep accidently turning it off, not a good spot or should be harder to push so this would not happen.  Not a heat resistent cord so you have to make sure each time you place down that the cord is not touching, started to melt my cord!!   Nothing came with it on which to place the styler when you need to put it down, so I am using a towel under mine so as not to burn my counter.   The price is to high for what it does.  So far I have not found it too helpful with curling hair, just seems good to straighten.   has a warning on it that say cord contains lead and to wash hands after handeling because of leads cancer causing agents. I mean could they not coat the cord and make it more safe to use and heat resistent?? I think they could have    The Verdict - My hair looks better than I could have done on my own, works quickly and I feel like I can style my hair each day with it. So Good purchase over all. :)      Pros - does straighten very well.   also makes my hair very soft.     P.S. the noise everyone is complaining about is not loud at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using the InStyler for 2 weeks. I have below shoulder length thick course wavy hair. I kept all the packaging and the receipt so that I could return it if it didn&#x27;t work out.  After getting used to it, I have decided to keep it.    CONS:  1 - The barrel only rotates one way. When I used it the first time, my hair looked frizzy and terrible, but I figured out that the barrel was rotating upwards and I was pulling it downwards.  After I figured out that the barrel should be rotating in the direction that I was pulling it, then it worked fine. My guess is that people who don&#x27;t like this iron are probably holding the iron incorrectly.    It is very awkward always holding the iron in a way so that the barrel is rolling in the right direction.  When I use a regular flatiron, I hold it in my right hand and pull it through the left side of my head, and then hold it in my left hand and pull it through the right side of my head.  You cannot do that with this iron.  I have to hold it with the handle pointing to the back of my head which is really really awkward.    2 - It doesn&#x27;t curl my hair very well, but that&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me.  If I want to curl my hair, I just use a regular iron, but I don&#x27;t curl my hair very often.    3 - You need to use very small sections of hair. I am used to using larger sections with my regular flat iron.    4 - It doesn&#x27;t work on my bangs.  If you have short hair, I don&#x27;t recommend this iron.    5 - It doesn&#x27;t work on damp hair AT ALL. It is much easier to have your hair completely dry.    PROS:  1 - Once you get used to holding it correctly and using smaller sections of hair, it does work very well.  I can make my hair straight, curled under or flip up, and it has great body.    2 - The style lasts until I wash it.  I only wash my hair every three days, and I only have to touch up my hair slightly each day with the InStyler.    3 - My hair feels silky and shiny. My old flat iron doesn&#x27;t do that.  BUT I do use a hair serum (Olive Oil brand) even though the directions says not to have any product in your hair (I&#x27;ve always used the serum, even with other tools).  My hair does not look as smooth and silky without the serum.    4 - My ultimate test was this morning. I washed my hair last night and let it air dry (my hair has a weird wave). I woke up to a hot mess. But the InStyler had no problem smoothing my hair out perfectly. To keep my hair healthy, I will probably always wash at night, let it air dry, and then straighten it in the morning.    All in all, I recommend this for people with long hair who want to straighten or flip their hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for about a year.  I received it as a gift and it worked great at first.  I have long thick hair and it straightens very quickly.  However, it failed to work properly while I was straighting my hair one day.  The top of the cylinder part of the iron fell off.  I tried everything to put the top back on and it did not go back the same way.  When I would try using it the top would come right off while it was spinning.  I think that this product could have been made with better quality.  It worked great prior to breaking but once it broke I was unable to use it anymore.  I am just glad that I received this as a gift because I would be very upset if I had actually purchased it myself.</li>
            <li> I think the product is exactly what they advertise &amp; I really wanted to try it. It just doesn&#x27;t work great for my type of hair. I am trying to grow it out &amp; it is curly &amp; very thick. I think for someone with shorter fine hair it would work wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my InStyler for a few months. It definitely straightens, but getting a curl on my ends doesn&#x27;t happen. I can get a fresh look to my ends, but nothing more than any other flat iron does. Not worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with high hopes, but I am very disappointed.  I used it for the first time last night, and it didn&#x27;t work very well.  My hair did not come out smooth and straight at all.  It was still wavy after 2 or 3 run throughs of the same 1\\&quot; section of hair.  It was straighter than when I started, but no where near the look you get from a flat iron.  It is also ineffective at straightening the first few inches from the scalp (unless you don&#x27;t mind touching 375 degree metal to your skin)which is my curliest area!  I could have lived with this sorta straight style because it went way quicker than using a flat iron, but then I noticed the bristles were bent and melting!  I called the customer service number in the box and they accused me of using the product incorrectly.  I read all the instructions first and had been using it properly, so they eventually offered me a replacement.  However, to get the replacement I&#x27;d have to fax my receipt, wait for a phone call, then wait 6-8 weeks for the replacement... which might also be a piece of junk!  Needless to say, I am returning it as soon as the store opens!</li>
            <li> I have only used my instyler a couple of times, and am returning it tomarrow. I am glad I bought it at walmart so it will be no hassle to return it at all. It&#x27;s a good enough product. It does straighten my hair well (long, thick hair with natural wave). I was impressed at how fast I got my hair done, but really it isn&#x27;t $100 impressive. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s $50 impressive, and if they ever go down to that price or lower I&#x27;ll buy another. So if you&#x27;ve got a hundred bucks to blow then it is does a fine job, but if you are like me and on a super tight budget you will more than likely feel guilty for spending that much money on something that doesn&#x27;t WOW you like expected (my $30 straight iron delivers the same results). My advice if you want to check it out is to buy one at walmart or walgreens, no shipping costs, and the easier to return if you do not want to keep it.  Another reason I&#x27;m returning it is because I&#x27;ve read a whole bunch of reviews saying that they break easy, that is disturbing for me to see. If you pay that much for something it should last much longer than a few months. I figure I&#x27;ll return it now, because if 3 months from now it breaks on me and I can&#x27;t return it, I&#x27;ll feel so ripped off.</li>
            <li> My friend brought a Instyler. I have used a Chi for 10 years and swear on it, but thought I would try to find out what all the hype was about. It fried my hair and didn&#x27;t make my hair straight at all. It was all frizzy. I know how to use tools and found this one hard to handle and it felt cheap. My friend hated it and thought it was her, but after using it told her it was the appliance not the user. Used my Chi to straighten her hair and she went out the same day and bought one and is taking her Instyler back to the store where it came from. Save your money and buy a good quality flat iron instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year and a half.  Best straightener ever!!  It used to take me 1.5 hours to blowdry &amp; then flat iron my course, thick and curly hair.  With the in styler, I wash my hair the night before...let it dry during the night &amp; straighten my hair the next day in 20 mins!!  It works phenomenally &amp; I use it every day...by far the quickest most effective way I&#x27;ve found to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> First let me say i do like it, having arthritis this make it easier for me but, I Cant beleive they have it on here for 199.00 dollars...way overpriced...ive seen it for 79.00 dollars on other sites But, the best deal was I found mine at The Salvation Army for only 3.99..shop around.</li>
            <li> I received this as a present and was ecstatic.  When I first starting using it - I loved it.  I have thin hair but it is frizzy.  It perfectly straightening my hair (mind you when it was already dry, when wet it took forever) and made it look shiny.  It takes some getting used to as far as using the tool without burning yourself but it wasn&#x27;t all that complicated.  I could have lived with the little quirks and would have been happy to continue using the Instyler if it hadn&#x27;t stopped working less than thirty days after I received it and it was not used on a daily basis.  Overpriced piece of junk.</li>
            <li> The claims are a little less than trueful. Bottom line, it still does use heat and so still damages. Not quite as fast, but it still does. I&#x27;m dissapointed because of that. I also found no way to curl my hair with it.</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick, past bra strap lenght hair.    I gave in to the infomercial and bought this product. It worked ok. I made it work due to the fact I had paid so much for it.    Pros:   It does somewhat curl your ends under.   It gets your hair straight.  Hair still frizzed VERY easily     Cons:  TOO Expensive for no more than what it does.  Easy to burn yourself.  The end piece that held the barrel on always came loose and my hair would become tangled around it.  Can&#x27;t really curl your hair with this any better than you can a regualar straightener.    WARNING!  If you are considering buying this product I must point you in the direction of a 5 star straightener. It truly is just that. I was tired of the Instyler and bought a Remington Frizz Therapy 1\\&quot; Straightener. It is wonderful.I was shocked at the fact it worked so well and just as the reviews stated. I went from straightening my hair once a month tops to everyday. I can take my hair from a frizzy mess to beautifully straight and shiny in 10 minutes. PLEASE Google the reviews or look at the ones on Amazon before you buy an INSTYLER. The REMINGTON Straightener keeps my hair just as straight as a board all day. I have used CHIs as well as other expensive ones and the remington blows the pants off those. It is also inexpensive. I LOVE IT &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Well I saw an add for this hair straightener I thought it looked great. I figured they couldn&#x27;t fake everything this hair straightener was doing. I was wrong. I got my instyler a month ago and the rotating part doesn&#x27;t heat up anymore. When my straightener was heating up, it didn&#x27;t even work that well. I had to use my old hair straightener on my hair first and then go over it with the instyler. Everyone said it worked great on all types of hair, when it didn&#x27;t even work right on mine. I was very disappointed when it broke. don&#x27;t let the adds fool you this product is truly horrible</li>
            <li> The first InStyler I bought was defective. It worked twice and then.....nothing. Sent the dead InStyler back and got a replacement. It did/does a nice job on my fine shoulder length hair, though admittedly I do not use it daily. I still use it when I am going out and want to look more finished. However, with a good haircut every four weeks my hair looks o.k. when I just air dry it with a volumnizer at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;Really have not had any problem with the replacement InStyler. It does not burn or singe my hair; I&#x27;d categorize this as gentle on the hair. It provides the volume I need. It doesn&#x27;t take a long time for me to style my hair. The InStyler physical composition is o.k., but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be worth the hefty price tag when I look at comparably priced items such as my pricey hair dryer or facial scrubber which scream &#x27;made to last&#x27;. My niece who has unbelieveably long and curly hair that always looks untamed has used this and has had far more impressive results. Her hair looks shiney, straight, and has great volume. Even during incredibly humid weather her hair holds and look good without the expected frizzies. She hasn&#x27;t noted excessive heating or burning when she uses it. Neither of us has had a problem with tangling, and the results have been quick and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;If you are willing to pay the high price on this item because you have untamed hair, I&#x27;d suggest you buy it only if there is an acceptable return policy. If it does not suit your needs or you are not happy with it, return it.&lt;br /&gt;I really am not sure I needed to spend this much money for something I don&#x27;t use that much. I also think the price is excessive based on quality. Remember, my first InStyler died.</li>
            <li> The styler is seriously great, its one of the few ones that straighten out your hair and make it look great. My mom recommended this to me, because she has one, and it works great for her. I have thick and curly hair, and it makes my hair look awesome. Best straightening hair Iron! The only problem that I saw was that it came without the pad that protect it from surfaces and the CD. I guess I can live without them... but still. :(</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift for my birthday, and I have to say I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it! My long, think hair takes forever to straighten, but with the instyler it totally cut my time in half. I travel a lot, and it is such a space saver when I don&#x27;t have to pack a straightener and curling iron. It even comes with its own carrying case. Streamlined, easy-to-use, and effective! Great product!</li>
            <li> Saw the instyler on TV.  Looked like it would be a great product.  Unfortunately, it is over rated.  It does not curl or lift my hair as advertised.  The instyler shuts off and does not heat thoroughly.  You have to unplug it and replug and start from scratch.  All in all, I am not satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Instyler for 2 years now, and I absolutely adore it!  I&#x27;ve lived my entire life with unruly, curly, frizzy hair.  My hair is very fine and dry, and its normal state is frizzy.  I have tried every product on the planet to make my hair more manageable, from leave-in treatments to curlers to revolving brushes, but NOTHING comes close to the Instyler.  In less than 10 minutes, my hair is smooth, straight, styled, shiny and gorgeous.  I have never looked so \\&quot;put together,\\&quot; sleek and under control before!  10 minutes, and I&#x27;m out the door with great hair!  It&#x27;s an amazing product!  I bought 2, have had them both for 2 years without any issues.  I keep one on my bathroom counter at all times for quick styling and touch-ups, and keep the other one in my suitcase for traveling.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!</li>
            <li> The InStyler is first and foremost a straightener, so if you&#x27;re looking for a good straightener, this might be for you. I will say though, that my $80 straightener does just as good a job and in a lot less time. If you&#x27;re interested in the InStyler for its styling or curling abilities- look on. This thing is a total pain to even attempt to curl with (I&#x27;ll definitely stick with a traditional curling iron); you have to actually wrap your hair manually around the barrel, making it nearly impossible not to burn yourself. Also there seems to be almost no way to curl the ends unless, again, you want to burn yourself.</li>
            <li> InStyler has been a great tool for me. All the time I had problems trying to comb my hair and now I can do it easily, fast and friendly. I really recommend this product to every woman.</li>
            <li> The InStyler is a great product.  My hair feels silky smooth and my ends look and feel great.  The Iron gets very hot so its important to put the protector on to protect your skin from burning.  I would definately recommend getting this product - I love it and my hair looks amazing!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Instyler.  It works great, I have longer, thick and naturally curly hair.  This has been the best invention for my hair type for sure.  However, their customer service is the worst I have experienced.  The product has a tendancy to break, and if you don&#x27;t purchase a warranty they will not replace.  I have had to replace 3 of them now and I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 years.  And when you try to replace them the customer service reps make you go around and around, and make all the excuses in the world on why they can&#x27;t replace it.  I think someone else should make something similar to the Instlyer, but make sure it lasts longer, is made better and provide better customer service.  In summery, the quality is not great because they break too easily, and you will have a hard time returning it.</li>
            <li> I had my InStyler for 2 weeks and it stopped working. The round plate doesnt heat up. When it did work I loved it...very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Ok we&#x27;ve all seen the infomercial and thought right this will work for me if I had 50 people in the bathroom with me every morning! But wait I happened to see this thing in a store and thought it could work not so much to straighten my hair but to give it a little bend on the ends and some body that you just don&#x27;t get with a flat iron, and it does just that. While it wont get your hair stick straight if you&#x27;re a mixed chick like me or African American it will give you a I woke up this way, not a I spent 2 hours in the bathroom styling my hair within a inch of its life look which I cant stand the over styled hair sculpture look. If you want hair that looks like it just happened but still pulled together get this thing, its cut my styling time down to 15-20mins. The only thing is you don&#x27;t get any of the extras like you would if you purchased it from the InStyler site, but I have a comb and styling spray so who cares.     Its pure Genius!</li>
            <li> After about 3 uses in 13 months, my InStyler literally fell apart this morning.  With half my hair straightened and the other half curly, the rotating iron portion came loose, the top cap popped off, and screws came out.  I waited for the iron to cool and tried to fix it, but to no avail.  So I called the company, only to find out that the 12 month warranty expired one month ago!  I asked for the supervisor, explained the story and number of uses, and was told there is nothing he could do.  I said, surely you can send me a new one, since you are the supervisor, and its just 13 months since purchase.  He told me he was \\&quot;sorry I feel he cannot help me\\&quot;, to which I replied, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t FEEL you cannot help me, you literally are NOT helping me\\&quot;.  He held his ground, so I told him I would blog about this and email all the women I know.  Do Not Buy this piece of cheap crap made in China...3 uses and 13 months later, and your $140 is in the toilet :(</li>
            <li> This item was bought for my wife. She was not impressed however with it&#x27;s results. The remaining information is from her:  The information on it and commercials talk about how great it is for fine hair and how easy it is to use. It did nothing for my hair. It is definitely not easy for one person to use. Now maybe if I had a styling team like they show on TV it might work great! But for the one person using it, it&#x27;s not user friendly. It didn&#x27;t give the body the information claims it will. Sorry to say, I was not pleased with it at all.</li>
            <li> After only about 4 months the Instyler began shutting itself off while I was using it. It turns back on, then a few seconds later, off it goes again. I&#x27;m sure that one of these days it will just stay off for good, so I need to buy another straightener. it won&#x27;t be an Instyler though!    The barrel won&#x27;t turn while it&#x27;s off so I can&#x27;t even use the leftover heat to do any more hair. What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> It has totally tamed my frizzy hair. I just hope that the brush doesnt wear down because of the heat.</li>
            <li> The first time I saw the InStyler on a late night infomercial I thought...YEAH right...I have long, very fine hair which lets put it this way, my older sister got the perfectly straight hair and I got all the natural curls.  I hated this as a kid cause I was the ONLY one in my class (or school for that matter at the time) who had curls-I only wish I had had the InStyler then! THIS IS THE BEST HAIR PRODUCT IF YOU WANT STRAIGHT, SHINY, BEAUTIFUL NON-FRIZZY HAIR!!!  Even if you suffered with Carole King type hair in your youth you can have beautiful shiny hair w/this product.  Not sure about those that say theirs didn&#x27;t work, I have had my first one for two years now and never had any problems w/it and I use it 3 times a week.  I usually wash my hair natural the night before and use my InStyler on dry hair in the morning for best results for me..and it takes ONLY about 10-15 minutes to get my hair looking great too....but I have used it on wet hair as well and it works wonders wet too. Its soooooo amazing to have ONE hair product instead of using a dryer (hard to do when your hair is fine and long-you NEVER get it looking like the salons-but you DO with InStyler) flat iron etc.  I recently bought my 2nd one from a shopping network so I can use their 5 EasyPays (less of a financial blow that way) as I never want to be without mine ever again! BRAVO InStyler peeps--bravo!! Your product is indeed a true Hair Miracle!</li>
            <li> Notice all the 5 star reviews sound similar &amp; the last sentence ends with an !.  The instyler brand is a marketing genius &amp; it looks like there are many fake positive postings that sound like an infomercial.</li>
            <li> I recieved the InStyler for Christmas form my mother in law. I had heard of it, but never heard if it was a good deal or not... I tried it out as soon as I received it, and had my hair straight in less than 20 minutes. Normally, with my Chi or other hair straightener, I would need my husband to help me straighten the back properly, and it would take around 45 minutes to do. The InStyler has litterally cut the styling time in half. I would recommend using the setting lower than they actually recommend. The loudness of the machine which has been complained about in other reviews is a little annoying, but nothing that would keep me from using it.</li>
            <li> I got the instyler for christmas and was phsyced, but after a use or two is started making static-ey noises and wouldnt stay on for more than five seconds. I was afraid of shcocking myself! It is very akward to use and seems like it is in the perspective of a person doing your hair instead of you doing your own hair! Over-all I&#x27;m very disappointed! :(</li>
            <li> I´ve wanted this beatiful tool for a long time, and finally got it. It´s simply the best and faster you can wish for a \\&quot;beatiful looking\\&quot;. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I got it for Christmas as a gift.  My hair is naturally curly, frizzy, dry, etc. This straightens and curls at the same time.  It saves me time and doesn&#x27;t crush my hair like a straightener.  I used to have to blow out my hair with a round brush, straighten it and then if I wanted any volume, use velcro rollers. I have burned myself though quite a few times, pretty painful and easy to do!  That&#x27;s the only downside.</li>
            <li> I am not good at straightening my hair, but with the Instyler, I can do it and it comes out looking smooth and great.</li>
            <li> I am currently on my second InStyler.  The first, my husband got me for Christmas 2 years ago and I fell in love!  I am completely a hair style failure - using any kind of styling tool just ends up making my hair look worse than it did before.  But the InStyler made everything super simple.    I&#x27;ve read some people complaining about not being able to use both hands while styling because there&#x27;s not a cool place to hold on the end.  I can see why this is a problem for other irons but you honestly do not need 2 hands for this.  If you hold the InStyler closed tight and firm and pull down the length of the hair slow, it works perfectly.  I think more of these \\&quot;complaints\\&quot; are user error.    But there are some downfalls.    Cons:    - It can be awkward to get used to, especially after learning that you have to hold it so that it rotates with your hair instead of against it.  If you hold the rotating barrel on the under side of your hair, you&#x27;ll end up with little fly-aways.  It&#x27;s nothing a little hairspray at the end can&#x27;t handle but still a disappointment.  Holding the rotating barrel on the top side of your hair gets rid of those fly-aways but it&#x27;s really awkward to style that.  Or at least it is for me.  I just hold it how it&#x27;s comfortable and deal with the fly-aways at the end with hairspray or a quick sweep with a regular straightener.    - The InStyler get EXTREMELY hot.  To me, this is a plus.  Every salon I have been tells me I have the thickest hair they have ever seen.  It&#x27;s a huge pain and has a mind of it&#x27;s own.  So I always use the highest heat setting and it styles my hair instantly.  I can see how this would be a downfall for others with thinner hair as the intense heat does make the styling process a bit more cautionary.    - The bristles.  Ah, those damn bristles!  The bristles are why I am on my second InStyler.  My first is still running like a champ but the bristles on the brush end look like a 30 year old abused broom - they&#x27;re all frayed and pushedapart.  They were barely even brushing my hair as I was straightening anymore so I had to get a second one.  Unfortunately, the second one is starting to show a bit of use as well in the bristles but I&#x27;m hanging in there.  For as expensive as this tool is, I would think they would sell replacement parts, such as the bristles, that you can easily slide in and out when needed.  This is definitely something they should consider.  I was none too happy when I had to buy another entire unit just because the bristles were pooped out.    - It seems the InStyler was originally designed for professional hair stylists and just got passed to us common folk.  When I use it on other people&#x27;s hair, their hair looks beautiful - just like it does on the models in the commercial.  And I think \\&quot;Now why can&#x27;t I get MINE to look like that?!\\&quot;  And it&#x27;s all because that&#x27;s what it was originally made for, I believe.  Not a deal breaker but they should&#x27;ve redesigned it to make it less awkward and more user-friendly for people doing their own hair.    Pros    - When I would use regular straighteners before, it would take me at least an hour to get my whole head done and to be sure there weren&#x27;t any pieces left unstraightened.  It even takes my hair stylist a good 45 minutes to get my hair completely straight.  With the InStyler, it takes me 20 minutes, tops.      - As I said, my super thick hair with a wave straight from the Pacific Coast, I didn&#x27;t have my sights set too high for this thing.  The test was when I went to bed with my hair wet the night before and woke up to looking like a wild bush woman.  The InStyler had no problem getting it back to a tamed, manageable place.  Granted, sometimes, I may have to go over the same piece 2 or 3 times but who doesn&#x27;t do that anyway?    - Anything that wasn&#x27;t a con, is a pro.  I just love this thing.  I do use a regular hair straightener after I&#x27;m done with the InStyler but it&#x27;s not necessary.  This thing is a beast and an answer to my hair-prayers!</li>
            <li> I love my Instyler! It works great and is easy to use! I have thick, frizzy- curly hair and the Instyler works wonders! I think that its worth what you pay for it because it can both straighten or curl your hair in one easy-to-use tool. (Which would usually take having to purchase a flat iron and curling iron.)</li>
            <li> It worked great for the first two weeks - after that all downhill.  31 days after purchased it stopped working. One day after it could have been returned, would not recommend, nor will I purchase from here again an item that is not returnable if defective.</li>
            <li> I have been waiting for 3 weeks now to receive a prepaid envelope so I can return the InStyler and receive a refund.  By the time I receive the prepaid envelope my 30 days will be up and then I will not be able to return it. I have sent numerous emails to Safari Store and filed a claim with Amazon and still nothing has been done.  At this point, I will never purchase anything from either location.  If I do not receive my prepaid envelope within the next week I will be contacting the Attorney General&#x27;s Office to have this issue handled. From the looks of it I am not the only one who has had issues with this store. I think Amazon should highly consider removing Safari Store from their site since they do not want to attempt to help in resolving issues.  Safari Store even had the nerve to ask me to go back and enter a new and positive review since they are a new and upcoming store.  Can you believe it?  Just send me my prepaid envelope so I can be done with it all and give me my $70 back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had curly hair but wanted smooth, straight styles.  Now I have it.  I can&#x27;t believe it really works so well.</li>
            <li> It took a few times for me to get used to the whirling sound of the styler, but the results are well worth it. I am African American and purchased the styler after my stylist used it on my hair. My hair has more body, the unit doesn&#x27;t make my hair dry.</li>
            <li> The time the Instyler has saved me is priceless.  I had to cancel dates, get-togethers with friends, postpone job interviews ALL because my hair dresser was late to work or wasn&#x27;t around.  I have sat home all weekend because my hair dresser was on vacation and I was too embarrassed to go out anywhere.  For 2 years I haven&#x27;t had to cancel anything because my hair wasn&#x27;t done.  Not only has this saved my money and time but it has effectively changed my life.    The last time I went to a salon was 2 years ago and I was charged $40 for a wash and set around my block, which does not even include a haircut in the Bronx.  I was furious at the price she \\&quot;made up\\&quot; because her price list was strategically nowhere to be found.  I threw the money on her counter and left.  I started seeing infomercials for this Instyler and thought I had to buy it if I ever wanted to see any money in my savings account.    If you do the math, $40 a week, 4 weeks in a month, 12 months in a year... That&#x27;s a lot of money.    Everyone has asked me the last 2 years \\&quot;where did you get your hair done\\&quot; and I tell them I did it myself and they are amazed.  Everyone gives me that \\&quot;eye\\&quot; like I have to be lying.  It looks long, shiny, HEALTHY and beautiful all the time and I&#x27;m NOT PAYING $40 a week for it to look that way anymore.    I haven&#x27;t had to get a relaxer for the last 2 years either.  That is $75 not including tip and I used to have to get it done twice a year.  No more....    The cons are:  -I have split ends and my hair can feel dry sometimes.  -You have to adjust your hands and body so that you know not to let the barrel touch any part of your body but your hair.  Any accidents could easily send you to a hospital.  - My long hair takes about 1-2 hours to iron initially.  A pro to this con is once it is ironed, during the week before work in the morning the touch-ups take up 10 minutes or less.  The commercial claims you can do this in 15 minutes but that&#x27;s BS if you are starting from scratch andespecially if you have long hair like I do.    Also I put the barrel on the TOP of my scalp, not on the bottom.  It gets closer to the root that way.</li>
            <li> I find the end result of the Instyler to be very nice.  My naturally curly frizzy hair is straightened but bouncy unlike flat irons that leave my hair too straight and the ends looking pointy.    Instyler heats up very quickly, but start off on a lower setting than usual because it is VERY hot and it&#x27;s not ceramic.  I use a a heat protectant as well as a drop of Frizz Ease on my ends.    Pros-  *I can straighten my thick frizzy hair faster vs a regular flat iron  *Bouncy, shiny hair    Cons-  *Annoying loud, my neighbor can hear it through our apartment walls (he thought I was drilling!)  *Hard to straighten roots  *Not Ceramic  *Dangerously hot, the shape of this makes it easy to be flimsy and fall. Be Careful! (Please don&#x27;t have this around kids!)    My Verdict-    I&#x27;m pleased with it, but not in love with it.  I have it as an addition to my drawer of styling tools, I don&#x27;t regret buying it but will not be buying another Instyler in the future.</li>
            <li> i love this product.  it gives my fine, wavy hair body and straightness.  i only use the lowest heat setting which is recommended fpr my hair type and it is sill hot.  The barrel is super hot and I have had several burns on my forehead and ears but it is worth it.  my only real complaint is, for a professional type product, the cord should be at least one foot longer. it is far too short.  but, i love it so i will continue to use it religiously everyday!  my friends say my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Brought as a gift for my aunt and she love it. It do not heat up the hair like regular iron.</li>
            <li> This is my second Instyler.  I do truly love this product.  However, the first one I had stopped working after one year.  As a matter of fact, shortly after the warranty expired.  I thought long and hard about getting another one since appox. $100 for only one year is a bit steep.  I waited several months and decided that I like it so much that it was worth getting again.  I am glad that I did.  I just hope this one lasts longer than the last one.  I know some think it is difficult to use, but I find that once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature.</li>
            <li> It felt like forever and a day that I got my Instyler because there was the fourth of July. My Instyler arrived before estamatied arrival date plus It straightend my VERY kinky curly ethnic hair. So all In all I&#x27;m satisfied. Only con Is It didn&#x27;t come with the spary that It normally comes with It.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I have thick coarse hair about shoulder length and it works for me.  The day I got it was damp and rainy and I styled my hair in 5 minutes ladies!  FIVE MINUTES!  Easy to use! Style stays in! Heats up fast! Even with the day being rainy my style stayed in!  Left my hair sleek and soft, the ends perfect!  This is one styling tool I will have with me whever I go!  I bought the red one with the smaller barrel and it fits my needs.  Could never get my hair really straight the way I wanted but this tool does it! I can also get volume on the top of my head as well with little effort.  Sometimes I just need to do the ends and it all blends in well.  Great product!  I have different lengths of hair and it all looks sleek and straight when I&#x27;m finished. I was very skeptical at first because I used a flat iron before and it never worked for me.  I had to go over and over it and by the end of the night...it was frizz again...but I&#x27;ve used this InStyler one time and am very pleased with the way it makes my hair look.  Worth the money!  I swear I am thinking of buying another one just for a back up.  I don&#x27;t think I could do without this product now.</li>
            <li> I was ready to give up straightening my hair until I was told about this product! I normally would straighten my hair once or twice a week since last fall or so. I liked the look but not what it made my hair feel like.I noticed alot of split ends and I go to the salon every 4 weeks,so I know it is not from lack of care or cheaper products. I suffer from Multiple Sclerosis so I am a bit klutzy,and this iron is actually easier for me to use. With the plastic guard it comes with (so you don&#x27;t burn yourself)and the brush incorporated with a rotating cylinder quite like a curling iron it just feels much sturdier in your hands and you really don&#x27;t have to work as hard at getting the style you choose. As long as you work with small sections at a time,just as you do with a plain straightener you will not be damaging your hair because it works on the first try. I am trying all kinds of styles ALL the time now, I really love this product.</li>
            <li> After using a friends instyler, I wanted one of my own and I thought I was getting a deal with this one. It did not have instyler packaging, it was much louder than the one I had used before and it tangled my hair when using it :( I think this might be an older model that may have been used before, or it is just a faulty product. I bought a new one at a kohls store and it works great.</li>
            <li> While I have been interested in this product and was ecstatic that I might have found a bargain; service from this vendor is not efficient or customer friendly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for 2 years and used it about 4 times. To get a semi-decent style, you have to take very small sections and go very slow to style it properly.  It simply takes too long and the results are just OK. You get much better resuls with a simple flat iron or a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I have had frizzy/wavy hair all my life and have NEVER been able to straighten it until the Instyler. My hair was just fuzzy chunks.  Curling irons would just flaten my frizz into flat waves and each hair would go in a different direction.  I must have bought 30 different curling irons thru the years.  A friend recommended the Instyler, she&#x27;d never been able to straighten her hair either. So I bought it and it is the best thing in the world. My husband is sick of hearing about it--it was windy the other day and I told him now my hair can blow and it will just fall right down into place.  I use to see every straight-haired woman on TV and be so envious.  Now my hair falls into my face when I bend over.  I can \\&quot;fling\\&quot; my hair!  I can run my fingers thru my hair and it will fall back into place.  I don&#x27;t need hair spray.  I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair every day, straight hair stays the same even after sleeping on it!  Who knew!  Now I am really too old to wear longer straight hair, where was this product when I was young?  But I&#x27;m wearing long straight hair just for a year or so because I&#x27;ve coveted it for so long.  I don&#x27;t care that I&#x27;m too old and I don&#x27;t care that another style would look better on me.  I LOVE straight hair (coming from a person who&#x27;s had fuzzy hair for 64 years!)  The Instyler&#x27;s brush straightens the hair first so it actually gets \\&quot;ironed\\&quot; straight instead of wavy like a flat iron. And the spinning pulls the hair slightly also to straighten it.  It is unique I think to the products I&#x27;ve tried.  It DOES get hot and I&#x27;ve gotten burned a little twice, but I&#x27;ve learned to use it and I LOVE IT!  Even when I go back to shorter curly hair (only cuz I&#x27;m old) I&#x27;m going to use this to straighten my bangs.  It was worth the money to have one whole year of hair bliss!  I could go on and on about how much I LOVE my straight hair, but the Instyler made it possible.</li>
            <li> Great product, use it every day.  Makes it fast to straighten hair or put a little curl into it!</li>
            <li> what used to take me 20 minutes+ to do with a regular iron, i can now do in 10 minutes or less with the instyler.  and the results are like night and day.    im not sure what all the complainers are going on about.   it does take a few days to get used to.  you can&#x27;t pull it thru your hair too fast and you cant stuff too much of your hair in at once.  You also have to be very careful not to burn yourself, but that is true for any iron.    I suck at using hair stylying tools, but when i use the instyler my hair looks like i went to salon.   I have totally  stopped using any hair products other than shampoo and conditioner.   no more gels, mouse, cream, shiners.   nothing.    and my hair is totally smooth, which is something that it is not naturally.</li>
            <li> I used it 3 times before the cap on the end of the roller popped off and could not be put back on.  I don&#x27;t have long or thick hair, so I can&#x27;t blame it on that.  I think it&#x27;s just not quality construction, but the idea of it is great.  I wish, like many other reviewers, that it could rotate in both directions, as I did have some hair ripped out when trying to pull through counter to the roll.  I am in the salon industry, so I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a novice with hair styling and styling products.  Big hopes, big disappointment.</li>
            <li> This is not worth for free, dries up &amp; ruins the texture of the hair.</li>
            <li> I personally think this item is not comfortable. Specially because it rolls only one way so you have to hold it in the same direction for your right and left side. It does leave your hair feeling very soft. I think it works perfectly when somebody else styles your hair with the instyler. But overall i won&#x27;t recommended.</li>
            <li> This product is better than using a culing iron if you have to use heat on your hair. I really like it and I am glad that I bought it because it really works and now I do not have to worry about my hair breaking off and burning from curling or flat irons. Thank you instyler!</li>
            <li> I have been using the in-styler for, well since it came out....I LOVE the way it makes my hair smooth. I curl it everyday, and I have over processed (over color-treated) hair. But the in-styler makes it look healthy. NOW: The iron itself does not last very long at all when ordered from the in-styler company themselves....but I bought mine from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, and it&#x27;s lasted longer than expected **knock on wood** and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is SUPER wonderful in that they will take back a product even YEARS after you bought it, if it breaks, and with the receipt. With that being said....I wouldn&#x27;t and copuldn&#x27;t use any other hot iron anymore, this is the only one for me. It does take a little getting used to, but I am a \\&quot;pro\\&quot; at it and it really wasn&#x27;t hard at all to \\&quot;get it down\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This company is the worst to deal with.  I regrettably ordered the in styler off the internet and while I like my curling iron, it is by no means worth the money or the headache the company has caused for me.  Subsequent to my purchase, the company (unbeknownst to me) \\&quot;sold\\&quot; my information to a 3rd party business, and now every month I am getting charges on my Visa that I never wanted, nor authorized.  To boot, Instyler will not help.  When I called them, they said there was nothing they could do so now I have spent hours - and months - calling the companies themselves to try and reverse the charges, most of which they will not do.  This company is unethical, and a total pain to deal with.  Save your money and buy a large, round curling iron.  It does the same thing and your life will be so much simpler!</li>
            <li> i received this product and tried it for the first time...on low setting...it burned my hair and forehead very badly...when i called and told them they were of no help...said you had to be careful and all of their instyler rotating irons were super hot i have a bad burn on my face and people should be aware of this item...they do not say anything about this on their commercial...</li>
            <li> got this in june and its not workin no more i hardly use it like seirously this suxed and it was a 5 star product that i loved!</li>
            <li> One of the best things I&#x27;ve ever bought. I curled my daughters hair and later I will post a picture, it&#x27;s amazing, not kidding. SO pretty.  I love it for my hair also. Flip under or over.  Most things I buy are crappy but I will say NOT this item..</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product and finally bought it a couple weeks ago so my mom could get one for Christmas. I now hope she hates it, so I can return both within the 30-day window. Someone posted below it appeared to be made for someone doing someone ELSE&#x27;S hair, which sounds right. If you&#x27;re left-handed, you&#x27;ll love it. But it only spins one way, and it&#x27;s counterintuitive to any right-hander I&#x27;ve ever seen. You have to hold it with the handle facing the BACK of your head, at least on the left side of your head. So I have to straighten/flip the left side of my head with my left hand, which is not my dominant hand and does not allow me control over the item. It also takes FOREVER for the highest setting to turn a solid glowing red, and it doesn&#x27;t do much to my ton of fine hair. Overall, it is the most disappointing purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> I have never had any luck straightening my hair on my own.. My hair is so thick and wavy that a flat iron would just make my hair worse, and it would be so frustrating and uncomfortable! I wanted to buy this over a year ago but didn&#x27;t have the money at the time.. But now, I saved up and bought this earlier this week and I&#x27;m so happy!  It arrived today which surprised me because I didn&#x27;t expect it until at least tomorrow, but all that means is I got to use it before I went out to dinner today. I was already running late and thought maybe I shouldn&#x27;t try and style my hair but I&#x27;m glad I did! It took me LESS THAN TEN MINUTES to completely straighten my hair with a flip and framing. My hair is now soo managed; I would have to go to a salon for results like this!  Don&#x27;t hesitate, buy this tool now if you&#x27;re like me and have very little time everyday but LOVE having straight and managed hair!</li>
            <li> The reseller I purchased this item on Amazon was EUREDOM.The advertisement incorrectly calls it a hair styler however the order summery correctly calls it a hair straightener, not what I wanted. The advertisements indicate that you can use it for many different stylings, untrue. When I went to return it I was advised that they cannot accept a return or refund my charge due to it being a hygienic product. I checked the return policy for Amazon and found that there are only a few items that are generally not returnable, those items involving skin of blood. No hair product of any kind is on the non-returnable list. However EUREDOM still refuses to accept a return. I am very disappointed in this product and the reseller. I wil never purchase anything from this reseller again. Of note they have taken this item down from their storefront. I guess they realize they are wrong in their preseentation, but still refuse to refund me.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I have wanted this product since it first came out and I finally decided to try it. It was really easy to use and I didn&#x27;t burn myself. but I felt that the product did the same job as my 25$ straightener, and no better. It did not rip or pull my hair, which was nice. I tried it on my hair with is not super thick with an annoying wave, my moms waist length curly hair and my little brothers shoulder length rat tail; after those 3 uses the combing bristles were already fraying. I am going to return the Instyler in the morning. I was hoping for a much better product then what was delivered.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This item worked for approximately one minute and then shut down. The voltage requirements were met but the manufacturers of this product failed this customer&#x27;s requirements!It is not worth the risk or dissapointment!</li>
            <li> The Instyler works great it gives your hair body instead of flatting and smashing your hair. It smooths your hair leaving it with body. The product does get very hot you can get burnt the setup could be a little better for the price, as far as the polishing and shining  it don&#x27;t really do to well with that. Overall it&#x27;s a great product because you can straighten, curl, and style your hair all in one.</li>
            <li> Dear Instyler    I just ordered your product November 18th, I haven&#x27;t even received it yet, and I&#x27;m getting spam email as well as telephone calls on my CELL PHONE from telemarketers \\&quot;calling on behalf of Instyler\\&quot; trying to bill my DEBIT CARD for coupons and garbage.      I am completely furious about this.  I ordered your product online and I did NOT check the box that asked if I want to be contacted by 3rd party affiliates.  I DO NOT want to get spammed and telemarketed!     My next issue. Your company shared my personal information without my permission. These companies have my phone number, address, and worst of all, my debit card number.  My DEBIT CARD! My bank account.     I called your customer service number, was hung up on once, then told that it was a company called DEALMAX&#x27;s fault. So I called Dealmax and they have no idea what I am talking about. I don&#x27;t care who may be in control of it now. Ultimately I trusted Instyler with my personal information and you broke that trust.  Instyler shared my personal information, not Dealmax. Also, just so your aware, I made these phone calls from my office phone, which has a handy little feature called the RECORD button.  I have the conversations recorded.      At this point I don&#x27;t care how good your product is, your business ethics SUCK.  I don&#x27;t want your product and I don&#x27;t want to do business with your company. I want my money back (all of it, every penny) and I will continue to use my Revlon flatiron, that I bought from Amazon. Because they don&#x27;t give my personal information to TELEMARKETERS without my permission!      In conclusion, I want a FULL refund, even the seven dollars I paid to jump to the head of the shipping line because your product is so highly in demand.      And then, YOU can contact the companies that you gave my personal information to, and YOU can make sure that they do NOT call or email me again and that my personal information is destroyed.    If you do not give me a FULL refund of every penny you debited from my now compromised account, I will be contacting the Better Business Bureau. Sharing peoples personal information without their permission is ILLEGAL. I did NOT give those telemarketers my debit card information. INSTYLER did. Without my permission.     Then, I will get on every website and every blog on every search engine I possibly can and post this email to make sure that no other innocent consumers get ripped off by your company!     A full refund is the only redeeming value you have at this point.      I will not settle for anything less, and I don&#x27;t want any apologetic emails or phone calls. I want resolution. Immediately.  I don&#x27;t pay a dime for an attorney, I work for one, so please don&#x27;t make him necessary. I will sue your company for sharing my bank account information, and compromising my finances if I have to.</li>
            <li> About a month ago my daughter bought one, works perfectly on her very fine medium lenght, wavy, limp hair.  Gives it body and straightens it without frizzing.  She has paid more for professional type flat irons that fried her hair and didn&#x27;t do half the job.  So I tried it--I&#x27;m 60 with short somewhat wavy hair with no body.  Hair always needed lots of product to give it any lift.  Now I use no products!!  My hair looks the best it ever has. We have had no mechanical problems with our instylers. Also, neither one of us has burned ourselves.  Perhaps that&#x27;s because we both have tried many, many different types of curling irons, flat irons, etc. and have learned how not to burn ourselves.  All of these types of machines have the potential to burn a person with just a tiny slip of the hand. Seriously, I cannot consider ever going without an instyler now.</li>
            <li> I purchase the instyler on qvc, this thing will give you several burns!! I&#x27;m glad I order from them because  a month after I purchased the Instyler they send me a plastic that prevents you from burning. You might want to call the manufacter I believe they have it at no additional cost. Anyways if you have it get the plastic to avoid burns If you don&#x27;t have it, you don&#x27;t need it!! I will just make your hair very puffy I have long, curly hair &amp; this thing make it realy bad. My hair does not look straight every time I use it I have to use a flat iron to finish it. Instead I order the old revo styler spinner brush that had work way better for me, than this thing.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying this product is made with cheap plastics and even cheaper screws, so you have to be a little delicate with it.  I had to send mine back as the first one broke in shipping, but my replacement was fine.    Anywho, it totally works!  I&#x27;m racially mixed, black and white; my hair is on the coarser side of things but it totally polished my hair and straightened it.   The key is to use small sections of already detangled hair but they give you a parting comb that works pretty well.  I have thin short hair so it took me 30 mins to give my self a cute full bodied straight do with the ends curled under.   Its really easy to give it volume and it does leave your hair super soft.  I&#x27;ve only used it once so I can&#x27;t tell if its as damaging as the other straighteners I&#x27;ve tried, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is.  And I don&#x27;t have to use it on high so there was no burnt hair smell!   I think if you&#x27;re going to spend $70 on a curling iron and a straightener you might as well just buy this baby and save yourself some time.     Also it is a little hard to use on my hair because you have to make sure its rotating in the proper direction, but I&#x27;ve always had trouble straightening my hair on my own so it could just be me.</li>
            <li> EXTERIOR IS SO FULL OF DAMAGES, ROTATING PART DOESN&#x27;T EVEN ROTATE, SO MUCH DIFFERENT KINDS OF HAIR IN THE BRUSH PART DISGUSTING!! AND THE HEAT SETTINGS WON&#x27;T STAY ON THE SETTING YOU CHOOSE! GOT RIPPED OFF TRULY NO WAY THIS ITEM WAS TESTED BEFORE GOING OUT. TOOK OUR 80.00 AND RAN! IGNORES MESSAGES AS WELL!! BAD SIGN NO COMMUNICATION. OF COURSE COMMUNICATE VERY WELL BEFORE SELL AND AFTER THAT DROP YOU LIKE A HAT. WITH ALL OF OUR WONDERFUL PURCHASES HERE ON AMAZON WE HAVE BEEN VERY BLESSED UNTIL NOW. WE FINALLY GOT A BAD SEED. BREEZED THRU OUR BUYS UNTIL NOW!! KARMA!!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying this product after reading many of the reviews, but curious enough to go ahead and buy ONE at Bed, Bath and Beyond with a 20% off coupon.  I am in love with this styler.  I used a straightening iron on my thick, frizzy hair for years, and often I would still have to pin it back to keep it from frizzing.  With this styler, I straighten/curl and go, and the body and style last all day.  I asked my hair stylist if my hair was damaged after using it for a couple of months, and she said my hair looks very healthy!  Some of the bad reviews are regarding the longevity or quality of the product and issues with it breaking or it quits working.  I have had the InStyler for nearly 3 months now.  In my mind, after having so few \\&quot;bad hair days\\&quot; since I&#x27;ve bought this, I would probably have to try to come up with another $80 if it broke on me after the one year warranty expired.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I really liked the instyler for was my bangs but my biggest issue is that the rolling part of the brush burned my forehead and it burned it in the same place twice. I never had this issue with a regular flat iron. Also, the bristles bent after one use and it makes my ends raggedy and damages them because they are bent. I would not recommend using this item on wet/damp hair like it claims you can. This will just lead to excessive damage. I think I&#x27;ll stick to my regular flat iron. Too bad I can&#x27;t get my money back though... I wish I ordered it at the 30 day trial price instead so I didn&#x27;t have to spend $80+ on something I don&#x27;t even like.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love this product!  We were using a regular ceramic hot iron and our hair was becoming so dry.  This product not only straightens your hair it leaves it soft and silky!</li>
            <li> I have coarse, wavy, color treated hair and have had minimal luck with flat irons. The Instyler is easy to use and works great on my hair. It takes a bit less time too. Takes out the frizzies, waves and leaves pretty, silky hair. Also great for the humid Florida climate that causes the frizzies. I Wasn&#x27;t sure about paying so much for it but once a friend tried hers on me I was sold. Not sure how you could burn yourself as it comes with a heat shield.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and usually use my Paul Mitchell straightener at 400 degrees to straighten my hair and I have no problems.  I bought this hoping it would be great for curling my hair since I saw on TV how it did great on all types of hair.  I set it at the 200 degree temp (the lowest setting) and it smelled like my hair was on fire.  It also left a burn mark on my natural blond highlights on the small section I tested near my face.  On top of that, it didn&#x27;t curl at all.  My hair curls really easily and will stay with little hairspray until I wash it out.  For this to not curl my hair and as expensive as it is, that was a big disappointment.  It was the biggest waste of money that I have ever spent.  It maybe gave a small amount of volume at the roots, but that is probably only because it frizzed the hair near my scalp just before burning it.  I had to wash my hair immediately because I kept smelling burnt hair even an hour after I had finished testing.  It appears that some people have had luck with it, but I was not one of them.  I wish I could say differently.  Since I can&#x27;t return it since it is a hair product, it is now sitting in my closet to collect dust.  Best of luck to you if you decide to take the risk and purchase it.  I hope it works better on you than it did for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Instyler from Amazon.  I was really happy with the way it styled my naturally-curly hair.  I could wear a relaxed do which garnered many compliments.  However, the Instyler began to malfunction.  I called Instyler as instructed in the warranty.  I was told that if I purchased the product from Amazon it was not covered under the warranty.  Amazon is NOT AUTHORIZED to sell the product.  Instyler covers only products purchased directly from the company, from the TV station, or from a store (I assume that means a building you can visit).  The service person even suggested that it could be a \\&quot;knockoff\\&quot;.  I told her it had all the authentic documentation; she had no comment on that.  My Instyler cannot be repaired, and my $80 is gone along with my hopes of a straighter more flattering hair style.  Sarah Capponi</li>
            <li> this product is easy enough to use for the most part but it&#x27;s not as awesome as the tv commercials show it to be; it leaves my hair pretty much the same as when i use a flat iron. i mainly bought it so i could give my hair volume without teasing it but as it turns out, you have to hold the roller really close to your scalp for a long period of time and spray this recommended spray (that the company also sells) onto your hair in order to have it work right. my hair is pretty fine and it just didnt work the way i expected it to i.e. the way they said it would.</li>
            <li> I ordered the InStyler for my Mother on a Monday; the package arrived on Wednesday!  I was completely surprised at the packaging...it was eloquently wrapped and my Mom was non the wiser.  Laser Tronix exceeded my expectations and I plan to do business in the future with this company.</li>
            <li> it is a awesome product. a blower and hair curler in one! but if you have bangs this is not for bang management. it makes them all pointy and stiff so stick to a real blower for that.</li>
            <li> I thought it didn&#x27;t heat up...that you just plugged it in and it worked it&#x27;s magic but it for me only works on the high setting and I&#x27;m trying to get away from heating my hair up. The advertisements that are shown on tv seem to let people know it works better than what it really does. It takes a few times on my hair to straighten it. Not the people that I got it from&#x27;s fault though. The items was brand new and worked the way it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this thing. Basically its an overpriced Flat iron. This does the same exact thing as the ones that they sell in the store for $20.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just another \\&quot; As Seen On TV\\&quot; junk.</li>
            <li> I recieved this straightner for christmas from my mom. And let me tell you it is amaaaaaaaaaaazing. :) I have very thick hair and I color it as well so for this tool to not only straighten and give my hair shine but it didn&#x27;t burn or fry my hair. Since the barrel rotates your able to curl and do other very cute hair styles. Worth every penny. The quality is top of the line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using super-hot products for years, since that&#x27;s what&#x27;s needed on my thick, frizzy hair. Of all the ones I&#x27;ve used, this is by far the easiest. I&#x27;ve never been able to do my whole head of hair in under an hour -- and with the Instyler, I&#x27;m done in 20 minutes. I never even thought that was possible! It&#x27;s very easy-to-use. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have never wrote a review before but so far this tool has been great.  I&#x27;ve had it for a week and finally for the first time have liked my hair.  I have slightly fine yet wavy hair that had so many fly aways if I tried to blow dry it.  I shower the night before, use it the next day and it&#x27;s awesome. Damp to dry is fine but my hair seems dryer and not as nice.  Hopefully time will tell and my hair doesn&#x27;t get damaged.      The only thing I don&#x27;t like it that it seems unstable when you set it down.  I bought a thermal pouch from Sally Beauty so that I could put it in something that would be safer as it cools down (have a young child in the house).</li>
            <li> Several things point toward the Instyler I received being a bootleg:  wrong spelling on the label, the heating element doesn&#x27;t do what the instructions say, there are two different versions of the instructions and one seems more legit than the other.  Having said that, it works for me so far (used it for a week so far).  Although I am very right handed and pretty inept with the left, I did not find it too hard to use the Instyler, which some reviewers complained about.  We will see how long this lasts.  If this one breaks, I will probably order directly from the manufacturer&#x27;s website to make sure I get the real thing.</li>
            <li> I bought this item mostly to straight my hair. I used it today for the first time and I started from the lower temperature, but it was not doing a good job. So I set it on medium temperature,and still I was not happy with the result. I set it then on high and the light flashed for very long time (like 15 minutes) before to stop. I almost tought it was broken. When the light finally stopped flashing, I used it and I got a good result. But when I saw this item advertised on tv, they said that it would have not burned my hair. This is not true because the barrel gets very hot and you need to be careful to not burn 1) your hands; 2) your scalp; 3) your eyes; 4) your hair!!! It really took me a while to do my hair because I had to be very careful in not getting burned!!! Plus it makes a pretty loud noise.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE IN-STYLER AND IT IS EASY TO USE, HOWEVER I WISH IT HAD SOME KIND OF RUBBER FEET OR STAND ON IT. SINCE IT IS HOT ALL OVER IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO PUT DOWN ON SOMETHING WHILE USING (FURNITURE OR VANITY). OTHER WISE PRODUCT WORKS VERY WELL AND MAKES MY HAIR NICE AND SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to get the InSyler for sometime but wanted to get the best price. After using the product I was pleased with how quickly it worked the magic of straighten my hair. The brush pulled my hair somewhat is why I did not give it a 5.</li>
            <li> I got an InStyler as a holiday gift in December &#x27;09.  The individual I received it from is not someone who ordinarily gives expensive gifts, and I had never heard of the product before.  I tried it a few times, but the result on my shoulder-length, baby-fine, naturally straight but highlighted hair was a frizzy mess.  I think I gave it to my teenage daughter to try and she didn&#x27;t like it either, and I can&#x27;t even remember what became of it after that...I think it might&#x27;ve taken a trip to Goodwill, or (cringe) actually gone into the trash!  I just happened across the reviews on a website when I was looking for a new flat iron for my daughter and couldn&#x27;t believe this product was almost $100!  I did read one review which made me realize I might have been using it incorrectly...but it sounds as though the proper way to use it would&#x27;ve been so awkward I would&#x27;ve eventually given up on it anyway.  Oh well, next time I receive a gift and don&#x27;t know what it is, I will definitely look it up...at least I would&#x27;ve tried to find a new home for it rather than throw it out, had I known!</li>
            <li> Had to figure out wich direction to hold the instyler on each side of my hair. My hair is not stringy or clumpy after styling, holds all day long with no frizz.</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair that has a tendency to frizz.  This tool is wonderful and quick to use. It does \\&quot;polish\\&quot; the hair.  I did not order from amazon - but from QVC (sorry amazon)and got the stand that the styler sits in as part of the package and it is so helpful when styling so I can put it down and not have it laying and burning on the countertop. A couple things to remember    1.It does get hot like any other tool - you can put it on the lowest setting as it has 3  2.There is a learning curve - go slowly when learning  3.Help your hair out by styling it in layers (bottom up) and then you will have better results  4.Use heat protection product when using</li>
            <li> When I ordered the InStyler I was skeptical; I was concerned that it would not be able to handle my curly, kinky hair.  It worked brilliantly!  While I cannot speak to whether or not it will last (a concern raised in other reviews), I can tell you it worked very well on what my friends kindly call my crazy hair!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE my instyler!!  I have used a chi for about ten years now.  I am Arabian/Mexican so I have extremely thick and curly hair, that goes past my belly button.  I blow dry my hair before I use it.  It works just as good as the infomercial.  It does make noise but I love it.  It curls it straightens it has replaced my curling iron entirely.  I read the reviews before and I was almost positive i didn&#x27;t want it but I took  a chance and I am so Happy!!!!!! I do have color treated hair too.  My bangs are bleaced white and then redyed every week pink, and it polishes them like new.  No split ends on here!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have owned this straightener for about eight months now. I was driven to purchase this after seeing the infomercials on tv. I am biracial with course dry hair and I hoped this iron wouldn&#x27;t dry out my hair and possibly give it a little shine. Here is what I noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;My hair had a much lighter body to it even though I use a lot of oils my hairs was still light.&lt;br /&gt;This gave my hair a little shine, because of the rotation.&lt;br /&gt;I am able to straighten larger sections of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Gives volume.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I have to go over the section of hair a couple times before it&#x27;s really straight.&lt;br /&gt;I have to go very slowly through each section to get the full effect.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to burn yourself if you don&#x27;t use the heat shield! Especially when you get near the roots.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a long time to heat up.&lt;br /&gt;Laves my hair frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest using this along with another iron to straighten your hair. I use an ion flat iron to get shorter sections and underneath and then I use the instyler to do my bangs because it creates a nice flip.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased and received the Instyler directly from the company. I had seen the commercials and infomercials a number of times and always thought to myself, \\&quot;There&#x27;s no way that thing actually works.\\&quot; Not too long ago I noticed that the company now offers the Instyler in 2 sizes and a 14-day trial. So I ordered one with the reasoning that I&#x27;ve wasted $15 on much worse in my life. When I ordered they were also offering 2 for 1 so I ordered one of each size. I will admit that it did take awhile to receive my order since the company is in Canada but that&#x27;s nothing either the company or I could help. I received both Instylers, 2 combs, 2 travel bags, 2 training protectors, a heat protective counter mat, and an instructional DVD. The main reason I purchased this product is because having thin hair I have never gotten my hair to hold any kind of curl. My hair is naturally wavy but I must put a lot of product in it to get it to even hold what little curl it has. I washed my hair with shampoo and conditioner and then blow-dried as I normally would. I then sectioned my hair and began the curling process. Yes the styler will get hot, it will be very hot. As almost every styling tool does. The Instyler does have 3 heat settings and the finer your hair the less heat you probably need. That being said I did use mine on the highest setting. And yes, I did burn myself. I just feel that it comes with the territory of using a heated styling tool. In fact, I&#x27;ve burnt myself without just about every curling iron and straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned. To curl your hair you simply wrap sections of your hair around the tool, squeeze the tool together allowing the iron to rotate for a few seconds, release and allow your hair to gently fall away from the iron. My hair had a perfect curl! Better results than I&#x27;ve ever gotten in my entire life. The tool does make a noise when the barrel is rotating, it doesn&#x27;t bother me because if it has moving parts I expect it to make noise. I was ableto curl my entire head of hair in about 30 minutes. Yes there is a learning curve because the Instyler should be held a certain way to get the results your are looking for, but it took me a few days getting used to my straightener so I think a couple of uses and a little patience is all you need. Those of you who may be worried about heat damage, that happens any time you use heat on your hair. You should be conditioning your hair and using some of kind of heat protectant no matter what styling tool your are using. Plus give it more than one shot, nothing is perfect the first time you do it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after my stylist used it on me, it worked well when she used it. The item came brand new in the box and thought it had done an ok job. After a few uses I noticed that it never got very hot and as soon as I started using it the lights would start flashing. I don&#x27;t think it ever reached full power. I sent it back today and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying another one. Will continue to look for something similar that doesn&#x27;t have so many mechanical issues.</li>
            <li> I have owned the Instyler for over a year and I am stil in love with it. The main thing I love about it is that it works on all hair types. I have used this on my friend&#x27;s very thin, fine hair and it didnt burn off her hair.I have very course, thick hair and when I&#x27;m done it&#x27;s slick and smooth. This is one of the products that really lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li> I watched the advertisements many times and was convinced that this was a miracle hair tool. I have baby fine hair that is very difficult to style. I have used a $20 hair dryer/curling brush two-in one product that works as well as this. This is not worth the price. It is a nice tool, but I would have stuck with the $20 hair styler from Wal-Mart if I had an opportunity to use the instyler before I purchased it. I will probably pass it on to someone else. It&#x27;s no better than any other straightener, curling iron, blow dryer brush, etc.</li>
            <li> I received a defective product.  I had to return it at a cost to me of $12.50.  The vendor does not have a replacement and has yet to issue me a refund two weeks after having received it back (according to UPS tracking information).  So, obviously, this has not been a good experience for me.  I have an Instyler myself, so am not critical of the product. [[ASIN:B003D85M6S InStyler ® Rotating Iron]]</li>
            <li> This is the WORST product I have ever encountered &amp; a total waste of money!! Hard to believe they are still on market.  Want to return it!!!   First, it takes forever to heat---then it actually does nothing. Between 2 daughters &amp; myself-with different hair textures &amp; straight, curly etc.--a real no go of any of us. Don&#x27;t waste yoaur money!!!!</li>
            <li> Product works great at first.  After 5 months, it started catching my hair and tearing it out.  After another month, it finally tore out a huge chunk of my hair and then the end spun off.  I called to return it to the manufacturer.  They set up the return, but when they gave me the shipping info, they said I was responsible for paying the return shipping for the defective product.  Poor customer service, I guess they don&#x27;t count on repeat customers.</li>
            <li> Love the idea, hate the quality.  I had it for maybe two months, and it just stopped working. The barrel didn&#x27;t turn any longer.  This is not ok. For the money, it should have lasted alot longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Instyler for almost 2 years now and I don&#x27;t use anything else.  It definitely gets hot, and you have to be careful getting used to it or setting it too close to anything that might melt.  It&#x27;s also noisy, but you can get over that because it works so well.  The one thing I will say is, while it does straighten your hair, it will always leave it with a little texture (bounce and volume) - if you want a flat look, this will not be the tool for you.  Though, you could use the Instyler initially and then flatten the ends with a flat iron I suppose.      I got mine direct from the infomercial on the buy one get one offer.  The first one I opened didn&#x27;t work.  I called up the 800 number and explained the situation (it made a terrible grinding noise but didn&#x27;t rotate) so they told me to box it up and send it back for a replacement.  No hassles.  When I got the replacement, they sent me another two! I thought I&#x27;d keep all 3 in case something happened to the one I&#x27;m using, but it&#x27;s been 2 years and it still works great.    My hair is naturally curly and using the instyler takes 15 minutes at the most once it&#x27;s heated up.  I&#x27;ve never found a faster, more efficient way to straighten my hair silky smooth without product.  I&#x27;m keeping my 2 extra Instyler irons so that I&#x27;ll be able to use it forever.</li>
            <li> So far the product lives up to what they say it does. Gives the hair shine and body.  I would recommend the product to anyone wanting to purchase.</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair frizzy and doesnt curl the way its presented in the video. In addition, its not user friendly.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this hair tool.  It is 1,000 times better than a flat iron - because it gives me body as well as making it straighter.  There are a few drawbacks that kept me from giving it 5 stars though.  First off you can get burned easily with the product.  The &#x27;burn guard&#x27; makes the product hard to manage through the hair and just plain gets in the way.  So to properly get your hair done - you gotta take the chance of a few little burns.  Now - I&#x27;ve had this product for about 1 1/2 years.....and all of a sudden it shuts off every 5 minutes or so while being used.  i then have to unpug it and turn it back on.  It would seem that something is going awry in the cord/connection and it sort of freezes up.  For the price of the product it&#x27;s a shame that it doesn&#x27;t have a longer endurance life.    it would seem that you have to buy a new one every year to two years.....and that makes me give it the only 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this rotating iron because:  - it was supposed to add shine and volume at the root. There is some truth to this save for the fact that the rotating iron burns your scalp and forehead if you try to get it anywhere near your roots. It does come with a \\&quot;thermal shield\\&quot; to protect you from this but the shield only protects one small &lt;1\\&quot; area on top of the rotator... which if you are straightening/ lifting your roots, it is the side of the rotator that burns you.  - the box says it \\&quot;styles in 1/2 the time!\\&quot; It does not do this at all. I generally blow dry my curly, course hair with a straightening brush and then use a ceramic flat iron to smooth and add shine... if you are trying to get to your roots, this takes much more time to do with the Instyler and the *shine results are less with it than with a ceramic flat iron.*  - it said \\&quot;410 degrees F ceramic heat.\\&quot; This lead me to think it was ceramic coated (which is much safer and less damaging to your hair... giving you less breakage and split ends.) That was a foolish assumption on my part. The rotating barrel is not ceramic coated. I actually looked everywhere in the instructions, on the box, and even searched the internet to find out what the barrel was comprised of... no success. Although, I do hope that after I write this, the facts will come forward.  - it was expensive! I always think that if something is expensive, it is well made and will last long. This is not the case with the product here. In fact, reading a lot of these reviews, I found that you are lucky if it lasts more than a year. My hair stylist recommended that I go to a beauty supply store or look into buying a ceramic Chi flat iron online. She said to make sure the iron is ceramic. I have looked at reviews on this Chi flat iron, which can be found around the same price, and read much better customer reviews. Some customers even say that their Chi iron lasted them 6+ years. This may be my next purchase.</li>
            <li> Long story short, it&#x27;s being returned. (Purchased at Target for $97.) I have really thick, curly hair and therefore rarely straighten my hair. When I do I use a Maxiglide. I was hoping the InStyler would help to do it faster as it can literally take me hours to straighten all my hair. I will say this, it works. For the few pieces of hair I tried, it did get straight. But it was not silky or shiny as promised. The biggest problem for me and why it is being returned is that (while not mentioned in the directions) the barrel needs to only roll one way (towards the bristles). If you do it the other way, the hair gets kicked out. The issue with this is that the way the barrel rolls means I had to do my hair with my left hand. I am right handed, so this was tricky. So on top of using my non dominate hand, the heating element is exposed which can lead to some pain. What sent me over the edge to decide to return was when I tried to do the hair in the back of my head and realizing that I still had to do it left handed AND I can&#x27;t see back there. I didn&#x27;t want to even attempt as the thought of bumping that hot barrel into my hand or head was too much! If there was a way to make the barrel roll the other way, that would have been so much better. Maybe this tool was originally intended for use of DOING someone elses hair. I guess that would work. Good Luck!</li>
            <li> OK, so I have a 13 year old, and this is her first time using a hair styler. I was really nervous that she would burn herself, but to my surprise she didn&#x27;t. The inStyler is great because we got one with a protective counter topper to lie the hot styler on, and it came with an instructional DVD. I made sure she watched it, and after viewing that very easy-to-follow video, I let her try it out. Being her first time (and mine), I was shocked at how fast it was to straighten our hair. I was even more shocked, even pleased, that our hair stayed straight throughout the whole day. I do not regret buying the inStyler, we will be using it every day from now on. This product is very simple, so anyone can do it, even first timers.</li>
            <li> This is just a great product.  My hair is happy and so am I.  It is just an amazing tool.  I have used flat irons and they were just ruining my hair--also I couldn&#x27;t get a \\&quot;volume look\\&quot;, but just flat.  With the instyler everything goes quickly and my hair looks great.  People are commenting on it and wonder what I am doing that is different than before--and I just say Instyler! Instyler!</li>
            <li> I am about to purchase my third InStyler. I absolutely love mine!! It really makes my hair look great! Really, it does! I purchased my first and second one from QVC about 4 years ago. Actually it was a special where I got both for $99 + s&amp;h. I know, great buy right? The only problem is that the on/off switch wears out too quickly. I do use it nearly everyday though, so I suppose I did get my money back out of them. Oh well, the fact is that this is a great styling tool and well worth every penny. I will continue to replace mine each time it wears out.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mid-length hair and the resutls are no different from a standard flat iron.  I couldn&#x27;t curl it at all with this product and the chances that the rotating barrel will stop working are too great to justify the big price tag.  I am returning it.</li>
            <li> i absolutely swear by this product! i must admit that i&#x27;m very handy with a flat iron, but i don&#x27;t like that slick straight look (though i have thick hair to pull it off so it doesn&#x27;t look flat). i love flips and volume. with the InStyler, i am able to do just that. i always have friends and co-workers thinking that i pay to get my hair blown dried by a professional. nope... its this product! i&#x27;ve had my InStyler for about 2 years going on 3. it fell once on me, and cracked a bit on the handle. but it still works great! i&#x27;ve been reading reviews that it&#x27;s awkward to hold. i don&#x27;t find that when i&#x27;m holding it. i guess it&#x27;s something to get used to. anytime my sister and i meet up, the first thing she says is : \\&quot;Bring the InStyler!\\&quot;.  i don&#x27;t recommend this for those of you that have short, pixie style hair. your hair won&#x27;t be long enough and you&#x27;ll burn yourself. but i did see that they came out with a smaller model.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in store rather than online because my CHI straightener broke and I needed a straightener ASAP!!  The commercial made it seem like the greatest product on the earth that would make me happy with how my hair would turn out. I have been a loyal CHI user for years, but I decided to give this new \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; straightener a try.  I WAS NOT HAPPY AT ALL!!  It did NOT deliver results like it said.  I followed the instructional DVD verbatim and it did not work. My hair is not super curly.  It is wavy and thick, but I sectioned it off into smaller pieces like I normally do when straightening my hair. I found myself straightening the same area over and over again and my hair still wasn&#x27;t as straight as it was with one pass through with my CHI straightener.  My hair is somewhat coarse naturally, but my hair felt worse after using it. Not smooth and polished like the product claims.  My hair looked unpolished, frizzy, and, to be quite honest, lion mane like which is the opposite goal of what straightening your hair is supposed to achieve.  The InStyler was heavy and I found myself having to take multiple breaks to let my arm rest; therefore, making the process take longer, not cutting my styling time in half like the product claims to be able to do.  I used every temperature setting it had and none of them worked for my hair.  I also tried using it to make the volume on my crown and it did NOT do a thing.&lt;br /&gt;  I thought since it was my first time using it and it was different that any straightener I had ever used I would give it a second chance and then a third one. I guess I was hoping maybe there was a learning curve to using it and I was just an incredibly slow learner; even though I have been using hair straighteners since I was thirteen years old.  I even had my friend who is a professional hair stylist watch me to make sure I was doing it right.  She said she couldn&#x27;t figure out why it wasn&#x27;t working because I was doing everything the exact way I wassupposed to. It did not straighten, curl, or flip out my hair like the infomercial showed.  I never buy things I see on TV (the Topsy Turvy, the Snuggie, the Nu wave oven etc. )and this product has made me realize why I don&#x27;t. (side note: my aunt doesn&#x27;t recommend the Nu Wave oven...but I digress.)&lt;br /&gt;  Since I had used the product multiple times and it was out of the packaging I was told returning the item was not an option.  Not by the store I bought it from, but by the people who invented this atrocity.  I was told I had to go through the InStyler manufacturer directly.  Which is not only inconvenient but bad customer service. I feel I should be able to return it and get my money back if the product did not successfully perform the one task it is designated to do.  I think Kohl&#x27;s and possibly Wal-Mart now even take back things without receipts. And the things I purchase there are usually no more than twenty dollars, not the one hundred dollars I spent on the InStyler.&lt;br /&gt;  In conclusion, do not waste your time, efforts, or money on the InStyler Rotating Iron. You will be very disappointed.  My personal recommendation is the CHI straightener.  I have been using it for years and it works great EVERY time.  The CHI straighteners last years and do a phenomenal job.  They are lightweight, they have cute colors, and it does what it is supposed to, which is straighten your hair. I feel such guilt for not purchasing another one right away after the one I had before it broke. Just so you know, the CHI I had that broke that started this whole fiasco I purchased my sophomore year of high school and just broke when I was 24.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Also make sure NOTHING is near the InStyler while it is heating up.  It melted the cord on my blow dryer.  So not only did I waste my money on this horrible product, but I then had to go and buy a new blow dryer.  I also still needed a straightener so I went and purchased another CHI; a product which ALWAYS performs great and will for many years to come.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t as impressive as I thought.&lt;br /&gt;I had a cheap $15 hair straightener from Walgreens before this and then someone gave this to me as a gift after mine broke after 2 years. Now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a little it seems more like a joke. It&#x27;s very very hard to work with side-swept bangs and little hair because of the curvature. If you have long somewhat already straight hair thats medium-thin thickness then yes this is for you. But if it&#x27;s short and thick or just thick in general then i would recommend just a regular flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;And it takes a very long time to heat up.&lt;br /&gt;The commercials are appealing but the actual product itself needs more work.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried curling my hair and it doesn&#x27;t do a very good job unless you want to put 500 products in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to buy another one of the straightener i used to have before this one.</li>
            <li> I have an original Instyler (Zebra print) which I bought from Canada and  love it so much. Have been using for two years, it styles my hair quickly and nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware! I ordered one on Amazon from Select electronics for my sister, but disappointed so much. Looks very cheap and fake. The barrel moves abnormally, and hair get tangled into it. I am afraid it will not work properly. Feeling so bad she lost her money because of me.</li>
            <li> After years of trying to balance flat irons and curlers I decided to try the instyler. I think that is an a ok product. I liked that there was an attachment so you don&#x27;t get yourself burned and a pouch to stored it in. It does get relatively hot. There are three heat settings each going up to thin to thick hair. I think that for someone who has thick hair such as myself it is more time consuming to have to really put small sections at a time versus a very hot flat iron. I know you have to section off your hair as with any hot tool but this one especially because the rotor sounds as if it will break if you don&#x27;t. This being said the motor is very loud and annoying. I do like that you can really style you&#x27;re hair as you go in one go versus other hot tools that you have to use interchangeably. If you&#x27;re worried about your hair getting snagged or stuck it hasn&#x27;t happened to me. I suppose this would be great to use after you&#x27;ve already straightened or blow dried your hair but want a more styled look. It&#x27;s much easier just using this for a touch up versus using it to do your hair from the beginning. I would recommend this for people who don&#x27;t have very thick hair because it would be a breeze for you to do your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this item!  It&#x27;s very easy to use and easy to straighten and flip. I am still working on learning how to curl, and it&#x27;s not as easy as a regular curling iron, but once you get the hang of it is nice to have one tool for multiple uses.  The only real issue with the item is that there is no guard ar anything to keep you from getting burned so it is tough to get the areas close to your ears and the nape of your neck.  I would highly recommend this item to anyone who toggles between curling and straightenign their hair!</li>
            <li> Get a flat iron will be better off!now a days flat iron will curl and put volume in your hair! DO NOT GET THIS!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to work but I was suprised. I&#x27;ve been battling my long, thick, curly hair for years and have found a simple solution. It is worth buying if you want to manage your hair. The process is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> This straightner does a great job on my hair. I have curly thin hair and most straightners run too hot and make my hair very flat. I was very pleasantly surprised to see that this one has a Low setting, and makes my hair look very full. And I don&#x27;t have nearly the amount of damage I did when using a flat iron every day, I&#x27;m guessing because of the low heat setting. It looks a little bit cheaply made with the silver-painted plastic, but it has worked great for me for 6 months now with no signs of quitting. Once it does finally kick the bucket, I&#x27;m for sure going to get another one. The reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is only because I think they should change the design so that you can reverse the direction that the spins. It&#x27;s a little awkward because you have to hold it to go one direction so it doesn&#x27;t spin \\&quot;against the grain\\&quot; or your hair, and once you get to the other side of your head and want to switch hands, you can&#x27;t because then the barrel will spin the wrong way... I don&#x27;t know how else to explain it but you&#x27;ll see what I mean when you get one.  I got used to using my other hand though, so it&#x27;s not a big deal for me anymore.</li>
            <li> I was excited at first to find a product that will work on my thick hair. And the product did work great... for about two weeks. First, it started turning itself off a minute or two after being turned on, then the barrel would no longer rotate.    I have tried repeatedly to contact customer service, but have yet to receive any sort of response.    If you can afford to pay around 100 bucks to replace it every two weeks, then it&#x27;s a great product, otherwise don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best styling tool i have ever owned!  It essentially a hair dryer, straightener and curler all in one.  I just wash my hair, towel dry, put a little product in it, and style.  The style stays pretty well until i wash it out, so i only have to style it after each wash.  I have medium length, thin to medium hair thickness.</li>
            <li> I have natural african american hair: very curly in spots and some frizzy dry spots. I have been using the instyler since the spring of 2009 and it has been a wonder. I am inept at blow-out with the traditional blowdryer - it just turns into a big frizzy bush.  The In-styler has been a no-brainer; after a one hour set with leave-in conditioner, under the dryer, the in-styler puts the finishing touch. During the procedure, I apply heat resistance products on the ends and then every night. I have done this once or twice a week and I am very pleased. When looking for a job, it is a neater more polished look than an afro-bush.   I have not sustained any damage - in fact my hair has grown. My friends are all amazed and so am I.</li>
            <li> This works great...for the folks on TV. In real life, it made my bangs stick out at odd angles and it made them look like they were fried...SOOO not the look I was going for. I have a short to medium length bob, so this should have been the perfect styling tool. Please note my use of the words SHOULD HAVE BEEN.     My biggest gripe is that instead of the hair coming out nice and smooth as shown on TV, it seems to grab the hair underneath and pull it up backwards through the bristles, which makes a VERY nice \\&quot;rat&#x27;s nest\\&quot; for you to have to try to comb out. I&#x27;ve tried several different things to avoid this, but nothing seems to work. As for getting the little curl under or flip up at the end, well, that created an even bigger tangle for me to deal with.    It does get hot, but not very fast, and if you take super tiny sections the tangles aren&#x27;t quite so bad. It does appear to polish the strands as stated on TV and it does give the hair a nice shine. It creates great volume at the crown if you have shorter hair there. If you have hair that is pretty short, though, please be aware that the roller part of this is large, so anything shorter than maybe 4 inches is going to be too short to even try to do lest you end up with major burns.     Oh, also, on TV during the demos, you&#x27;ll notice that they use an Instyler that has red \\&quot;accents\\&quot; while the one you get has yellow. Perhaps that is the reason it works so much better on TV.</li>
            <li> I received my In-Styler several days ago - and tried it today - New Year&#x27;s Eve and it didn&#x27;t even turn on!  I&#x27;m returning this item - and not bothering to replace it.  Ugh.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and this product did not get my hair smooth enough.  I also have a chi that I use and I find that it works much better on my hair.</li>
            <li> Great price, Quick Shipping and I didn&#x27;t have to pay \\&quot;Seen On TV\\&quot; Price.  Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> the sellers were great the product is ok not what they make it out to be</li>
            <li> This item came in defective.  I&#x27;m fighting to get my money back from a very irresponsible vendor.</li>
            <li> God blessed me with very thick frizzy hair that I have spent the better part of my 30+ years trying to tame. That battle is no more!  With the InStyler, I can blow dry my hair to mostly dry, run the Instyler through it and go.  Start to finish, it used to take me an hour to do my hair with my flat iron.  Using the InStyler, it takes me 15 minutes. Every woman needs this tool!!!!!</li>
            <li> BOOOO!!!!!   I so looked forward to receiving this product! The very first swipe I took with this device I knew I had made a huge mistake. I am so glad that I purchased this item on Amazon because I am returning mine for a refund. UNLESS you have straight, fine hair I do not see how this could possibly work for anyone. To all who have given this product great reviews... God bless you all! .... you must have already pretty amazing hair! I for one have very curly spiral permed hair. This product with two or three swipes did not straighten my hair. My hair did not look healthy or moisturized. I immediately plugged in my \\&quot;old faithful\\&quot; and I am now convinced that more expensive is not always better. I was using my \\&quot;old faithful\\&quot; $45 Remington wet to dry 2 \\&quot; flat iron which I purchased at Walmart 3 years ago prior to this purchase. With my hair slightly damp it completely straightens and conditions! My hair is completely straight and shiny in one swipe! With the instyler I used only a one inch section of hair and went over it three times and it still was not straight, nor shiny... even on the highest setting! I could feel hair being pulled out by the bristles on the brush. I never lose hair with my Remington. To me, the Instyler feels cheap (lightweight and plastic) and does not clamp down on the hair. Personally I felt this was a terrific waste of money!</li>
            <li> Saw it on TV and finally bought it, not happy with the results.      First - there&#x27;s no safe way to put it down!  You put it down and it just falls over so the barrel is on the counter.  It doesn&#x27;t have a stand or prop or flat surface so it will stay upright.  Major Fire hazzard!!!    Second - My daughter used it herself on her hair and it didn&#x27;t look as good as with a regular straightner and she has thick hair.  She did her friend&#x27;s hair with it and it turned out great.    However, when I used it - terrible.  I have thin, fine hair. I sectioned my hair off as I usually do for a regular straightner but the barrel wouldn&#x27;t close on my hair enough for the brush to be any use. Basically, it wouldn&#x27;t grip my hair and it came out frizzy. For the barrel to close on my hair at all - I cannot section my hair any, and then it just doesn&#x27;t do the job.     Third - I&#x27;ve been using curling irons and hair straightners for years now and I find the instyler VERY awkward to use.  The barrel only turns one way, and while I have no problems positioning it on my right side, I have a lot of trouble using it on my left.    I would only recomend this product if you&#x27;re going to use it on someone else&#x27;s hair or have REALLY thick hair yourself.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend wanted this item for the longest an I finally surprised her with it she was thrilled! Tried it out and absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my order.  Shipping was fast and the quality of my item was just as nice as advertised. I will be buying again..BEING AN ARMY FAMILY WE ONLY WANT THE BEST AND THIS PAST OUR TEST..</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, a piece was broken off; I emailed the seller the next day, and he asked me to mail it back to him. I shipped the item back and he credited my account for the item right away.</li>
            <li> Best seller that I have deal with, at first I wasn&#x27;t completly satified with the instyler and I let the seller  know. By the next day he had sent me an email willing to work out my problem. He exchanged my instyler for another new one without any problem and of course it was very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The InStyler is the greatest product I have found for styling hair. I was at a salon recently and all the operators using a blow dryer and a round brush. The InStyler can do the job of these two items all by itself. It delivers exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li> Very poorly made.  Endcap was loose due to an untightened nut.  Nut appears to have nylon threads inside and are striped out.  The loose end cap causes a gap at the end of the roller.  This gap grabs hair and twists it around the heating area, basically pulling the hair off of your head.  It&#x27;s a great piece of equipment if you want to slowly go bald.</li>
            <li> I received this item yesterday and have used it twice. It does a nice job on my hair, however I am a little concerned with how long it will hold up. It seems like it is made very cheap. If you put any amount of pressure while clamping down on your hair it makes a dragging/clunking noise. Like I said, it does a nice job straightening my hair and it is easy to use. If I knew of a similar product that was made better I would definitely buy it. The information about this product is slightly misleading, because you are still pressing your hair in between two metal plates, so it does the same thing as a straightening or curling iron. Overall I think it is overpriced for the quality, but I do like it.</li>
            <li> I have had my inStyler for almost two months now and I love it!! It&#x27;s the best straightener I have ever owned. My hair is medium length very curly and normally takes an hour an a half to straighten. With the inStyler it cuts the time in half and comes out so smooth and shiny. Now on full power it does get very hot so I would suggest not leaving it on a specific section for too long. I would recommend this straightener to anyone looking for a great product!</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased this item after coveting it for some time and I cannot express how much I love it.  I have medium length hair that is very curly.  I have always had a really difficult time straightening it properly.  Either it looked too dry or took way too long.  I cannot stand to spend more then fifteen minutes on my hair.  This is the best product I have ever bought! I takes me about 10 minutes to fully straighten my hair.  My hair looks healthy and has so much volume.  Plus I like that I can create curls and other styles with it.  Additionally, I do not find it hard to handle once you have used it a few times.  I have never burned myself.  I actually sit in front of the TV and just straighten my hair because the product works so well you don&#x27;t need to look in the mirror every five seconds. I AM IN LOVE!</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the $$$ for girls with fine, straight hair. Don&#x27;t waste a minute on this product.</li>
            <li> I bought and used the Instyler yesterday 11/2/09. I think it is a really good product so far. I have long, curly, thick hair and I was able to get it very straight by using this iron. I don&#x27;t think that my hair looks as great as it could be because I only used it once and I can tell I need a bit of practice with it for me to get my hair to look exactly as I would like it to. This is because I am not skilled in using a flat iron. I think people you use flat irons are going to find this product to work very well for them. It seems like it didn&#x27;t burn, fry, damage my hair at all. The insert says that you can use the iron on damp hair but they recommend it to be used on dry hair with no product in it for the best results. It makes sense because I tried it on my slightly damp hair last night and I had to go over my hair a few times before it got as straight as I wanted it to be. So when I was about 75% complete with straightening my hair, I blew out the rest of my curls briefly and then used the iron. It looked great and I straightened that section so quickly. Since I have long, curly, thick hair, going forward I am going to blow out my towel dried hair using a comb attachment and then use the Instyler. Basically I think I will be able to straighten my hair with the iron in probably a half hour to forty minutes if I blow it out first. If you have short or mid length, loose curly or wavy hair you will be able to straighten your hair in less than a half hour for sure. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to straighten their hair without damaging it and who doesn&#x27;t want to spend time or money in salon to have someone else straighten your hair. Also it was not hard at all to straight the hair in the back of my head. If you buy this production just keep in mind that if you aren&#x27;t skilled in straightening your hair with a flat iron, you are going to have to practice a bit with it before you get the hang of it.  I just hope it doesn&#x27;t break like some people have mentioned in their reviews. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this machine.  It is so much more than a straightener.  It gets every single bit of frizz out, but also adds curl and body.  It is real easy to use too.  I am a little bit worried about burning myself though.  There isn&#x27;t anywhere on the end to hold.  Takes some getting used to holding it differently than other irons.</li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift. At first, I had no idea what to do with it or if I even wanted to touch this contraption to my hair. But after giving it the benefit of the doubt and watching some videos, I&#x27;ve gotten a technique down that I love. My hair is already pretty straight (some weird waves or tangles here and there), so I used it mainly just to make it look neater. My favorite thing to do with the InStyler is to straight it down and then turn/roll the InStyler in towards me at the bottom so the ends of my hair sort of curl into my face. It definitely makes my hair look softer and shinier and the curl at the bottom gives it an extra bounce. It&#x27;s quick and I loved doing it in the morning when my hair wasn&#x27;t necessarily looking its best. However, after only a few months of actively using it, it just went dead. :( I&#x27;m really sad because I don&#x27;t know how to do the same thing to my hair so efficiently with any other product. But I don&#x27;t know if I want to spend that much money to buy another one. I&#x27;m really sad about it though...I really did get compliments on my hair after using it!     For users thinking about it, make sure you definitely READ instructions on how to use and take care of it. Watching a few videos for tips works well too. I&#x27;m not sure about the types of hair, but to me I feel like this would be more for styling hair that&#x27;s already on its way to being straight. I have thick black (Asian) hair and I really loved what I managed to do with it. I may end up buying it because I miss the compliments I&#x27;ve gotten... :)</li>
            <li> Spectacular!!  Leaves hair amazing!!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this thing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carrie Lynn Jones&lt;br /&gt;Author of: [[ASIN:1425933742 It All Began... When Jesus Gave Me Sneakers]]</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied yet as this item has not been received by me yet. I ordered it over a month ago and it&#x27;s 2 days before Christmas.  No response from Seller either.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in August, 2009.  I used it approximately once a week.  I love love love how my hair comes out.  No split ends and very straight and shinny...almost as the salon does it.  It says not to use any styling product so I didn&#x27;t and it worked great... The only issues were be careful of burning.  Once I got the hang of it, I didn&#x27;t burn myself.  Unfornately the other day in the middle of doing my hair - the orange cap that keeps the products barrel on fell off onto the floor.  I went to pick it up but forgot it was hot.  Soon after a washer fell on the floor as well.  Now the barrel was just hanging and red hot!  So after cooling packed it up and sent it back.  I love it and now have to hunt down another one as the company I got it from no longer carries it...  One more thing about a few days prior to this, the company sent me a plastic shield to go over the barrel as to prevent burning...</li>
            <li> I have wanted one of these for a long time &amp; although the seller was great the product is so-so doesn&#x27;t work as I expected it to. Maybe I&#x27;m not letting it heat enough but I did not get the results that I thought I would given the infomercials and the hype of the product but by no means the sellers fault. They were great &amp; I recieved my product just as they said I would; brand new and in record time!</li>
            <li> This product is horribly overpriced. Though I only paid half of the retail price, I still do not think it is worth even that. It says it can be used on slightly damp hair.. don&#x27;t attempt, unless you want to fry your hair. My hair is fairly limp; and wanted to give it some body and lift... needless to say I could have achieved better results with a large curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revised 10/28/2010: I will say this: the instyler is great at straightening hair. It&#x27;s not easy to use as a curling iron, but it does work really well to tame wild/ coarse hair. It does polish the hair (rotating brushes, probably). I still use a big curling iron along with this, and I still say it&#x27;s horribly overpriced, but it works well. I have definitely changed my mind after using for a few months.</li>
            <li> I have had an Instyler for 2 years now and LOVE the results.  It is easy to use and consistently produces salon quality results.  Even my hair stylist is now recommending the Instyler to her other customers. My stylist actually said that she is proud when I walk in the salon because my hair is a reflection of her cutting and coloring skills, and the Instyler makes my hair look gorgeous.  I wish they had a 220V version.</li>
            <li> I recently bought the InStyler, first I was afraid to do something wrong but the iron is so easy to use and really works!! I am enjoying it and my hair shines. I am 62 years old and all my friends ask me \\&quot;what kind of shampoo I use\\&quot; because my hair really shine, so I tell them about the iron. I am very happy with my InStyler,   Ann</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this Hot Iron hair styler. What a dissapointment. It gets very hot, drys out your hair, it would take hours to style even shoulder length hair, and has a large warning label on the electrical cord to keep away from your eyes. I&#x27;m certainly glad that I didn&#x27;t pay $99.00 for this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> My cousin bought one, I tried it &amp; liked the results. The cost on Amazon was about $40 less than WalMart. Using it is tricky. I think what I miss the most is something cool at the tip I can hold onto rather than only the large wide handle.  It&#x27;s taken a while to figure out what to do when I get to the end of my hair &amp; then I want to curl it under. Can be hard on the wrist when trying to twist. Also miss some kind of stand for it. It lays on the counter (no damage yet) but seems odd just laying there on its side. Has 3 heat temps. &amp; I&#x27;ve only used the least #3. I DO like the way my hair looks after I&#x27;ve used it &amp; it does stay stylish for a few days (or maybe it&#x27;s the good haircut). I don&#x27;t use it everyday but it does make hair much less frizzy, smooth &amp; gives it body. Other irons are easier to work with, but I like this one best.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last month. I was very happy when I received it. It worked very good. My hair is very hard to style, but this product could work even on the tough hair.      But the product stop working only after 1 month. Now I am trying to contact the vendor to see what I can get.  It is a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  I didn&#x27;t work as advertised at all.  It would straighten my hair, sort of, but left it very frizzy and it took several passes to get it to even that point.  Because I spent what I thought was a good amount of money on this product, I tried it several times, just trying different things to see if I could get better results and nothing worked.    I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt; Only managed to burn myself once, it gets hot!&lt;br /&gt;The one complaint that I may have is that I can&#x27;t get as close to my roots as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;The hair gets really straight and I love the body.</li>
            <li> I bought the InStyler about two weeks ago -- after having seen the infomercial for months.  I just couldn&#x27;t get up the nerve to spend this much money on a curling iron.  I finally forked it over when I got my most recent hair cut.  The stylist used one of those big round brushes while blow drying, and pulled out all my natural waves.  I&#x27;ve been fighting my curls my entire life, and only a good hair dresser could style my thick, wavy hair.  I&#x27;ve tried curling irons and flat irons.  Neither has worked well.  The InStyler, however, has exceeded my expectations as a styling product.  With it, I can style my hair as well as my hair stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My concern with this product is the noisiness of the motor.  The machine &#x27;clunks&#x27; and seems to strain and halt as it spins.  I&#x27;ve tried to use less hair, and then more hair, but it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference.  It does continue to spin, and gets the job done, just with a lot of noise that seems like more than just the sound of a motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, the InStyler is an effective product.  It needs to spend a bit more time in the development department, though.  For the price, it should spin smoothly and somewhat quieter than it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I had the defective one replaced at the store, and am satisfied with the second one.  I have since purchased one for my daughter, and she loves it too.</li>
            <li> I bought the Instyler thinking it was the best thing that ever happened to me. Figures, after using it for two months, the brush on the Instyler fell off, and every time I try to use it again, it just gets worse. I would NOT recommend.    Hope that helps you decide if you want to get it or not.</li>
            <li> Hi,  I am a professional triathlete with shoulder length, fine and curly hair!  After countless hours in the pool or on ny bike, both the bathig cap and helment started to damage my hair and make it break off. I wanted longer hair to wear it down.  But because it was curly and damaged it was difficult and time consuming to blow it out.  Once I purchased the In Styler I wear my hair down everyday. I dry it very fast just using a comb and then I use the In styler to keep it straight and add a few waves.  Now when it is down you can see the layers of my hair.  It has helped keep my hair more healthy and the product helps the hair shine!  Prior to using this product I had to keep my hair up as it was to time consuming. I am actually bringing the product to the salon I go to in order to show it to my friend that cuts my hair.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.  It doesn&#x27;t work that well, and it breaks within the first couple months of using it.  An item that breaks within months of purchase is cheaply made.  What&#x27;s worse, when I attempted to have the situation rectified, customer service ignored my email.  When I called the call center, the person I spoke with was rude, and the supervisor with whom I was connected was inept.  They refused to repair or replace my item.  I will be letting everyone know not to purchase this piece of junk.  ONCE AGAIN DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> ... then it probably is. Unfortunately, I think this observation applies to the InStyler. I&#x27;m quite proficient with a hair brush and blow dryer, but I bought this product because it seemed like it would save time and be more effective in terms of styling. Nothing could&#x27;ve been further from the truth: this is, hands down, the most abysmal styling product I&#x27;ve ever purchased. If I&#x27;d paid what I think is the outrageously high price on the manufacturer&#x27;s web site, I&#x27;d be furious. But since I got it for only about half the retail price, I&#x27;m just disgruntled and indignant enough to go on record with my opinion in the hopes that somebody will read it, choose not to buy this item and save their money for something more worthy--like a product that actually performs according to its claims.</li>
            <li> The InStyler is not worth the money and it doesn&#x27;t work for all hair types.  I turned it on and it would trip my breaker although it sometimes worked but then it would cut off, the last time it turned off I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn back on. I have only had it for 3 days and decided to email the seller I bought it from \\&quot;Dinabambinaa\\&quot; so I emailed them and Dina herself sent me this in return......\\&quot;Hello Rhonda,     I am so sorry for the inconvenience. Unfortunately the best advice I can give you is to re-sell it here on Amazon because it has been opened and used I cannot take it back. I sold 2 that day and the other buyer had no issues. Once again I do apologize.    Good luck,     Dina\\&quot;    Really!!! I think she called me a liar and what does it matter someone had bought the same thing and hasn&#x27;t had a problem YET!!!!!  I am more upset with the seller than I am the product!  Apparently this is a new seller! Stupid me should have known better!  I called Amazon.com and they are wonderful...I read the email back to them and they agreed that you have to open and try a product to find out if it works and if it&#x27;s what you want. Anyway, they said there will be an investigation...music to my ears!!!!  I thought what kind of IDIOT seller won&#x27;t let you open something and try it out(just look at it don&#x27;t open to decide if you like it) give me a break!!!!  Thank you Amazon.com for saving me with your A to Z Guarantee!!!! You have restored my faith in YOu!!....BEWARE OF SELLER DINABAMBINAA for any products you might buy!!!!!!  Just lookin&#x27; out for my fellow Amazonians!!</li>
            <li> Bought the Instyler after using the Revo Styler for years to dry my hair. Revo Styler is a rotating brush that allows you to blow dry your hair straight with a hair dryer.  So I thought the InStyler would be the same principle and work really well...and it did for awhile.  After 3 or 4 months my hair was so damaged from the heat of the InStyler and the hair would break and fall off...even at the lowest heat setting.  It took a year to grow out my hair and get it back to normal.  Too bad, it worked so well for months....but just not worth the damage.</li>
            <li> I received the InStyler last week (4/4) and I thought it was gonna work out great...once I got the hang of it but I am still taking a long time to straighten my hair.  With a flat iron it takes me about 20 minutes to do my hair, with the InStyler I&#x27;m taking 35-40 minutes! It is difficult to straighten your own hair with it because of the brush it seems like its easy if you&#x27;re straightening someone&#x27;s hair.  Also, my InStyler did not come w/the comb :( but I don&#x27;t really care because I don&#x27;t use that type of comb.  I am debating if I should return it and just buy a regular flat iron.  For the time being, I&#x27;m out $76 and I don&#x27;t like the product! Pretty expensive if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I bought the instyler, and it didn&#x27;t heat up at all.  after a couple weeks I got in touch with Amazon on how to return.  I sent it back and I am still waiting for the refund.  I would recommend that you pay and get a orginal, my daughter got the real one and she loves it.  I guess the one I bought from Amazon is a knock off, and I hope to get my money back.</li>
            <li> I love my instyler it&#x27;s so easy to use an after watching the video I feel like a pro. Thank you for making this awesome product. I would recommend it for all ages. Better than a flat iron it curls or straightens without leaving marks or kinks. An instead of a curling iron it not only curls but gives hair body when used as shown.</li>
            <li> I ordered the In-Styler after I heard about it on TV.  I thought it was just what I needed for the way I did my hair. I did some checking around local stores and also on the computer.  I found the best price at Amazon and didn&#x27;t hesitate ordering from Amazon as I have had such good luck in the past with anything I ordered from them.  I have used the In-Styler now and find it very slick and easy to use.  It goes much faster than a curling iron and it keeps my hair straightened like I want it yet gives it some body.  I brought the In-Styler to my hairdresser so she could use it on me and now she is sold on it.  She wants to buy a couple of them for her shop.</li>
            <li> I have had an Instyler for several months and I think it&#x27;s wonderful.  Watch a demonstration and read my review on YouTube.    [...]</li>
            <li> I have one of the original In Stylers,  My Biggest disappointment was that my hand kept touching the off button; I think it is located in an impractical place and it&#x27;s rather clumsey</li>
            <li> Compared to the previous InStyler I bought from the InStyler website, this one never reached the proper heat level. I do not know if it was defective or it is an imitation. That&#x27;s why I am returning it. No use at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago and I am african american, my hair is thick and coarse. It does well straightening already relaxed hair. The brush part is not good for african american hair. It will dry it out. It dried the ends of my hair. I even used a heat protection serum before using this and it still dried my hair. If they made the instyler without the brush thing, It would be great for african american hair. I highly recommend spending the $100 bucks on a CHI flat iron or a IZUNAMI flat iron. Those are the best in the industry. And i guarantee you any professional hair stylist will recommend it and they&#x27;re probably using it too. This product works better on Caucasian hair (other finer hair types as well).</li>
            <li> I have been using the Instyler for over a year now and have had excellent results! I have thick hair that is heavy and difficult to \\&quot;lift\\&quot; on top without creating a lot of damage by teasing, and this product has been my solution! It really does the job! It also creates a nice loose wave that doesn&#x27;t bunch up like with a standard curling iron. I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> This product is the bomb as the kids say these days.  It is the greatest thing since slice bread as us more mature folks would say.  It straightens and curls with such ease.  I have never been able to fix my hair so quickly until now using the new InStyler Rotating Hot Iron Hair Straightener and my daughter&#x27;s head which is thick and medium lenght was finished in 7 mins no less.  It is a really good product and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to look good in less time than it would normally take you to get dressed.</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christamas present from my husband after a few major hints. I so love the Instyler, especially since I was a major skeptic even when I asked for it. Used it on Christmas day on my hair which is thick and coarse and on my duaghter&#x27;s hair which is thick, long and extremely curly and wavey! I was amazed at how sraight is got her hair in a matter of minutes with no burning smell or any of the usual problems we used to get with flat iron and straightening combs. This is the best thing I have ever used on my hair and my daughters hair and I&#x27;ve owned every styling device to straighten, curl, spiral, crimp and wave ones hair and non have left my hair looking shiney and healthy and not looking over done. I&#x27;ll definately have to get another one of these just in case I need to give one to a family member as a gift!</li>
            <li> I have THICK and LONd hair. This  does not work well at all for my hair style. It could work for those who have short thin hair. Hope this helps</li>
            <li> I got an Instyler from a friend &amp; I really LOVE it. I have naturally wavy hair &amp; the Instyler makes my hair so smooth &amp; straight. I use to use a flat iron to straighten my hair, but it always looked dull. But when I use the Instyler I always get compliments on how beautiful &amp; shiny my hair is. It&#x27;s such a great product!</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my daughter.  Her hair is curly &amp; she&#x27;s been using a flat iron to straighten it.  We purchased this item with the hopes that it would prevent split ends.  The InStyler was easy to use and the styling results were just as advertised.  However, this item did not prevent split ends.  The brush actually seemed to make the hair even more frizzy.  This item would probably work best on a person with semi straight or straight hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend overseas and she loves it. It is a little loud when you are using it but the results make that seem like nothing. Using this instead of a traditional straightener/hair iron you can see a huge difference in body. The hair looks more naturally straight.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and surprisingly it works just as well as seen on television. Truth in advertisement; what a concept. It works just as well on \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; hair and that is a major plus in combing hair that is sometimes not comb friendly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 of these they gives me the most luxurious curls ever!  everybody knows that i have gorgeous hair and asks me how is it so perfect all the time.  i tell them this is it! here is what is does it you:    1. one of the best and most unique feature of this styler is that it brushes your hair while curling it so you can always run your fingers through your hair. they came out so natural and bouncy!   2. the amount of shine you get is believable. You should always watch how the barrel turns because counter rotation will still give you the style you desire but if you make sure the barrel turns where your hair cuticles goes it will close any open cuticles as it brushes through thus give you an amazing shine look.  3. I have a lot of hair to start with but these definitely helps to get my relaxed dramatic bouncy curls. I&#x27;m not sure what technology is behind this, speaking from experience.  4. it can be used to curl/straight hairs. most of time i have curly hair but when i straighten them I prefer a more bouncy/bombshell look than 100% flat &amp; straight hair if you know what i mean. these does the job.  5. it takes me 20 minutes to have party/prom/date curls(including sectioning, pre-seruming, post-spraying time) and 10 mins to straighten my hair. super quick!    I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because you can buy it half the price on ebay.</li>
            <li> Great product...it took me a couple of times to get used to it, but it works great and curls great.  I would recommend this product for medium to long length hair.</li>
            <li> I bought it a few years ago to see if it&#x27;d do as it claimed.  It did absolutely nothing for my thick, long blonde hair, at all. First, the rotating iron doesn&#x27;t do much . It&#x27;s said to protect your hair from being burned, but its still very easy to burn your hair on it. It made my hair look awful. Didn&#x27;t make it shiny, and only straightened it a little bit. Without half a gallon of hairspray, it only stayed straight for about an hour or so and then returned to its natural state. The brush-part of the instyler didn&#x27;t polish it, separate it, or do anything, really. It takes absolutely FOREVER to heat up, definitely not something that would be used in a rush.</li>
            <li> I have waited 50 long years to get my hair as it is now, thanks to the Instyler, I just can&#x27;t do without it and will be buying a spare so as never to be without it. My hair looks and feels great,for the first time without putting any other products on it apart from shampoo and conditioner. I recommend the Instyler to everone that wants gorgeous hair.</li>
            <li> This does not work well on African American hair that is on the coarser end of our hair spectrum. It will work fine if the hair is permed or pressed straight first, but of course applying triple heat defeats the purpose. I can&#x27;t rate it highly because the infomercials feature an African American woman with kinkier hair than mine and show it effectively smoothing her hair without mention of pre-straightening or chemicals. I may have gotten better results if I fried my hair in it, but again this defeats the purpose. Very misleading and disappointing. My blow dryer and flat iron work much better. I returned it promptly.</li>
            <li> I had mine for 4 months until it broke- the barrel stopped turning. I contacted customer service and was told I had no recourse because it was over 30 days since I purchased it. Three of my friends bought one, based on my recommedations, and all 3 broke within 6 months of purchase and had the same response from the company. Its a great product but for $100 they need to improve the design AND their customer service.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did not listen to all of the negative things people had to say about the InStyler.. I have very very long wild and unmanageable curly hair. I finally gave in and bought an InStyler. Amazing!!! No more spending an hour or more using my old iron with my hands cramped trying to get my hair to look good. It only took me about 15 to 20 minutes and my hair looks awesome. It really does shine more and has a soft polished feel. If your not getting results your doing something wrong. Be sure you watch the dvd and not just hop in and start going.. My only complaint would be that it does not have a tip at the end to help  you to guide it easier.. but even with that said I have never had these results with any flattening iron I have ever used and that says a lot! This is the only product I have ever ordered that lived up to the infomercial.</li>
            <li> I saw the infomercial but hesitated buying it because the audience seemed so rehearsed and phony.  But I needed something as most hot irons were breaking and burning my hair.  So I purchased it and loved it for 6 weeks.  But this morning I went to use it and the barrel was stone cold even though the LCD light was lit.  Six weeks functionality for this price?  I don&#x27;t know if I had a defective one-I am trying to see if I can get it replaced and try again as I do like the way it straightens your hair without burning or drying it out.</li>
            <li> I just bought this and rushed home to use it today!  I loved it!  I was able to use it easily without even reading instructions.  Making curls will take a little getting used to, but I am pleased with the soft waves in my first attempt.</li>
            <li> I bought this item more to try and curl my hair so please if you are looking to purchase to control your frizz don&#x27;t go off of my review.  For the price though not worth it to me.  I gave it a 3star and not a 2 because it does straighten well, but my $20 straightener does a better job.  You can use to curl your hair but because of how bulky it is I have burned my fingers trying to wrap the hair around. Went back to my original curling iron and am looking to sell my Instyler.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but tried anyway as I needed a shorter morning hair regime.  I have thin, fine hair that is shoulder length.  I was hoping to get volume so I didn&#x27;t need to wear jumbo velcro rollers overnight.  Even with proper instructions, over-directing, etc., this tool is simply a flat iron.  I had no volume whatsoever which was why I bought this.  Gets very hot on lightest setting so even with heat spray, I wonder about damage.  I have also tried using it and then quickly taking each heated hair section and rolling onto jumbo velcro roller and letting it set and cool for 10 minutes.  Not ideal as within 30 minutes, even this is already starting to flatten out.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical just like everyone else. And I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if it weren&#x27;t for my friend who already had it and styled my hair with it. I couldn&#x27;t belive my eyes when I looked in the mirror. So I bought it immediately (found it in Marshalls for $80).   I&#x27;ve had it for a year - and I&#x27;m still impressed everytime I use it. I have terrible hair - I hate it. It&#x27;s very thing, very flat, split ends, and very puffy. Yuk! After spending 10-15 minutes with Instyler, it looks like fantastic! It&#x27;s shiny, glossy, has volume, and looks very very healthy. I look like I actually have shiny healthy hair! I never had a problem with it - it has been working properly so far, doesn&#x27;t shut down or anything. Best $80 I ever spent. I can&#x27;t believe it only has 3 start. Although I don&#x27;t know if it would work just as good on other types of hair - say really think and really curly. But definitely would recomment instyler to anyone, it&#x27;s a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> I just bought this item a few hours ago and came home to try it out immediately. I have thick, curly hair and yesterday I cut off 4 inches of it so it is now shoulder length. I knew I would have to straighten my hair a lot more at this length and bought the item but made sure I could return it as I am very skeptical of anything that claims to straighten hair. I spent about an hour doing my hair this morning and it had since been up in a pony tail for work with an awful crease and curls starting to show themselves all over again.  Within 15 minute my hair was completely straight again! I did not try any styling techniques such as flipping it out, but I will say I thought the product was pretty awesome! The ONLY thing I did not like was that it did leave my hair just slightly frizzy. I put a little finishing smoothing spray on the ends of my hair which fixed the issue immediately and with absolutely no more need of the tool. My hair is usually frizzy after I use a regular straightener though, so I doubt this can be attributed to the Instyler. I also had no issues with my hair getting caught or tangled.   Some reviews said they had trouble straightening the back of their hair. I actually found this so much easier because I like to flip my hair under and I could do that with one hand by just pulling my hair straight back. My ponytail crease is gone and the back looks flawless.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, thick hair that is shoulder length.  I have battled the curls my whole life.  I would have loved this product when I was younger and straight hair was the ONLY option.  But I love it now and am so glad I finally let loose of my wallet to purchase the Instyler.  [[ASIN:B002L5THSI The Original InStyler Rotating Hot Iron Hair Straightener]]I had seen someone else use one at the gym where I work out and it seemed to do well for her.  My hair, when it is straightened, is very soft, but very thick and out of control if I just let it go.  For the past several years I used a large barrel curling iron (2 inches) plus a flat iron for final smoothing.  Now, with the Instyler, I can achive soft, smooth, large curls with just one tool.  I am excited beyond belief.  It has attracted a lot of attention in the gym lockerroom from both curlyheads and straight haired women.  The noise of the motor is what gets their attention, and then they all want to see it in action!  It does get hot, but no hotter than any of the other tools I have used.  You need to be careful.  I find it very easy to use.  I manipulate it much like I did my other irons.  I would recommend this product to anyone who struggles with getting their curly hair to behave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product for someone with very fine hair....you may lose your hair if you use this enough...Highly not recommended</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was uneasy.  Then I was told by a friend that she loved the product so I purchased one and I love it!  It does exactly what it says at the medium heat cycle.  It heats up extremely fast.  I would highly recommend to anyone with frizzy or unruly hair!  Absolutely awesome product!</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve only used this product for curling and NOT straightening, so I can only attest for curling. This thing is amazing!! I have hair halfway down my back and it&#x27;s never held a curl from a regular curling iron. It holds gorgeous curls ALL NIGHT LONG even in humid temperatures. I got TONS of compliments every time I use this on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It does get hot, so BE CAREFUL. I have a scar on my finger to prove it. It&#x27;s really simple to use after your first try, the first try never turns out as well as after you&#x27;ve had some practice.&lt;br /&gt;There are two different sizes. The smaller 3/4 inch works MUCH better than the bigger 1-1/4 inch. The bigger one gives extremely loose curls that fall out quickly. The 3/4 curls stay in place.</li>
            <li> No single product will work for everyone. With that said, this device for MY hair is the single best thing that I have ever used. My hair is fine and blond, and left to its own devices will be flat with a bit of scraggly wave and frizz.  If I use today&#x27;s hair dryers it becomes EVEN FLATTER (the ionic feature works \\&quot;too\\&quot; well to straighten and de-frizz!) and the same problem with straightening irons, yes they remove the frizz but leave my hair flat and darken the blond, leaving it greasy looking.  Big barrel curling irons do give it some nice body and yet it took a really long time to do my whole head that way so I&#x27;d leave that for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago a co-worker complained that she had gotten the InStyler and it didn&#x27;t work for her hair (too short) and she was miffed because she waited too long to return it so was stuck with an expensive mistake.  I asked if I could try it and from the first use I couldn&#x27;t believe how great it was. I was still skeptical that maybe it was the weather or a fluke (plus I resisted liking it because of the NOISE!) so I used it 3 more days and each day I was amazed - it simultaneously straightened, removed the frizzies, and ADDED body and shine, without making it look greasy.  It was a hair miracle.  Finally I admitted to myself that it was not a fluke, friends were commenting \\&quot;what have you done, did you change your shampoo? a hair cut???\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;This product is truly the thing that my hair has been waiting for.&lt;br /&gt;YES it is noisy!! I cringe every time I use it (because I&#x27;m using it at work in my cubicle out in the open with 8 others within 5 feet listening!). But there is simply no substitute for the transformation this gives my hair.  Needless to say I bought it from my co-worker, and I&#x27;m on here now to buy another so I can keep one at home too.&lt;br /&gt;I hope that a) it doesn&#x27;t stop working in 6 months like other reviewers have written, and b) if it does, the company won&#x27;t go out of business by the time I need to buy another!  Isn&#x27;t it murphy&#x27;s law that when you find the very best product that you totally love, the company will either discontinue it or go out of business?&lt;br /&gt;At least I&#x27;ll have two so if one breaks I can have perfect hair as long as the 2nd one lasts. Maybe I should order two more...another!  Isn&#x27;t it murphy&#x27;s law that when you find the very best product that you totally love, the company will either discontinue it or go out of business?&lt;br /&gt;At least I&#x27;ll have two so if one breaks I can have perfect hair as long as the 2nd one lasts. Maybe I should order two more...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had natural frizzy hair.  This appliance is amazing.  Takes less than 5 minutes to style my medium length hair.  Works as advertised...if not better.</li>
            <li> I bought mine at Ulta almost 2 years ago and it still works perfectly. Well worth the money, does exactly what it claims to do, I completely recommend getting and InStyler.</li>
            <li> BEST thing i ever bought, you just need to have patience to figure out which way your hair will curl</li>
            <li> It does not work with my long thick hair. I hardly use it because it doesn&#x27;t get the job done in a timely or efficient manner! Don&#x27;t waste your money. Stick with a curling iron or straightener.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud, too hot and takes forever to straighten/curl my hair. I prefer my wet 2 straight $25 straightener over this one. It&#x27;s not worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> Ive had the instyler for about 6 months now and it is truly amazing. I have very long, curly hair (a lot of it too) but the instyler works wonders on it. It is true that it&#x27;s very hot but with practice you&#x27;ll be able to figure out how to keep your hands, neck, and scalp from getting a few burns. The Instyler leaves your hair with shine and volume, but make sure to use products that will protect your hair from the heat. The only negative thing   I can say about the product is that its hard getting into the roots, I think its because I&#x27;m scared to get burned. Overall great product!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Instyler when they first came out. I have very long, curly, somewhat frizzy hair but it is fairly fine and I have lots of it. Previously I would use a flat iron to straighten out the waves and curls and then a curling iron to put a little curl back on the ends of my hair. This works as a great substitute for that. I use the middle setting and it has never burned my hair. I guess because my hair is long it is a lot easier for me to use this as I have never burned myself with the Instyler. I run it down the section of hair a couple of times to smooth it and then I just let it sit for about 6 seconds on the ends and it puts a nice curl on the ends. It also works really well if I want to put long curls in. I just wrap it like a curling iron and hold it in place for 5-7 seconds. It takes me about 25 minutes to do my hair. I can see how it may not work as well on thick, very curly hair, but on my hair type it works great. I have never had any mechanical issues with either of the Instylers. It is a little noisy but you get used to that...but don&#x27;t expect to listen to the television while you are using it.</li>
            <li> I got this and was so excited to get it. But the when i took it out of the package and used it, it was terrible! I makes your hair so frizzy and it doesn&#x27;t get your hair perfectly straight(if that&#x27;s what your looking for). I jut had to go over it after using it with a hair straightener anyways. I didn&#x27;t use the curling part but my sister did (because i gave it to her because that&#x27;s how much i didn&#x27;t like it) and that didn&#x27;t work good for her either! I heard so many good things about this but when i tried it for myself i was so disappointed! For straight hair i would recommend the brand Remington. I hoped this helped!</li>
            <li> I will never order from these people again.  I ordered 2 InStylers and only received 1.  I was charged for 2.  When I contacted company they apologized and said 2nd one was on way.  That was December 16, 2011.  I finally called my credit card company to get a refund.  I give this company a \\&quot;0\\&quot; rating.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a well made item and feels consistent to any other curling / flat iron I have held.  Note that this was a gift for my wife and I don&#x27;t use these products.  My wife had seen the infomercial for this item and was excited about what it offered.  She used it once and then we boxed back up because it didn&#x27;t work.  She said that it didn&#x27;t dry or straighten.  She does have pretty thick hair so it may work for other folks.  The return was seamless and quick and the prompt refund was appreciated.</li>
            <li> I have natural wavy, but somewhat frizzy, thin hair. I purchased this product after my 10 year old Infrashine straightened kicked the bucket. This product is definitely not worth the money they charge for it. The brush attachments leave my hair frizzy, and stringy looking, not sleek and shiny the way it advertises. The barrel is very dangerous and could cause severe burns. An improved version of this product would be to make the brush attachments detachable, and to give the rotating barrel an on and off button. With those options, you would have a better functioning straightening iron. Unless improvements are made to it, I don&#x27;t recommend this item if you&#x27;re looking for a straightening iron.&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  Since I wasn&#x27;t able to return the item after it had been used, per store policy, I improved the product by cutting the brisles as low as I could cut them, and it made the item somewhat of a better flat iron, which is what I need to use it for.  I don&#x27;t recommend this if you need to use it as a curling iron, however, because then the rotating barrel has nothing to hold the curl in place.  Increased to two stars.</li>
            <li> The InStyler is a tool I can&#x27;t live without!  I have curly hair and it makes my hair look like I just got out of the salon.  I do have curly hair &amp; I need to run the Instyler through my roots twice to make it smooth. While I was waiting for my Instyler to arrive  my hair didn&#x27;t have the same polished look, it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Please dont waste your money. This product fries your hair which causes more frizz. Also the design of this makes burning yourself very easy. Spend your money on one of the better flat irons that have the ability to curl.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought this product for me for my birthday, and it never worked at all! It wouldn&#x27;t turn on for more than five seconds, and I tried it in several different outlets just to be sure. I was so disappointed, and my experience is very typical, from what I&#x27;ve read online about the instyler. The only positive is that he purchased it from amazon, and we were able to return it. It seems like the manufacturer is unwilling to refund people.</li>
            <li> I bought this brand new a little less than a year ago, I found it on sale for $50. It worked well, straightened, did flips, and curled just like it says. It took a few tries to teach myself how to work it for the different styles but eventually I got the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.Straightens, curls, flips, etc.&lt;br /&gt;2. heats fast&lt;br /&gt;3. Automatic shut off if you forget to turn it off&lt;br /&gt;4. I have thick hair and i was done in 15 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.Kinda loud but bearable and you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;2.The brush part doesnt stay in very good condition for long at all. Mine has wilted a bit and the brissels have bent and it doesnt really brush very well anymore. That was the first thing to go.&lt;br /&gt;3.again with the brush, just like any other brush hair gets caught in it, so the problem is i always forget to clean it and i try to do it last min while i straighten my hair, havent gotten burned but its something that worried me.&lt;br /&gt;4. the roller part worked great but recently its started to sound like it gets off track. It still works but it has an annoying popping sound every time the roller hits a certain spot.&lt;br /&gt;5. ***VERY IMPORTANT*** if you have bangs....The roller is too big to straighten bangs very well. its possible, but difficult and i&#x27;ve burned myself a good bit. If you have short hair or bangs, then go on to the next one, trust me! This was my biggest issue!!! (but I think instyler recently came out with a smaller one so that&#x27;s an option)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes it does it&#x27;s job as it says it should (minus bangs and short hair), but the hardware issues just weren&#x27;t worth it to me. I&#x27;ve already ordered a new straightener, and this one isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> so it looks great you hair after you straight in it but even with product in my hair it turn poofy and weird about 10 min after not sure why i have thick wavy hair bu never frizzy. oh and i am very care full but still burned my self it burns your skin to the point that i wil always have a scar on my neck. they sould sell this thing to you with a tube of mederma lol. anywho no dont buy this thing i cant return it because i really dont feel like paying shipping back. get a golden plated chi the original i wish i had listened to my hair stylest and bought that one in the first place. maybe i will give this to my arch rival for xmas</li>
