            <li> I made this rating because the cologne has a amazing!!! smell. Its very light and sweet but has a strong masculent aroma as well. When i first spray it, it last for acouple of hours but the majority of the scent fades away. But i found that if i spray my neck and shirt collar directly; it last all day and i recieve nothing but compliments.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne thinking I was going to get a fake/water downed bottle. I CAN GLADLY TELL YOU THIS IS %100 Realities! It has that great strong scent that freshens up throughout the day. I even got it a week earlier than expected! I will DEFINETLY buy again!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband.  Liked the smell of it from the bottle.  Not so much on my husband.  Gave it to my son and he likes it and it smells nice on him.  I would recommend a sample to try before you spend the money to buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. I appreciate the prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> I think this is the cleanest smelling cologne for men to wear in hot and humid temps we get in Florida</li>

            <li> I have always liked this cologne but it was discontinued.  At least I can still find it here and it&#x27;s always available.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000C1VZQU Realities (new) By Liz Claiborne For Men. Cologne Spray 1.7 Ounces]] I had bought three 1.7 oz sizes. I opened one and immediately, I assessed it to be a fake product...Liz Claiborne Realities smells refreshing and longer lasting. This product seemed to be water down...very weak smell and stays about 10 seconds.  Be aware you can not return the product even if it is unopened...this was shocking to me. I am awaiting resolution from Amazon customer service. Update: Amazon contacted me for refund...I appreciate their willingness to refund me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Realities for years and never been disappointed in the product.The bottle was a little smaller then others I have purchased that would be my only complaint. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> It´s an amazing cologne despite of their cheap price and well known trademark.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using for years and it is one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend 100%</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cologne. Smells awesome, not overpowering at all. In my opinion it&#x27;s the best smelling cologne I&#x27;ve ever owned and I have a pretty solid collection including D&amp;G, Burberry &amp; more. The size bottle you get for the price is very good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get complimented all the time with this cologne on, I recommend for all age ranges really.</li>
            <li> I first bought this cologne in 2006, and finally by 2011 had used up the bottle, aside from a small spritz here and there in the time since. However, I had been unable to find this anywhere at a brick-and-mortar location for a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is exactly what I wanted, came earlier than expected, and I now have a supply that should last me close to ten years!</li>
            <li> Good smell, not to strong.&lt;br /&gt;Last most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;Great for evenings out on the town.&lt;br /&gt;The women compliment me on it, and I like that.</li>
            <li> One of my long time favorites... Nice, clean and crisp smell and it lasts!</li>
            <li> Great smell, and great price, been using this for years. Has an oaky spicy smell. Not to strong or musky. Somewhat fruity hint to it.</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE fragrance!! It smells so good. Actually, I am writing a review from this and I already used it all. I plan to order more next week! I love this for my summer scent.. actually I can wear this all year. I just wish they sold it by the gallon. Someone told me it is discontinued, which makes me want to cry. I hope that isnt true. Anyway, buy this! Or don&#x27;t and save them all for me. Either way..</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really like the smell once it arrived.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes that I have ever used. Unable to find it in stores for years. Looks and smells exactly like the bottle that I had purchased years ago. The price is excellent. I will order this again.</li>
            <li> it is a very clean and masculine cologne. Great for any occasion. This will make a great gift. Don&#x27;t let the price fool you.</li>
            <li> This was a gift..but they loved it would purchase again</li>
            <li> great sent.....men you will love this...so will the women...buy it.</li>
            <li> I ordered on a Friday and received it on Monday.  He was very pleased with his gift</li>
