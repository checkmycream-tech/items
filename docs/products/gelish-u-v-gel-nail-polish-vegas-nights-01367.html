            <li> I almost always add this or June Bride as the last coat because I like the little touch of sparkle.</li>
            <li> might also recommend if you are looking for something that has a &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; shimmer but still has the dance try &amp;#34;Ambience&amp;#34; this I would say is the shade down from Vegas Nights</li>
            <li> This is a pretty sparkly topcoat that I use over a lot of my base coats.</li>

            <li> I really like the Gelish line of nail polish.  It wears well and stays on for two weeks.  It is a bit of a process to remove, but worth it to have lovely fingernails for two weeks.  This color is lovely, sparkly, and goes well over other colors, as well as by itself.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This polish looks great over any color and even on its own.  I used just a little and they looked fantastic.</li>
            <li> Love this gel polish glitter very popular</li>
            <li> As the title states, this is my HG glitter polish from Gelish. I use 1-2 coats of this on top of Light Elegant and it is so beautiful. I plan on trying 1-2 coats of Vegas Nights alone to see how it looks. Wonderful polish to add an interesting touch to ANY other color! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right amount of sparkle.  Use it alone or over top of another color.  I get lots of compliments!</li>

            <li> I love this color... It really &amp;#34;dressed&amp;#34; up my nails for Christmas. It looks nice anytime!  I love Vegas nights....</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a nice glitter with great color without getting the large chunks of color flex this is my choice, the colors in this glitter are so pretty.&lt;br /&gt;I might also recommend if you are looking for something that has a &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; shimmer but still has the dance try &amp;#34;Ambience&amp;#34; this I would say is the shade down from Vegas Nights it has the shimmer but toned down both great products. I use the &amp;#34;Ambience&amp;#34; over the creme colors to give that low shimmer effect, the &amp;#34;Vegas Nights&amp;#34; will defiantly give any color that extra POP!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, would purchased from again!</li>
            <li> Really nice glitter. Particles are tiny and multicolored so it goes with any color. Really easy to use, doesn&#x27;t clump the glitter like regular polish tends to</li>
            <li> Three coats of this will catch the sunlight and many many compliments.  This is always my go to nail polish color.  It also looks great with any solid base color.</li>
            <li> This color is fantastic! I get compliments on it every time I wear it! I use it as a top coat over creme colors to add sparkle.</li>
            <li> Favorite gelish Polish thus far; sparkles and subtle.</li>
            <li> looks like a galaxy on your nail. gold color that turns rainbow in diffrent light. very fine pieces of glitter.</li>
