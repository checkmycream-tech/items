            <li>I am amending my review to 4 stars---this is a good product</li>

            <li>The scent is good and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It is a good price.</li>

            <li>The smell so good check it out and save money</li>
            <li>This product has a lot of good qualities.  </li>
            <li>but this is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think anything could be as good as it was - degree</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It smells good and goes on good, but that is about where it ends.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>

            <li>But good product.  </li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Great deodorant that does not smell like i bathed in cheap cologne.</li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing and continues to smell until you take a shower.</li>
            <li>Nicely packed and delivered on time.</li>
            <li>great product, great price and fast delivery</li>
            <li>Though not as potent as 21% &amp;#34;clinically&amp;#34; labeled OTC deodorant products, I find this brand and line to be a good compromise.  </li>
            <li>smells nice, both men and women use it in our home</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great service and great product.  </li>
            <li>Good product but deo is better its bit sticky and gives itchy feel after 8 hrs</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is nice too but not overpowering, and the &#x27;lubrication&#x27; it gives your armpits is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have had no rashes or adverse side effects of any kind.</li>
            <li>Very wierd deal,but a great one!</li>
            <li>The nice balance between smelly girly and smelly like a cowboy.</li>
            <li>This really is effective as a deodorant and reasonably effective as an antiperspirant for me.</li>
            <li>This is effective for me all day.</li>
            <li>Pulling a shift at work and then a nice 3 mile jog didn&#x27;t dent the protection this antiperspirant provided me.  </li>
            <li>I am finding the WHOLE Dove line for men is GREAT!</li>
            <li>I like all of the Dove scents, this one is clean smelling and smells great.  </li>
            <li>Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used for 3 main reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great, strong deodorant that lasts all day and more.</li>
            <li>good deodarant , is not to over powering in good smell and comes off quick after shower.</li>
            <li>It smells good, easy to operate, stops the sweat.</li>
            <li>Very strong baby powder smell makes me a bit weary.</li>
            <li>PLUS, I&#x27;m very easy to be around...</li>
            <li>is in great condition and is work like a charm .. super stylish and amazing performance ..</li>
            <li>It smells good, nothing fancy, just kind of a clean manly smell is how I would describe it.</li>
            <li>Perfect for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>One of the most effective antiperspirants I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant smells nice, it comes as a powder stick instead of gel, which is a lot better for clothes when your underarms sweat.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good price, though, so if you have light body odor / perspiration tendencies, this might be a good fit for you.</li>
            <li>Without a doubt, this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve used and will use nothing else.</li>
            <li>A decent feel, good smell and comfort you expect from a deodorant with a good price attached to it over competitors</li>
            <li>The scent is very light (which is what I was looking for).  </li>
            <li>Has a nice scent without being overly strong.  </li>
            <li>You should always use good deodorant that isn&#x27;t intrusive and use cologne for the smells ;)!</li>
            <li>its meh, not manly or femine its ok</li>
            <li>smells ok</li>
            <li>It keeps me from sweating most of the day.</li>
            <li>Love these for my husband and for myself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK when i purchased i thought it was the gel type that smells stronger and</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok still a value pack</li>
            <li>Will eventually buy more.</li>
            <li>I smell better than when I don&#x27;t use this</li>
            <li>My wife likes it, so I do as well :)</li>
            <li>What more can you say about a deodorant?</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it&#x27;s holding for 10 hours love it</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the protection.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this antiperspirant and deo.</li>
            <li>and now he&#x27;s handsome and appealing as ever.</li>
            <li>Dove for men is awesome, works like womens stuff, only it&#x27;s not...incredible!</li>
            <li>Plus the ladies love it too...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This product is ok for what it does.  </li>
            <li>On a whim, I thought I&#x27;d give this Dove brand a try and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>but I love this one.</li>
            <li>too so if your out and about or cant wait for amazon, youll prolly pay more, but still be able to get it.</li>
            <li>love the 48 hr protection and not it won&#x27;t irratate my skin.....</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>Definitely my favorite deodorant</li>
            <li>It works just as well as Sure</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Better yet, it keeps me from stinking, so it must work.</li>
            <li>Most antiperspirants make me itch</li>
            <li>buy it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Not too overwhelming with the scent</li>
            <li>This is by for the most ineffective antiperspirant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Lasts longer and smells better than everything else he&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li>My fault, I should have known better...</li>
            <li>called the number on the back of the deodorant and was very impressed with the customer service!  </li>
            <li>I can be a lot more confident that I won&#x27;t need to change my shirt halfway through the day with this</li>
            <li>He loves ot and it helps all day :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m DB, and I&#x27;m comfortable in my own skin.</li>
            <li>You can never be sure, but I&#x27;m about 80% sure</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>I love Dove products and will continue to use their soaps and lotions.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t sweat :)</li>
            <li>It lasts for most of the day...</li>
            <li>I have tried many antiperspirants and I always end up with itchy armpits.</li>
            <li>Goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is not an overwhelming scented product and it lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s almost like cars MPG, varies per usage :)</li>
            <li>so it probably work better then most.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been more than two years since I&#x27;ve started using the product/written this review, and I&#x27;m still using it to this day.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the protection.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll buy more when I&#x27;m done with the two I have</li>
            <li>most antiperspirants use to achieve this.</li>
            <li>This truly lasts for 2 days and glad they invented it, customer for life.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>love it all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many antiperspirants and deodorants.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t able to file for a refund or return.</li>
            <li>I am totally ok handing in my man car and going with the dove brand...</li>
            <li>Degree deodorant works a million times better than this product.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, most deodorants irritate my skin, but that&#x27;s not the case with this Dove non-irritant deodorant.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy any more after I run out.  </li>
            <li>I switched to Axe invisible solids a couple years ago and enjoyed the smell of them but</li>
            <li>I weigh 150 lbs, and eat healthy.</li>
            <li>This works really great and smells really good and is a much more effective antiperspirant than a lot of other mens products.</li>
            <li>He works in a high stress imdustry, and a very hot one at that, and this is the perfect amount of protection against B.O. for him.</li>
            <li>This is a great product with clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>The Dove Men Care stuff is great, this smells good and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good antiperspirant/deodorant.</li>
            <li>However this worked pretty good.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh like Christmas trees!!</li>
            <li>No irritation like some others Ive tried price goes up kind of quick though.</li>
            <li>Many men&#x27;s antiperspirants are so strongly perfumed that they clash with cologne, but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>there isn&#x27;t really anything more to say than it smells good</li>
            <li>excellent better product than I expected</li>
            <li>Woo for smelling clean!</li>
            <li>In fact it&#x27;s up there with pure deodorants which just smell good and offer no wetness protection.</li>
            <li>I smell great, the chicks dig it, and I stay dry for the most part!</li>
            <li>I went with this and so far am happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Smells good, doesn&#x27;t leave much residue.</li>
            <li>Girlfriend really likes it, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I have been a Sure user for many years as I found it to be most consistent.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and no lumps.</li>
            <li>Easy to use with a twist of your hand.  </li>
            <li>Easily washes off in the shower.</li>
            <li>Strong deodorant and</li>
            <li>I need a strong deodorant/antiperspirant and this one has been doing the job</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, my wife says the line of stuff all smells good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the performance of this product and plan on buying another twin pack very soon.</li>
            <li>the only good thing though is that it comes off very easily when you take a shower..</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and it works well for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Pleasant, masculine scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent like some of the others, which is a huge plus in my book.</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>No burn, No sweat, Smell nice and for a very longer time.</li>
            <li>and i was hoping to have the same quality, but the deo stick isnt that great</li>
            <li>My wife, daughter and I love the fresh scent of this product.  </li>
            <li>This highly effective deodorant, I have done very well with it,</li>
            <li>They asked for some numbers on the bottom of the product, apologized for my defective one, and sent me a coupon for a FREE stick of their deodorant which I picked up at the store today.  </li>
            <li>My one and only deodorant, doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts and works great.  </li>
            <li>Big deodorant bottles in a two pack for a great price.  </li>
            <li>The feel is also light and does not cake.</li>
            <li>Smooth, not sticky.</li>
            <li>Smells great and last!!!</li>
            <li>Very nic and smell like a rose flower.  </li>
            <li>everything I have ever bought from dove has been absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>no sweat stains on my shirts, still smells great the next morning when I get up.</li>
            <li>It worked ok, not the best deodorant but at least I wasn&#x27;t suffering.</li>
            <li>My husband loves it and it looks like it is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but Tom&#x27;s was essentially the best I could do even though it didn&#x27;t really satisfy everything I was looking for.</li>
            <li>For me, it works the best of any antiperspirant I&#x27;ve tried, but I do vacuum my car much more frequently these days.</li>
            <li>love the smell of it, and has just the right balance of strength</li>
            <li>Lives up to its description as an antiperspirant &amp; deodorant and has a very fresh smell to it.</li>
            <li>Smells super strong.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone looking for an effective antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>I bought this originally for the 48 hour claim, and boy does it deliver.</li>
            <li>so fresh and so clean clean!</li>
            <li>I only use these kind of products!</li>
            <li>The combination of all three keeps me clean and smelling great all day long.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and keeps my underarms dry</li>
            <li>It smells great and keeps me dry.</li>
            <li>However I know I still smell clean thancks to this 48 hour protection.</li>
            <li>Does a great job of keeping BO out and dry.  </li>
            <li>Clean smell</li>
            <li>real thing, works great so far.</li>
            <li>No frills, nothing special.</li>
            <li>This particular one offers a great scent, and hasn&#x27;t caused me any issues.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, it is an adequate product and superior to most other brands.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very clean, very consistent with what you might expect Old Spice or Gillette to smell like but not too over the top.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really ask for anything more but world peace.</li>
            <li>Of the products in the &amp;#34;Extra Fresh&amp;#34; line by Dove, this is the only one which smells as good as the bar soap that motivated me to try the others.</li>
            <li>He also has sensitive skin and this has proven effective on both fronts.</li>
            <li>The only good deoderant I can find that doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out in a rash, nor bleach the underarms of my shirts.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, with this stuff I seem to notice a body odor later in the day, whereas with just deodorant I do not.  </li>
            <li>even my wife loves it a lot and lasting is good</li>
            <li>I am a sweaty guy and this thing kept me comfortable and fresh.</li>
            <li>The antiperspirant isn&#x27;t on full effect, but I can dig it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been kind of stuck with Tom&#x27;s natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Light fresh smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good basic deodorant.</li>
            <li>I decided to try it after seeing it was top rated on Amazon, but I don&#x27;t really care for it.</li>
            <li>Keeps you dry and has a nice and refreshing fragrance.  </li>
            <li>My nose is quite sensitive to most smells and this one is really strong for me.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell which stays long.</li>
            <li>It has a great scent and does not leave any residue, I work long hours in an old un airconditioned office building and it gets pretty warm in the summer months.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and goes on noticeably smoother and gentler than alot of other stick deodorants i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Great price with the subscription deal and 5 other items.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to fault Dove for that, so if you love the smell like I do, and don&#x27;t mind those stains - it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>i love having a subscription show up each month :) makes it easy and worry free it has been about a year and a half</li>
            <li>Fresh Clean Fortifying 2 in 1 (12oz)]].  </li>
            <li>All because i smell so fresh and so clean.</li>
            <li>This deodorant smells fresh and keeps me feeling clean all day, even in the sun.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a mild, pleasant smell and keep you dry all day.</li>
            <li>Two thumbs up for the quick delivery</li>
            <li>Could just be I am super stinky, but do not think so.</li>
            <li>Got here quickly.</li>
            <li>Just as described; arrived quickly</li>
            <li>We have tried many other deodorants since we realized with MUCH better results!</li>
            <li>Super.</li>
            <li>I never imagined the product would afford 48 hour protection as it claims, but I&#x27;m lucky to get 8 hour protection.</li>
            <li>No absurd ads, just simple, clean, smell good deodorant</li>
            <li>Much better than normal Gillette, etc.</li>
            <li>Maybe I sweat more than normal?  </li>
            <li>This antiperspirant will keep you smelling good all day long.  </li>
            <li>He still smells good when he comes home after a long day.</li>
            <li>Soap bar does go down faster but the suds and whatever else is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to most smells and this one is a bit strong for me.  </li>
            <li>I was kind of amazed of the strong smell of it which can last pretty long (more than a day for sure).</li>
            <li>My friends tried to play an April fools prank on me this year, but instead I ended up finding my new favorite snack.</li>
            <li>Pretty good but be prepared for white deodorant stains on clothing this stuff always makes them.</li>
            <li>Keeps me smelling good and somewhat dry</li>
            <li>The scent is just enough to make everything neutral until you get very close, then my wife says it is pleasant.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s very active and works out frequently, and this one does the best job.  </li>
            <li>circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved it so much when I tried it that I ordered a half dozen more sticks</li>
            <li>Smells Fantastic, fast application.</li>
            <li>it smells really good and last the whole day for me</li>
            <li>I personally prefer the gel kind of deodorants, but this one does its job.  </li>
            <li>This review is for the Dove Men+Care Fresh Scent.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I can&#x27;t afford stuff in a regular store.</li>
            <li>Keeps my man smelling fresh all day.  </li>
            <li>It is worth a try if you haven&#x27;t found one that works for you.</li>
            <li>smell fresh and stay fresh all day for them</li>
            <li>Worth of my money and my underarm pits</li>
            <li>Good antiperspirant that  will last throughout a whole day.</li>
            <li>I prefer deodorants that are not too smelly and this one has a pretty mild scent.</li>
            <li>Antiperspirant is antiperspirant, right?</li>
            <li>Am I right or am I right.</li>
            <li>Prefer over right guard right now.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, this stuff works.  </li>
            <li>The main reason I like it is the light scent.</li>
            <li>This is easy on his sensitive skin but does the job, we have it on subscribe and save delivered to the door!</li>
            <li>Glides on smoothly and wipes off easily, doesn&#x27;t leave your underarms feeling gritty or oily.</li>
            <li>This is twin-pack is a good deal at Amazon and this scent is fresh enough without being overpowering or way too artificially masculine like some of the ones on the market (eh hem, axe).</li>
            <li>Keep you fresh throughout the whole day!</li>
            <li>Keeps odor away while not having much of a smell itself, dries quick.</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell to it and goes on smoothly without any trouble.</li>
            <li>It works and is easy on sensitive men&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product because I realized that my Old Spice antiperspirant had too much of a scent.  </li>
            <li>To me, this has a pleasant but almost imperceptible scent, which is as it should be.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, and many antiperspirants that are strong enough to work for me also irritate my skin to the point of a visible rash.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, goes on smooth, and the whole bottom rotates to push the deodorant unlike brands that use a small wheel that doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>Smells good, a little clumpy or powdery.</li>
            <li>It smells good too, not as good imo and is weak compared to their solid.  </li>
            <li>But seriously, it works well, smells good and was pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>I like the smell very much, it doesn&#x27;t last more than 24 hours (they say 48 hours)</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was on sale (with a smaller sample stick of the Aqua Impact scent, which I also highly recommend, smells amazing) and immediately after putting it on I knew I had found a go-to deodorant.</li>
            <li>is reasonable!</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it definitely lasts for 24+ hours!</li>
            <li>I like most about this product is how it compliments the soap of the same smell.</li>
            <li>more of it came than i thought (the tubes were bigger than expected)&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I applied pretty generously.</li>
            <li>However, smells pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Fresh scented deodorant with antiperspirant works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Mitchum lasts longer and is better for the summer, but I will go back to dove for winters.  </li>
            <li>I tried one of the higher end ($9)</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with underarm wetness for years; this is the first antiperspirant that has actually worked for me, and it smells better than anything I&#x27;ve worn before.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, I don&#x27;t know about it actually lasting as long as it says it does</li>
            <li>Make sure it dries thoroughly before you put on your shirt though, otherwise it will leave some white residue.</li>
            <li>For pennies more, you can purchase the larger size in any grocery store or Drug store.&lt;br</li>
            <li>wish I had tried the faulty one first.  </li>
            <li>My current favorite.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and I can say it will last defiantly more than a day.</li>
            <li>FINALLY, I found one that doesn&#x27;t, and I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Most likely won&#x27;t get this again.</li>
            <li>This deodorant really works!</li>
            <li>Works very well and would recommend to anyone with a need to keep their perspiration in check!  </li>
            <li>The scent is refreshing and definitely protects you throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I got my first Dove Men&#x27;s +Care.</li>
            <li>My teenage son realized it didn&#x27;t work after many embarrassing moments at school activities.  </li>
            <li>And does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>Great deodorant, keeps me from sweating excessively and doesn&#x27;t smell too much.</li>
            <li>However, this is reduces to a non-noticeable level pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They seem to work OK, but they leave LOTS of white residue on my clothes.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant is mostly sold individually in stores and can get quite pricey.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it needs to.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, smells great, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>This is the only deodorant my husband wants to buy any more.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this antiperspirant, it really does last 48 hours for those times</li>
            <li>Fairly safe so far on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>All of the deodorants I&#x27;ve used before this certainly seemed to help prevent some perspiration, but by the end of the day my shirts would still be pretty damp under the arms.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Bought this after reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>They sell it pretty much everywhere</li>
            <li>Other products left my skin irritated but this works great.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few months now, and am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Stops you from sweating so much the whole day!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other lines of deodorants and this is definitely my current favorite.</li>
            <li>Also, with the exception of the white plastic at the bottom of the stick (which is easily removed), the rest of the packaging can be recycled.</li>
            <li>It may leave you smelling clean and feeling fresh but it leaves your clothing with a permanent sweat stain making you look like the 400lb man running through the aisles of Walmart searching for the last box of Twinkies, and much like that man feeling dissatisfied when he can&#x27;t find any Twinkies you will be dissatisfied with this product when you realize it ruined your clothing by leaving a waxy residue on your shirt.</li>
            <li>but I would go for unsented in the future as I find the smell way too strong.</li>
            <li>Twin pack consists of two large deodorants.</li>
            <li>B001F0QX1E Certain</li>
            <li>i even tried putting it on right after i shower thinking it might absorb better hence leading to less shedding which made no difference.  </li>
            <li>I usually have used Original Degree and it would go on kind of rough and not glide smoothly.</li>
            <li>Keeps the guy smelling good even if he&#x27;s a hard working guy.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few deodorants that can last all day, smell great even after a workout, and not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Deodorant works really well.</li>
            <li>My husband thanks me for the purchase..</li>
            <li>Works very well all day.  </li>
            <li>You really do save money that way.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even sweat that much.</li>
            <li>I also like the light blue one.</li>
            <li>This deodorant really helped me out by keeping me from perspiring too much.</li>
            <li>Those poor ladies, lol.</li>
            <li>The 48-hour claim is real.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not very often you&#x27;ll ever make it 48 hours without a shower, 36 is certainly plausible if you take a shower before work on Monday, but not before work on Tuesday because you&#x27;re planning on hitting the gym after work.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t perspire a lot, but can tell you that the protection lasts much longer than 24 hours.</li>
            <li>how much can I write about deodrant, it keeps me from being stinky.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and packaged well.</li>
            <li>Deodorant and antiperspirant, that second one is the important part...</li>
            <li>really like Dove.  </li>
            <li>And I really like the scent.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had much issues with perspiration since I started using this...</li>
            <li>I waited to get through the whole stick before I posted my review</li>
            <li>It has a gentle fragrance, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>that is what really matters.</li>
            <li>I have very hairy underarms</li>
            <li>and it gets me through my whole day and my workout...</li>
            <li>I have never gone through a stick of deodorant so fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I didnt really help to much in my effort to stop sweating.</li>
            <li>That is about all I really ask for.</li>
            <li>Subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I found dove because so far its the only one I have used that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Has a pleasant long lasting fragrance and dries clear.</li>
            <li>Since you buy it in a twin pack the unit price is reasonable and you can even save more with subscribe and save or any other coupon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problems with the other Dove Men brands, like the moisturizer causing my skin to get scaly, but this one product is top notch.</li>
            <li>Miss the other scents, this one is OK.</li>
            <li>When you shamefully go through life with sweaty armpits like I do, you need something that provides greater stink-covering protection than the other brands.</li>
            <li>I end up using more product than I do with other brands and it ends up transferring to the underarm area of my shirt as I wear it.  </li>
            <li>It also controls perspiration better than other ones I have used.</li>
            <li>It is better than any other anti-perspirant I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Love this product, no irritation at all, I have had some other deodorants that have caused issues.</li>
            <li>Just clean off with water, no big deal.</li>
            <li>While this won&#x27;t prevent pit stains in 90 degree heat while working outside in the sun, it does keep the pits dry throughout the day while moving between slightly warm conference rooms at work.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin which tends to become easily irritated from the combination of sweat, antiperspirant, and friction from daily arm movement.</li>
            <li>I will be going back to the deodorant, since even going full bore</li>
            <li>The scent is so sweet which definitely eliminates the need to wear cologne or perfume.</li>
            <li>Very masculine scent with decent coverage!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll keep you smelling decent and also help you avoid unsightly underarm</li>
            <li>Decent price.</li>
            <li>is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that</li>
            <li>For the last month I&#x27;ve tried to go completely stick free... and, well, I find myself redordering this product.</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m likely putting on more than i normally would get from another brand with the same expectations.  </li>
            <li>It does not last nearly as long as it claims, I do not sweat that much and after 5hrs I could feel my self in need of more deodorant.</li>
            <li>having to need more during the day is not cool.</li>
            <li>I can see why it was highly reviewed.</li>
            <li>I really highly recommend</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a guy who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like a 16-year-old high school kid trying to impress a girl in his math class, then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to buy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I like the scent and everything but just like other kind similar, it does leave streaks on your shirts.</li>
            <li>It successfully blocks sweat for a long time, even during fairly intense workouts, without the irritants and hard metals</li>
            <li>I can be outside for an afternoon and still smell fresh and not be &amp;#34;pitting out&amp;#34; as they say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This extra fresh scent is not overpowering and does not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>I have been searching a LONG time for a antiperspirant/deodorant that seems to be a rare combination: one that really works and doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals.</li>
            <li>I normally get degree</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it does not fit this case&lt;</li>
            <li>I normally use degree</li>
            <li>I use something else as my normal antiperspirant, but I will use this periodically.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did cut down on the itchiness and irritation, but i did not get better until using doves clear gel.  </li>
            <li>I love this deordorant but seems like they dont last very long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others and this is the only one that keeps me dry and odor free!</li>
            <li>Kind if expensive,, ran out quick.</li>
            <li>Some anti-perspirants have such a strong odor that it irritates my nose when I sleep shortly after applying.</li>
            <li>I can tell you after a full work day I still feel dry.</li>
            <li>I have been using Right Guard gel deodorant for several years but thought it was time to try something new.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to re-apply unless it&#x27;s a super hot day, whereas with Tom&#x27;s and other natural deodorants</li>
            <li>I am on a pursuit to find a new deodorant</li>
            <li>No idea what that is about, but I&#x27;ve now ordered new shirts, and am here to order new antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>I tried to find a new deodorant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m better of staying with the clear gel or dry spray in the future</li>
            <li>It smells great and do not leave behind any white stuff.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and short lasting.</li>
            <li>Lasts most of the day, and is comparable to pretty much every other anti perspirant (less mitchum)</li>
            <li>I have cancer and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The extra strength old spice always ends up giving me a rash, and does not seem to last until 9pm, while Dove lasts until I shower and does so with a more subtle, more refined scent that does not overpower in the morning nor fade in the evening.</li>
            <li>, I ordered this plus many other Bath items and they all arrived a couple days later.</li>
            <li>only complaint is the chalky texture, Other wise a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently deployed to Afghanistan, its hot over here which means i sweat nonstop, this stuff works....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d try some new natural deodorants here and there</li>
            <li>Smells really fresh and keeps you dry all day.</li>
            <li>It does what it does and keeps things fresh and dry.</li>
            <li>It also lasts quite long - not sure if it goes the full 24 hours, but it will last most of the day with one application.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this Dove antiperspirant to use daily in conjunction with the Certain Dri.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going through a stick</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those complaining about this deodorant leaving behind residue on your shirts, be sure you (a) only apply ONE SWIPE per pit and (b) make sure you allow time for the antiperspirant to dry before putting your shirts on.</li>
            <li>I was assuming it was the clear stick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and it has kept my underarms clear of sweat or any odor.  </li>
            <li>would not buy again - chose the clear type</li>
            <li>clear gel is the way to go... expect to get this all over your clothes when dressing...</li>
            <li>is one of the items that a review is silly to do as I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner&lt;</li>
            <li>Gentle enough for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is usually sensitive but don&#x27;t have a problem with this.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give me a rash or irritation like old spice.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even want to be near me then.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it if you are sensitive like I am.</li>
            <li>far as the quality, it DOES the &amp;#34;job&amp;#34; well.</li>
            <li>I must say I am surprised by Dove&#x27;s deodorant.</li>
            <li>I got this for my 12 yr old son.</li>
            <li>I was amazingly surprised at the logetivity of the antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>this helps people that might have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this was recommended by my doctor.</li>
            <li>The odor is masculine, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>For a while, I wanted to get away from the aluminum and tried all natural deodorants.  </li>
            <li>I used to use the Old Spice deodorants but those made me sweat and soon after I would smell.</li>
            <li>so it stays affective throughout the day but not come off too aggressive early on.&lt;br /&gt;Overall –</li>
            <li>I feel that it&#x27;s almost too soft of a stick</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how doo this antiperspirant deodorant worked.</li>
            <li>I had tried Mitchum, Old Spice, Speed Stick, and nearly every brand trying to find something to curb my pit sweating.</li>
            <li>He used Old Spice before and now prefers this.</li>
            <li>I also use [[ASIN:B004S7QDCA Dove Men Plus Care Extra Fresh Cooling Agent Body and Face Wash Total Skin Comfort 3 Pack Value Pack]] and</li>
            <li>This is the only deodorant I use, I love it and it is hard to find where I live.</li>
            <li>Like the subtle scents they offer much better.</li>
            <li>The only main issue I found is that it did irritate my skin after a while.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first about ordering the twin pack but needless to say, I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the antiperspirant for its lasting power and gentleness on the skin.</li>
            <li>My husband works outside year round and needs something strong and this does the job.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s immediately prior to a workout I&#x27;ll just use a small amount and there won&#x27;t be much to get off in the shower, though I can easily use it after showering and it&#x27;ll keep me from sweating while I sleep, all throughout the next day, and through my workout.</li>
            <li>i got the item on exact time as expected ..</li>
            <li>This product smells good and is effective, but leaves a terrible rash on my teen son.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful, very little scent</li>
            <li>Opted for old spice with a higher percentage of active ingredient.</li>
            <li>worked great for a while but after wearing for several months stopped working and now my husband stinks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Gillette brand of clear gel for years but the cost got too high and it took forever for it to dry under my arms after application.</li>
            <li>Unlike other deodorants I&#x27;ve used, this one actually lasts and lets me stay fresh throughout the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc</li>
            <li>Typically, if it&#x27;s a white paste, I never have a problem, but sometimes never do with clear either.  </li>
            <li>but it ends up feeling wet in my armpits even without much activity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to old spice.</li>
            <li>I have discovered I actually like all of the scents Dove offers.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to different antiperspirants as they can cause a burning sensation which can often be an allergic reaction to the product.</li>
            <li>Would recommend, even though I prefer gel or soft cream type deodorants to bar types such as this.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it can leave white residue on darker clothing like most deodorants of this type.</li>
            <li>Left marked in the arm pits of my shirts.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate underarm sweating, but only minimizes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I started developing rashes from Old Spice and Axe solid sticks, and decided to give this a try!</li>
            <li>son no longer stinks - works good</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to do better or worse than Axe or others at anti-perspiring.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely tough on clothing, which goes for every antiperspirant I&#x27;ve tried (Degree, Right Guard, Gillette, Old Spice...), and it has an unusual chalky texture that flakes off my underarms.</li>
            <li>This one is gentle enough on my skin for every day use, and keeps me dry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that it takes just a few swipes to get just the right amount applied...</li>
            <li>Works well for the whole day, and not an overpowering scent like some of the other brands, also doens&#x27;t seem to bother my skin.</li>
            <li>I subtracted one star from the rating because this is a little more expensive and doesn&#x27;t give me as many days of use as my previous choice.</li>
            <li>Personally to me really like this fragrance, long kept not leave traces and dry.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised how long the smell lasts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overwhelming, smells fresh, and lasts for 2 days.</li>
            <li>My husband asked me to stop purchasing it a few months after he first tried it.  </li>
            <li>Really keeps the sweat down, I do not get pitted-out at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fifty one years old and have been using these products for a very long time.</li>
            <li>Large amount of deodorant for little money.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant unobtrusive scent.</li>
            <li>This has a subtle smell that keeps you cool.</li>
            <li>Definitely a bit less moisture, but hasn&#x27;t kept me completely dry even in the first two hours,</li>
            <li>It smells really good and the price isn&#x27;t bad.</li>

            <li> Works well, smells good.</li>
            <li> The scent is good and not overpowering.</li>

            <li> The smell so good check it out and save money</li>
            <li> This product has a lot of good qualities.  </li>
            <li> but this is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think anything could be as good as it was - degree</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The smell is nice too but not overpowering, and the &#x27;lubrication&#x27; it gives your armpits is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have had no rashes or adverse side effects of any kind.</li>
            <li> Very wierd deal,but a great one!</li>
            <li> The nice balance between smelly girly and smelly like a cowboy.</li>
            <li> This really is effective as a deodorant and reasonably effective as an antiperspirant for me.</li>
            <li> This is effective for me all day.</li>
            <li> Pulling a shift at work and then a nice 3 mile jog didn&#x27;t dent the protection this antiperspirant provided me.  </li>
            <li> I am finding the WHOLE Dove line for men is GREAT!</li>
            <li> I like all of the Dove scents, this one is clean smelling and smells great.  </li>
            <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used for 3 main reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great, strong deodorant that lasts all day and more.</li>
            <li> good deodarant , is not to over powering in good smell and comes off quick after shower.</li>
            <li> It smells good, easy to operate, stops the sweat.</li>
            <li> Very strong baby powder smell makes me a bit weary.</li>
            <li> PLUS, I&#x27;m very easy to be around...</li>
            <li> is in great condition and is work like a charm .. super stylish and amazing performance ..</li>
            <li> It smells good, nothing fancy, just kind of a clean manly smell is how I would describe it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> One of the most effective antiperspirants I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant smells nice, it comes as a powder stick instead of gel, which is a lot better for clothes when your underarms sweat.</li>
            <li> The smell is light and good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good price, though, so if you have light body odor / perspiration tendencies, this might be a good fit for you.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve used and will use nothing else.</li>
            <li> A decent feel, good smell and comfort you expect from a deodorant with a good price attached to it over competitors</li>
            <li> The scent is very light (which is what I was looking for).  </li>
            <li> Has a nice scent without being overly strong.  </li>
            <li> You should always use good deodorant that isn&#x27;t intrusive and use cologne for the smells ;)!</li>
            <li> its meh, not manly or femine its ok</li>
            <li> smells ok</li>
            <li> It keeps me from sweating most of the day.</li>
            <li> Love these for my husband and for myself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK when i purchased i thought it was the gel type that smells stronger and</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok still a value pack</li>
            <li> Will eventually buy more.</li>
            <li> I smell better than when I don&#x27;t use this</li>
            <li> My wife likes it, so I do as well :)</li>
            <li> What more can you say about a deodorant?</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it&#x27;s holding for 10 hours love it</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the protection.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this antiperspirant and deo.</li>
            <li> and now he&#x27;s handsome and appealing as ever.</li>
            <li> Dove for men is awesome, works like womens stuff, only it&#x27;s not...incredible!</li>
            <li> Plus the ladies love it too...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> This product is ok for what it does.  </li>
            <li> On a whim, I thought I&#x27;d give this Dove brand a try and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> but I love this one.</li>
            <li> too so if your out and about or cant wait for amazon, youll prolly pay more, but still be able to get it.</li>
            <li> love the 48 hr protection and not it won&#x27;t irratate my skin.....</li>
            <li> I love this scent.</li>
            <li> Definitely my favorite deodorant</li>
            <li> It works just as well as Sure</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Better yet, it keeps me from stinking, so it must work.</li>
            <li> Most antiperspirants make me itch</li>
            <li> buy it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Not too overwhelming with the scent</li>
            <li> This is by for the most ineffective antiperspirant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Lasts longer and smells better than everything else he&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li> My fault, I should have known better...</li>
            <li> called the number on the back of the deodorant and was very impressed with the customer service!  </li>
            <li> I can be a lot more confident that I won&#x27;t need to change my shirt halfway through the day with this</li>
            <li> He loves ot and it helps all day :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m DB, and I&#x27;m comfortable in my own skin.</li>
            <li> You can never be sure, but I&#x27;m about 80% sure</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> I love Dove products and will continue to use their soaps and lotions.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t sweat :)</li>
            <li> It lasts for most of the day...</li>
            <li> I have tried many antiperspirants and I always end up with itchy armpits.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is not an overwhelming scented product and it lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s almost like cars MPG, varies per usage :)</li>
            <li> so it probably work better then most.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been more than two years since I&#x27;ve started using the product/written this review, and I&#x27;m still using it to this day.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the protection.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll buy more when I&#x27;m done with the two I have</li>
            <li> most antiperspirants use to achieve this.</li>
            <li> This truly lasts for 2 days and glad they invented it, customer for life.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> love it all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many antiperspirants and deodorants.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t able to file for a refund or return.</li>
            <li> I am totally ok handing in my man car and going with the dove brand...</li>
            <li> Degree deodorant works a million times better than this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, most deodorants irritate my skin, but that&#x27;s not the case with this Dove non-irritant deodorant.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy any more after I run out.  </li>
            <li> I switched to Axe invisible solids a couple years ago and enjoyed the smell of them but</li>
            <li> I weigh 150 lbs, and eat healthy.</li>
            <li> This works really great and smells really good and is a much more effective antiperspirant than a lot of other mens products.</li>
            <li> He works in a high stress imdustry, and a very hot one at that, and this is the perfect amount of protection against B.O. for him.</li>
            <li> This is a great product with clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> The Dove Men Care stuff is great, this smells good and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good antiperspirant/deodorant.</li>
            <li> However this worked pretty good.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh like Christmas trees!!</li>
            <li> No irritation like some others Ive tried price goes up kind of quick though.</li>
            <li> Many men&#x27;s antiperspirants are so strongly perfumed that they clash with cologne, but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> there isn&#x27;t really anything more to say than it smells good</li>
            <li> excellent better product than I expected</li>
            <li> Woo for smelling clean!</li>
            <li> In fact it&#x27;s up there with pure deodorants which just smell good and offer no wetness protection.</li>
            <li> I smell great, the chicks dig it, and I stay dry for the most part!</li>
            <li> I went with this and so far am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Smells good, doesn&#x27;t leave much residue.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend really likes it, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I have been a Sure user for many years as I found it to be most consistent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply and no lumps.</li>
            <li> Easy to use with a twist of your hand.  </li>
            <li> Easily washes off in the shower.</li>
            <li> Strong deodorant and</li>
            <li> I need a strong deodorant/antiperspirant and this one has been doing the job</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, my wife says the line of stuff all smells good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the performance of this product and plan on buying another twin pack very soon.</li>
            <li> the only good thing though is that it comes off very easily when you take a shower..</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and it works well for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Pleasant, masculine scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent like some of the others, which is a huge plus in my book.</li>
            <li> Cheap.</li>
            <li> No burn, No sweat, Smell nice and for a very longer time.</li>
            <li> and i was hoping to have the same quality, but the deo stick isnt that great</li>
            <li> My wife, daughter and I love the fresh scent of this product.  </li>
            <li> This highly effective deodorant, I have done very well with it,</li>
            <li> They asked for some numbers on the bottom of the product, apologized for my defective one, and sent me a coupon for a FREE stick of their deodorant which I picked up at the store today.  </li>
            <li> My one and only deodorant, doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts and works great.  </li>
            <li> Big deodorant bottles in a two pack for a great price.  </li>
            <li> The feel is also light and does not cake.</li>
            <li> Smooth, not sticky.</li>
            <li> Smells great and last!!!</li>
            <li> Very nic and smell like a rose flower.  </li>
            <li> everything I have ever bought from dove has been absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> no sweat stains on my shirts, still smells great the next morning when I get up.</li>
            <li> It worked ok, not the best deodorant but at least I wasn&#x27;t suffering.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it and it looks like it is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but Tom&#x27;s was essentially the best I could do even though it didn&#x27;t really satisfy everything I was looking for.</li>
            <li> For me, it works the best of any antiperspirant I&#x27;ve tried, but I do vacuum my car much more frequently these days.</li>
            <li> love the smell of it, and has just the right balance of strength</li>
            <li> Lives up to its description as an antiperspirant &amp; deodorant and has a very fresh smell to it.</li>
            <li> Smells super strong.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to anyone looking for an effective antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I bought this originally for the 48 hour claim, and boy does it deliver.</li>
            <li> so fresh and so clean clean!</li>
            <li> I only use these kind of products!</li>
            <li> The combination of all three keeps me clean and smelling great all day long.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps my underarms dry</li>
            <li> It smells great and keeps me dry.</li>
            <li> However I know I still smell clean thancks to this 48 hour protection.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of keeping BO out and dry.  </li>
            <li> Clean smell</li>
            <li> real thing, works great so far.</li>
            <li> No frills, nothing special.</li>
            <li> This particular one offers a great scent, and hasn&#x27;t caused me any issues.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, it is an adequate product and superior to most other brands.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very clean, very consistent with what you might expect Old Spice or Gillette to smell like but not too over the top.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really ask for anything more but world peace.</li>
            <li> Of the products in the &amp;#34;Extra Fresh&amp;#34; line by Dove, this is the only one which smells as good as the bar soap that motivated me to try the others.</li>
            <li> He also has sensitive skin and this has proven effective on both fronts.</li>
            <li> The only good deoderant I can find that doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out in a rash, nor bleach the underarms of my shirts.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, with this stuff I seem to notice a body odor later in the day, whereas with just deodorant I do not.  </li>
            <li> even my wife loves it a lot and lasting is good</li>
            <li> I am a sweaty guy and this thing kept me comfortable and fresh.</li>
            <li> The antiperspirant isn&#x27;t on full effect, but I can dig it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been kind of stuck with Tom&#x27;s natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Light fresh smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good basic deodorant.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it after seeing it was top rated on Amazon, but I don&#x27;t really care for it.</li>
            <li> Keeps you dry and has a nice and refreshing fragrance.  </li>
            <li> My nose is quite sensitive to most smells and this one is really strong for me.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell which stays long.</li>
            <li> It has a great scent and does not leave any residue, I work long hours in an old un airconditioned office building and it gets pretty warm in the summer months.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and goes on noticeably smoother and gentler than alot of other stick deodorants i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Great price with the subscription deal and 5 other items.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to fault Dove for that, so if you love the smell like I do, and don&#x27;t mind those stains - it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> i love having a subscription show up each month :) makes it easy and worry free it has been about a year and a half</li>
            <li> Fresh Clean Fortifying 2 in 1 (12oz)]].  </li>
            <li> All because i smell so fresh and so clean.</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells fresh and keeps me feeling clean all day, even in the sun.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It has a mild, pleasant smell and keep you dry all day.</li>
            <li> Two thumbs up for the quick delivery</li>
            <li> Could just be I am super stinky, but do not think so.</li>
            <li> Got here quickly.</li>
            <li> Just as described; arrived quickly</li>
            <li> We have tried many other deodorants since we realized with MUCH better results!</li>
            <li> Super.</li>
            <li> I never imagined the product would afford 48 hour protection as it claims, but I&#x27;m lucky to get 8 hour protection.</li>
            <li> No absurd ads, just simple, clean, smell good deodorant</li>
            <li> Much better than normal Gillette, etc.</li>
            <li> Maybe I sweat more than normal?  </li>
            <li> This antiperspirant will keep you smelling good all day long.  </li>
            <li> He still smells good when he comes home after a long day.</li>
            <li> Soap bar does go down faster but the suds and whatever else is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to most smells and this one is a bit strong for me.  </li>
            <li> I was kind of amazed of the strong smell of it which can last pretty long (more than a day for sure).</li>
            <li> My friends tried to play an April fools prank on me this year, but instead I ended up finding my new favorite snack.</li>
            <li> Pretty good but be prepared for white deodorant stains on clothing this stuff always makes them.</li>
            <li> Keeps me smelling good and somewhat dry</li>
            <li> The scent is just enough to make everything neutral until you get very close, then my wife says it is pleasant.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s very active and works out frequently, and this one does the best job.  </li>
            <li> circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved it so much when I tried it that I ordered a half dozen more sticks</li>
            <li> Smells Fantastic, fast application.</li>
            <li> it smells really good and last the whole day for me</li>
            <li> I personally prefer the gel kind of deodorants, but this one does its job.  </li>
            <li> This review is for the Dove Men+Care Fresh Scent.  </li>
            <li> Honestly I can&#x27;t afford stuff in a regular store.</li>
            <li> Keeps my man smelling fresh all day.  </li>
            <li> It is worth a try if you haven&#x27;t found one that works for you.</li>
            <li> smell fresh and stay fresh all day for them</li>
            <li> Worth of my money and my underarm pits</li>
            <li> Good antiperspirant that  will last throughout a whole day.</li>
            <li> I prefer deodorants that are not too smelly and this one has a pretty mild scent.</li>
            <li> Antiperspirant is antiperspirant, right?</li>
            <li> Am I right or am I right.</li>
            <li> Prefer over right guard right now.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right, this stuff works.  </li>
            <li> The main reason I like it is the light scent.</li>
            <li> This is easy on his sensitive skin but does the job, we have it on subscribe and save delivered to the door!</li>
            <li> Glides on smoothly and wipes off easily, doesn&#x27;t leave your underarms feeling gritty or oily.</li>
            <li> This is twin-pack is a good deal at Amazon and this scent is fresh enough without being overpowering or way too artificially masculine like some of the ones on the market (eh hem, axe).</li>
            <li> Keep you fresh throughout the whole day!</li>
            <li> Keeps odor away while not having much of a smell itself, dries quick.</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell to it and goes on smoothly without any trouble.</li>
            <li> It works and is easy on sensitive men&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product because I realized that my Old Spice antiperspirant had too much of a scent.  </li>
            <li> To me, this has a pleasant but almost imperceptible scent, which is as it should be.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, and many antiperspirants that are strong enough to work for me also irritate my skin to the point of a visible rash.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, goes on smooth, and the whole bottom rotates to push the deodorant unlike brands that use a small wheel that doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Smells good, a little clumpy or powdery.</li>
            <li> It smells good too, not as good imo and is weak compared to their solid.  </li>
            <li> But seriously, it works well, smells good and was pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> I like the smell very much, it doesn&#x27;t last more than 24 hours (they say 48 hours)</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was on sale (with a smaller sample stick of the Aqua Impact scent, which I also highly recommend, smells amazing) and immediately after putting it on I knew I had found a go-to deodorant.</li>
            <li> is reasonable!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it definitely lasts for 24+ hours!</li>
            <li> I like most about this product is how it compliments the soap of the same smell.</li>
            <li> more of it came than i thought (the tubes were bigger than expected)&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I applied pretty generously.</li>
            <li> However, smells pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Fresh scented deodorant with antiperspirant works very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Mitchum lasts longer and is better for the summer, but I will go back to dove for winters.  </li>
            <li> I tried one of the higher end ($9)</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with underarm wetness for years; this is the first antiperspirant that has actually worked for me, and it smells better than anything I&#x27;ve worn before.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I don&#x27;t know about it actually lasting as long as it says it does</li>
            <li> Make sure it dries thoroughly before you put on your shirt though, otherwise it will leave some white residue.</li>
            <li> For pennies more, you can purchase the larger size in any grocery store or Drug store.&lt;br</li>
            <li> wish I had tried the faulty one first.  </li>
            <li> My current favorite.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and I can say it will last defiantly more than a day.</li>
            <li> FINALLY, I found one that doesn&#x27;t, and I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Most likely won&#x27;t get this again.</li>
            <li> This deodorant really works!</li>
            <li> Works very well and would recommend to anyone with a need to keep their perspiration in check!  </li>
            <li> The scent is refreshing and definitely protects you throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I got my first Dove Men&#x27;s +Care.</li>
            <li> My teenage son realized it didn&#x27;t work after many embarrassing moments at school activities.  </li>
            <li> And does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> Great deodorant, keeps me from sweating excessively and doesn&#x27;t smell too much.</li>
            <li> However, this is reduces to a non-noticeable level pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They seem to work OK, but they leave LOTS of white residue on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant is mostly sold individually in stores and can get quite pricey.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it needs to.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, smells great, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant my husband wants to buy any more.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this antiperspirant, it really does last 48 hours for those times</li>
            <li> Fairly safe so far on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> All of the deodorants I&#x27;ve used before this certainly seemed to help prevent some perspiration, but by the end of the day my shirts would still be pretty damp under the arms.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Bought this after reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> They sell it pretty much everywhere</li>
            <li> Other products left my skin irritated but this works great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now, and am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Stops you from sweating so much the whole day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other lines of deodorants and this is definitely my current favorite.</li>
            <li> Also, with the exception of the white plastic at the bottom of the stick (which is easily removed), the rest of the packaging can be recycled.</li>
            <li> It may leave you smelling clean and feeling fresh but it leaves your clothing with a permanent sweat stain making you look like the 400lb man running through the aisles of Walmart searching for the last box of Twinkies, and much like that man feeling dissatisfied when he can&#x27;t find any Twinkies you will be dissatisfied with this product when you realize it ruined your clothing by leaving a waxy residue on your shirt.</li>
            <li> but I would go for unsented in the future as I find the smell way too strong.</li>
            <li> Twin pack consists of two large deodorants.</li>
            <li> B001F0QX1E Certain</li>
            <li> i even tried putting it on right after i shower thinking it might absorb better hence leading to less shedding which made no difference.  </li>
            <li> I usually have used Original Degree and it would go on kind of rough and not glide smoothly.</li>
            <li> Keeps the guy smelling good even if he&#x27;s a hard working guy.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few deodorants that can last all day, smell great even after a workout, and not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Deodorant works really well.</li>
            <li> My husband thanks me for the purchase..</li>
            <li> Works very well all day.  </li>
            <li> You really do save money that way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even sweat that much.</li>
            <li> I also like the light blue one.</li>
            <li> This deodorant really helped me out by keeping me from perspiring too much.</li>
            <li> Those poor ladies, lol.</li>
            <li> The 48-hour claim is real.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not very often you&#x27;ll ever make it 48 hours without a shower, 36 is certainly plausible if you take a shower before work on Monday, but not before work on Tuesday because you&#x27;re planning on hitting the gym after work.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t perspire a lot, but can tell you that the protection lasts much longer than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> how much can I write about deodrant, it keeps me from being stinky.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Deodorant and antiperspirant, that second one is the important part...</li>
            <li> really like Dove.  </li>
            <li> And I really like the scent.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had much issues with perspiration since I started using this...</li>
            <li> I waited to get through the whole stick before I posted my review</li>
            <li> It has a gentle fragrance, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> that is what really matters.</li>
            <li> I have very hairy underarms</li>
            <li> and it gets me through my whole day and my workout...</li>
            <li> I have never gone through a stick of deodorant so fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I didnt really help to much in my effort to stop sweating.</li>
            <li> That is about all I really ask for.</li>
            <li> Subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I found dove because so far its the only one I have used that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Has a pleasant long lasting fragrance and dries clear.</li>
            <li> Since you buy it in a twin pack the unit price is reasonable and you can even save more with subscribe and save or any other coupon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with the other Dove Men brands, like the moisturizer causing my skin to get scaly, but this one product is top notch.</li>
            <li> Miss the other scents, this one is OK.</li>
            <li> When you shamefully go through life with sweaty armpits like I do, you need something that provides greater stink-covering protection than the other brands.</li>
            <li> I end up using more product than I do with other brands and it ends up transferring to the underarm area of my shirt as I wear it.  </li>
            <li> It also controls perspiration better than other ones I have used.</li>
            <li> It is better than any other anti-perspirant I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this product, no irritation at all, I have had some other deodorants that have caused issues.</li>
            <li> Just clean off with water, no big deal.</li>
            <li> While this won&#x27;t prevent pit stains in 90 degree heat while working outside in the sun, it does keep the pits dry throughout the day while moving between slightly warm conference rooms at work.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin which tends to become easily irritated from the combination of sweat, antiperspirant, and friction from daily arm movement.</li>
            <li> I will be going back to the deodorant, since even going full bore</li>
            <li> The scent is so sweet which definitely eliminates the need to wear cologne or perfume.</li>
            <li> Very masculine scent with decent coverage!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll keep you smelling decent and also help you avoid unsightly underarm</li>
            <li> Decent price.</li>
            <li> is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that</li>
            <li> For the last month I&#x27;ve tried to go completely stick free... and, well, I find myself redordering this product.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m likely putting on more than i normally would get from another brand with the same expectations.  </li>
            <li> It does not last nearly as long as it claims, I do not sweat that much and after 5hrs I could feel my self in need of more deodorant.</li>
            <li> having to need more during the day is not cool.</li>
            <li> I can see why it was highly reviewed.</li>
            <li> I really highly recommend</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a guy who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like a 16-year-old high school kid trying to impress a girl in his math class, then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to buy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like the scent and everything but just like other kind similar, it does leave streaks on your shirts.</li>
            <li> It successfully blocks sweat for a long time, even during fairly intense workouts, without the irritants and hard metals</li>
            <li> I can be outside for an afternoon and still smell fresh and not be &amp;#34;pitting out&amp;#34; as they say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This extra fresh scent is not overpowering and does not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been searching a LONG time for a antiperspirant/deodorant that seems to be a rare combination: one that really works and doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals.</li>
            <li> I normally get degree</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it does not fit this case&lt;</li>
            <li> I normally use degree</li>
            <li> I use something else as my normal antiperspirant, but I will use this periodically.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did cut down on the itchiness and irritation, but i did not get better until using doves clear gel.  </li>
            <li> I love this deordorant but seems like they dont last very long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others and this is the only one that keeps me dry and odor free!</li>
            <li> Kind if expensive,, ran out quick.</li>
            <li> Some anti-perspirants have such a strong odor that it irritates my nose when I sleep shortly after applying.</li>
            <li> I can tell you after a full work day I still feel dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using Right Guard gel deodorant for several years but thought it was time to try something new.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to re-apply unless it&#x27;s a super hot day, whereas with Tom&#x27;s and other natural deodorants</li>
            <li> I am on a pursuit to find a new deodorant</li>
            <li> No idea what that is about, but I&#x27;ve now ordered new shirts, and am here to order new antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I tried to find a new deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m better of staying with the clear gel or dry spray in the future</li>
            <li> It smells great and do not leave behind any white stuff.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and short lasting.</li>
            <li> Lasts most of the day, and is comparable to pretty much every other anti perspirant (less mitchum)</li>
            <li> I have cancer and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The extra strength old spice always ends up giving me a rash, and does not seem to last until 9pm, while Dove lasts until I shower and does so with a more subtle, more refined scent that does not overpower in the morning nor fade in the evening.</li>
            <li> , I ordered this plus many other Bath items and they all arrived a couple days later.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the chalky texture, Other wise a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently deployed to Afghanistan, its hot over here which means i sweat nonstop, this stuff works....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d try some new natural deodorants here and there</li>
            <li> Smells really fresh and keeps you dry all day.</li>
            <li> It does what it does and keeps things fresh and dry.</li>
            <li> It also lasts quite long - not sure if it goes the full 24 hours, but it will last most of the day with one application.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this Dove antiperspirant to use daily in conjunction with the Certain Dri.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going through a stick</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those complaining about this deodorant leaving behind residue on your shirts, be sure you (a) only apply ONE SWIPE per pit and (b) make sure you allow time for the antiperspirant to dry before putting your shirts on.</li>
            <li> I was assuming it was the clear stick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and it has kept my underarms clear of sweat or any odor.  </li>
            <li> would not buy again - chose the clear type</li>
            <li> clear gel is the way to go... expect to get this all over your clothes when dressing...</li>
            <li> is one of the items that a review is silly to do as I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner&lt;</li>
            <li> Gentle enough for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin is usually sensitive but don&#x27;t have a problem with this.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give me a rash or irritation like old spice.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even want to be near me then.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it if you are sensitive like I am.</li>
            <li> far as the quality, it DOES the &amp;#34;job&amp;#34; well.</li>
            <li> I must say I am surprised by Dove&#x27;s deodorant.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 12 yr old son.</li>
            <li> I was amazingly surprised at the logetivity of the antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> this helps people that might have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this was recommended by my doctor.</li>
            <li> The odor is masculine, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> For a while, I wanted to get away from the aluminum and tried all natural deodorants.  </li>
            <li> I used to use the Old Spice deodorants but those made me sweat and soon after I would smell.</li>
            <li> so it stays affective throughout the day but not come off too aggressive early on.&lt;br /&gt;Overall –</li>
            <li> I feel that it&#x27;s almost too soft of a stick</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how doo this antiperspirant deodorant worked.</li>
            <li> I had tried Mitchum, Old Spice, Speed Stick, and nearly every brand trying to find something to curb my pit sweating.</li>
            <li> He used Old Spice before and now prefers this.</li>
            <li> I also use [[ASIN:B004S7QDCA Dove Men Plus Care Extra Fresh Cooling Agent Body and Face Wash Total Skin Comfort 3 Pack Value Pack]] and</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I use, I love it and it is hard to find where I live.</li>
            <li> Like the subtle scents they offer much better.</li>
            <li> The only main issue I found is that it did irritate my skin after a while.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first about ordering the twin pack but needless to say, I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the antiperspirant for its lasting power and gentleness on the skin.</li>
            <li> My husband works outside year round and needs something strong and this does the job.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s immediately prior to a workout I&#x27;ll just use a small amount and there won&#x27;t be much to get off in the shower, though I can easily use it after showering and it&#x27;ll keep me from sweating while I sleep, all throughout the next day, and through my workout.</li>
            <li> i got the item on exact time as expected ..</li>
            <li> This product smells good and is effective, but leaves a terrible rash on my teen son.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful, very little scent</li>
            <li> Opted for old spice with a higher percentage of active ingredient.</li>
            <li> worked great for a while but after wearing for several months stopped working and now my husband stinks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Gillette brand of clear gel for years but the cost got too high and it took forever for it to dry under my arms after application.</li>
            <li> Unlike other deodorants I&#x27;ve used, this one actually lasts and lets me stay fresh throughout the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc</li>
            <li> Typically, if it&#x27;s a white paste, I never have a problem, but sometimes never do with clear either.  </li>
            <li> but it ends up feeling wet in my armpits even without much activity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to old spice.</li>
            <li> I have discovered I actually like all of the scents Dove offers.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to different antiperspirants as they can cause a burning sensation which can often be an allergic reaction to the product.</li>
            <li> Would recommend, even though I prefer gel or soft cream type deodorants to bar types such as this.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it can leave white residue on darker clothing like most deodorants of this type.</li>
            <li> Left marked in the arm pits of my shirts.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate underarm sweating, but only minimizes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I started developing rashes from Old Spice and Axe solid sticks, and decided to give this a try!</li>
            <li> son no longer stinks - works good</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to do better or worse than Axe or others at anti-perspiring.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely tough on clothing, which goes for every antiperspirant I&#x27;ve tried (Degree, Right Guard, Gillette, Old Spice...), and it has an unusual chalky texture that flakes off my underarms.</li>
            <li> This one is gentle enough on my skin for every day use, and keeps me dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that it takes just a few swipes to get just the right amount applied...</li>
            <li> Works well for the whole day, and not an overpowering scent like some of the other brands, also doens&#x27;t seem to bother my skin.</li>
            <li> I subtracted one star from the rating because this is a little more expensive and doesn&#x27;t give me as many days of use as my previous choice.</li>
            <li> Personally to me really like this fragrance, long kept not leave traces and dry.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised how long the smell lasts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming, smells fresh, and lasts for 2 days.</li>
            <li> My husband asked me to stop purchasing it a few months after he first tried it.  </li>
            <li> Really keeps the sweat down, I do not get pitted-out at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fifty one years old and have been using these products for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Large amount of deodorant for little money.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant unobtrusive scent.</li>
            <li> This has a subtle smell that keeps you cool.</li>
            <li> Definitely a bit less moisture, but hasn&#x27;t kept me completely dry even in the first two hours,</li>
            <li> It smells really good and the price isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I have found so far that keeps me dry, I will continue to use Dove Men+Care everyday and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I Mean they smell so fresh that I don&#x27;t even notice there for men.</li>
            <li> The deodorant seemed old or that is was in some extreme heat, and it fell apart after about a week of use.</li>
            <li> but it definitely lasts a long time (enough to get through an entire day at minimum)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stick doesn&#x27;t last quiet as long as the degree everest or the traditional old-spice stick</li>
            <li> Does not last long enough for me.</li>
            <li> Apparently, the white bar of this product gave me extreme irritation.</li>
            <li> which in the long run makes each stick last longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting.</li>
            <li> Long daily commute.</li>
            <li> I does not stick to clothes and last me all day long.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell how much of the dark staining is due to the product or due to my sweat though.</li>
            <li> It still lasts long ( about 4 months ) and well stick based anti-perspirants are also eco-friendly.</li>
            <li> So long are my days of buying bathroom supplies from a supermarket.</li>
            <li> Using this deodorant, you will continue to stink under your arms for a really long time.</li>
            <li> Sometime I have a long day and night and day witch</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go that long between showers anyway.</li>
            <li> It lasts that long.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> As a result of this deodorant&#x27;s effectiveness combined with the lack of rashes I will be using this brand for a long time.</li>
            <li> no 48 hour protection for me, but it lasts long enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not developed any rashes or irritations from months of using this product</li>
            <li> plus the product controls odor and perpiration all day long.</li>
            <li> All of Dove&#x27;s Men+Care deodorants have a strange smell to me.  </li>
            <li> My previous antiperspirant worked well enough but left a residue I could feel on my skin after a shower; this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> works all day long, stay dry and smell</li>
            <li> also, the deo forms a white layer while applying unlike the other brands where you dont feel applying a deo..</li>
            <li> I will go going back to my other deo/APs.</li>
            <li> We love this product,  unfortunately it was completly melted when we received it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stays dry for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Washes off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> other thing I really like about this antiperspirant is that the scent is subtle enough not to overpower the smell of aftershave, cologne, body spray, etc.,  </li>
            <li> Not to overpowering and lasts a very long time after you use it.</li>
            <li> Not as dry as Axes.</li>
            <li> Stayed dry all day in 92 degree weather.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and threw these away and ordered the clinical strength stuff from Secret (i&#x27;m a man btw and Secret is simply amazing if you get a non-feminine scent)</li>
            <li> This stuff can keep me dry for two days.</li>
            <li> It does keep you dry all day or longer.</li>
            <li> Prefer the dry spray over this.</li>
            <li> After applying this stuff, the effects only last a few hours until your armpits eventually return to stinkage.  </li>
            <li> Leaves heavy remnants of the product on shirts and these are tough to wash out, let along clean the shirt.</li>
            <li> Other antiperspirants and deodorants, including Axe, Old Spice, Speed Stik, and Degree (to name a few) give my husband an itchy armpit rash.</li>
            <li> A couple things matter to me on a product like this:  does it last, is the fragrance toned down, and does it rub off on clothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All the previous deodorant that I had before was 24 hours one which last only half a day.</li>
            <li> but I still manage to get white streaks on black t-shirts while putting the shirt on...</li>
            <li> Chalky white texture that slightly crumbles when applied on underarm hair</li>
            <li> One caution, it seems to leave a white residue on some dark shirts so be careful.</li>
            <li> This is a product that has gotten so expensive, like the fact of the double product and a smart price point.</li>
            <li> Always delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> Product seems really wet under the arm after applied.</li>
            <li> Which makes me feel like I&#x27;m sweating when it&#x27;d just a wet deodorant.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say about it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like the feeling my wet pits.  </li>
            <li> It has a clean scent, definitely recommend you try, it is less expensive than degree!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for two months now and haven&#x27;t seen any signs of yellowing even from my newest, brightest plain white tees.</li>
            <li> I noticed it on the black upholstery of my car, and it took me quite a while to figure out where it came from, but this antiperspirant cakes up and flakes off every single day.</li>
            <li> I use other Dove Men + Care products and buy this to compliment the rest of the stuff.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, it&#x27;s not overpowering compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> It works just like all the other reviews say.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with the product and definitely will not recommend this to anyone i know...</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t want to leave your house either due to the shamefulness.  </li>
            <li> This is why I usually stay away from these white sticks</li>
            <li> The other was stripped or something</li>
            <li> But I decided to try this, because every other antiperspirant I&#x27;ve tried irritates my underarms.  </li>
            <li> Other antiperspirants show some &amp;#34;resistance&amp;#34; to being scrubbed off with a shower pouf and body-wash.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear jewelry, cologne, and latex bandages without getting rashes but this product does not affect me and no more red pimples and blisters.</li>
            <li> I suffer from occasional hyperhydrosis (excessive underarm sweating), so I use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> ,the fragrance is very minimal..</li>
            <li> No white residue left behind.</li>
            <li> Last at least 24 hours even being active.</li>
            <li> Dead Space 3 limited editon plus 8 bars of face/body soap and 2 sticks of antiperspirant for $30!</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t expensive and you can never have too much deodorant.</li>
            <li> Just learned that the aluminum compounds in anti-perspirants is what is responsible for those impossible &amp;#34;pit stains&amp;#34; in white shirts.</li>
            <li> Works well in every other way, but for some strange reason it leaves hard, plastic-y film seemingly soaked into the pits of my undershirts, visible inside and out.</li>
            <li> Also, this stuff is almost impossible to wash off of underarms after a full day at work, stays caked on and slippery</li>
            <li> It made me stink less.</li>
            <li> (and then I do not care about a slight temporary sweat odor), so perhaps this stuff is just overkill for someone like me.</li>
            <li> I just got this product previous ago.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, I can&#x27;t use and am going to have to go back to my \\&quot;white paste\\&quot; deodorants.  </li>
            <li> Once a day use and the bar was gone in less than a month.</li>
            <li> It completely stopped my random sweating and I no longer get those embarrassing wet spots on my pits.</li>
            <li> Lasts at least twice as long as others both when applied and when using each applicator.</li>
            <li> real complaint that I have is that it goes on soft and chalky.  </li>
            <li> (I realize this is just the mechanism of action, but nevertheless I have used other antiperspirants that are not so difficult to wash off).  </li>
            <li> within half an hour of applying this product, it has already dried and falling to the ground in little pieces.  </li>
            <li> a leave little time to get a shower.</li>
            <li> I wish it was actually a little \\&quot;wetter\\&quot; when it went on and that the cake was a little firmer and bound together stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Twin pack is nice because running out of deodorant is the worst.</li>
            <li> may try another one of the Dove 48 hour deodorants, but this one is looking dead in the water to me.</li>
            <li> She says it is a faint masculine scent.</li>
            <li> I have searched the world over for deodorant that doesn&#x27;t have ill effects for me with my sensitive under arm skin area.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now and never had a rash or break out from using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months.</li>
            <li> I sweat through it in a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I live in Georgia where it gets hot and humid and this stuff does the trick when it comes to not looking and smelling disgusting.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and what I prefer Dove is the fact that there&#x27;s not a strong odor from the deodorant.</li>
            <li> but it does tame smells for 48 hours and</li>
            <li> Most typical deodorants give me a nasty rash so up until now</li>
            <li> summer times are pretty bad.</li>
            <li> This has been my go to deodorant for the past few years.  </li>
            <li> To start with the con side: It does tend to flake a little bit, at least when you just start using it.</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming, like Axe.</li>
            <li> and I can sweat a lot usually.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy whichever one is on sale.</li>
            <li> But then I found this, and he is itchy no more.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t like the fact that it leaves stains on my shirt when it dries and it&#x27;s hard to eliminate them.</li>
            <li> I switched from Old Spice because their atrocious advertising made me hate the company so much that the move had to be made.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, a week or two into using the first stick I began to develop a painful rash under both arms.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced sensitivity to deodorant in the past and thought maybe it was a fluke, so I tried another stick after some time for the rash to go away.</li>
            <li> is subtle and not overpowering&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> only way I would give a bad review</li>
            <li> My daughters &amp; I have had the same, bad results with the ladies&#x27; Dove deodorants.  </li>
            <li> Aluminum and any ingredient with &amp;#34;tetra&amp;#34; in it is never a good combination.  </li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> And you need to use a LOT of this too because it&#x27;s so weak.  </li>
            <li> I have to re-apply at least twice a day!</li>
            <li> It works well and isn&#x27;t irritating to your skin.  </li>
            <li> not really happy.</li>
            <li> I hate white spots on my clothes from deodorant.  </li>
            <li> After a few months I start itching like crazy.  </li>
            <li> There are some serious antiperspirants in there!  </li>
            <li> this gave me a bad itchy rash slightly under arms and across chest.  </li>
            <li> Had an unpleasant scent compared to past antiperspirants I have used.</li>
            <li> The poor guy was so uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have got rashes from alcohol based sticks and sprays in the past, but not that bad.  </li>
            <li> this is a weird product to review.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it would seem Dove Men Care isn&#x27;t the solution to this dilemma.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> and it has been difficult to find antiperspirant/deodrant that does not irritate the skin and gum up the hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I believe I ordered the wrong scent.</li>
            <li> I do not sweat through my shirt while casually walking around at work.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a bad product</li>
            <li> The one downside is it does tend to stain your shirts in an awkward way...</li>
            <li> It is impossible for my pits to sweat when using this product.  </li>
            <li> but its a deodorant, so unless u like smelling bad then u should buy one.</li>
            <li> The scent is not all that bad</li>
            <li> My husband and son HATE this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t create that annoying &amp;#34;wet armpit&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this problem before, but I hate getting ripped off by a bad product!  </li>
            <li> Smells awful.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible experience with this deodorant.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m gonna give in and continue using the aluminum until something comes out telling me it&#x27;s just awful for you.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells good, I did go through it faster than gel type. Likely going back to Gillette gel.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Doesn&#x27;t make my armpits bleed. Can&#x27;t really ask for anything more but world peace.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to most smells and this one is a bit strong for me.  The antiperspirant part of it doesn&#x27;t work for my body.  I&#x27;ll have to try again elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is just the amount that I want, and it came in a two-pack. It&#x27;s also a good smell, but it&#x27;s not over-powering.</li>
            <li> i love having a subscription show up each month :) makes it easy and worry free it has been about a year and a half and i&#x27;m still subscribed! (06/2016)</li>
            <li> Looked over the Amazon reviews, picked this. Really keeps the sweat down, I do not get pitted-out at all. I can see why it was highly reviewed.</li>
            <li> Deodorant works really well. I&#x27;ve had problems with the other Dove Men brands, like the moisturizer causing my skin to get scaly, but this one product is top notch.</li>
            <li> Great product great brand good quality great smell and very effective I no sweating a drop I really highly recommend</li>
            <li> Bought it quite a while ago and I use it daily. It still lasts long ( about 4 months ) and well stick based anti-perspirants are also eco-friendly. So chuck the spray and buy the stick.</li>
            <li> this is a weird product to review. there isn&#x27;t really anything more to say than it smells good and it does the trick when preventing unwanted perspiration. that&#x27;s about it. yup.</li>
            <li> I sometimes sweat after using these even though they are &#x27;48-hour&#x27;</li>
            <li> its meh, not manly or femine its ok I guess just using it to not be smelly, Eewww!!!</li>
            <li> Best deodorant that I have used. Lasts at least twice as long as others both when applied and when using each applicator. Leaves  almost no residue.</li>
            <li> My husband thanks me for the purchase.. It&#x27;s an excellent and nice protection</li>
            <li> Does the job! I like this deodorant and the two pack price is reasonable!</li>
            <li> My pits have never been dryer.</li>
            <li> My husband and father-in-law love this product line!</li>
            <li> Miss the other scents, this one is OK.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this deodorant.  He swears this is the one that works best for him.  Nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> It made me stink less.</li>
            <li> it smells really good and last the whole day for me</li>
            <li> Works very well all day.  Smells good and does not irritate the skin.  Good quality.  Will continue to buy this antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Pretty good but be prepared for white deodorant stains on clothing this stuff always makes them.</li>
            <li> I love this deordorant but seems like they dont last very long. Not a fault of the product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it definitely lasts for 24+ hours!</li>
            <li> Best antiperspirant and deodorant I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like most about this product is how it compliments the soap of the same smell. I use both and feel manlier every time I use them. The combo pack on Amazon is a steal if you ask me. So long are my days of buying bathroom supplies from a supermarket. I live in Georgia where it gets hot and humid and this stuff does the trick when it comes to not looking and smelling disgusting. I can be outside for an afternoon and still smell fresh and not be &amp;#34;pitting out&amp;#34; as they say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase this from Amazon in the future. If you&#x27;re a guy who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like a 16-year-old high school kid trying to impress a girl in his math class, then this is the product for you. Plus I don&#x27;t get itchy or irritated in my arm pits.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Husband and son both use this. Perfect for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deodorant. I use other Dove Men + Care products and buy this to compliment the rest of the stuff. It works fine. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and smells good, can&#x27;t ask for anything else.  My skin is usually sensitive but don&#x27;t have a problem with this.  Quality Dove product.</li>
            <li> smells ok but it ends up feeling wet in my armpits even without much activity. I&#x27;m going back to old spice.</li>
            <li> Great deodorant.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  I will continue to buy this product until it ceases to exist.</li>
            <li> This smell is wonderful!  I am on a pursuit to find a new deodorant and I am wondering if I found it!</li>
            <li> I switched from Old Spice because their atrocious advertising made me hate the company so much that the move had to be made. This is a great substitute. This is now what I use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good antiperspirant/deodorant. It keeps me from sweating most of the day. It smells good without being overpowering and giving me headaches.</li>
            <li> I got it with the promo.  I personally prefer the gel kind of deodorants, but this one does its job.  I like the scent and everything but just like other kind similar, it does leave streaks on your shirts.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li> Love these for my husband and for myself. I Mean they smell so fresh that I don&#x27;t even notice there for men. We get these shipped our every 3months. You really do save money that way. Even if you&#x27;re still driving to go get them you save money buying them here.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell which stays long. Good for people who are allergic.Nicely packed and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Great price and favorite Dove Men+Care scent. Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Have this on subscribe and save with Amazon.  Always delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> good deodarant , is not to over powering in good smell and comes off quick after shower.Does not stain my shirt.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give me a rash or irritation like old spice.</li>
            <li> more of it came than i thought (the tubes were bigger than expected)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is lighter version of their soap. It doesn&#x27;t smell overtly Dove-y, yet does the anti-perspiration job well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deodorant. Smells good and does the job!!</li>
            <li> Good product at a great price. Has a pleasant long lasting fragrance and dries clear.</li>
            <li> Switched over to Dove Men + Care after years of wearing Axe. Like the subtle scents they offer much better. This extra fresh scent is not overpowering and does not irritate the skin. I would recommend this version over the gel one, it does however leave a chalky white line on t-shirts sometimes. Just clean off with water, no big deal.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant for my husband.  He puts them to the test, too.  He&#x27;s very active and works out frequently, and this one does the best job.  Not to mention it is one of the best smelling ones (in my opinion!)</li>
            <li> I was assuming it was the clear stick.</li>
            <li> Of the products in the &amp;#34;Extra Fresh&amp;#34; line by Dove, this is the only one which smells as good as the bar soap that motivated me to try the others. I&#x27;ve tried many other lines of deodorants and this is definitely my current favorite.</li>
            <li> No absurd ads, just simple, clean, smell good deodorant</li>
            <li> great product, great price and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Definitely a bit less moisture, but hasn&#x27;t kept me completely dry even in the first two hours, and I applied pretty generously. I don&#x27;t even sweat that much. However, smells pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will try again and edit later.</li>
            <li> This product smells good and is effective, but leaves a terrible rash on my teen son.  Had to switch to a gentler deodorant.</li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps my underarms dry</li>
            <li> Excellent price smells great and Works as well as the high priced stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells awful. Does not work well. Returned for a refund.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK when i purchased i thought it was the gel type that smells stronger and last longer but it&#x27;s ok still a value pack</li>
            <li> We buy Dove deoderant because it works and the smell is wonderful.  It has an earthy, manly smell.  I have discovered I actually like all of the scents Dove offers.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, it&#x27;s not overpowering compared to other brands. But I don&#x27;t like the fact that it leaves stains on my shirt when it dries and it&#x27;s hard to eliminate them.</li>
            <li> I like the scent of this and it works great. Will eventually buy more.</li>
            <li> No irritation like some others Ive tried price goes up kind of quick though.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few deodorants that can last all day, smell great even after a workout, and not irritate my skin. The extra strength old spice always ends up giving me a rash, and does not seem to last until 9pm, while Dove lasts until I shower and does so with a more subtle, more refined scent that does not overpower in the morning nor fade in the evening. While this won&#x27;t prevent pit stains in 90 degree heat while working outside in the sun, it does keep the pits dry throughout the day while moving between slightly warm conference rooms at work.</li>
            <li> Great product at the best price!</li>
            <li> Great deodorant. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> One of the most effective antiperspirants I&#x27;ve used.  Controls my underarm sweat incredibly well.  Has a nice scent without being overly strong.  Also great price!!</li>
            <li> I smell better than when I don&#x27;t use this</li>
            <li> Smells good, a little clumpy or powdery. Cheap.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to different antiperspirants as they can cause a burning sensation which can often be an allergic reaction to the product. This particular one offers a great scent, and hasn&#x27;t caused me any issues. My wife likes it, so I do as well :)</li>
            <li> Very good antiperspirant and smells great. Great scent, still leaves stains on shirts as most others do.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant my teenage son will use.</li>
            <li> It works just like all the other reviews say. No burn, No sweat, Smell nice and for a very longer time.</li>
            <li> What more can you say about a deodorant? It smells good, easy to operate, stops the sweat. Twin pack is nice because running out of deodorant is the worst.</li>
            <li> Great deodorant that does not smell like i bathed in cheap cologne. I took a star off because they reduced the size of the packaging.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it&#x27;s holding for 10 hours love it</li>
            <li> I put this on and instantly felt the +CARE  OMG why aren&#x27;t we funding this...oh yeah, because it&#x27;s just a deodorant stick...calm yourselves.</li>
            <li> My husband works outside year round and needs something strong and this does the job. He also has sensitive skin and this has proven effective on both fronts.</li>
            <li> I like all of the Dove scents, this one is clean smelling and smells great.  I also like the light blue one.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Unlike other deodorants I&#x27;ve used, this one actually lasts and lets me stay fresh throughout the day. I tend to sweat a lot and it&#x27;s embarrassing to know that I&#x27;ve got pit stains accumulating. This deodorant really helped me out by keeping me from perspiring too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I had it for 3 years and I just bought a double pack</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the protection.</li>
            <li> Great refreshing scent that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache or cause me to get dizzy. No irritations whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and the price isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this antiperspirant and deo. it just brought out the best from my husband. and now he&#x27;s handsome and appealing as ever. not surpised as to how he got admirers at the office</li>
            <li> This product works miracles.</li>
            <li> Wish they had a non-aluminum product. However this worked pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have used Dove&#x27;s deodorant (body spray) earlier and i was hoping to have the same quality, but the deo stick isnt that great,the fragrance is very minimal.. also, the deo forms a white layer while applying unlike the other brands where you dont feel applying a deo.. this almost looks like you are applying the dove soap in your arm pits without washing it..the only good thing though is that it comes off very easily when you take a shower.. I am not satisfied with the product and definitely will not recommend this to anyone i know...</li>
            <li> Fresh scented deodorant with antiperspirant works very well. I work 10-12 hour days on a dock and this deodorant gets the job done!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming, smells fresh, and lasts for 2 days.</li>
            <li> I was buying Kiekl&#x27;s $20 deodorant because my underarms were on fire using regular perspirant.  It worked ok, not the best deodorant but at least I wasn&#x27;t suffering. I saw this on TV and knew I had to try it.  It works great and I no longer get a rash in my pits.</li>
            <li> Dove for men is awesome, works like womens stuff, only it&#x27;s not...incredible! You can use it without loosing your macho swaggger baby. Plus the ladies love it too...Bonus!</li>
            <li> When you shamefully go through life with sweaty armpits like I do, you need something that provides greater stink-covering protection than the other brands. Unfortunately it would seem Dove Men Care isn&#x27;t the solution to this dilemma.  This deodorant doesn&#x27;t cut the mustard.  Using this deodorant, you will continue to stink under your arms for a really long time. You won&#x27;t want to leave your house either due to the shamefulness.  After applying this stuff, the effects only last a few hours until your armpits eventually return to stinkage.  And you need to use a LOT of this too because it&#x27;s so weak.  So I have no choice but to say Dove Men + Care Antiperspirant is overrated because it&#x27;s ineffective.  Come on I&#x27;m a guy here!  Give me deodorant that will keep my armpits stink-free over the course of a day!  And let&#x27;s not even mention when my armpits get *really* stinky a few times a year.  You don&#x27;t even want to be near me then.  Oh man that time I went to the dentists office, sat in the chair... and realized I forgot to put deodorant on.  Those poor ladies, lol.</li>
            <li> Smells super strong. Yeck. Gave it away.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  In fact I think they might put some sort of addictive substance into the deodorant because this is literally the only deodorant that I use.  I also find myself having physical withdrawals when I go without my dove men&#x27;s care</li>
            <li> My wife, daughter and I love the fresh scent of this product.  This antiperspirant will keep you smelling good all day long.  I also use [[ASIN:B004S7QDCA Dove Men Plus Care Extra Fresh Cooling Agent Body and Face Wash Total Skin Comfort 3 Pack Value Pack]] and [[ASIN:B00AAJTDLI Dove Men+Care Fresh Clean Fortifying 2 in 1 (12oz)]].  The combination of all three keeps me clean and smelling great all day long.  I highly recommend the antiperspirant for its lasting power and gentleness on the skin.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used for 3 main reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s Dove, so it&#x27;s easy on the skin.  No underarm itch or rashes.&lt;br /&gt;2. The 48-hour claim is real.  While it&#x27;s not very often you&#x27;ll ever make it 48 hours without a shower, 36 is certainly plausible if you take a shower before work on Monday, but not before work on Tuesday because you&#x27;re planning on hitting the gym after work.  This deodorant has you covered on Tuesday afternoon at the gym.&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s antiperspirant, not just deodorant.  It&#x27;ll keep you smelling decent and also help you avoid unsightly underarm circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved it so much when I tried it that I ordered a half dozen more sticks so I&#x27;ll never run out.</li>
            <li> works well, inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This highly effective deodorant, I have done very well with it, since I use it, I recommend it with confidence</li>
            <li> No frills, nothing special. It is antiperspirant, and it works. It doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent like some of the others, which is a huge plus in my book. Will buy it again</li>
            <li> Keeps the guy smelling good even if he&#x27;s a hard working guy. Doesn&#x27;t clog the pores. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is ok for what it does.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and it has kept my underarms clear of sweat or any odor.  The only main issue I found is that it did irritate my skin after a while.  Once I looked over the ingredients listed, I stopped using it.  I thought this product might be different since it was made by Dove but it seems all Antiperspirants are the same across the board.  Aluminum and any ingredient with &amp;#34;tetra&amp;#34; in it is never a good combination.  Stick with regular deodorant that is unscented.</li>
            <li> Keeps odor away while not having much of a smell itself, dries quick. Doesn&#x27;t rub off on shirts or leave marks.</li>
            <li> It is a good price for a two pack.  It has a mild, pleasant smell and keep you dry all day.</li>
            <li> The only good deoderant I can find that doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out in a rash, nor bleach the underarms of my shirts.</li>
            <li> Really good deodorant, comes in two to a pack.  People regularly sit close to me while wearing it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it and it looks like it is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> before finding this product I was walking around wondering why no one would hang out with me. Now i find myself with all kinds of friends and people who want to be my friends All because i smell so fresh and so clean. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my brother and it smells wonderful</li>
            <li> Subscribe and save, love it!</li>
            <li> The Dove Men Care stuff is great, this smells good and lasts a long time. I highly recommend it, my wife says the line of stuff all smells good.</li>
            <li> i got the item on exact time as expected ..&lt;br /&gt;item is in great condition and is work like a charm .. super stylish and amazing performance ..</li>
            <li> This antiperspirant has been a pleasant surprise for me. I&#x27;ve used a Gillette brand of clear gel for years but the cost got too high and it took forever for it to dry under my arms after application. On a whim, I thought I&#x27;d give this Dove brand a try and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I don&#x27;t perspire a lot, but can tell you that the protection lasts much longer than 24 hours. Obviously, this will vary from person to person. I&#x27;ve also noticed that it takes just a few swipes to get just the right amount applied...which in the long run makes each stick last longer. Also, with the exception of the white plastic at the bottom of the stick (which is easily removed), the rest of the packaging can be recycled. I&#x27;m very pleased with the performance of this product and plan on buying another twin pack very soon.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I use, I love it and it is hard to find where I live. Two thumbs up for the quick delivery, I ordered this plus many other Bath items and they all arrived a couple days later.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he likes the smell of this. It doesn&#x27;t leave yellow stains on his white shirts either.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant my boyfriend will use. It goes on smooth, smells great, and a little goes a long way! He works in a high stress imdustry, and a very hot one at that, and this is the perfect amount of protection against B.O. for him. Great deal for this product too.</li>
            <li> son no longer stinks - works good</li>
            <li> I had a terrible experience with this deodorant. I would start to stink of BO after only a couple of hours. It also stained my shirts white. After switching to a different deodorant all of the issues were gone.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my son and husband that had started having allergic reactions to deodorants such as Axe. This deodorant lasts and they have not had any issues with it at all. The smell is pleasant and it works well for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells nice, it comes as a powder stick instead of gel, which is a lot better for clothes when your underarms sweat. Glides on smoothly and wipes off easily, doesn&#x27;t leave your underarms feeling gritty or oily. Lasts all day from the time I out it on in the morning, to the time I take a shower at night. This lasts all day including on days I do a lot of physical activity, truly an all day protection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of bar antiperspirant but I love this one. Smells really fresh and keeps you dry all day.</li>
            <li> Though not as potent as 21% &amp;#34;clinically&amp;#34; labeled OTC deodorant products, I find this brand and line to be a good compromise.  It works well and isn&#x27;t irritating to your skin.  Would recommend, even though I prefer gel or soft cream type deodorants to bar types such as this.</li>
            <li> No irritation, which is why I switched to this from mitchum.  Mitchum lasts longer and is better for the summer, but I will go back to dove for winters.  Lasts most of the day, and is comparable to pretty much every other anti perspirant (less mitchum) ive tried.  They sell it pretty much everywhere too so if your out and about or cant wait for amazon, youll prolly pay more, but still be able to get it.</li>
            <li> Good Product just as described!</li>
            <li> Smells like mancave heaven</li>
            <li> I bought this originally for the 48 hour claim, and boy does it deliver. Unfortunately, a week or two into using the first stick I began to develop a painful rash under both arms. I have never experienced sensitivity to deodorant in the past and thought maybe it was a fluke, so I tried another stick after some time for the rash to go away. Same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may try another one of the Dove 48 hour deodorants, but this one is looking dead in the water to me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold up to the desert. Opted for old spice with a higher percentage of active ingredient. This product got slimy.</li>
            <li> excellent better product than I expected</li>
            <li> The lady of my life likes the scent of this specific deodorant. She says it is a faint masculine scent.</li>
            <li> love the 48 hr protection and not it won&#x27;t irratate my skin.....</li>
            <li> I love this scent. Definitely my favorite deodorant</li>
            <li> smells nice, both men and women use it in our home</li>
            <li> Very powerful, very little scent</li>
            <li> This is the deodorant I always use. I prefer this one based on its smell and it does not leave marks on clothing and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Who knew that deoderant could go so well with bread. My friends tried to play an April fools prank on me this year, but instead I ended up finding my new favorite snack. Whose laughing now John?</li>
            <li> Product seems really wet under the arm after applied. Which makes me feel like I&#x27;m sweating when it&#x27;d just a wet deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have been a Sure user for many years as I found it to be most consistent. I tried one of the higher end ($9) Dove products and this packaging looked similar so I gave it a shot. It works just as well as Sure but I would go for unsented in the future as I find the smell way too strong. I thought it was a great bargain for 2 bottles and would otherwise buy again.</li>
            <li> Works well for the whole day, and not an overpowering scent like some of the other brands, also doens&#x27;t seem to bother my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Not as dry as Axes.</li>
            <li> I feel good when I use this AP.  I don&#x27;t know why, but I do.  Better yet, it keeps me from stinking, so it must work.</li>
            <li> Kind if expensive,, ran out quick. but its a deodorant, so unless u like smelling bad then u should buy one.</li>
            <li> Great product. Stayed dry all day in 92 degree weather.</li>
            <li> not really happy. Leaves heavy remnants of the product on shirts and these are tough to wash out, let along clean the shirt. would not buy again - chose the clear type</li>
            <li> I bought this after using the deodorant version of this same scent as well as the silver variety.  Surprisingly, with this stuff I seem to notice a body odor later in the day, whereas with just deodorant I do not.  Also, this stuff is almost impossible to wash off of underarms after a full day at work, stays caked on and slippery (I realize this is just the mechanism of action, but nevertheless I have used other antiperspirants that are not so difficult to wash off).  I will be going back to the deodorant, since even going full bore I do not sweat a ton unless I&#x27;m actually exercising at the gym (and then I do not care about a slight temporary sweat odor), so perhaps this stuff is just overkill for someone like me.</li>
            <li> Most antiperspirants make me itch but this one doesn&#x27;t. It smells great and keeps me dry. I would recommend it if you are sensitive like I am.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this deodorant. I was hesitant at first about ordering the twin pack but needless to say, I love this deodorant. I smell great, the chicks dig it, and I stay dry for the most part!</li>
            <li> This is a good product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I buy it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Not too overwhelming with the scent and it does the job in the Arizona heat.</li>
            <li> Lives up to its description as an antiperspirant &amp; deodorant and has a very fresh smell to it. I have been searching a LONG time for a antiperspirant/deodorant that seems to be a rare combination: one that really works and doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals. I buy them by the twin-pack and plan to continue to do so. It&#x27;s a good product that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i like it, it smells great even my wife loves it a lot and lasting is good</li>
            <li> This review is for the Dove Men+Care Fresh Scent.  This has been my go to deodorant for the past few years.  It has a great scent and does not leave any residue, I work long hours in an old un airconditioned office building and it gets pretty warm in the summer months.  This is the only deodorant I have found so far that keeps me dry, I will continue to use Dove Men+Care everyday and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this after reading all the positive reviews. This is by for the most ineffective antiperspirant I&#x27;ve used. In fact it&#x27;s up there with pure deodorants which just smell good and offer no wetness protection. I went ahead and threw these away and ordered the clinical strength stuff from Secret (i&#x27;m a man btw and Secret is simply amazing if you get a non-feminine scent)</li>
            <li> Bought on Prime Day! Great Deal!!!! This deodorant works perfectly for day to day use.</li>
            <li> This stuff can keep me dry for two days. Sometime I have a long day and night and day witch a leave little time to get a shower. However I know I still smell clean thancks to this 48 hour protection. This is a great product with clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Only one my hubby will use...</li>
            <li> Smell good, look good, feel good :)</li>
            <li> Just learned that the aluminum compounds in anti-perspirants is what is responsible for those impossible &amp;#34;pit stains&amp;#34; in white shirts. I always thought they were from sweat, but they are actually the residue from the AP. It&#x27;s hard to fault Dove for that, so if you love the smell like I do, and don&#x27;t mind those stains - it&#x27;s great. Otherwise, get the deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant my husband wants to buy any more.  Lasts longer and smells better than everything else he&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li> I sweat at work and i got this deodorant cause it was on sale and it turned my white shirts yellow under the arms. I normally get degree and i am definitely going back to that because it has never turned my shirts yellow.</li>
            <li> so fresh and so clean clean!</li>
            <li> The deodorant seemed old or that is was in some extreme heat, and it fell apart after about a week of use. Both sticks did the same thing. This is why I usually stay away from these white sticks and I&#x27;ve learned my lesson. I&#x27;m better of staying with the clear gel or dry spray in the future</li>
            <li> how much can I write about deodrant, it keeps me from being stinky.</li>
            <li> Smells good, goes on smooth, and the whole bottom rotates to push the deodorant unlike brands that use a small wheel that doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Very strong baby powder smell makes me a bit weary.</li>
            <li> This smells good but stopped working. Could just be I am super stinky, but do not think so.</li>
            <li> All day protection with a great price. This has a subtle smell that keeps you cool. Buying in bulk does pay.</li>
            <li> Great, strong deodorant that lasts all day and more. Has a nice smell to it and goes on smoothly without any trouble.</li>
            <li> Would order again...  Thanks for the great service and great product.  Fast shipping and packaged well. Ellen drives herself to work...</li>
            <li> Decent price. Got here quickly. I like the smell. I prefer deodorants that are not too smelly and this one has a pretty mild scent.</li>
            <li> Keeps me smelling good and somewhat dry</li>
            <li> Its dove deodorant  Smells great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with underarm wetness for years; this is the first antiperspirant that has actually worked for me, and it smells better than anything I&#x27;ve worn before. I&#x27;d definitely recommend using subscribe&amp;save to keep yourself supplied!</li>
            <li> Good product but deo is better its bit sticky and gives itchy feel after 8 hrs and u have to bath 3 times</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I don&#x27;t know about it actually lasting as long as it says it does but it definitely lasts a long time (enough to get through an entire day at minimum)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice too but not overpowering, and the &#x27;lubrication&#x27; it gives your armpits is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the best thing about this stuff is you put it on then forget you even did it because you don&#x27;t notice it all day.</li>
            <li> My fault, I should have known better... clear gel is the way to go... expect to get this all over your clothes when dressing...</li>
            <li> Strong deodorant and it works well. Make sure it dries thoroughly before you put on your shirt though, otherwise it will leave some white residue.This deodorant smells fresh and keeps me feeling clean all day, even in the sun.</li>
            <li> For the size, it IS overpriced. For pennies more, you can purchase the larger size in any grocery store or Drug store.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the quality, it DOES the &amp;#34;job&amp;#34; well.</li>
            <li> Works great and has a good scent.</li>
            <li> In this Twin pack, only 1 of the sticks actually worked.  The other was stripped or something so the turning mechanism was faulty---absolutely no way to get the deodorant to raise up to be used.  I went to use the return option on here and it expired a week ago---wish I had tried the faulty one first.  I&#x27;ve never had this problem before, but I hate getting ripped off by a bad product!  Just letting you know---they may not work properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review edit: Nov. 23, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;I called the number on the back of the deodorant and was very impressed with the customer service!  They asked for some numbers on the bottom of the product, apologized for my defective one, and sent me a coupon for a FREE stick of their deodorant which I picked up at the store today.  I am amending my review to 4 stars---this is a good product and I was happy with the customer service I received!</li>
            <li> My current favorite. Subtle and pleasant. Not overwhelming, like Axe.</li>
            <li> All of the deodorants I&#x27;ve used before this certainly seemed to help prevent some perspiration, but by the end of the day my shirts would still be pretty damp under the arms. Not so with Dove Men + Care Extra Strength! I can be a lot more confident that I won&#x27;t need to change my shirt halfway through the day with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those complaining about this deodorant leaving behind residue on your shirts, be sure you (a) only apply ONE SWIPE per pit and (b) make sure you allow time for the antiperspirant to dry before putting your shirts on. Ive been using this for two months now and haven&#x27;t seen any signs of yellowing even from my newest, brightest plain white tees.</li>
            <li> Large amount of deodorant for little money.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant unobtrusive scent. Easy to apply and no lumps. Highly recommended to buy.</li>
            <li> Smells Fantastic, fast application.</li>
            <li> Very masculine scent with decent coverage! I bought this on prime day, and thought I would use it. However, the scent is fairly powerful/potent, so I gave it to my brother.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and quick shipment. Thanks!</li>
            <li> this stuffs great,best deodorant ive ever used</li>
            <li> I must say I am surprised by Dove&#x27;s deodorant. I&#x27;ve been a user of degree for YEARS and what I prefer Dove is the fact that there&#x27;s not a strong odor from the deodorant. It has a clean scent, definitely recommend you try, it is less expensive than degree!</li>
            <li> I just got this product previous ago. I was kind of amazed of the strong smell of it which can last pretty long (more than a day for sure). All the previous deodorant that I had before was 24 hours one which last only half a day. This one advertised as 48 hours and I can say it will last defiantly more than a day. Since you buy it in a twin pack the unit price is reasonable and you can even save more with subscribe and save or any other coupon.</li>
            <li> I was perspiring within 1 hour after I used it. Supposed to be good for 48 hours. I don&#x27;t go that long between showers anyway. Feels greasy going on. Back to Ban unscented for me.</li>
            <li> Began using this the moment that they introduced  it... Never looked back... Between this deodorant and the Dove Body-Washes... I&#x27;m here to stay! PLUS, I&#x27;m very easy to be around... Scent-wise!</li>
            <li> No overpowering smell.&lt;br /&gt;No irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Stays dry for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Washes off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> Deodorant and antiperspirant, that second one is the important part... But seriously, it works well, smells good and was pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> The scent is not all that bad and it&#x27;s DOVE of course. Honestly I can&#x27;t afford stuff in a regular store. Amazon is the best in cosmetics and supplies of this nature.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 12 yr old son. He loves ot and it helps all day :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve resisted using Dove products for men, because the advertising annoys me.  But I decided to try this, because every other antiperspirant I&#x27;ve tried irritates my underarms.  FINALLY, I found one that doesn&#x27;t, and I love this product.  I&#x27;m DB, and I&#x27;m comfortable in my own skin.</li>
            <li> I was amazingly surprised at the logetivity of the antiperspirant. I am a sweaty guy and this thing kept me comfortable and fresh.</li>
            <li> You can never be sure, but I&#x27;m about 80% sure this gave me a bad itchy rash slightly under arms and across chest.  I have got rashes from alcohol based sticks and sprays in the past, but not that bad.  Typically, if it&#x27;s a white paste, I never have a problem, but sometimes never do with clear either.  I tried this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like Dove.  I like the packaging.  I like the value.  And I really like the scent.  I think it&#x27;s one of the best smelling products out there. I SOOO wanted this product to work, and be the last stick I ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But unfortunately, I can&#x27;t use and am going to have to go back to my \\&quot;white paste\\&quot; deodorants.  Hope this helps people that might have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Hello, I just wanted to say I been using this product for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Dove men care deodorant smells great, Keeps the sweat and the smell away. Plain and simple.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the chalky texture, Other wise a full 5 stars. Reminds me of Degree.</li>
            <li> Keeps my man smelling fresh all day.  No white residue left behind.</li>
            <li> Antiperspirant is antiperspirant, right? I absolutely love this antiperspirant, it really does last 48 hours for those times you need it to.  Amazing.  And it smells great.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Best combo anti-antiperspirant/deodorant combo for my skin type.  It is worth a try if you haven&#x27;t found one that works for you.</li>
            <li> I love Dove products and will continue to use their soaps and lotions. But I bought this based on the name of the scent. But I found the scent a bit repugnant, as did my wife. So now I have 4 sticks I need to get rid of...</li>
            <li> Works well, smells good.</li>
            <li> This is the second Dove men deodorant I&#x27;ve used, but this one is also a Antiperspirant so it leaves a white residue after you put it on. Most likely won&#x27;t get this again.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and continues to smell until you take a shower. The antiperspirant isn&#x27;t on full effect, but I can dig it.</li>
            <li> A decent feel, good smell and comfort you expect from a deodorant with a good price attached to it over competitors</li>
            <li> As a canned response to a requested review, I state this:&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the items that a review is silly to do as I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner&lt;br /&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc&lt;br /&gt;the only way I would give a bad review is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that so I&#x27;m sure it does not fit this case&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product it works very good</li>
            <li> For those who have never purchased deodorant + antiperspirant it brings about the result of your armpits not producing sweat, all while smelling generally pleasant. I consider this a win-win personally.</li>
            <li> Keeping it simple. The scent is good and not overpowering. It works at making my armpits not smell. It is a good price. My only complaint is that it can leave white residue on darker clothing like most deodorants of this type. I can deal with it. Would order again</li>
            <li> It makes me break out. Believe me, you do not want a rash and constant itching in your arm pits. I give it 2 stars because I do like the scent, or lack of it.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of keeping BO out and dry.  Doesn&#x27;t stain your shirt like the gel deodorants do.  Definitely recommend this</li>
            <li> This is a product that has gotten so expensive, like the fact of the double product and a smart price point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this deodorant. I have been using Right Guard gel deodorant for several years but thought it was time to try something new. I went with this and so far am happy with it. It smells good, nothing fancy, just kind of a clean manly smell is how I would describe it. It&#x27;s long lasting. I apply it in the morning and typically I&#x27;m good for the day.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had much issues with perspiration since I started using this...and I can sweat a lot usually.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I can tell you after a full work day I still feel dry. My work days start at 5:00 AM and end at 5:00 PM. Long daily commute. No problems.</li>
            <li> It does keep you dry all day or longer. I put this on after a shower before bed and not again til the next day at bed time. It lasts that long. I&#x27;ve tried others and this is the only one that keeps me dry and odor free!</li>
            <li> The smell so good check it out and save money smell fresh and stay fresh all day for them women</li>
            <li> Great product, not an overpowering scent. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> love it smells great and I don&#x27;t sweat :)</li>
            <li> I normally use degree but it just does not last all day. I am glad that I found dove because so far its the only one I have used that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It works and is easy on sensitive men&#x27;s skin. Plus, it smells great!</li>
            <li> Had an unpleasant scent compared to past antiperspirants I have used.</li>
            <li> Just as described; arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this was recommended by my doctor. Other products left my skin irritated but this works great.</li>
            <li> Most typical deodorants give me a nasty rash so up until now I&#x27;ve been kind of stuck with Tom&#x27;s natural deodorant. I&#x27;d try some new natural deodorants here and there but Tom&#x27;s was essentially the best I could do even though it didn&#x27;t really satisfy everything I was looking for. I ended up seeing this in the store and decided to give it a try. The scent is very clean, very consistent with what you might expect Old Spice or Gillette to smell like but not too over the top. This deodorant really works! This is great as I sweat a lot and need a reliable deodorant. I don&#x27;t even have to re-apply unless it&#x27;s a super hot day, whereas with Tom&#x27;s and other natural deodorants I have to re-apply at least twice a day! Best of all, no rashes! I waited to get through the whole stick before I posted my review and I have had no rashes or adverse side effects of any kind. As a result of this deodorant&#x27;s effectiveness combined with the lack of rashes I will be using this brand for a long time.</li>
            <li> Works very well and would recommend to anyone with a need to keep their perspiration in check!  Good product for the money too!</li>
            <li> This product has a lot of good qualities.  The odor is masculine, but not overpowering.  It lasts for most of the day...no 48 hour protection for me, but it lasts long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real complaint that I have is that it goes on soft and chalky.  I end up using more product than I do with other brands and it ends up transferring to the underarm area of my shirt as I wear it.  I wish it was actually a little \\&quot;wetter\\&quot; when it went on and that the cake was a little firmer and bound together stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it is an adequate product and superior to most other brands.  I use something else as my normal antiperspirant, but I will use this periodically.</li>
            <li> Great scent but I still manage to get white streaks on black t-shirts while putting the shirt on... It doesn&#x27;t seem to do better or worse than Axe or others at anti-perspiring.</li>
            <li> Does not last long enough for me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tested out the 48hr feature as I shower daily but this is as good as it gets. I came over from degree and I didn&#x27;t think anything could be as good as it was - degree ie- until I found this. The scent is refreshing and definitely protects you throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Great scent, still leaves stains on shirts as most others do.</li>
            <li> This product is an antiperspirant that makes your shirt look like you&#x27;ve just sweat multiple gallons out of each armpit. It may leave you smelling clean and feeling fresh but it leaves your clothing with a permanent sweat stain making you look like the 400lb man running through the aisles of Walmart searching for the last box of Twinkies, and much like that man feeling dissatisfied when he can&#x27;t find any Twinkies you will be dissatisfied with this product when you realize it ruined your clothing by leaving a waxy residue on your shirt.</li>
            <li> Very wierd deal,but a great one! Dead Space 3 limited editon plus 8 bars of face/body soap and 2 sticks of antiperspirant for $30!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work for me at all. Doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a bad product, just means everybody&#x27;s different and this will work for some and not others. You won&#x27;t know till you try it. I don&#x27;t like the white smears it left on my shirts tho.</li>
            <li> Very good antiperspirant and smells great</li>
            <li> Good product. I have tried many antiperspirants and I always end up with itchy armpits. Hasn&#x27;t happened with this one yet. It has a gentle fragrance, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Left marked in the arm pits of my shirts. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep the fragrance for longer than 12 hours but it does tame smells for 48 hours and that is what really matters. You should always use good deodorant that isn&#x27;t intrusive and use cologne for the smells ;)!</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Who needs deoderant. Yolo. Am I right or am I right. I tried this stuff once and it kept ripping my arm pit hairs off. This peice of junk is a conspiracy man.</li>
            <li> Works great I does not stick to clothes and last me all day long. my job requires me to be outside 90% of the time I work in Michigan and its summer. So The heat can get to yo, but Dove Men + Care Antiperspirant works great, and I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I have searched the world over for deodorant that doesn&#x27;t have ill effects for me with my sensitive under arm skin area.  Everything breaks me out except this stuff.  I know it&#x27;s for men but the smell is awesome and it works so I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> This works really great and smells really good and is a much more effective antiperspirant than a lot of other mens products. This is not an overwhelming scented product and it lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I bought a bunch of these from costco without trying it before, biggest mistake. within half an hour of applying this product, it has already dried and falling to the ground in little pieces.  everywhere i walk, there are white flakes on the ground.  i even tried putting it on right after i shower thinking it might absorb better hence leading to less shedding which made no difference.  i ended up throwing the rest out and will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I like the smell very much, it doesn&#x27;t last more than 24 hours (they say 48 hours) but that&#x27;s almost like cars MPG, varies per usage :)&lt;br /&gt;one note, recently I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s leaving a stain under my arms. but it goes away once you wash it.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again, as it gets crummy after an hour and will leave you with crumbs rolling off of you</li>
            <li> This is an excellent anti-perspirant/deodarant. The scent is pleasant and long lasting. It also controls perspiration better than other ones I have used.</li>
            <li> I got my first Dove Men&#x27;s +Care. On the label it&#x27;s stated it will last 48hrs and after trying it, it does last 48hrs. The scent is so sweet which definitely eliminates the need to wear cologne or perfume. I bought this pair and will continue to by Dove Men&#x27;s +Care Antiperspirant Deodorant. Worth of my money and my underarm pits</li>
            <li> It is impossible for my pits to sweat when using this product.  It is better than any other anti-perspirant I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have very hairy underarms and it has been difficult to find antiperspirant/deodrant that does not irritate the skin and gum up the hair.&lt;br /&gt;This product is excellent. It soften the skin and keeps the stink away. I approve of this product.Check all my Dove care men products reviews.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever bought, love it!</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My husband and son HATE this deodorant.  It doesn&#x27;t work.  My husband asked me to stop purchasing it a few months after he first tried it.  My teenage son realized it didn&#x27;t work after many embarrassing moments at school activities.  He started using his dad&#x27;s deodorant instead!  My daughters &amp; I have had the same, bad results with the ladies&#x27; Dove deodorants.  We have tried many other deodorants since we realized with MUCH better results!</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this item after trying a sample sized version. The main reason I like it is the light scent. Some anti-perspirants have such a strong odor that it irritates my nose when I sleep shortly after applying. That hasn&#x27;t been a problem with Dove for Men. It seems to work all day as well. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with odor.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold up for a 12hr shift as a nurse.....</li>
            <li> It does what it does and keeps things fresh and dry. Not much else to say about it. Nice that it came in a 2 pack!</li>
            <li> I love this product because I realized that my Old Spice antiperspirant had too much of a scent.  The Dove works just great and isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Smells great and goes on noticeably smoother and gentler than alot of other stick deodorants i&#x27;ve used. I usually have used Original Degree and it would go on kind of rough and not glide smoothly. I bought this because it was on sale (with a smaller sample stick of the Aqua Impact scent, which I also highly recommend, smells amazing) and immediately after putting it on I knew I had found a go-to deodorant.</li>
            <li> My one and only deodorant, doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts and works great.  I sweat alot so it probably work better then most.</li>
            <li> I tend to order all maintenance supplies for the family. The men did like this.</li>
            <li> The nice balance between smelly girly and smelly like a cowboy. Light fresh smell and it gets me through my whole day and my workout...</li>
            <li> one of the best concoctions of Unilever. THe level of antiperspirant this has is over the charts</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Keeps you dry and has a nice and refreshing fragrance.  Easy to use with a twist of your hand.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, and many antiperspirants that are strong enough to work for me also irritate my skin to the point of a visible rash.  This one is gentle enough on my skin for every day use, and keeps me dry all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I really like about this antiperspirant is that the scent is subtle enough not to overpower the smell of aftershave, cologne, body spray, etc.,  Many men&#x27;s antiperspirants are so strongly perfumed that they clash with cologne, but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> works all day long, stay dry and smell good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t last 48 hours as stated for me, everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different however.</li>
            <li> A couple things matter to me on a product like this:  does it last, is the fragrance toned down, and does it rub off on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;It easily last the entire day and that&#x27;s with a hour workout tagged onto the end.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is subtle and not overpowering&lt;br /&gt;Have yet to discover the tell-tale white rub-off on my shirts after putting them on in the morning.</li>
            <li> Good antiperspirant that  will last throughout a whole day. I am unsure about the 48 hour claim but it will definitely last for a day.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the smell or the feel of the powder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.I like it.</li>
            <li> My nose is quite sensitive to most smells and this one is really strong for me. It seems that the antiperspirant part has no effect whatsoever on my body.</li>
            <li> Big deodorant bottles in a two pack for a great price.  The scent is very light (which is what I was looking for).  If you don&#x27;t like unscented deodorant, but don&#x27;t want an overbearing smell on you for hours, this deodorant is great.</li>
            <li> Twin pack consists of two large deodorants. The smell is light and good. The feel is also light and does not cake.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now, and am very satisfied with the results. I have sensitive skin which tends to become easily irritated from the combination of sweat, antiperspirant, and friction from daily arm movement. I am comparing this product to &amp;#34;Degree Invisible Stick Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant 2.7oz&amp;#34;, which I have used for almost a year exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Pleasant, masculine scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering&lt;br /&gt;- Fairly safe so far on sensitive skin. I have not developed any rashes or irritations from months of using this product&lt;br /&gt;- Easily washes off in the shower. Other antiperspirants show some &amp;#34;resistance&amp;#34; to being scrubbed off with a shower pouf and body-wash.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t leave residues or scents after being washed off.&lt;br /&gt;- Actually does what it says when it provides 48 hours of protection.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t create that annoying &amp;#34;wet armpit&amp;#34; feel that makes you want to readjust your shirt constantly to air it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Chalky white texture that slightly crumbles when applied on underarm hair&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate underarm sweating, but only minimizes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to any person that experiences skin irritations from using antiperspirants, and is looking for an alternative product that won&#x27;t cause them. I hope this review helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: 05/24/2015 - It&#x27;s been more than two years since I&#x27;ve started using the product/written this review, and I&#x27;m still using it to this day. I have no problems to report.</li>
            <li> I always use this deorderan.t</li>
            <li> Not bad.leaves white resedue on your shirt armpit.Prefer the dry spray over this.</li>
            <li> Smooth, not sticky. Love the smell and the protection. Clean smell</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible! It smells good and goes on good, but that is about where it ends. I put this on at 6AM and could smell BO by noon. I will go going back to my other deo/APs.</li>
            <li> Product was as advertised.  I believe I ordered the wrong scent. I would be care in the future of that.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells good, doesn&#x27;t leave much residue. Girlfriend really likes it, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Smells good. And does exactly what it says. Keeps away sweat!</li>
            <li> It smells great and do not leave behind any white stuff. They are a great price and I&#x27;ll buy more when I&#x27;m done with the two I have</li>
            <li> Works well in every other way, but for some strange reason it leaves hard, plastic-y film seemingly soaked into the pits of my undershirts, visible inside and out. No idea what that is about, but I&#x27;ve now ordered new shirts, and am here to order new antiperspirant. Freaky.</li>
            <li> My hubby uses it all the time</li>
            <li> Great deodorant, keeps me from sweating excessively and doesn&#x27;t smell too much. It&#x27;s a good basic deodorant.</li>
            <li> I stink. This sort of solved my problems.  Antipersperant is good but I think it still stains my shirts.  Not good. But good product.  Prefer over right guard right now.  May switch back tho.</li>
            <li> Smells great and last!!! Last at least 24 hours even being active. No worries with Dove Men Care. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I tried to find a new deodorant. I have never gone through a stick of deodorant so fast. Once a day use and the bar was gone in less than a month. I will not be buying dove mens deodorant again.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is awesome! I started developing rashes from Old Spice and Axe solid sticks, and decided to give this a try! It smells great and does not give me a rash. This is my go-to for deodorant now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update** 05/06/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this deodorant for almost a year and now have no rashes. Sometimes people will develop allergies so I just wanted to inform you that, that was not the case for me. I love it!</li>
            <li> Good deodorant, it lasts all day and does not irritate my skin</li>
            <li> It successfully blocks sweat for a long time, even during fairly intense workouts, without the irritants and hard metals most antiperspirants use to achieve this. If it&#x27;s immediately prior to a workout I&#x27;ll just use a small amount and there won&#x27;t be much to get off in the shower, though I can easily use it after showering and it&#x27;ll keep me from sweating while I sleep, all throughout the next day, and through my workout.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant ever !!! I can&#x27;t wear jewelry, cologne, and latex bandages without getting rashes but this product does not affect me and no more red pimples and blisters. This truly lasts for 2 days and glad they invented it, customer for life. Thanks</li>
            <li> Love this product, no irritation at all, I have had some other deodorants that have caused issues. This is the one product that I can rely on for good wetness protection, good smell, and no rash</li>
            <li> This deodorant&#x27;s scent is overpowering, and I don&#x27;t like the way it smells at all. I should have smelled it in person before purchasing online. Worked okay but that was probably just because of the overpowering scent!</li>
            <li> i guess it&#x27;s good. i was in a hurry and thought i was purchasing soap and it turned out to be deodorant. oh well good thing it wasn&#x27;t expensive and you can never have too much deodorant.</li>
            <li> Been using these over year, and like them alot.</li>
            <li> Very nic and smell like a rose flower.  Great job!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> USING IT SPARINGLY; WORKS FOR ME.  GOOD FRAGRANCE, TOO.</li>
            <li> i buy this for my husband, and he just swears buy it!! even when he goes to the gym and works out , he doesn&#x27;t stain his shirts anymore!!  awsome  stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> everything I have ever bought from dove has been absolutely fantastic. love it all. leaves everything softer and smoother, yup.</li>
            <li> Solid product. I&#x27;ve tried many, many antiperspirants and deodorants.  For a while, I wanted to get away from the aluminum and tried all natural deodorants.  They simply don&#x27;t work well and I don&#x27;t like the feeling my wet pits.  For the last month I&#x27;ve tried to go completely stick free... and, well, I find myself redordering this product. I just don&#x27;t like the feeling of sweaty armpits so I&#x27;m gonna give in and continue using the aluminum until something comes out telling me it&#x27;s just awful for you. This is twin-pack is a good deal at Amazon and this scent is fresh enough without being overpowering or way too artificially masculine like some of the ones on the market (eh hem, axe). It also lasts quite long - not sure if it goes the full 24 hours, but it will last most of the day with one application.  The one downside is it does tend to stain your shirts in an awkward way... sometimes out of the laundry I can actually see some aluminum traces. I can&#x27;t tell how much of the dark staining is due to the product or due to my sweat though. I&#x27;ll keep an eye out and report back.</li>
            <li> I also use Degree and Gillette. Dove is comparable to those products for me. I usually buy whichever one is on sale.</li>
            <li> Other antiperspirants and deodorants, including Axe, Old Spice, Speed Stik, and Degree (to name a few) give my husband an itchy armpit rash. The poor guy was so uncomfortable. But then I found this, and he is itchy no more. Will never use another.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deodorant. Woohoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only deodorant that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or leave chunks tangled in my arm pit hair. I used to use the Old Spice deodorants but those made me sweat and soon after I would smell. With this one I don&#x27;t sweat and it actually lasts me the whole day, I don&#x27;t know about the 48 hour thing because I shower everyday, so yea. Shower people.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I thought this product was the invisible-like see through stick. I have cancer and have very sensitive skin. Apparently, the white bar of this product gave me extreme irritation. I was in the hospital so I wasn&#x27;t able to file for a refund or return.</li>
            <li> Personally to me really like this fragrance, long kept not leave traces and dry. Super. I would recommend it you to</li>
            <li> To start with the con side: It does tend to flake a little bit, at least when you just start using it. However, this is reduces to a non-noticeable level pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of it, and has just the right balance of strength so it stays affective throughout the day but not come off too aggressive early on.&lt;br /&gt;Overall – great product. Will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I need a strong deodorant/antiperspirant and this one has been doing the job recently i&#x27;m big like 6&#x27;6&amp;#34; 200+#&#x27;s.  The stick doesn&#x27;t last quiet as long as the degree everest or the traditional old-spice stick but this has done a good job.  I feel that it&#x27;s almost too soft of a stick so i&#x27;m likely putting on more than i normally would get from another brand with the same expectations.  I am totally ok handing in my man car and going with the dove brand...like the package says...men care...too.  Next brand i&#x27;m going to throw into the mix is Axe.  Degree Everest has become the anchor of my sweaty Virginia life recently.</li>
            <li> This really is effective as a deodorant and reasonably effective as an antiperspirant for me. I sweat a lot and living in the Houston area summer times are pretty bad. This is effective for me all day. One caution, it seems to leave a white residue on some dark shirts so be careful.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh like Christmas trees!!</li>
            <li> I hate white spots on my clothes from deodorant.  I don&#x27;t get them with this plus the product controls odor and perpiration all day long.</li>
            <li> I purchased this antipersipirant after reading a favorable write-up in one of those men&#x27;s magazines. I suffer from occasional hyperhydrosis (excessive underarm sweating), so I use [[ASIN:B001F0QX1E Certain Dri Roll-On Anti-Perspirant 1.2 Fl  Ozs, (Pack of 3)]] (it works wonders). I purchased this Dove antiperspirant to use daily in conjunction with the Certain Dri.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going through a stick, I&#x27;m a little disappointed. The fragrance is light and short lasting. I never imagined the product would afford 48 hour protection as it claims, but I&#x27;m lucky to get 8 hour protection. This antiperspirant struggles to handle day-to-day sweating issues for me. Everyone has different body chemistry, so maybe this product just doesn&#x27;t jive with my genetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good price, though, so if you have light body odor / perspiration tendencies, this might be a good fit for you.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fifty one years old and have been using these products for a very long time. Without a doubt, this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve used and will use nothing else.</li>
            <li> Great price with the subscription deal and 5 other items.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my husband and it smells so good. I was really surprised how long the smell lasts. He still smells good when he comes home after a long day.</li>
            <li> We love this product,  unfortunately it was completly melted when we received it! That&#x27;s why it only gets three stars. There was melted deodorant all over the package,  inside and out</li>
            <li> No irritation. Makes you smell good. Stops you from sweating so much the whole day! And this is coming from a fire fighter! I only use these kind of products!</li>
            <li> Awesomely a life saver</li>
            <li> I didnt really help to much in my effort to stop sweating. Was a good product, but quite pricey too!!</li>
            <li> Degree deodorant works a million times better than this product. It does not last nearly as long as it claims, I do not sweat that much and after 5hrs I could feel my self in need of more deodorant. I do not carry around deodorant every where I go, so having to need more during the day is not cool.</li>
            <li> To me, this has a pleasant but almost imperceptible scent, which is as it should be. My previous antiperspirant worked well enough but left a residue I could feel on my skin after a shower; this doesn&#x27;t. I subtracted one star from the rating because this is a little more expensive and doesn&#x27;t give me as many days of use as my previous choice.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right, this stuff works.  Pulling a shift at work and then a nice 3 mile jog didn&#x27;t dent the protection this antiperspirant provided me.  Rock on Dove.  lol</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how doo this antiperspirant deodorant worked. I had tried Mitchum, Old Spice, Speed Stick, and nearly every brand trying to find something to curb my pit sweating. Nothing worked, until I tried this. It completely stopped my random sweating and I no longer get those embarrassing wet spots on my pits. The scent is just enough to make everything neutral until you get very close, then my wife says it is pleasant. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for an effective antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, most deodorants irritate my skin, but that&#x27;s not the case with this Dove non-irritant deodorant. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now and never had a rash or break out from using it. Works well for me all day and keep sweat/odor under control.</li>
            <li> real thing, works great so far.</li>
            <li> The scent is SO overpowering. I will not be buying this scent again.</li>
            <li> worked great for a while but after wearing for several months stopped working and now my husband stinks</li>
            <li> I do not sweat through my shirt while casually walking around at work.  That is about all I really ask for.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend. He used Old Spice before and now prefers this. No complaints!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months. It works great... no sweat stains on my shirts, still smells great the next morning when I get up. It&#x27;s definitely tough on clothing, which goes for every antiperspirant I&#x27;ve tried (Degree, Right Guard, Gillette, Old Spice...), and it has an unusual chalky texture that flakes off my underarms. I noticed it on the black upholstery of my car, and it took me quite a while to figure out where it came from, but this antiperspirant cakes up and flakes off every single day. For me, it works the best of any antiperspirant I&#x27;ve tried, but I do vacuum my car much more frequently these days.</li>
            <li> All of Dove&#x27;s Men+Care deodorants have a strange smell to me.  I don&#x27;t know what it is.  They seem to work OK, but they leave LOTS of white residue on my clothes.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy any more after I run out.  I decided to try it after seeing it was top rated on Amazon, but I don&#x27;t really care for it.</li>
            <li> Not a man&#x27;s product. I need something that meets my personal care needs and this one does not come close. Dove Corp. needs to go back to the drawing board on this one. Guys if you are like me and need a good antiperspirant look else where.</li>
            <li> i was buying women dove because my skin and now this is deodorand for life is maintain quality,keep the improvement</li>
            <li> I like it but in no way 48 hour protection unless you like offending people and eating alone. No rash, smells good doesn&#x27;t stain clothes..but 48 hours...umm no unless your in Antarctica walking around with your arms up so you wont sweat.</li>
            <li> Great product, we love it and would buy it again if we need to.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Does what it should do. Keep you fresh throughout the whole day!</li>
            <li> The only deodorant that doesn&#x27;t irritate my armpits! &amp;#34;Subscribe &amp; Save&amp;#34; is even cheaper than Walmart!</li>
            <li> Great price! Woo for smelling clean!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is mostly sold individually in stores and can get quite pricey. Can&#x27;t beat the price online and sometimes the stores don&#x27;t even carry this brand.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Tried a couple of anti perspirants - this one does not leave stains on ur clothing unlike the others.</li>
            <li> I am finding the WHOLE Dove line for men is GREAT! Much better than normal Gillette, etc. Soap bar does go down faster but the suds and whatever else is great. This product is the BEST EVER!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it needs to. It has a great smell and it lasts all day, and is not overpowering or gives you an uncomfortable feel like the deodorant is too thick.</li>
            <li> It still irritates my skin.  What happened to me!?  I used to where solids all through my teens.  I switched to Axe invisible solids a couple years ago and enjoyed the smell of them but the sweat just came rolling through.  I tried Axe solids and they immediately stopped all stink and sweat.  There are some serious antiperspirants in there!  After a few months I start itching like crazy.  So I decided to try this dove low irritant deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;It did cut down on the itchiness and irritation, but i did not get better until using doves clear gel.  It smells good too, not as good imo and is weak compared to their solid.  I sweat through it in a few hours.  Maybe I sweat more than normal?  I weigh 150 lbs, and eat healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently deployed to Afghanistan, its hot over here which means i sweat nonstop, this stuff works....I wouldnt say for 48 hours but definitally for 24!</li>
            <li> It works great. Has a great smell and feel. Not to overpowering and lasts a very long time after you use it.</li>
            <li> Man of the house loves the Dove Men Plus Care products. This is easy on his sensitive skin but does the job, we have it on subscribe and save delivered to the door!</li>
