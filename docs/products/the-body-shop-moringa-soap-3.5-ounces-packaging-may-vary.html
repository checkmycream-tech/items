            <li>I don&#x27;t enjoy cream cleansers that don&#x27;t make me feel clean.</li>
            <li>Moringa soap is really great for those with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I hesitated buying it because I didn&#x27;t know much about Moringa, but I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it.  </li>

            <li>I have not tried the other scents of this soap because I find this one very pleasant, but if they are subtle like this one, I&#x27;m sure they are nice as well.</li>
            <li>I like the scent very much.</li>

            <li>The last time I had ordered, it wasn&#x27;t available, and my local Body Shop closed.  </li>
            <li>This is a delicate, creamy, light floral soap that is also non-drying.  </li>
            <li>I have crazy sensitive skin, so to find something that smells nice and doesn&#x27;t break me out is almost miraculous.</li>
            <li>Whether or not it is any better for my skin than other soaps, hard to say.  </li>

            <li> Just as described. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Best soap family and I used! We highly recommend for a soft feel, facial or body.&lt;br /&gt;It moisturize and helps reduce stretch marks on skin. Moringa soap is really great for those with dry skin. We defiantly continue ordering this moringa soap. It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> Like the shape of the bar, the lathering is really good, and it smells nice without being feminine/perfume-y.  Whether or not it is any better for my skin than other soaps, hard to say.  But I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I adore this soap. I have sensitive skin and I try to stay away from &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; bar soaps. This bar has a very delicate scent and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It also seems to last a very long time. I have not tried the other scents of this soap because I find this one very pleasant, but if they are subtle like this one, I&#x27;m sure they are nice as well.</li>
            <li> This soap smells great !  Leaves a clean fresh sent.  That&#x27;s a plus.  A little pricey but we will buy again.</li>

            <li> IT CLEARED MY FACE. I WILL PURCHASE MORE WHEN I FINISH THE ONES I HAVE</li>
            <li> This soap smells so wonderful and unique, and leaves my skin amazingly soft. I&#x27;ve been using it as a shaving bar. I have crazy sensitive skin, so to find something that smells nice and doesn&#x27;t break me out is almost miraculous.</li>
            <li> was very excited how this soap felt on my skin .I&#x27;m very pleased with it. Will order it again</li>
            <li> This is my fave bodyshop soap. I actually got it in London and came on hear to buy some so i thought to write a review, makes my skin super soft and it never soaks up water when using it in the shower....moringa body butter is my fave too!</li>
            <li> I like the scent very much. it is foaming and refreshing. If it lasts longer, it would be perfect! very nice soap!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry at all. I&#x27;m used to moringa oil, and this is the best soap bar ever!!! :)</li>
            <li> I have only used this soap about 5 times.  It is very cleansing; my skin feels smooth, soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> nice smell and remain it for a while.</li>
            <li> I was having such problems with my face skin. Rashes, especially on my eyelids and throat. Since I have been using this as a facial bar every morning and night the rashes have gone away. The rashes had to be caused by some ingredient in the other products I used to wash my face. I like something that soaps up! I don&#x27;t enjoy cream cleansers that don&#x27;t make me feel clean. This bar soaps up nice and smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!!! I love the scent, the way it leaves my skin feeling after my shower too. I hope I never let myself run out of it. I also drink Moringa tea. It is very light and smooth, not harsh. All I can say is Moringa is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Love the scent..great for face, and body..leaves my skin feeling clean and soft..</li>
            <li> I really love the fragrance and will probably purchase again.</li>
            <li> This smells so good! It makes me feel like a million bucks. Even my 14 year old daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Along with The Body Shop, Honeymania, this is a favorite soap for me. Such a beautiful smell and great lather quality. Great soap!</li>
