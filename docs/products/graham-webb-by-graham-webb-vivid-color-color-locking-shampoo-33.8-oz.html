            <li>Graham Webb Vivid Color color locking shampoo is the best shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>No itchy scalp and the mild but pleasant fragrance does not interfere with the scent I choose to wear.  </li>
            <li>I have used Graham Webb Shampoo and Conditioner for many years and wish it was able to be found in beauty salons or stores.  </li>
            <li>I plan on buying more from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love the Graham Webb products</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>When I received the box looked fine, but when I opened it, there was shampoo all over the inside.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and continue to enjoy the results.</li>
            <li>YOU HAVE IT AVAILABLE.</li>
            <li>The primary reason for this purpose was the product&#x27;s advertised &amp;#34;color locking&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I also do not like hair products that are highly scented and therefore interfere with my own perfume.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo plus the matching conditioner make me look like I have a full head of hair again.</li>
            <li>Although it is more expensive that brands available at the drug or grocery store it is well worth the money as you do not need very much to do a great job!  </li>
            <li>I use alot of hair spray on my hair and this shampoo cuts right through the heavy hair spray and really cleans great!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and many shampoos and conditioners make my scalp itch and burn.  </li>
            <li>Vivid Color Color Locking Shampoo keeps my color looking good until the next time I color.  </li>
            <li>Many salons in my area have stopped carrying  the product so needless to say I was so happy to find it through Amazon--my always go to place.</li>
            <li>It really works in keeping your color from fading too quickly.  </li>
            <li>I like the product very much.  </li>
            <li>I have purple highlights in my hair and those can fade very fast.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy and does not weigh down my hair, allowing it to have good volume.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The top of the bottle was crushed.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo feels very luxurious on my hair and my color stays a lot longer.</li>
            <li>They are worth every penny of the price and have never disappointed me (except that they are getting harder to find).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend the products for anyone to use.</li>
            <li>I have been using Graham Webb&#x27;s Vivid Color Shampoo and the matching Vivid Color Conditioner for over 10 years and absolutely swear by these products.  </li>
            <li>I also recommend Graham Webb&#x27;s Vivid Color Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My cheap Garnier Fructis shampoo caused less color loss than this.</li>
            <li>Nice product but ridiculously expensive</li>
            <li>The shampoo does not fade or damage my color and does not dry my hair.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m 60+ and have silver-gray hair that&#x27;s starting to thin.</li>
            <li> Probably at least 3 ounces had spilled.  </li>
            <li> Also, like others have said, the packaging sucks.</li>
            <li> Granted, my hair is crazy unnatural mermaid red, but when compared to other shampoos, this one failed.</li>
            <li> However, I was very disappointed that it had leaked out everywhere in the shipping package, even though it was wrapped in plastic.  </li>

            <li> I have used Graham Webb Shampoo and Conditioner for many years and wish it was able to be found in beauty salons or stores.  I like the lather and the protection for my color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Have used Graham Webb hair care products for over 20 years.  Great products. Highly recommend the products for anyone to use.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and many shampoos and conditioners make my scalp itch and burn.

            <li> Nice product but ridiculously expensive</li>
            <li> This is one of the best &#x27;volumizing&#x27; products I&#x27;ve used even tho that&#x27;s not how it&#x27;s advertised. I&#x27;m 60+ and have silver-gray hair that&#x27;s starting to thin. This shampoo plus the matching conditioner make me look like I have a full head of hair again.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much.  However, I was very disappointed that it had leaked out everywhere in the shipping package, even though it was wrapped in plastic.  It&#x27;s obvious this problem is a re-occuring one; it&#x27;s also obvious that the solution is not an acceptable one!</li>
            <li> Since I started coloring my hair I find this is a great product to keep color in and hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and continue to enjoy the results. I will order it again as soon as I can.</li>
            <li> When I received the box looked fine, but when I opened it, there was shampoo all over the inside.  Probably at least 3 ounces had spilled.  The top of the bottle was crushed.  It seemed to be packed well and the box didn&#x27;t look damaged, but it definitely had been crushed at some point.</li>
            <li> Vivid Color Color Locking Shampoo keeps my color looking good until the next time I color.  I have used it for years, and can only find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love the Graham Webb products</li>
            <li> I use nothing else for my hair this product is awesome</li>
            <li> I have purple highlights in my hair and those can fade very fast. This shampoo feels very luxurious on my hair and my color stays a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED OTHER SHAMPOO&#x27;S BUT THIS IS THE BEST.  I WILL ORDER AGAIN!!  I AM SO GLAD YOU HAVE IT AVAILABLE.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> The primary reason for this purpose was the product&#x27;s advertised &amp;#34;color locking&amp;#34; power... This offered no color protection. My cheap Garnier Fructis shampoo caused less color loss than this. Granted, my hair is crazy unnatural mermaid red, but when compared to other shampoos, this one failed. Also, like others have said, the packaging sucks.</li>
