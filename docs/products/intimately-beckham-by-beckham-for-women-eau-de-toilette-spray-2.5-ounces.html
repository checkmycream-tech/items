            <li>I bought my first bottle in the UK and as it was coming to an end I searched and happily found it on Amazon.  </li>

            <li>t has a beautiful odor, however first try one pump of it, some thing that it was to strong.</li>

            <li>A fragrance that is not as durable, but with a very nice and gentle fragrance to wear on the day.</li>

            <li>Soft, sensual, and sexy... such a great combination when you want to smell good for yourself or your man!!</li>
            <li>And the best part is how long it lasts on you.</li>

            <li>This perfume is so light and lovely.</li>
            <li>As far as the smell I think it would be great on anyone.</li>
            <li>Great soft scent.</li>
            <li>I love this scent because it is unique, and feminine but still smells like a WOMAN not a teens perfume.</li>
            <li>Scent doesn&#x27;t last too long, but when I put it on in the morning I feel I&#x27;ve done something lovely just for me:) very warm &amp; beautifully feminine scent.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, feminine fragrance but only lasts an hour or two.  </li>
            <li>When I smelled this parfume for the first time, I could not believe how nice the aroma was.</li>
            <li>It smells clean and light and sexy...</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong, but yet it lightly lingers on your body.</li>
            <li>Love this Product--It is a soft scent that every women would love!</li>
            <li>i really recommend this product, smell amazing and sensual.</li>
            <li>Light and airy.</li>
            <li>So cheap</li>
            <li>(so probably using cheap fragrance...</li>
            <li>I knew this one would work, as it has a light flowery scent, not</li>
            <li>Do not let the affordable price fool you or reflect on this perfumes fabulous scent.  </li>
            <li>It is worth a try, and makes for a lovely gift.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>fragrance is  a light floral scent.  </li>
            <li>It was on sell for dirt cheap.</li>
            <li>and I still enjoy it.</li>
            <li>This perfume is just as fabulous as everybody says it is.</li>
            <li>Also the period of my life when I did use it was really good, two guys were in love with me at the same time.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on my favorite cologne, Intimately Beckham.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a super strong scent to it..</li>
            <li>They all love it very much.</li>
            <li>This has been a scent I have enjoyed since I first tried a sample</li>
            <li>My Niece Loves this scent, this is the Second Purchase of this for me, and it is nice to know where to find it!</li>
            <li>I was very pissed, but it would have cost me more to return it than I paid (guess I should have read the fine print?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Opens with pure fresh flowers, bergamot, rose petals and orange blossom.</li>
            <li>so it will not matter for this fragrance truly blends in to your chemistry and leaves a clean sultry smell.  </li>
            <li>I do not think the scent is anything special.</li>
            <li>I receive compliments from friends, co-workers, and complete strangers on how nice I smell</li>
            <li>I love this parfume so much.</li>
            <li>I constantly receive compliments about how good it smells.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and it was an absolute money saver.</li>
            <li>I love the heavenly scent of Intimately Beckham for women.</li>
            <li>The smell is really fragrant and enjoyed by all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy, over powering strong or overly sweet scent like so many colognes that are now on the market.</li>
            <li>Wears off way too quickly.  </li>
            <li>I got so lucky finding this perfume.  </li>
            <li>Nice simple clean scent.  </li>
            <li>It fits well within my long hair and the scent lingers nicely and is just super smooth.</li>
            <li>However aside from that, the perfume itself smells amazing, the scent is something flowery yet not too sweet or overbearing, I got it last night</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone interested in this product!</li>
            <li>Many strong smells give me instant headaches</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s very feminine light fragrance.</li>
            <li>When I spritz it on, I immediately get a heady dose of white flowers, rose, and tuberose.</li>
            <li>Soft, elegant, feminine.</li>

            <li>Its worth the 15 bucks.</li>
            <li>Most American women do not know of this fragrance, so those who have it can feel special having a fragrance that no one else will have.</li>
            <li>was right on time</li>
            <li>just right mix of musk &amp; floral</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a very light fragrance that last all day</li>
            <li>might be the same with this one, cannot say for sure yet.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve ever purchased perfume by way of a sample</li>
            <li>I received exactly what I ordered and wanted.</li>
            <li>I purchased this, based on reviews I read about it, without having the opportunity to smell it first.  </li>
            <li>o that&#x27;s been wearing her scents for years because it last all day &amp; get so many compliments😍</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no need to spray more on hours later.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the deal !</li>
            <li>This is my first time to buy a PERFUME from amazon and the first time i buy this PERFUME and thank god</li>
            <li>really loved it, the smell is amazing and fresh and it last long time in my clothing and as long as it last the smell will be more fascinating.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i first saw it in.</li>
            <li>I feel pretty everytime</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I feel pretty when I&#x27;m wearing it</li>
            <li>Upon smelling it, I looked through the 150 + samples for more of them instantly.  </li>
            <li>Have been a fan of this perfume since it first came out.</li>
            <li>It was on sale at Target when I first discovered it and decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>It smells like a bouquet of flowers when you first apply it.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t recall exactly what it smells like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taken me almost 2 years to get through the first bottle</li>
            <li>First found this at TJMAX and tried it on a whim.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; perfume is Red Door.  </li>
            <li>My body chemistry doesn&#x27;t mix well with heavy, musky scents so this one is really good for me.  </li>
            <li>It makes me feel pretty and sensual and at 55 yrs old, I use all that I can get!!!!</li>
            <li>Also scents that are not too strong for public use and not just bedroom fun.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite perfumes, the scent is fresh and clean and not too heavy, and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x60;t smell great only, it lasts incredibly long on you!!</li>
            <li>I certainly be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing just like all her other scents...</li>
            <li>The smell is soft &amp; sweet.  </li>
            <li>i was dissapointed with it, it has a very intense rose scent that is a little over powering.</li>
            <li>Thank you Beckham&#x27;s and all involved for making such a great smelling and long lasting scent perfume that suits me just right!</li>
            <li>I am very particular on the scents I wear as they also have to meet with the approval of my horses and animals.  </li>
            <li>yes it reminds you of Pure Poison on the opening notes but it doesn&#x27;t go anywhere.</li>
            <li>and you get a large quantity for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very high quality bottle as well.</li>
            <li>Its a huge bottle (2.5 OZ) and its a tiny sticker on a bulky glass bottle.</li>
            <li>and I really wish it would.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my mom who absolutely loves it</li>
            <li>Scent wears off too fast.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put on too much because it can be over powering.</li>
            <li>Intimately Beckham By Beckham For Women Eau De Toilette Spray, 2.5-Ounces]]packaged, in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>ordering again because this is such a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>It is intimate, sensous, and feminine, without being over powering.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Intimately Beckham eau de toilette spray it got the desired effect from everyone around.  </li>
            <li>It is an absolute head turner.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I have tried to give it to my friends and family but nobody wants it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very florally and musky.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, feminine, and floral, and I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Ordered this because VS stopped making Pink, which I dearly love.</li>
            <li>I found on amazon and it was very afordable.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy both mature and young, flirty fragrances.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting; nice sweet, soft, floral smelling fragrance.</li>
            <li>Those are positive 5star for seller.&lt;br /&gt;The 3 stars is because I didn&#x27;t care for this particular perfume on my skin.</li>
            <li>Sensual, yet soft; just the right mix of floral notes...</li>
            <li>I am excited to see the price so low!  </li>
            <li>The next day I opened up after I showered and put some on, it smelled great as usual, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, and actually I am starting to like this brand more and more, but the only concern with my other purchase from Beckham&#x27;s is that the smell does not last long....</li>
            <li>It has such a sweet scent that lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s deep, flowery, and musky, and not fruity and sweet.</li>
            <li>I like it more when it dies down because its a little strong at first.</li>
            <li>I sprayed more ten minutes later</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s crisp and fresh, and I&#x27;m so pleased that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s makes you feel pretty and complete after you get ready and head out to your busy day.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this scent.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Received packaged just fine, received when expected to.</li>
            <li>I was so shocked considering how amazing the price was...great buy!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received so many compliments since I began wearing it a few years ago.</li>
            <li>is not something I would normally do.  </li>
            <li>That NEVER happens with my beloved Victoria&#x27;s Secret sprays!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this one falls right in the middle.  </li>
            <li>Received it in 4 days, new bottle.</li>
            <li>The moment I sprayed my band new</li>
            <li>It came brand new</li>
            <li>The initial group of flowers last for a while and then a light hint of lily joins the party.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always purchased Intimately Beckham and loved the smell, it has become difficult to find and Amazon has it.</li>
            <li>This is a very classy fragrance.</li>
            <li>it was a smaller size but seeing how it took me so long to get it the first time i just figured it wasnt worth complaining about</li>
            <li>I always get complements because it is so soft and sensual!</li>
            <li>This almost smells exactly like red door.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find where I live, so glad I have the internet.</li>
            <li>They sent me a old perfume, and refuse to let me return it.</li>
            <li>It is powdery but not to the point of old lady.</li>
            <li>Yes, I was surprised.  </li>
            <li>The scent caught my attention so much so that I actually put some on which</li>
            <li>The price surprised me when I looked for the perfume.  </li>
            <li>The scent smells a lot like alcohol with a soft floral scent to it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Feeling blue, and just not smelling like myself, I ordered some Intimately from somewhere else.</li>
            <li>The few more times I used it before it ran out, I would instantly get compliments on the scent from guys around me.</li>
            <li>I mean many) for our Game&#x27;s release at Casual Connect in Seattle this year, I came upon this one, \\&quot;Intimately Beckham\\&quot; in a not so anything wonderful packet, as it was a sample.  </li>
            <li>the eau de toilette is flat, the scent remains the exact same all throughout,</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t live in the same town</li>
            <li>Only negative I wish it have more staying power.</li>
            <li>I often wear it around the house just because I love it so much, and it is not too expensive.</li>
            <li>I have only worn two other scents-a French scent and Light Blue.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended - especially if you actually like tuberose like me!</li>
            <li>I have used this scent before and it really lasts so not sure I got the real deal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fresh floral, fruity everyday wear that I will use for some time to come.</li>
            <li>I get a ton of compliments  from both men and women at work or in a social environment.</li>
            <li>I did order Beckham Signature for women &amp; was uber disappointed but the men&#x27;s beckham colognes smell great too.</li>
            <li>I find myself gravitating towards it more than any other in my collection lately.</li>
            <li>An exquisit heart of casablanca lily and sublime tuberose, leading to a seductive base of voluptuous vaniall, rich sandalwood, and elegant sensual musk.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>fragrance soft long lasting.</li>
            <li>In the late afternoon, I feel the need to spritz a little more on</li>

            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this perfume!</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle in the UK and as it was coming to an end I searched and happily found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Desperate, I took a chance and ordered myself three bottles from Amazon, as I am well aware of their great return policy.</li>
            <li> Came right on time and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> t has a beautiful odor, however first try one pump of it, some thing that it was to strong.</li>

            <li> This perfume is so light and lovely.</li>
            <li> As far as the smell I think it would be great on anyone.</li>
            <li> Great soft scent.</li>
            <li> I love this scent because it is unique, and feminine but still smells like a WOMAN not a teens perfume.</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last too long, but when I put it on in the morning I feel I&#x27;ve done something lovely just for me:) very warm &amp; beautifully feminine scent.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, feminine fragrance but only lasts an hour or two.  </li>
            <li> When I smelled this parfume for the first time, I could not believe how nice the aroma was.</li>
            <li> It smells clean and light and sexy...</li>

            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> fragrance is  a light floral scent.  </li>
            <li> It was on sell for dirt cheap.</li>
            <li> and I still enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This perfume is just as fabulous as everybody says it is.</li>
            <li> Also the period of my life when I did use it was really good, two guys were in love with me at the same time.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments on my favorite cologne, Intimately Beckham.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a super strong scent to it..</li>
            <li> They all love it very much.</li>
            <li> This has been a scent I have enjoyed since I first tried a sample</li>
            <li> My Niece Loves this scent, this is the Second Purchase of this for me, and it is nice to know where to find it!</li>
            <li> I was very pissed, but it would have cost me more to return it than I paid (guess I should have read the fine print?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Opens with pure fresh flowers, bergamot, rose petals and orange blossom.</li>
            <li> so it will not matter for this fragrance truly blends in to your chemistry and leaves a clean sultry smell.  </li>
            <li> I do not think the scent is anything special.</li>
            <li> I receive compliments from friends, co-workers, and complete strangers on how nice I smell</li>
            <li> I love this parfume so much.</li>

            <li> I love this perfume and it was an absolute money saver.</li>
            <li> I love the heavenly scent of Intimately Beckham for women.</li>
            <li> The smell is really fragrant and enjoyed by all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a heavy, over powering strong or overly sweet scent like so many colognes that are now on the market.</li>
            <li> Wears off way too quickly.  </li>
            <li> I got so lucky finding this perfume.  </li>
            <li> Nice simple clean scent.  </li>
            <li> It fits well within my long hair and the scent lingers nicely and is just super smooth.</li>
            <li> However aside from that, the perfume itself smells amazing, the scent is something flowery yet not too sweet or overbearing, I got it last night</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone interested in this product!</li>
            <li> Many strong smells give me instant headaches</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s very feminine light fragrance.</li>
            <li> When I spritz it on, I immediately get a heady dose of white flowers, rose, and tuberose.</li>
            <li> Soft, elegant, feminine.</li>
            <li> NICE FRAGRANCE BIG BOTTLE FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li> and it is totally worth the money for the size you get.</li>
            <li> Sure to have it near me every day.</li>

            <li> I love the soft yet powerful scent.</li>
            <li> Its worth the 15 bucks.</li>
            <li> Most American women do not know of this fragrance, so those who have it can feel special having a fragrance that no one else will have.</li>
            <li> was right on time</li>
            <li> just right mix of musk &amp; floral</li>
            <li> Intimately Beckham fragrance became a favorite scent from my first sniff but is no longer available locally.</li>
            <li> The scent is very femine and more on the sweet side and it do last all day.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother for a christmas gift, I was very reasonable priced</li>
            <li> the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very light fragrance that last all day</li>
            <li> might be the same with this one, cannot say for sure yet.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever purchased perfume by way of a sample</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I ordered and wanted.</li>
            <li> I purchased this, based on reviews I read about it, without having the opportunity to smell it first.  </li>
            <li> o that&#x27;s been wearing her scents for years because it last all day &amp; get so many compliments😍</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no need to spray more on hours later.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the deal !</li>
            <li> This is my first time to buy a PERFUME from amazon and the first time i buy this PERFUME and thank god</li>
            <li> really loved it, the smell is amazing and fresh and it last long time in my clothing and as long as it last the smell will be more fascinating.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I feel pretty when I&#x27;m wearing it</li>
            <li> Upon smelling it, I looked through the 150 + samples for more of them instantly.  </li>
            <li> Have been a fan of this perfume since it first came out.</li>
            <li> It was on sale at Target when I first discovered it and decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> It smells like a bouquet of flowers when you first apply it.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t recall exactly what it smells like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken me almost 2 years to get through the first bottle</li>
            <li> First found this at TJMAX and tried it on a whim.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; perfume is Red Door.  </li>
            <li> My body chemistry doesn&#x27;t mix well with heavy, musky scents so this one is really good for me.  </li>
            <li> It makes me feel pretty and sensual and at 55 yrs old, I use all that I can get!!!!</li>
            <li> Also scents that are not too strong for public use and not just bedroom fun.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes, the scent is fresh and clean and not too heavy, and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x60;t smell great only, it lasts incredibly long on you!!</li>
            <li> I certainly be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing just like all her other scents...</li>
            <li> The smell is soft &amp; sweet.  </li>
            <li> i was dissapointed with it, it has a very intense rose scent that is a little over powering.</li>
            <li> Thank you Beckham&#x27;s and all involved for making such a great smelling and long lasting scent perfume that suits me just right!</li>
            <li> I am very particular on the scents I wear as they also have to meet with the approval of my horses and animals.  </li>
            <li> yes it reminds you of Pure Poison on the opening notes but it doesn&#x27;t go anywhere.</li>
            <li> and you get a large quantity for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very high quality bottle as well.</li>
            <li> Its a huge bottle (2.5 OZ) and its a tiny sticker on a bulky glass bottle.</li>
            <li> and I really wish it would.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my mom who absolutely loves it</li>
            <li> Scent wears off too fast.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put on too much because it can be over powering.</li>
            <li> Intimately Beckham By Beckham For Women Eau De Toilette Spray, 2.5-Ounces]]packaged, in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> ordering again because this is such a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> It is intimate, sensous, and feminine, without being over powering.</li>

            <li> It is an absolute head turner.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have tried to give it to my friends and family but nobody wants it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very florally and musky.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, feminine, and floral, and I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Ordered this because VS stopped making Pink, which I dearly love.</li>
            <li> I found on amazon and it was very afordable.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy both mature and young, flirty fragrances.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting; nice sweet, soft, floral smelling fragrance.</li>
            <li> Those are positive 5star for seller.&lt;br /&gt;The 3 stars is because I didn&#x27;t care for this particular perfume on my skin.</li>
            <li> Sensual, yet soft; just the right mix of floral notes...</li>
            <li> I am excited to see the price so low!  </li>
            <li> The next day I opened up after I showered and put some on, it smelled great as usual, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, and actually I am starting to like this brand more and more, but the only concern with my other purchase from Beckham&#x27;s is that the smell does not last long....</li>
            <li> It has such a sweet scent that lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deep, flowery, and musky, and not fruity and sweet.</li>
            <li> I like it more when it dies down because its a little strong at first.</li>
            <li> I sprayed more ten minutes later</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crisp and fresh, and I&#x27;m so pleased that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s makes you feel pretty and complete after you get ready and head out to your busy day.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this scent.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Received packaged just fine, received when expected to.</li>
            <li> I was so shocked considering how amazing the price was...great buy!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received so many compliments since I began wearing it a few years ago.</li>
            <li> is not something I would normally do.  </li>
            <li> That NEVER happens with my beloved Victoria&#x27;s Secret sprays!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this one falls right in the middle.  </li>
            <li> Received it in 4 days, new bottle.</li>
            <li> The moment I sprayed my band new</li>
            <li> It came brand new</li>
            <li> The initial group of flowers last for a while and then a light hint of lily joins the party.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always purchased Intimately Beckham and loved the smell, it has become difficult to find and Amazon has it.</li>
            <li> This is a very classy fragrance.</li>
            <li> it was a smaller size but seeing how it took me so long to get it the first time i just figured it wasnt worth complaining about</li>
            <li> I always get complements because it is so soft and sensual!</li>
            <li> This almost smells exactly like red door.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find where I live, so glad I have the internet.</li>
            <li> They sent me a old perfume, and refuse to let me return it.</li>
            <li> It is powdery but not to the point of old lady.</li>
            <li> Yes, I was surprised.  </li>
            <li> The scent caught my attention so much so that I actually put some on which</li>
            <li> The price surprised me when I looked for the perfume.  </li>
            <li> The scent smells a lot like alcohol with a soft floral scent to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Feeling blue, and just not smelling like myself, I ordered some Intimately from somewhere else.</li>
            <li> The few more times I used it before it ran out, I would instantly get compliments on the scent from guys around me.</li>
            <li> I mean many) for our Game&#x27;s release at Casual Connect in Seattle this year, I came upon this one, \\&quot;Intimately Beckham\\&quot; in a not so anything wonderful packet, as it was a sample.  </li>
            <li> the eau de toilette is flat, the scent remains the exact same all throughout,</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t live in the same town</li>
            <li> Only negative I wish it have more staying power.</li>
            <li> I often wear it around the house just because I love it so much, and it is not too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have only worn two other scents-a French scent and Light Blue.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended - especially if you actually like tuberose like me!</li>
            <li> I have used this scent before and it really lasts so not sure I got the real deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fresh floral, fruity everyday wear that I will use for some time to come.</li>
            <li> I get a ton of compliments  from both men and women at work or in a social environment.</li>
            <li> I did order Beckham Signature for women &amp; was uber disappointed but the men&#x27;s beckham colognes smell great too.</li>
            <li> I find myself gravitating towards it more than any other in my collection lately.</li>
            <li> An exquisit heart of casablanca lily and sublime tuberose, leading to a seductive base of voluptuous vaniall, rich sandalwood, and elegant sensual musk.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> fragrance soft long lasting.</li>
            <li> In the late afternoon, I feel the need to spritz a little more on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very subtle, light scent that I can wear to the office or</li>
            <li> long lasting fragrance...suitable for day or night.</li>
            <li> didnt last long ..</li>
            <li> and it last so long.  </li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance,  not too heavy but complex and long-lasting!</li>
            <li> This is very soft and very light, but not to be confused with weak.</li>
            <li> The scent does not last very long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on much more expensive perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I used to be a big fan of Victoria Secret&#x27;s line of perfumes but found they were not long lasting like \\&quot;Intimately Beckham for her\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> it is very subtle and great for any casual occasion.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and would never change a single thing about it !</li>
            <li> Yosh was a gracious host and very informative of just how complex perfumes can be.  </li>
            <li> This bottle was so much bigger than I expected and the price was unbeatable.  </li>
            <li> Picked this up on sale one day and was using it as a room freshener for a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle for myself last year and spent $60</li>
            <li> First base lasts around 30 minutes and the second layer of the scent is the part that I like its more soft and gentle, it smells very casual.</li>
            <li> My fiance likes my perfume to be subtle and I certainly don&#x27;t want to stink because I have doused myself.  </li>
            <li> I had this perfume a long time ago and have been trying to purchase it again for while now!</li>
            <li> And the bottle was a lot bigger than expected!</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy it as long as they continue to sell it!</li>
            <li> She has use this and likes the prefers this over several other brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a subtle, very feminine smell.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend instantly complimented it, and a few days later his brother did too.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with the bottle, it is very cheap feeling and hard to get open.</li>
            <li> I had actually never seen, heard and much less smelled this perfume before prior to ordering it and just guided myself based on the reviews I read and considering there were WAAAAYYY better reviews than bad reviews</li>
            <li> This is a fragrance that I would let a young girl wear but in no way smells juvenile.</li>
            <li> A little last a long time.</li>
            <li> I believe the bottle was even larger than the one I had previously bought in the store!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patrice</li>
            <li> This is a bigger bottle for a lil less money.</li>
            <li> I dont wear it alot in summer because its kind of heavy but not in a bad way.</li>
            <li> not much staying power.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that I disliked was the bottle and how the sticker is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few new perfumes lately.</li>
            <li> only need to use a small amount...</li>
            <li> To my delight, I received three GIANT bottles of &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; scent for a mere percentage of what I would have paid at the only store in my area (again, not gonna name names, Rite Aid) that was carrying the smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> Very few scents generate open compliments, this one does.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t start actually wearing it until I was running low on my Victoria&#x27;s Secret sprays.</li>
            <li> It takes quite a while on my skin for the base notes to warm up, and when they do, I&#x27;m not getting as heavy of a &amp;#34;dose&amp;#34; of them as I would like.  </li>
            <li> The price was exceptionally less than in retail stores.  </li>
            <li> I recieved this less then a week</li>
            <li> I will wear less of it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s less than $10</li>
            <li> There was one store that brought it back for a spell, but was charging a ridiculous amount for it</li>
            <li> Overall, you just can&#x27;t go wrong with this perfume especially for a little less than $10.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to order this over the internet since I have not smelled it before.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I don&#x27;t find this perfume lasting very long on my skin at all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy</li>
            <li> Like I said very casual and also pretty.</li>
            <li> It has very little to no &amp;#34;spice&amp;#34; to it</li>
            <li> I have had this perfume in the past and this bottle has very little smell.</li>
            <li> Usually on my skin the base notes are what really have the staying power.  </li>
            <li> This product is hard to find in retail stores.  </li>
            <li> Used it for years, then it became hard to find in retail.</li>
            <li> Hard item to find in stores.</li>
            <li> At least not through this retailer.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, as secretive as this industry is, we learned enough to make the game</li>
            <li> Our Video Game Studio recently did a casual game about Perfume.  </li>
            <li> Subtle yet lasts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s there yet subtle; you won&#x27;t smell like a floral shop on crack.</li>
            <li> If anybody knows what it&#x27;s similar to, please tell me because it&#x27;s driving me crazy trying to remember!</li>
            <li> The lack of a richer development of the base notes is the one disappointment I have about this whole blend.  </li>
            <li> does not smell at all like described, almost smells of nothing but floral alcohol, not a great smell, not as described</li>
            <li> feminine without being all flowery, or worse, powdery.</li>
            <li> Comparative to my calvin Klein beauty which was expensive.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry with this perfume.</li>
            <li> I like a scent that it airy and casual.</li>
            <li> Sort of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> How can you give it a bad review</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed if you by this product.</li>
            <li> I Hate giving bad feedback</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> It smells horrible!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my favorite :-)</li>
            <li> My wife loves this! It&#x27;s not expensive but it smells awesome!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, and actually I am starting to like this brand more and more, but the only concern with my other purchase from Beckham&#x27;s is that the smell does not last long.... might be the same with this one, cannot say for sure yet. But it&#x27;s very feminine light fragrance.</li>
            <li> It seems pretty strong, and though it&#x27;s a good smell, it&#x27;s very overwhelming. I gave it away cuz i couldn&#x27;t take it anymore.</li>
            <li> I used to be a big fan of Victoria Secret&#x27;s line of perfumes but found they were not long lasting like \\&quot;Intimately Beckham for her\\&quot;. Thank you Beckham&#x27;s and all involved for making such a great smelling and long lasting scent perfume that suits me just right! Now, can you all just come up with affordable make-up?!</li>
            <li> Its perfume if you like the smell. How can you give it a bad review</li>
            <li> Men love this fragrance. I got a sample of it and got so many compliments that I ended up buying the biggest bottle I could find! First time I&#x27;ve ever purchased perfume by way of a sample and this won&#x27;t be the only bottle I purchase! It smells clean and light and sexy...</li>
            <li> Just love it i really recommend this product, smell amazing and sensual.</li>
            <li> Got good reviews from those I gifted the spray.</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I ordered and wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend for Christmas as she could not find it in the stores anymore.  She was delighted.  When she sprayed it on herself we both thought it smelled heavenly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this, based on reviews I read about it, without having the opportunity to smell it first.  I am extremely happy!  This is some DELICIOUS juice!  When I spritz it on, I immediately get a heady dose of white flowers, rose, and tuberose. (I am one of those people who actually LOVE tuberose.) The initial group of flowers last for a while and then a light hint of lily joins the party. So luscious.  My nose never picks up the orange blossom or the bergamot.  It takes quite a while on my skin for the base notes to warm up, and when they do, I&#x27;m not getting as heavy of a &amp;#34;dose&amp;#34; of them as I would like.  I smell no sandalwood (which I love) and only a faint hint of musk and vanilla.  The lack of a richer development of the base notes is the one disappointment I have about this whole blend.  Usually on my skin the base notes are what really have the staying power.  Sadly, I don&#x27;t find this perfume lasting very long on my skin at all and I really wish it would.  It is such a truly beautiful scent I would love more time to enjoy it before it fades away.  Otherwise, in my opinion, this just couldn&#x27;t be better. Highly recommended - especially if you actually like tuberose like me!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume! I dont wear it alot in summer because its kind of heavy but not in a bad way. Its noticeable. EVERY time I wear it people compliment me and ask what it is. I love it!!</li>
            <li> does not smell at all like described, almost smells of nothing but floral alcohol, not a great smell, not as described</li>
            <li> This is a very classy fragrance. Sensual, yet soft; just the right mix of floral notes...Rose, Bergamot, Vanilla, Orange Blossom, Musk, Casablanca Lily, Sandalwood, Tuberose ....only need to use a small amount...long lasting fragrance...suitable for day or night. A beautiful fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd time I have bought this fragrance for someone. I am a big fan of Victoria Beckham! She is one of my favorite singers, is a top fashion designer, and a wonderful mother and wife. Whatever she does, she gives 110% so when I found out she was making perfumes I already knew they would be amazing. This product had a very lovely, feminine scent. The Beckham Frangrance website describes it as : \\&quot;Opens with pure fresh flowers, bergamot, rose petals and orange blossom. An exquisit heart of casablanca lily and sublime tuberose, leading to a seductive base of voluptuous vaniall, rich sandalwood, and elegant sensual musk.\\&quot; you will not be disappointed if you by this product. Makes a great gift. I have bought it for my an aunt, mother, and best friend. They all love it very much. Most American women do not know of this fragrance, so those who have it can feel special having a fragrance that no one else will have. And it being a Beckham product ensures the utmost elegance and sophistication!!!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing just like all her other scents... I&#x27;m an African-American 28 y/o that&#x27;s been wearing her scents for years because it last all day &amp; get so many compliments😍</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!!!!</li>
            <li> http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WZSWZ8/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_img&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery, great price, great product!  I believe the bottle was even larger than the one I had previously bought in the store!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patrice JOhnson~</li>
            <li> I enjoy both mature and young, flirty fragrances.  I think this one falls right in the middle.  It is fruity and floral at the same time.  I often wear it around the house just because I love it so much, and it is not too expensive. A+++ from me!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes. It doesn&#x27;t have a super strong scent to it.. it is very subtle and great for any casual occasion. I think this item has been discontinued so it&#x27;s a good thing people are still selling it on here! I bought it from Sears and started wearing it all the time. My mom fell in love with it so she wears it now too.</li>
            <li> Soft, elegant, feminine. Beautiful.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! I smelled it once a couple of years ago and fell in love. For me, the scent is not citrus-y or flower-y, which I don&#x27;t like. And the best part is how long it lasts on you. There&#x27;s no need to spray more on hours later.</li>
            <li> Intimately Beckham Eau De Toilette Spray is awesome.  The price was exceptionally less than in retail stores.  I will definitely shop again through this service !!  Thanks for the deal !</li>
            <li> This is my first time to buy a PERFUME from amazon and the first time i buy this PERFUME and thank god it is a good experience :)&lt;br /&gt;I really loved it, the smell is amazing and fresh and it last long time in my clothing and as long as it last the smell will be more fascinating.&lt;br /&gt;I will defiantly buy it again :)</li>
            <li> NICE FRAGRANCE BIG BOTTLE FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance,  not too heavy but complex and long-lasting!</li>
            <li> This perfume has a nice scent for the spring and summer months. Light and airy. Good item for the price.</li>
            <li> A gift for my daughter, this great smelling perfume was a real bargain on amazon.  I highly recommend this scent.</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last too long, but when I put it on in the morning I feel I&#x27;ve done something lovely just for me:) very warm &amp; beautifully feminine scent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my mom who absolutely loves it but we could not find it anywhere in the stores.  This is all she likes to wear</li>
            <li> I recieved this less then a week and it is totally worth the money for the size you get. I know where to get more when I run out :)</li>
            <li> Came in a box and it smells awesome</li>
            <li> I wish I would have been able to smell this before I bought it! It smells horrible! I don&#x27;t know if I got a knock off or some different perfume in this bottle but it smells like something a grama would wear. I would not recommend this nor will I purchase this again</li>
            <li> This bottle was so much bigger than I expected and the price was unbeatable.  I get so many compliments from the pleasing smell.  Many strong smells give me instant headaches but this scent does not affect me! i just love it.</li>
            <li> Scent wears off too fast.</li>
            <li> this perfume is very strong!! it smells ok, but not like it did in the magazine i first saw it in. i was dissapointed with it, it has a very intense rose scent that is a little over powering. but my boyfriend loves it so i wear it anyway.</li>
            <li> Lovely perfume.Can&#x27;t get enough of it.However the perfume box was crumpled,luckily there were no damages to the bottle.Please ensure proper packaging.</li>
            <li> This is the best perfume I have ever used! Also the period of my life when I did use it was really good, two guys were in love with me at the same time. And both absolutely loved my scent!~ this perfume is the ultimate feminine perfume I think</li>
            <li> I had this perfume a long time ago and have been trying to purchase it again for while now! So glad I found it here on Amazon! The smell was just as I&#x27;d remembered! Beautiful. And the bottle was a lot bigger than expected!</li>
            <li> i purchased this for my niece for a gift....she opened it and loved it...and after she sprayed it on, i loved it as well....smells really great</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume and get a lot of compliments.  It is hard to find where I live, so glad I have the internet.</li>
            <li> This has been a scent I have enjoyed since I first tried a sample yeas ago.  My fiance likes my perfume to be subtle and I certainly don&#x27;t want to stink because I have doused myself.  I like that I can spritz Intimately Beckham a few times on my neck, hair, and body and I&#x27;m good to go.  I receive compliments from friends, co-workers, and complete strangers on how nice I smell and I can always find IB on Amazon for my cheaper than any department store.  Soft, sensual, and sexy... such a great combination when you want to smell good for yourself or your man!!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and lasts all day!!  So cheap it&#x27;s a great perfume for work, something you can use daily and not break the bank!!</li>
            <li> The scent does not last very long. Which means you end up using more. Definitely will NOT purchase again. At least not through this retailer.</li>
            <li> amazing amazing amazing</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 years ago on sale at Kmart. It&#x27;s a wonderful perfume and very elegant. Don&#x27;t put on too much because it can be over powering. Great for day or night.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent. I have been wearing it since &#x27;08! It&#x27;s fresh clean scent makes it perfect for all day wear.</li>
            <li> Received it in 4 days, new bottle. Smells great!! I will order from here again!</li>
            <li> My fragrance order was all that I&#x27;d hoped it to be. Intimately Beckham fragrance became a favorite scent from my first sniff but is no longer available locally. I was elated to find it at Amazon.com. And at an affordable price! The product arrived well-[[ASIN:B000WZSWZ8 Intimately Beckham By Beckham For Women Eau De Toilette Spray, 2.5-Ounces]]packaged, in a timely fashion. Now I cannot wait to place another order.</li>
            <li> This perfume is so light and lovely. I feel pretty everytime I wear it. I spray it into my closet so I&#x27;m. Sure to have it near me every day. Just love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.  I receive many compliments on this fragrance - it is very nice.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores but found it on Amazon.  I was very happy and ordered two of them.</li>
            <li> smells good didnt last long ..</li>
            <li> I received the product timely so all was good there. The next day I opened up after I showered and put some on, it smelled great as usual, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t even last 30 min.!! I sprayed more ten minutes later smelled nothing so I reapplied AGAIN for a third time and asked a friend (without telling them) If they liked my perfume (let them smell my wrist were I had applied) and they also smelled nothing.I Hate giving bad feedback but it&#x27;s crummy paying for something and it not being any use. I have used this scent before and it really lasts so not sure I got the real deal. Will not purchase again</li>
            <li> Ordered the product--love the perfume so happy that I was able to get it with out paying full price at the store.  I will definitely use this site again for my purchases.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> My very, very favorite frangrance of all time!  So happy to have found it again. Could not find at department stores anymore.  I thought it had been discontinued, but to my delight, I found it here.  So happy!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume brand, but I just received the one I ordered today and it smelt like alcohol. They sent me a old perfume, and refuse to let me return it. I guess buying perfume online isn&#x27;t the best way to go because you don&#x27;t know if it is fresh and still has it&#x27;s nice smell.</li>
            <li> I chose this because i like this product and because it was a great price! I would recommend this to anyone interested in this product!</li>
            <li> Ohoooo! I love the smell. I love victoria beckham! Hahaha.&lt;br /&gt;But the smell is mild and nice. Will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Love this scent. I paid 80 at khols 5 yrs ago and thought it was a good value today for this price. Comparative to my calvin Klein beauty which was expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this perfume many times and I love it. I&#x27;ve received so many compliments since I began wearing it a few years ago. It has a warm sensual smell instead of bright florals. It&#x27;s perfect and I wear it every day</li>
            <li> While the scent didn&#x27;t work for me, my mom LOVED it!</li>
            <li> 5 STARS ALL THE WAY!! I was expecting a smaller bottle. I was happy when it arrived. The bottle is very beautiful and classy. It&#x27;s a very high quality bottle as well. It&#x27;s not too heavy but, it has a bit a weight to it. OMWOW! The fragrance is simply gorgeous. It&#x27;s sexy and elegant. I feel pretty when I&#x27;m wearing it and I wear it often. My husband simply loves the way it smells on me. A little last a long time. I&#x27;ve purchased a few new perfumes lately. This is most definitely my NEW FAVORITE!!</li>
            <li> one of my favorite fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;cheap (so probably using cheap fragrance...but smell so good)</li>
            <li> Picked this up on sale one day and was using it as a room freshener for a long time. I didn&#x27;t start actually wearing it until I was running low on my Victoria&#x27;s Secret sprays. My boyfriend instantly complimented it, and a few days later his brother did too. The few more times I used it before it ran out, I would instantly get compliments on the scent from guys around me. That NEVER happens with my beloved Victoria&#x27;s Secret sprays!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m ordering again because this is such a fantastic price. Get it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> This seems to be diluted?  I have had this perfume in the past and this bottle has very little smell.</li>
            <li> i did recv this item, finally but was not 2.5 oz it was a smaller size but seeing how it took me so long to get it the first time i just figured it wasnt worth complaining about</li>
            <li> I love this scent &amp; so happy to find it! It&#x27;s like my signature smell and I&#x27;m so happy :-)</li>
            <li> My Niece Loves this scent, this is the Second Purchase of this for me, and it is nice to know where to find it!</li>
            <li> This was a gift and I think my daughter likes it.  She is using it and I like the smell of the cologne.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It is the best. This was a great value. As far as the smell I think it would be great on anyone. I get compliments the smell all the time. Always hearing &amp;#34;You smell lovely!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is very soft and very light, but not to be confused with weak. It lasts a good day at work or shopping. In the late afternoon, I feel the need to spritz a little more on but I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. It is powdery but not to the point of old lady. It has very little to no &amp;#34;spice&amp;#34; to it but that&#x27;s fine with me. I like a scent that it airy and casual. This is a fragrance that I would let a young girl wear but in no way smells juvenile. I would call it youthful and versatile. I am so happy to have found this. I will keep a bottle of this on my dresser.</li>
            <li> Yes, I was surprised.  Our Video Game Studio recently did a casual game about Perfume.  I had the pleasure of educating myself with invitation to a famous perfumer in San Francisco.  Yosh was a gracious host and very informative of just how complex perfumes can be.  Needless to say, as secretive as this industry is, we learned enough to make the game and I learned about what perfume makes me \\&quot;feel\\&quot;, and how it can make me \\&quot;feel\\&quot; ....  Truly surprised as I gathered many scents (and I mean many) for our Game&#x27;s release at Casual Connect in Seattle this year, I came upon this one, \\&quot;Intimately Beckham\\&quot; in a not so anything wonderful packet, as it was a sample.  Upon smelling it, I looked through the 150 + samples for more of them instantly.  The scent caught my attention so much so that I actually put some on which is not something I would normally do.  I am very particular on the scents I wear as they also have to meet with the approval of my horses and animals.  Believe it or not. Also scents that are not too strong for public use and not just bedroom fun. I knew this one would work, as it has a light flowery scent, not overwhelming hit-you-in-the-face strong but that is .... \\&quot;attractive\\&quot; for lack of a better word. It makes me feel attractive and compliments my finish out-the-door. It fits well within my long hair and the scent lingers nicely and is just super smooth. Very few scents generate open compliments, this one does. It may not work for everyone but works well for me being a \\&quot;Winter\\&quot; (which seems to work even for my daughter who is a blonde winter too.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on much more expensive perfumes.  The price surprised me when I looked for the perfume.  Do not let the affordable price fool you or reflect on this perfumes fabulous scent.  It equals some of the best.  It is worth a try, and makes for a lovely gift.  Enjoy.</li>
            <li> I could not believe the price of one of favorite scents. It is intimate, sensous, and feminine, without being over powering.</li>
            <li> i bought it for my girlfriend,she likes it.</li>
            <li> My mom liked it a lot! She likes white-floral scent!</li>
            <li> Beautiful, feminine fragrance but only lasts an hour or two.  Obviously not enough oil in the mix.</li>
            <li> The price and scent of this perfume is great.  I certainly be ordering more in the future. I get plenty of complements when I wear it.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find in retail stores.  But Amazon came through once again.&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance is  a light floral scent.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> t has a beautiful odor, however first try one pump of it, some thing that it was to strong. I will wear less of it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The smell is soft &amp; sweet.  I&#x27;ve had many compliments.  Thank You</li>
            <li> I love it!!!  I looked for it in many, many store and could not find it. So, I love that I could stop wasting gas driving all over looking for it.</li>
            <li> I have been in love with this perfume,  since day I smelled it, it is soft, feminine and sensual.. I recommend and my hubby does too!!</li>
            <li> Awesome price for bottle</li>
            <li> great perfume happy with the purchase. fragrance soft long lasting.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes, the scent is fresh and clean and not too heavy, and it lasts all day.  It also comes in a beautiful bottle that i don&#x27;t mind keeping on my counter.</li>
            <li> My wife just got her perfume and she loves it as for me she smells great at a good price and shipping was right on time</li>
            <li> Great price for item that u can&#x27;t find in many stores!</li>
            <li> Wife liked the smell and I loved the price.</li>
            <li> Love this scent and great price.</li>
            <li> I love this parfume so much. I have been wearing it for 3years. I bought during xmas one year. It was on sell for dirt cheap. When I smelled this parfume for the first time, I could not believe how nice the aroma was. My honey loves it. For some reason I cant find it at any retail stores anymore, Thank goodness for amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of perfume. I do have another Beckham perfume but this one is my favorite. The price is amazing also. i will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Great soft scent. I always get compliments but I love wearing this just for me too. Lingers nicely.</li>
            <li> Perfect guft for daughter</li>
            <li> The moment I sprayed my band new Intimately Beckham eau de toilette spray it got the desired effect from everyone around.  It is an absolute head turner.  I love the soft yet powerful scent. I bought my first bottle in the UK and as it was coming to an end I searched and happily found it on Amazon.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> At the time I bought this, there were several reviews praising this perfume. I decided to give it a try. I am not impressed with the bottle, it is very cheap feeling and hard to get open. The scent smells a lot like alcohol with a soft floral scent to it. If you spray it on yourself, it fades within an hour. I do not think the scent is anything special. I have tried to give it to my friends and family but nobody wants it. I personally would not buy it just because it does not last. Think you can finds something else.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent. It lasts forever and it just makes my day when I spray it on. This was an anniversary gift from my husband.</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly. Received many compliments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always purchased Intimately Beckham and loved the smell, it has become difficult to find and Amazon has it. A great buy !!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good. Sort of smells a bit musky on me, which is not my favorite scent but it&#x27;s not offensive and I still enjoy it. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> my mom iove perfume i love to perfume</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume! I love the way it smells the longer it stays on through out the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very florally and musky. s actually very nice, feminine, fresh, clean yet sexy smelling and it lasts forever on me,</li>
            <li> This perfume has become my signature scent. It makes me feel pretty and sensual and at 55 yrs old, I use all that I can get!!!! I was concerned it was only for a Season-I was very happy to have found it again.</li>
            <li> Intimately Beckham is the best perfume that I have ever used. I constantly receive compliments about how good it smells. Subtle yet lasts. You won&#x27;t be sorry with this perfume.</li>
            <li> I like this smell, however it does have this undertone of musk/woodsy/brut that I do not like. I love floral scents, and this is one, but with that under tone it just sets me off sometimes!!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this perfume. It doesn&#x60;t smell great only, it lasts incredibly long on you!! Will definitely buy another one when I run out...</li>
            <li> Have been a fan of this perfume since it first came out. Always get compliments on it. It&#x27;s a subtle, very feminine smell. Will continue to buy it as long as they continue to sell it!</li>
            <li> Nice simple clean scent.  I bought this on a whim on clearance and fell in love with it. I have been using it for the last 2 years and I continuously  get compliments</li>
            <li> Long lasting; nice sweet, soft, floral smelling fragrance.</li>
            <li> not much staying power.  Wears off way too quickly.  I would buy again if it wore better.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother for a christmas gift, I was very reasonable priced and I got more for my money then I would have got at the department stores.</li>
            <li> Came right on time and smells amazing! this is the only place i could find it. Met all of my expectations.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes ever!! It has such a sweet scent that lasts for hours. I get a lot of compliments on it!</li>
            <li> Love this Product--It is a soft scent that every women would love! Used it for years, then it became hard to find in retail.Thank you Amazon.com for carrying it.I always get complements because it is so soft and sensual!</li>
            <li> the eau de toilette is flat, the scent remains the exact same all throughout, yes it reminds you of Pure Poison on the opening notes but it doesn&#x27;t go anywhere. I&#x27;m keeping it as a deodorant. Sort of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> A fragrance that is not as durable, but with a very nice and gentle fragrance to wear on the day.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and it was an absolute money saver. Smaller bottles of this are sold at dept or drug stores for 30 bux. This is a bigger bottle for a lil less money.</li>
            <li> I got this perfume for my mother for Christmas. We were looking for it everywhere! And couldn&#x27;t find it in anywhere. So low and behold came on here and there it was! It was such a great price and was awesome to give to my mother when she thought she would never get it again.</li>
            <li> On my quest to look up good and affordable Christmas gifts I came across this perfume...I had actually never seen, heard and much less smelled this perfume before prior to ordering it and just guided myself based on the reviews I read and considering there were WAAAAYYY better reviews than bad reviews and it&#x27;s less than $10 I figured, why not?&lt;br /&gt;I received it a day later than what was specified in Amazon... However aside from that, the perfume itself smells amazing, the scent is something flowery yet not too sweet or overbearing, I got it last night 12/4/14 and tried it on one of my sleeves from a cardigan I was wearing, sprayed it only once and the smell 10:42am today the scent of this perfume is still there. Overall, you just can&#x27;t go wrong with this perfume especially for a little less than $10.</li>
            <li> I gave it away.  I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I got so lucky finding this perfume.  It was on sale at Target when I first discovered it and decided to give it a shot.  $9 was the cost so I figured what did I have to lose.&lt;br /&gt;This perfume is amazing!  I have gotten so many compliments from men and women on the scent and how nice it is.  My friend even started wearing it and her  boyfriend loved it!&lt;br /&gt;It may not work for everyone but I am so glad it worked for me!</li>
            <li> I love this scent....it is so awesome :) I was so shocked considering how amazing the price was...great buy!!! Thanks</li>
            <li> I love the price and the cologne is nice too.</li>
            <li> I love the heavenly scent of Intimately Beckham for women. It&#x27;s not a heavy, over powering strong or overly sweet scent like so many colognes that are now on the market. It&#x27;s a very subtle, light scent that I can wear to the office or wherever I go. I get many compliments on my favorite cologne, Intimately Beckham.</li>
            <li> I love this scent because it is unique, and feminine but still smells like a WOMAN not a teens perfume.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. I was a little hesitant to order this over the internet since I have not smelled it before. I have only worn two other scents-a French scent and Light Blue. It&#x27;s light, feminine, and floral, and I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. I always get so many compliments whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle for myself last year and spent $60 and I love it!  Now I am buying for a fraction of that here for my Mom for Christmas!  We don&#x27;t live in the same town so it will not matter for this fragrance truly blends in to your chemistry and leaves a clean sultry smell.  I truly is a wonderful fragrance.  I am excited to see the price so low!  It you like a elegant aroma w/o paying for it, this is a great buy!</li>
            <li> I had never had this perfume before. I bought it not knowing if I would like it but I love it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It smells like a bouquet of flowers when you first apply it. I like it more when it dies down because its a little strong at first. First base lasts around 30 minutes and the second layer of the scent is the part that I like its more soft and gentle, it smells very casual. This fragrance is more of a spring/early summer scent (daytime scent). My mom loves this perfume she said it smells lovely and it smells like it would be worn for women also. Like I said very casual and also pretty. The only thing that I disliked was the bottle and how the sticker is. Its a huge bottle (2.5 OZ) and its a tiny sticker on a bulky glass bottle. I took mine off. Its worth the 15 bucks. (My seller was: FragranceNet)</li>
            <li> I bought this scent because of the great reviews on amazon and boy it did not disappoint. This perfume smells great, you can smell  hints of rose, orange blossom, vanilla and lily. The scent is very femine and more on the sweet side and it do last all day. I have gotten so many compliments every time  I wear this scent, people would ask me, what perfume are you wearing. It is suitable for all ages, try it you might like it and the price is very reasonable. I am giving these as gifts for christmas.</li>
            <li> I could not beleive the price on this item, it was great and one of my favorite Toilette Spray. It smells so good and it got to my house in one piece it was well packaged.  Thank you</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this perfume! People ask me what I&#x27;m wearing all the time. I did order Beckham Signature for women &amp; was uber disappointed but the men&#x27;s beckham colognes smell great too.</li>
            <li> Ordered this because VS stopped making Pink, which I dearly love. I was hoping this would smell similar but it doesn&#x27;t. It smells awesome though and reminds me of another perfume but I can&#x27;t recall exactly what it smells like. If anybody knows what it&#x27;s similar to, please tell me because it&#x27;s driving me crazy trying to remember! LOL</li>
            <li> Received packaged just fine, received when expected to. Those are positive 5star for seller.&lt;br /&gt;The 3 stars is because I didn&#x27;t care for this particular perfume on my skin. I gave it to a friend who would give the smell a 5 star.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s my favorite and Thank you</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume! Great price for the size, I have not been able find it anywhere else. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Always loved it , always will. This is my second bottle and would never change a single thing about it !</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes so was really glad to find it online since they no longer sell it anywhere that I can find!</li>
            <li> This is actual Beckham! I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for several years, but stores in my area stopped carrying it. There was one store that brought it back for a spell, but was charging a ridiculous amount for it (I won&#x27;t say who.... Let&#x27;s just call it Rite Aid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feeling blue, and just not smelling like myself, I ordered some Intimately from somewhere else. IT. WASN&#x27;T. BECKHAM. I was very pissed, but it would have cost me more to return it than I paid (guess I should have read the fine print?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate, I took a chance and ordered myself three bottles from Amazon, as I am well aware of their great return policy. To my delight, I received three GIANT bottles of &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; scent for a mere percentage of what I would have paid at the only store in my area (again, not gonna name names, Rite Aid) that was carrying the smaller bottles. How happy am I?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s feminine without being all flowery, or worse, powdery. (ick!) It&#x27;s crisp and fresh, and I&#x27;m so pleased that a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s taken me almost 2 years to get through the first bottle (I still have some left!), and I wear it every day. One or two good spritz lasts all day. It&#x27;s there yet subtle; you won&#x27;t smell like a floral shop on crack.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my mother for Christmas. It was exactly what she wanted and the price was excellent. Hard item to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This scent is perfect for day or night. I get a ton of compliments  from both men and women at work or in a social environment. It&#x27;s makes you feel pretty and complete after you get ready and head out to your busy day. Robyn</li>
            <li> I get the most compliments with this perfume! And it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> This scent is sophisticated, elegant and soothing. It is so fresh with a yummy more up to date spin on a floral scent! &amp;#34;PERFECT&amp;#34; &amp; I Love it!!! Only negative I wish it have more staying power.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom as its her favorite scent. I couldn&#x27;t believe I got this perfume for such a great price! It came brand new and it smells awesome.</li>
            <li> First found this at TJMAX and tried it on a whim.  OMG, I got so many compliments on the scent and it last so long.  I found on amazon and it was very afordable.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> This perfume is just as fabulous as everybody says it is. Did not disappoint. As a matter of fact I now wear it more than everything else I had :) The smell is just easy on the nose and will suit most preferences.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Love it. Would buy again. Great deal.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this!!!! One of my favorite &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; perfume is Red Door.  This almost smells exactly like red door. I am in love with this!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter as a present for christmas. She has use this and likes the prefers this over several other brands. I myself like the fragrence and always knows when my daughter is wearing it.</li>
            <li> I love this smell and so does everyone else that I encounter. They always tell me I smell good. It&#x27;s a very light fragrance that last all day</li>
            <li> My body chemistry doesn&#x27;t mix well with heavy, musky scents so this one is really good for me.  I just wish that it was a bit stronger and longer lasting.</li>
            <li> If I was to go into a lab and was able to create my own signature fragrance this would be it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried this before, once I received it I fell in love the scent. It&#x27;s a fresh floral, fruity everyday wear that I will use for some time to come.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells delicious! It&#x27;s deep, flowery, and musky, and not fruity and sweet. I find myself gravitating towards it more than any other in my collection lately.</li>
            <li> I love thus fragrance . I was told I smell like a million bucks ...</li>
            <li> PRICE IS GREAT, SMELLS GREAT, BUT LASTS ABOUT 5 MINUTES...DONT THINK I WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN.S</li>
            <li> lovely smell very nice just right mix of musk &amp; floral</li>
            <li> Very nice perfume and you get a large quantity for the price. The smell is really fragrant and enjoyed by all.</li>
            <li> I really love this fragrance and purchased it twice now.  It&#x27;s not too strong, but yet it lightly lingers on your body.</li>
