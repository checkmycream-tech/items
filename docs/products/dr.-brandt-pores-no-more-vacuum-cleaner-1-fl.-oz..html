            <li>I got a sample in my Ipsy bag,  and I was very impressed.  </li>

            <li>which is, in my opinion, the best time to use a product like this.</li>
            <li>This product works very good to cleanse your face and pores.  </li>
            <li>Good buy!</li>
            <li>am rating it a 5 because it&#x27;s a great mask;  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very effective for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best, most effective spot treatment I&#x27;ve ever used, and doesn&#x27;t fry my skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even say the moisturizer is good.</li>
            <li>With my nose blackheads after the reduction, is also good, will often use, hoping to improve my situation blackheads and pores</li>
            <li>I got a trial size tube for free and have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Smells good and feel refreshed after use.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product based on good reviews and recommendation.</li>
            <li>I use it as an overnight spot treatment on all my blemishes, and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice mask.  </li>
            <li>After applying the product to my problem area, and letting it sit for the recommended amount of time (and sometimes more), I start by rinsing my face with warm water.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this item in a Birchbox a while back, and was thoroughly impressed with how easy and how effective it was at clearing my face.</li>
            <li>I used for 2 weeks as directed and it never got any better.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t use this more than twice a week because your nose will start peeling.</li>
            <li>I received this as a sample in my Birch Box and fell in love.</li>
            <li>There are better, less-expensive options.</li>
            <li>but no one ever thought my face looked any better except me.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved it so much that I had to buy the full size product.</li>
            <li>I have a problem with large pores and blackheads and this really has led to great results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend getting a sample of these pricey items for free before you shell out $40-100 on something that doesn&#x27;t work for you-</li>
            <li>you let it sit on your face for the proper amount of time, it does a great job pulling the gunk</li>
            <li>I saw good reviews on Dr. Brandt&#x27;s vacuum cleaner in one of my favorite magazines</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product but make sure you cleanse your face before applying for better results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because this product worked so well, I got excited and tried the Pores</li>
            <li>This product has made a significant impact on the size and look of my pores, and I can literally see it working when I&#x27;m using it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sometimes, I use it at bedtime on the areas of my face that need special attention.  </li>
            <li>I saw good reviews on Dr. Brandt products and since I&#x27;m almost 40 and want to improve appearance of pores and overall skin appearance</li>
            <li>get the larger tube if there is one because it&#x27;s that good</li>
            <li>I absolutely fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li>my nose is smooth and clear of clogs. :)</li>
            <li>After I rinsed it,  my face felt incredibly clean,  smooth,  and balanced (not dry,  not oily) and I feel like my moisturizer absorbed way better,  too.</li>
            <li>This product is very good and helps me in keeping my pores clean especially for being an &amp;#34;over-the-counter&amp;#34; facial products.  </li>
            <li>AND I had much fewer blackheads!!</li>
            <li>normally use a weekly clay mask to keep my skin feeling good, but my pores always stayed the same.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The mask doesn&#x27;t have too much of a smell and the cooling sensation is pleasant but not intense.</li>
            <li>I have tried a number of things, but this is the first product that has removed them consistently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a full time student the rest of the year and normally don&#x27;t wear make up, so</li>
            <li>The product pulls the gunk to the surface, but isn&#x27;t always strong enough to remove them entirely, which is why the extractor tool helps make the cleansing process more thorough.</li>
            <li>My pores were becoming noticeable especially in the t-zone part of my forehead when I purchased this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, this was good for blackheads, but not sure if it shrinks pores.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would strongly recommend you to take your fifty dollars and run.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think anything will work on naturally large pores.</li>
            <li>For anybody interested in this product, I would highly recommend queen helen clay mask, i think it&#x27;s called pore refining mask.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice much results</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t really like it</li>
            <li>Before, I would use a product I thought worked really well</li>
            <li>I decided to buy the full version, and I still have no regrets about it.</li>
            <li>: I requested a sample of the Vacuum from Sephora, and used the product as instructed (apply to clean face, wait 4-5 minutes).</li>
            <li>Because of its value, I will definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>Although this product is for blackheads, etc., which the vacuum cleared up also, I mostly benefited from the overall \\&quot;unified\\</li>
            <li>I normally use an extractor tool and /or</li>
            <li>, it makes my skin super dry.  </li>
            <li>This is amazing and within two uses I saw smaller black heads!</li>
            <li>I used the vacuum for about 1-2 weeks on a consistent basis as part of my p.m. regimen-</li>
            <li>My nose is so clear.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re natural like me, don&#x27;t bother - unless you got blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I used it twice a week, as directed, for several weeks, but didn&#x27;t really notice any visible changes to my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was born with large pores, and they aren&#x27;t oily rather they&#x27;re quite dry.</li>
            <li>my black heads are right where they&#x27; ve always been</li>
            <li>No difference in my pores OR my face in general.</li>
            <li>After about 1 month of using this I was surprised to see that my pores became significantly smaller</li>
            <li>Then, I pat dry, and apply my normal moisturizers and serums.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also note that I used the Dr. Brandt moisturizer at first (also a sample), to see how the products worked together, but, ironically, it dried out my skin</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s about $5, maybe less... and does a better job than Dr. Brandt pores no more vacuum.</li>
            <li>used this mask only on my nose right after washing my face (as per directions) and left it on for ~3 minutes until it dried and turned white.</li>
            <li>Before this, the only product that barely helped reduce my blackheads was the Biore ULTRA deep cleansing strips (</li>
            <li>At first, I thought the product was a waste of money because all it did was bring the blackheads to the surface; however, I later realized that if you scrub your nose with a damp cloth after washing off the cream, it removes most/all of the blackheads.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I started using an extractor tool after using the product, and I found that a TON of blackheads and buildup came out far easier than with any other method I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> No More Vacuum Cleaner to see if my larger pores would really shrink.  </li>
            <li> Pores look the same if not worse :/</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember, I&#x27;ve had dozens of tiny blackheads and clogged pores on my nose - this banishes them.</li>
            <li> I used it every other day for two weeks and that when I saw major results.</li>
            <li> However, this might irritates skin a little so not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After rinsing I used my usual Perricone MD high potency evening repair.</li>
            <li> It comes out of the tube as a gel and dries down to a chalky white color on my skin.  </li>
            <li> They did make my pores slightly smaller though, which doesn&#x27;t mean much to me because dirt is still trapped inside.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so the tube last a while.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well on bigger issues like the beginning stages of a pimpl3, but works well on the black needle point marks.</li>
            <li> The result of removing black heads was tighter pores; however, it didn&#x27;t make the pores on my cheeks - which don&#x27;t have blackheads - smaller.</li>
            <li> This actually worked on my blackheads, which I have quite a few on my nose.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice result until the last few days, but I&#x27;ve been using it 3 times per week for a month.</li>
            <li> like to use this product in the evening before I go to bed, because I do see an increase in pore size for an hour or two after using the product and I also believe it would NOT be beneficial to apply heavy makeups with pores so open and exposed.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while for pores to relax and shrink back down, but once they do, the results are no joke.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> No More Vacuum Cleaner would make them vanish, but it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband has been using the pores no more vacuum cleaner for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> No More VACUUM CLEANER (2x/week) and Pores No More cleanser (every other day) for about a month, but</li>
            <li> The formula made the black heads softer, which also made it easier to remove them by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone, a lot of money to mess up your face.</li>
            <li> Unlike other masks, you apply only a thin layer and you don&#x27;t get that tight, face-about-to-crack feeling.</li>
            <li> Used approximately 3 times already and see a big difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this is the third tube I have ordered, so needless to say I recommend it.</li>
            <li> No More Pore Refiner this summer</li>
            <li> No More Pore Refiner with makeup to cover my blackheads because I had a summer job</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and it&#x27;s less painful and messy then the Biore strips, which usually leave a sticky residue on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I have problem pores on my nose that are nearly impossible to keep clear.</li>
            <li> If I look in the mirror, I usually see an enlargement in my pores, and little creepy bumps on my nose.</li>
            <li> I was actually very shocked because I wasn&#x27;t really expecting anything from</li>
            <li> I have terrible black heads on my nose and they were nearly gone after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I can tell somewhat of  a difference immediately after use, but not a great deal of difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> sadly those did not remove my blackheads.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> He is very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My husband has been using the pores no more vacuum cleaner for a few weeks. I saw good reviews on Dr. Brandt&#x27;s vacuum cleaner in one of my favorite magazines &amp; I thought he should try it. There has been no change &amp; the blackheads still remain. He is very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Pores look the same if not worse :/</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much results</li>
            <li> My pores were becoming noticeable especially in the t-zone part of my forehead when I purchased this product.  After using, my pores enlarged (especially around my nose) and have stayed that way!  I used for 2 weeks as directed and it never got any better.  I didn&#x27;t find it any easier to remove the \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; from my pores after using.  I would not recommend this product to anyone, a lot of money to mess up your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately 3 weeks. I saw good reviews on Dr. Brandt products and since I&#x27;m almost 40 and want to improve appearance of pores and overall skin appearance, I thought I&#x27;d try it. But I&#x27;m highly disappointed. I purchased all of the products that were recommended for the age and pore refining. I can&#x27;t even say the moisturizer is good. For anybody interested in this product, I would highly recommend queen helen clay mask, i think it&#x27;s called pore refining mask. it&#x27;s about $5, maybe less... and does a better job than Dr. Brandt pores no more vacuum. What a rip off this was.</li>
            <li> Too pricey for what this mask is delivering, which is nothing, a bit of cooling feeling when I have it on and my black heads are right where they&#x27; ve always been</li>
            <li> I have had a problem with blackheads forming on my nose for years now. I have tried a number of things, but this is the first product that has removed them consistently. At first, I thought the product was a waste of money because all it did was bring the blackheads to the surface; however, I later realized that if you scrub your nose with a damp cloth after washing off the cream, it removes most/all of the blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is the third tube I have ordered, so needless to say I recommend it.</li>
            <li> With my nose blackheads after the reduction, is also good, will often use, hoping to improve my situation blackheads and pores</li>
            <li> I uses before i recommended</li>
            <li> I got a trial size tube for free and have been very happy with it. For as long as I can remember, I&#x27;ve had dozens of tiny blackheads and clogged pores on my nose - this banishes them. A little bit goes a long way, and it&#x27;s less painful and messy then the Biore strips, which usually leave a sticky residue on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just used it not ten minutes ago...my nose is smooth and clear of clogs. :)</li>
            <li> excellent product. does what it says. a little goes a long way. get the larger tube if there is one because it&#x27;s that good</li>
            <li> Does not produce the results I was expecting. I can tell somewhat of  a difference immediately after use, but not a great deal of difference in my skin. I will use it until it is gone but probably won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to the Pores No More Pore Refiner this summer when I was experimenting with ways to cover the blackheads on my nose. After about 1 month of using this I was surprised to see that my pores became significantly smaller AND I had much fewer blackheads!! Before this, the only product that barely helped reduce my blackheads was the Biore ULTRA deep cleansing strips (regular Biore strips do nothing on me).&lt;br /&gt;I used the Pores No More Pore Refiner with makeup to cover my blackheads because I had a summer job. I&#x27;m a full time student the rest of the year and normally don&#x27;t wear make up, so when I stopped using the Pore Refiner I saw that my blackheads and pores reappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this product worked so well, I got excited and tried the Pores No More VACUUM CLEANER (2x/week) and Pores No More cleanser (every other day) for about a month, but sadly those did not remove my blackheads. They did make my pores slightly smaller though, which doesn&#x27;t mean much to me because dirt is still trapped inside.</li>
            <li> I got a sample in my Ipsy bag,  and I was very impressed.  I normally use an extractor tool and /or my fingers (i know,  I know) to remove blackheads,  but this did a great job for a mask option! After I rinsed it,  my face felt incredibly clean,  smooth,  and balanced (not dry,  not oily) and I feel like my moisturizer absorbed way better,  too. I prefer it to the natural clay masks as well as the glam glow  (which is a complete waste of money,  in case you were considering it).&lt;br /&gt;I am rating it a 5 because it&#x27;s a great mask;  however,  I doubt I&#x27;ll purchase it because the price tag is out of my budget. Bummer.</li>
            <li> Received this in my ipsy monthly package. Used approximately 3 times already and see a big difference. Doesn&#x27;t work as well on bigger issues like the beginning stages of a pimpl3, but works well on the black needle point marks.</li>
            <li> This is amazing and within two uses I saw smaller black heads! I have terrible black heads on my nose and they were nearly gone after a couple of weeks. I highly recommend this product but make sure you cleanse your face before applying for better results. You don&#x27;t want to try and get rid of blackheads if you haven&#x27;t cleaned the layer of dirt off your face. I will be using for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> I got this in a beauty bag. I use it as an overnight spot treatment on all my blemishes, and it works amazingly. It&#x27;s the best, most effective spot treatment I&#x27;ve ever used, and doesn&#x27;t fry my skin.</li>
            <li> Vacuums every pore on your face so, bye bye blackheads! I absolutely fell in love with this product. Good buy!</li>
            <li> This product really works. I use this on my nose after I come out of the shower. Make sure you don&#x27;t use this more than twice a week because your nose will start peeling.</li>
            <li> This product is very good and helps me in keeping my pores clean especially for being an &amp;#34;over-the-counter&amp;#34; facial products.  Sometimes, I use it at bedtime on the areas of my face that need special attention.  Because of its value, I will definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample. I don&#x27;t have a big problem with blackheads, but I do tend to get them on my nose occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;I used this mask only on my nose right after washing my face (as per directions) and left it on for ~3 minutes until it dried and turned white. Unlike other masks, you apply only a thin layer and you don&#x27;t get that tight, face-about-to-crack feeling. After washing it off, I noticed an immediate difference in my skin. Any sign of blackheads was gone! I will definitely use this again and I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;The mask doesn&#x27;t have too much of a smell and the cooling sensation is pleasant but not intense.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product in my June Ipsy Glambag. I absolutely loved it so much that I had to buy the full size product.</li>
            <li> This actually worked on my blackheads, which I have quite a few on my nose. The result of removing black heads was tighter pores; however, it didn&#x27;t make the pores on my cheeks - which don&#x27;t have blackheads - smaller. The formula made the black heads softer, which also made it easier to remove them by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, this was good for blackheads, but not sure if it shrinks pores. I was born with large pores, and they aren&#x27;t oily rather they&#x27;re quite dry. I don&#x27;t think anything will work on naturally large pores. If you&#x27;re natural like me, don&#x27;t bother - unless you got blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice result until the last few days, but I&#x27;ve been using it 3 times per week for a month. My nose is so clear.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t really like it, it makes my skin super dry.  And i don&#x27;t think it works personally. thank you</li>
            <li> This product works very good to cleanse your face and pores.  Smells good and feel refreshed after use.  However, this might irritates skin a little so not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample in my Birch Box and fell in love. I have a problem with large pores and blackheads and this really has led to great results. It&#x27;s not a miracle mask. It doesn&#x27;t work in one use. I used it every other day for two weeks and that when I saw major results. My pores are so much smaller and it&#x27;s also evened out my skin tone. I now use it once or twice a week for maintenance. A little goes a long way so the tube last a while. I also have sensitive skin and I have not noticed any drying and I have been using this now for 6 months.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on good reviews and recommendation. I&#x27;ve used it for three weeks...nothing. No difference in my pores OR my face in general. You can actually feel your skin drying out as the product is on it- thats the &amp;#34;cooling sensation&amp;#34; the label describes. In fact, I noticed that there is alcohol in this product- which is a skin care no-no, no matter what skin type you have!! Overall, I would strongly recommend you to take your fifty dollars and run. There are better, less-expensive options.</li>
            <li> Overall, I have literally never used another product that made my skin so dramatically different. Before, I would use a product I thought worked really well but no one ever thought my face looked any better except me. Although this product is for blackheads, etc., which the vacuum cleared up also, I mostly benefited from the overall \\&quot;unified\\&quot; look of my skin after using the product. I was actually very shocked because I wasn&#x27;t really expecting anything from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Details: I requested a sample of the Vacuum from Sephora, and used the product as instructed (apply to clean face, wait 4-5 minutes). I used the vacuum for about 1-2 weeks on a consistent basis as part of my p.m. regimen- which is, in my opinion, the best time to use a product like this. After rinsing I used my usual Perricone MD high potency evening repair. Also note that I used the Dr. Brandt moisturizer at first (also a sample), to see how the products worked together, but, ironically, it dried out my skin so I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend getting a sample of these pricey items for free before you shell out $40-100 on something that doesn&#x27;t work for you- you&#x27;ve got nothing to lose!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this item in a Birchbox a while back, and was thoroughly impressed with how easy and how effective it was at clearing my face. I decided to buy the full version, and I still have no regrets about it. I have problem pores on my nose that are nearly impossible to keep clear. This product has made a significant impact on the size and look of my pores, and I can literally see it working when I&#x27;m using it!&lt;br /&gt;If you let it sit on your face for the proper amount of time, it does a great job pulling the gunk out.&lt;br /&gt;The thing about this product is that I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using it immediately before heading out, and I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using this product entirely on it&#x27;s own. After applying the product to my problem area, and letting it sit for the recommended amount of time (and sometimes more), I start by rinsing my face with warm water. If I look in the mirror, I usually see an enlargement in my pores, and little creepy bumps on my nose. The point of the product is to pull out the stuff that builds up in your pores, and that&#x27;s what those tiny bumps are! I started using an extractor tool after using the product, and I found that a TON of blackheads and buildup came out far easier than with any other method I&#x27;ve tried. The product pulls the gunk to the surface, but isn&#x27;t always strong enough to remove them entirely, which is why the extractor tool helps make the cleansing process more thorough. After extracting, I wash my face using some type of exfoliator. Again, this helps to remove any of the excess stuff that got pulled up, but not entirely removed. Then, I pat dry, and apply my normal moisturizers and serums.&lt;br /&gt;I like to use this product in the evening before I go to bed, because I do see an increase in pore size for an hour or two after using the product and I also believe it would NOT be beneficial to apply heavy makeups with pores so open and exposed. It takes a little while for pores to relax and shrink back down, but once they do, the results are no joke. My pores have shrunk to be a quarter of the size that they used to be, and some have all but vanished! I will continue to use this product, and I will definitely recommend it to anyone who asks!results are no joke.

            <li> I wanted to try the Pores No More Vacuum Cleaner to see if my larger pores would really shrink.  They didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use a weekly clay mask to keep my skin feeling good, but my pores always stayed the same.  I had hoped that the Pores No More Vacuum Cleaner would make them vanish, but it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice mask.  It comes out of the tube as a gel and dries down to a chalky white color on my skin.  It does make my skin feel tighter as it dries.  I used it twice a week, as directed, for several weeks, but didn&#x27;t really notice any visible changes to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the mask.  I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very effective for me.</li>
