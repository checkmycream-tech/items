            <li>I will say that there was a good variety in the set, but what does that matter if none standout?</li>
            <li>but it just didn&#x27;t feel like I got a good value.</li>
            <li>Smell good.</li>
            <li>The packaging is attractive, and suitable as a gift for a man or a woman.</li>
            <li>I love these soaps!</li>
            <li>I love this set!</li>
            <li>Some of them are better than others but they all smell good.  </li>
            <li>With the exception of the lavender that seems to hold its own scent, the others don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I feel as if they were wrapped they would retain their own scent.</li>
            <li>Really nice rustic soap set.</li>
            <li>I would have liked to buy them again</li>
            <li>I am so happy I bought these - they smell fantastic and leave my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to receive this soap for the first time.</li>
            <li>My hands are clean and smooth and my soul is happy  </li>
            <li>BUT it is more a 2.5 rating because the scents blend together.</li>
            <li>This is the best natural palm free soap i have tried (and trust me, there&#x27;s been lots of them...</li>
            <li>Kept a set for myself and love em</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of these packs for our home and as hostess and teacher gifts for the holiday season.</li>
            <li>Love these soaps.</li>
            <li>The soaps themselves are accurately described &amp;#34;sample size&amp;#34;, but there are so many of them</li>
            <li>The soap sampler came as expected and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>The scents are unique and soothing and can be appealing to anyone.</li>
            <li>Easy on the skin</li>
            <li>The scents and ingredient combos are unique and intentional; the packaging is cute, crafty, and hassle-free.  </li>
            <li>Each one of these soaps fit that bill.  </li>
            <li>They smelled super strong.</li>
            <li>If these soaps were separated by some paper and the top of the box labeled them correctly in chronological order, then maybe they would be more enjoyable.     </li>
            <li>And never seen this -- so environmentally friendly that even the box is constructed without glue.</li>
            <li>The reason being is it would be a 3 if my rating was just based on the soaps ability to lather, clean hands</li>
            <li>I love the sampler because I can not only get to try many of the different soaps offered by Craftsman Soap Co., but the size of the bars are great for travel or throwing in my gym bag.</li>
            <li>I felt like all the soaps were overpowered by one bar in there and every bar even though it was supposed to be its own unique scent all smelt the same.</li>
            <li>There are better natural alternatives, a number of them at cheaper prices, that I have used before.</li>
            <li>Good gift for guest visiting from other countries.</li>
            <li>It’s important to me that soap rinses clean off my children’s bodies, but does not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>Everything you&#x27;ve read is pretty spot on.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap!</li>
            <li>First, most of the soaps smell very similar.</li>
            <li>They seem like genuinely quality soaps, but the picture kind of tricked me into thinking they were like full bar sized when they are just a little bigger than hotel sized.</li>
            <li>The soaps got here pretty fast which is a good thing, however the soaps are very small, smaller than I expected, they smell great, but the scent only lasts a few minutes which is a big NO NO in my book, I love soaps and I always try to be fair when writing a review.</li>
            <li>I cannot say that I was very pleased with these soaps in comparison to other natural bars I have used or that I would suggest these to anyone else.</li>
            <li>I am really fussy about soap.</li>
            <li>I use this daily and it makes my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>The fact that the soaps are handmade from locally sourced natural and sustainable ingredients will keep me going back for more!</li>
            <li>The price for the sample set is high for soaps that don&#x27;t really standout when you use them.</li>
            <li>Many of these are heavy on the patchouli and &#x27;musk.&#x27;</li>
            <li>Some really great scents in this package, just wish it cost a little less for what you get.</li>
            <li>I normally get the Biggs and Feathebelle mini-soaps, because I like natural, good-smelling soaps</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy the bigger bars.</li>
            <li>Bought as Christmas gifts and found they smell extremely masculine.</li>
            <li>Natural</li>
            <li>So I went for these natural, good-smelling soaps to mix things up.</li>
            <li>Not terribly caustic, but just enough for it to be noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my hands feeling very well moisturized compared to commercial liquid/bar soaps.</li>
            <li>Today it was hot, windy, and I spent all day coating terra cotta pots with sealant, then rode my bike home.  </li>
            <li>All around no regrets with this one!</li>
            <li>Though there is a list of the soap types on the back of the box, the list doesn&#x27;t seem to be in any kind of order and it is hard to distinguish the soaps from each other.</li>
            <li>but they are cut very thin but for the money they were nice</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but they are cut very thin but for the money they were nice</li>
            <li> My hands were BLACK and disgusting and yet there was my new soap waiting to great me!  </li>
            <li> They are pretty small and don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I only have 2 minor complaints.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a bit caustic and irritated my, um... more delicate regions.</li>
            <li> Note to buyer these are tiny little samples.</li>
            <li> I expected the bars to be thicker...</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> have bought hand made soap a lot this is defiantly NOT worth the money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it less if I could</li>
            <li> Not full bath bars.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers have said, the bars of soap are sample sized (i.e., the size of a small bar of hotel soap).</li>
            <li> I work at a nursery/urban farm, and come home everyday to immediately pick-up a bar of soap and a scrub brush.  </li>
            <li> cool soaps, but very disappointed in size, the box of soap&#x27;S is about the size of a regular bar of soap.</li>
            <li> These are small hand soap bars.</li>
            <li> and I get bored with a single scent before the end of a full-size bar.</li>
            <li> I immediately pulled out Rough Stuff and Peppermint Lemon Pine to do the dirty work...</li>
            <li> Too expensive anyway.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one disappointment was the size.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These smell awesome. Some of them are better than others but they all smell good.  My husband and I both like the fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one disappointment was the size.  They are pretty small and don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I like this soap.  Easy on the skin but the individual bars only last about 2-3 shower time sessions.  Some really great scents in this package, just wish it cost a little less for what you get.</li>
            <li> I was debating between a 2-3 star review for this soap. The reason being is it would be a 3 if my rating was just based on the soaps ability to lather, clean hands etc BUT it is more a 2.5 rating because the scents blend together. With the exception of the lavender that seems to hold its own scent, the others don&#x27;t. If these soaps were separated by some paper and the top of the box labeled them correctly in chronological order, then maybe they would be more enjoyable.     I am really fussy about soap. I will use them up but I will not be purchasing them again. Too expensive anyway. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I felt like all the soaps were overpowered by one bar in there and every bar even though it was supposed to be its own unique scent all smelt the same. I feel as if they were wrapped they would retain their own scent.</li>
            <li> Very nice assortment.</li>
            <li> These are small hand soap bars. Not full bath bars. Still, good product!</li>
            <li> I am so happy I bought these - they smell fantastic and leave my skin feeling smooth. Even my bf who never notices this stuff commented on them. The soaps themselves are accurately described &amp;#34;sample size&amp;#34;, but there are so many of them and i can pick which to buy in regular size (Eucalyptus and Peppermint!). This is the best natural palm free soap i have tried (and trust me, there&#x27;s been lots of them...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this soap, it will make for a great gift to friends.</li>
            <li> these smell wonderful  but they are cut very thin but for the money they were nice</li>
            <li> I cannot say that I was very pleased with these soaps in comparison to other natural bars I have used or that I would suggest these to anyone else. The price for the sample set is high for soaps that don&#x27;t really standout when you use them. There are better natural alternatives, a number of them at cheaper prices, that I have used before. I will say that there was a good variety in the set, but what does that matter if none standout?</li>
            <li> The soaps got here pretty fast which is a good thing, however the soaps are very small, smaller than I expected, they smell great, but the scent only lasts a few minutes which is a big NO NO in my book, I love soaps and I always try to be fair when writing a review.</li>
            <li> Really nice rustic soap set. Smells so yummy, I have to restrain myself from taking a bite. And never seen this -- so environmentally friendly that even the box is constructed without glue.</li>
            <li> The soaps are great, very nice quality.  The package, however, is overpriced and/or undersized.  I would have liked to buy them again but it just didn&#x27;t feel like I got a good value.</li>
            <li> Bought as Christmas gifts and found they smell extremely masculine. Kept a set for myself and love em</li>
            <li> Good gift for guest visiting from other countries. I put a gift basket together with made in America products and was happy to find this.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to receive this soap for the first time. The packaging is attractive, and suitable as a gift for a man or a woman. The scents are unique and soothing and can be appealing to anyone. I love the sampler because I can not only get to try many of the different soaps offered by Craftsman Soap Co., but the size of the bars are great for travel or throwing in my gym bag. The fact that the soaps are handmade from locally sourced natural and sustainable ingredients will keep me going back for more!</li>
            <li> Overpriced. Everything you&#x27;ve read is pretty spot on. They seem like genuinely quality soaps, but the picture kind of tricked me into thinking they were like full bar sized when they are just a little bigger than hotel sized. I&#x27;ll have to see if I get any compliments from it, but I would&#x27;ve priced this thing at $8 or $9 max with the amount you get.</li>
            <li> Note to buyer these are tiny little samples. Smell good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it less if I could&lt;br /&gt;The soap almost all smells the same&lt;br /&gt;I have bought hand made soap a lot this is defiantly NOT worth the money</li>
            <li> They all smell the same</li>
            <li> I love these soaps! It’s important to me that soap rinses clean off my children’s bodies, but does not dry out my skin.  Each one of these soaps fit that bill.  The soaps have a creamy lather and the ones that have scent are heavenly, but not overpowering.  I will be purchasing more of these packs for our home and as hostess and teacher gifts for the holiday season.</li>
            <li> Love these soaps. Some are buttery, some are textured. They all smell great!</li>
            <li> I am always looking for made in USA products and this one ROCKS! feels great on the skin, smells wonderful too. Natural</li>
            <li> cool soaps, but very disappointed in size, the box of soap&#x27;S is about the size of a regular bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I normally get the Biggs and Feathebelle mini-soaps, because I like natural, good-smelling soaps and I get bored with a single scent before the end of a full-size bar. So I went for these natural, good-smelling soaps to mix things up. Mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) They&#x27;re smaller than the Biggs and Featherbelle minis, which I actually like about them, but which may annoy some of you.&lt;br /&gt;2) Many of these are heavy on the patchouli and &#x27;musk.&#x27; If I wanted to smell like a Phish concert, I&#x27;d go to a Phish concert. Gross.&lt;br /&gt;3) They&#x27;re a bit caustic and irritated my, um... more delicate regions. Not terribly caustic, but just enough for it to be noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adventure over. Back to Biggs and Featherbelle.</li>
            <li> I love this set! I use this daily and it makes my skin so smooth. Not to mention, it also makes my bathroom smell amazing!</li>
            <li> The soap sampler came as expected and smells wonderful! Great gift for my boyfriend!</li>
            <li> I really like this soap! It leaves my hands feeling very well moisturized compared to commercial liquid/bar soaps. I only have 2 minor complaints. First, most of the soaps smell very similar. That may be because they are boxed together and just happen to take on a collective scent. Second, I wish there was a way to tell which soap was which. Though there is a list of the soap types on the back of the box, the list doesn&#x27;t seem to be in any kind of order and it is hard to distinguish the soaps from each other. Note: Like the other reviewers have said, the bars of soap are sample sized (i.e., the size of a small bar of hotel soap).</li>
            <li> Sent these back.  They smelled super strong.</li>
            <li> I work at a nursery/urban farm, and come home everyday to immediately pick-up a bar of soap and a scrub brush.  Today it was hot, windy, and I spent all day coating terra cotta pots with sealant, then rode my bike home.  My hands were BLACK and disgusting and yet there was my new soap waiting to great me!  I immediately pulled out Rough Stuff and Peppermint Lemon Pine to do the dirty work... and I&#x27;m impressed.  My hands are clean and smooth and my soul is happy  The scents and ingredient combos are unique and intentional; the packaging is cute, crafty, and hassle-free.  All around no regrets with this one!</li>
            <li> I expected the bars to be thicker... Then again, it is a sampler. Each soap smells wonderful. Lathers real nice. I will certainly buy the bigger bars.</li>
