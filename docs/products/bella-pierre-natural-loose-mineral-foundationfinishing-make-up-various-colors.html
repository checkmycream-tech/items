            <li>I use this everyday it matches up great, the best thing i love about it is that it protects my skin from the sun and it keeps me from sweating extreamly well.</li>
            <li>Prompt delivery love the product</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more okay over another foundation, more as a finishing powder.  </li>
            <li>Love this makeup.</li>
            <li>It layers well and gives good , smooth ,flawless coverage  from sheer to full.  </li>
            <li>so 6mos is still a long time, and a great deal!  </li>
            <li>The color pallet is good for most skin complexions of all races,  from fair to dark.  </li>
            <li>Have to keep it in stock, love it so much :)</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and dark circles and the coverage is amazing and my skin looks flawless.</li>
            <li>Love my new BPM recommend if yo anyone who has never used it before!!!</li>
            <li>This is certainly one of the better mineral powder foundations that I have tried and the one that I am sticking with for the time being.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll write later on how good it is.</li>
            <li>I love the whole line of products.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup, I bought it at a woman&#x27;s expo and paid way to much for it.</li>
            <li>Love the whole line of products.</li>
            <li>Good product but definitely suggest getting the liquid foundation applied beforehand for maximum coverage.</li>
            <li>It ships very quickly and is exactly what I order.</li>
            <li>Got exactly what I needed quickly!</li>
            <li>Love this product, got it quick and for a decent price.</li>
            <li>I bought one a while back at a mall and fell in love with it!  </li>
            <li>Love how it makes me look like I have young beautiful skin with hardly any makeup.</li>
            <li>I prefer this over the Bare Mineral foundation because the coverage is so much better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now back on Amazon, happily ordering my second foundation purchase...in Nutmeg.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light on your face and so far I have not had any skin irritation because of this makeup.</li>
            <li>My all time favorite was the Costco Kirkland&#x27;s brand, but that became unavailable several years ago, so after much research I switched to Bella Pierre.  </li>
            <li>Purchased for less through Amazon- and same great product.</li>
            <li>I feel like I really do need to reapply.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use that much</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>If I wear too much it cakes up.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to people with oily skin.</li>
            <li>This product is all natural and pure, so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>I can get away with one application for a normal day, but if I am working or going out in the evening</li>
            <li>It is very soft and not cakey on my face.</li>
            <li>Looks so natural and yet covers everything.</li>
            <li>Same high quality product that I&#x27;ve come to expect from Bella Pierre .</li>
            <li>I was a fan of Bare Minerals...until I discovered Belle Pierre.  </li>
            <li>The color ordered was consistent to the color previously purchased at a Bella Pierre kiosk that no longer exists.</li>
            <li>bought from kiosk previously and this does not seem to be the same product nor exactly the same color.  </li>

            <li> will buy again when it finishes usually buy 1 or 2 a year</li>
            <li> I did tho notice a small crack in the bottle but still usable.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave that fake or sticky look of liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> Disappointed,  not what I was looking forward to.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this product! You don&#x27;t need to use that much so it last awhile. I recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for years. I never thought I would find it again. Just by chance I thought I&#x27;d look it up on line, OMG I couldn&#x27;t believe it! This product works great. It gives just enough coverage. perfect.</li>
            <li> I used to work at Bella Pierre Cosmetics, and have been hooked on this mineral makeup ever since! It&#x27;s light on your face and so far I have not had any skin irritation because of this makeup. (I have been using it for about 3 years)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this for all skin types!</li>
            <li> Best makeup I have ever used. Doesn&#x27;t leave that fake or sticky look of liquid foundation. Looks so natural and yet covers everything.</li>
            <li> I was a fan of Bare Minerals...until I discovered Belle Pierre.  This product lasts way longer--both on your face and on your shelf. It goes on very evenly and does an excellent job of creating a smooth, flawless look. I&#x27;m now back on Amazon, happily ordering my second foundation purchase...in Nutmeg. Bravo!</li>
            <li> Very good deal. Thanks</li>
            <li> Love this product!! I prefer this over the Bare Mineral foundation because the coverage is so much better and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This is the only product my daughter uses and I got it for a good price and&lt;br /&gt;it was delivered on time for christmas.  I would highly recommend this product to people with oily skin.</li>

            <li> When used along with the Bella Pierre Derma Beauty Make up Primer, your skin will look FLAWLESS! Love the whole line of products. Some beautiful girls stopped me in the mall and did a makeover on me and I was sold!!</li>
            <li> Love this product, got it quick and for a decent price. Second purchase already and would buy it again without a doubt.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t change these products.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd time I&#x27;m ordering Bella Pierre Mineral Foundation.  I bought one a while back at a mall and fell in love with it!  It lasts long time.  It is very soft and not cakey on my face.</li>
            <li> This is  really a good quality mineral powder foundation.  It layers well and gives good , smooth ,flawless coverage  from sheer to full.  This product is all natural and pure, so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my acne prone skin.  The color pallet is good for most skin complexions of all races,  from fair to dark.  Great product at a great price.  The vendor delivered the product in the timeframe promised and my item was packaged well. I would definitely purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The only complaint , if I can call it a complaint, about this product is that it can make your skin look a little ashy in certain kinds of lighting. Other than that, I am very pleased with it.</li>
