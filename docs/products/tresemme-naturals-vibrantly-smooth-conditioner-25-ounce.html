            <li>OMG I love this&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells nice, doesn&#x27;t cause product build up, and conditions really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell is light</li>
            <li>it was either lower sulfate or sulfate free.</li>
            <li>also mix it with honey and oils and it serves as a great deep</li>
            <li>I liked that this was a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product, but if you look closely it still has a decent number of chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell any difference in how my hair looks, but it definitely seems to help keep my hair more healthy</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and so easy to finger comb through!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more!</li>
            <li>My favorite leave in by far!</li>
            <li>I put it on my freshly washed hair and EVERY time I wear it</li>
            <li>Makes my kinky natural hair soft after a good condition for a day or two.</li>
            <li>Price was very reasonable, the bottle takes me awhile to finish since it is very large.</li>
            <li>Exactly as I would buy it in store, except I got a discount on two which I know I&#x27;ll be using.</li>
            <li>I get complimented on my hair at least 4 times a week lol.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s at all possible to be in love with a conditioner...</li>
            <li>Much better than the regular tresemme.</li>
            <li>I have coarse 3C hair and it leaves my hair soft, manageable, and easy to detangle!</li>

            <li>a male tells me that I smell funny...</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t work well to use a conditioner styler for Natural Hair.</li>
            <li>It is soft, manageable, and it SHINES.</li>
            <li>I would even go as far as saying its a staple for your natural hair cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical at first about this product, but decided to try it out and think it is a great product.</li>

            <li> ( I live on the other side of earth).</li>
            <li> other thing to try, by the way, is to condition EVERY DAY, but only shampoo every 2nd or 3rd day.  </li>
            <li> am black with extra kinky</li>
            <li> This one makes my hair very dry after use.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is just my hair type that doesn&#x27;t go with it, but I would not really recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> But with this one makes when I leave it in, my hair is dead dry after rinsing it out, and I would have to wet my hair again afterwards</li>
            <li> I usually leave a conditioner in and add a moisturizer to my braid outs to keep them from looking dry</li>
            <li> (I was already doing this previously with the Biolage, and still do it with this product).</li>
            <li> Nothing permanent, yet to find a conditioner that will tame my hair.</li>
            <li> I usually leave the conditioner in for about 5-10mn and then rinse out, and my hair would be softer, easier to detangle.</li>
            <li> This is a THICK conditioner--much like one of those heavy duty conditioning treatments--but I use it every day!  </li>
            <li> every male that has smelled it tells me it  stinks!  </li>
            <li> I use it to &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; my hair instead of the expensive Deva Curl One Condition.</li>
            <li> to me the smell isn&#x27;t at all bad...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get why the men that I know hate this smell on me.</li>

            <li> Great deal. Exactly as I would buy it in store, except I got a discount on two which I know I&#x27;ll be using.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner if you are looking for softness but it does not give my hair shine and it doesn&#x27;t work well to use a conditioner styler for Natural Hair.</li>
            <li> The product was ok, and I liked it. I didn&#x27;t care to much for the smell. But&lt;br /&gt;over all it gives good slipp. That&#x27;s a pluss for curly and coily hair like mine.</li>
            <li> This is what I use as a leave in when following the curly girl method. It has incredible slip and the smell is HEAVENLY. This has become a staple!!! .-_-</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!</li>
            <li> I liked the slippery feeling of this conditioner.  HOWEVER every male that has smelled it tells me it  stinks!  I put it on my freshly washed hair and EVERY time I wear it a male tells me that I smell funny...then they sniff my hair and say yep that&#x27;s where it&#x27;s coming from....to me the smell isn&#x27;t at all bad...I don&#x27;t get why the men that I know hate this smell on me.</li>
            <li> Since I started using the Tresemme hair care products, I have gotten lots of compliments on my hair. It is soft, manageable, and it SHINES.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This product got discontinued where I live. Now I have to pay around 20 dollars for shipping alone ( I live on the other side of earth). This is how much I love this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice, doesn&#x27;t cause product build up, and conditions really well.&lt;br /&gt;If you have curly hair use this along with Garnier curl shaping gel spray. Those two products go hand in hand. I get complimented on my hair at least 4 times a week lol.</li>
            <li> A bit watery but gives awesome slip. Smell is light so that&#x27;s an added plus. Love, love this product, makes de-tangling a breeze.</li>
            <li> This is the most moisturizing conditioner I ever used. I have coarse 3C hair and it leaves my hair soft, manageable, and easy to detangle! Also, with its low price, I can use it liberally !!!!</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s at all possible to be in love with a conditioner...I LOVE this one!! It makes my hair so soft and so easy to finger comb through! I use it as a co wash and a leave in. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> Before using this conditioner, I used to use the one with lower sulfate. it was either lower sulfate or sulfate free. That one used to make my hair very soft. This one makes my hair very dry after use. I usually leave the conditioner in for about 5-10mn and then rinse out, and my hair would be softer, easier to detangle. But with this one makes when I leave it in, my hair is dead dry after rinsing it out, and I would have to wet my hair again afterwards so I can detangle it. Maybe it is just my hair type that doesn&#x27;t go with it, but I would not really recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal user of Biolage for several years, but my hair is getting dryer and I decided to give this a try.  This is a THICK conditioner--much like one of those heavy duty conditioning treatments--but I use it every day!  I apply it in the shower and comb through it to make sure I get it throughout and leave it in while I take the rest of my shower, then rinse out.  When I went for a haircut and highlights a couple days ago, my stylist commented on how much healthier my hair seemed, so it certainly must be making a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing to try, by the way, is to condition EVERY DAY, but only shampoo every 2nd or 3rd day.  I can&#x27;t tell any difference in how my hair looks, but it definitely seems to help keep my hair more healthy (I was already doing this previously with the Biolage, and still do it with this product).</li>

            <li> My favorite leave in by far! I usually leave a conditioner in and add a moisturizer to my braid outs to keep them from looking dry but I didn&#x27;t even need a moisturizer! Best deal for the amount you pay for. I would even go as far as saying its a staple for your natural hair cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*&lt;br /&gt;Ive graduated from braid outs to wash and goes and this works really well with kinky kurly custard. The whole line is great!</li>
            <li> Much better than the regular tresemme. Price was very reasonable, the bottle takes me awhile to finish since it is very large. Smell is great. It moisturized my hair wonderfully. I will definitely buy product again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this on my hair! I Love everything about it. It truly makes my hair feel amazing and smooth. It makes my hair shine like the girls hair in the commercial! I abs.recommend this condition &amp; shampoo for anyone its simply great! Better than most salon products to me at a great price!</li>
            <li> I liked that this was a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product, but if you look closely it still has a decent number of chemicals in it. My hair never quite felt like I washed the product out. The price was great, but I can&#x27;t justify buying a conditioner that doesnt feel good in my hair!</li>
            <li> I use it to &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; my hair instead of the expensive Deva Curl One Condition. I use Deva for a leave-in. Can&#x27;t find this in the drug/grocery stores anymore. Is it discontinued?</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner...smooth, silky this, gray hair</li>
            <li> OMG I love this&lt;br /&gt;I am black with extra kinky hair.&lt;br /&gt;I miss this with some oils and some water and it makes detangling a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;I also mix it with honey and oils and it serves as a great deep conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;It also serves as a great rinse out conditioner and the price is AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE!</li>
