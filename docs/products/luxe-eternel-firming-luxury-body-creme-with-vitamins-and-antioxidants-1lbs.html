            <li>I have been using this product for more than one year</li>
            <li>I love this company.</li>
            <li>Swimming in luxury:)</li>
            <li>Love love this body cream.</li>
            <li>Considering the hefty price, a drugstore firming cream is a better value.</li>
            <li>I love to share it with others.</li>
            <li>Enjoy...treat yourself to some wonderful products that actually work!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>The cream is very rich, creamy, but does not get sticky at all.  </li>
            <li>I am very familiar with products &amp;amp;  </li>
            <li>Lastly, and just as important, the customer service is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Leaves it soft and firm...and smells great.</li>
            <li>and it goes away very quickly.</li>
            <li>The scent is very mild, too.</li>
            <li>The container is large, and looks very spa like, so I proudly display it on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>I see a huge change on my hands, arms and legs.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fluffy yet creamy texture and delicious scent</li>
            <li>This is important to me. ...</li>
            <li>, it will become your only favorite!!</li>
            <li>And the boy she liked would give her those first fresh roses and you would get those butterflies in your tummy.</li>
            <li>absorbed into my skin, non-greasy, does help with toning and tightening!</li>
            <li>I have lots of very fine but very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>This is literally the best body cream that I have ever used, I am that type of person who has to put lotion on every morning after my shower and most times would have to later in the day since I don&#x27;t like the feeling of dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of rose water, but this product feels very cool and silky on your skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>Probably desperation as I have a vanity full of hair care products</li>
            <li>When I find something so good that actually works...</li>
            <li>The smell is really mild and divine, my husband loves the smell as well</li>
            <li>The scent is discrete and pleasant and does not interfere with the other products or perfumes I use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so creamy and has very pampering feel to it, leaving your skin so velvety and smooth.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price if you ask me.</li>
            <li>So worth the price.</li>
            <li>Not a big fan of rose scented products but the scent is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>So many people buy new brands of lotion regularly always looking for a better product.</li>
            <li>I have just finished my first bottle</li>
            <li>Last but not least, the packaging is professional, and the box stuffing smells nice!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine it being all that healthy applying lotion with chemicals in it several times a day.     </li>
            <li>I call it my liquid gold, it&#x27;s a great size and seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li>It works not only better than everything else</li>
            <li>After 2 months using the Luxury body cream, I can swear that the cream really firms your skin!.</li>
            <li>The smell of a million red roses kissing my skin:)</li>
            <li>The cream is absorbed really well and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I received this cream along with a few other products right before the holidays, and I must say, this was the best gift I have ever gotten for myself.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice, thick cream with a light fragrance.</li>
            <li>The scent reminds me of a very slight scent of a fresh Rose</li>
            <li>Yes, it really has all of these qualities (amazed me when first tried it).</li>
            <li>and my skin feels more soft, firmer and just plain looks better too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s brought me back to those days when I was a young girl, first time in love, who was going on a date for a Valentine&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li>Its not greasy like many commercial products, doesn&#x27;t feel wet after you apply, and doesn&#x27;t linger a strong fragrance that overpowers or causes irritation in anyway.</li>
            <li>is just perfect.... a little bit of roses, a little bit of sandalwood, a little bit of citrus &amp; lots of amazing vitamins/antioxidants that make this cream so moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I really felt a difference, almost as if my skin was soaking up the vitamins immediately, and saying thank you.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d feel moisturized the whole day.</li>
            <li>It is completely different and better than any product as it really is natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any chemicals whats so ever.</li>
            <li>do continue giving the public such a good product with natural ingredients!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to apply and reapply like many other lotions.</li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with their other product the seaweed body scrub though.  </li>
            <li>the shower.&lt;br /&gt;The 1 lbs container is quite large for this kind of items and hold enough product for a couple of months without getting dry or loosing its aspect and properties.</li>
            <li>It really feels amazing especially after a good workout and cold shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad as a daily body cream but not for this price.  </li>
            <li>My skin just needed that little extra boost to look good.  </li>
            <li>I had previously purchased the QR luxury bath salts which I love, so decided to try this.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very important for me to specify that I have a delicate skin and easily reacts allergically to similar creams.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it would be possible for anyone to regret purchasing a jar as it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I received this cream a few days ago and although I am not a fan of rosewater, I love the way it softens my skin.  </li>
            <li>This product is rare in that It actually does what it says.  </li>
            <li>The cream has this pure, uplifting, natural, soft, sensual scent that truly takes your mind to another place.</li>
            <li>I know that sounds weird, but it really feels that good when you put it on after a bath or shower.  </li>
            <li>A little bit really goes such a long way and the fact that it lasts all day makes it by far a superior product.</li>
            <li>The combination of this cream and diet and exercise are helping this 40 year old body!</li>
            <li>Also it is an extra large size jar</li>
            <li>The large size will last a while.</li>
            <li>Trying really hard to firm up my mommy belly and thighs and all theyre products are aiding me greatly in this lengthly proccess.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great &amp; for as much as you get, the price isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li>I bought this along with the Nuelle Triple Action Anti Cellulite serum but didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>After applying it your skin feels satiny soft without the wetness and greasy</li>
            <li>It makes the skin unbelievably soft and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I use this product along with the nuelle triple action anti cellulite firming concentrate</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and my skin already feels more firm.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot (I mean A LOT) of body cream products but this cream not only moisture, it nourishes and firms my skin amazingly.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I almost feel lucky using this cream,like it is a hidden secret or something.</li>
            <li>It only takes a little, so this huge jar can last almost a year.    </li>
            <li>I also have eczema on my legs and this product has helped it calm down and is practically gone!</li>
            <li>My skin stays soft until the next shower.  </li>
            <li>I apply the cream at night after my shower and my skin is still soft and silky the next day.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think I will ever have a plan to go back to using the old cream that I used before this.</li>
            <li>But I do give this cream credit for smelling nice (faintly of rosewater) and not being greasy/oily.</li>
            <li>it works extremely well (an absolute statement).  </li>
            <li>I had a dark patch on my left elbow that would never go away, no matter how much I exfoliated that spot.  </li>

            <li> I had previously purchased the QR luxury bath salts which I love, so decided to try this.   </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would be possible for anyone to regret purchasing a jar as it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I received this cream a few days ago and although I am not a fan of rosewater, I love the way it softens my skin.  </li>
            <li> This product is rare in that It actually does what it says.  </li>
            <li> The cream has this pure, uplifting, natural, soft, sensual scent that truly takes your mind to another place.</li>

            <li> The combination of this cream and diet and exercise are helping this 40 year old body!</li>
            <li> Also it is an extra large size jar</li>

            <li> Trying really hard to firm up my mommy belly and thighs and all theyre products are aiding me greatly in this lengthly proccess.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great &amp; for as much as you get, the price isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>

            <li> After applying it your skin feels satiny soft without the wetness and greasy</li>
            <li> It makes the skin unbelievably soft and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I use this product along with the nuelle triple action anti cellulite firming concentrate</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and my skin already feels more firm.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot (I mean A LOT) of body cream products but this cream not only moisture, it nourishes and firms my skin amazingly.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, I almost feel lucky using this cream,like it is a hidden secret or something.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little, so this huge jar can last almost a year.    </li>
            <li> I also have eczema on my legs and this product has helped it calm down and is practically gone!</li>
            <li> My skin stays soft until the next shower.  </li>
            <li> I apply the cream at night after my shower and my skin is still soft and silky the next day.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think I will ever have a plan to go back to using the old cream that I used before this.</li>
            <li> But I do give this cream credit for smelling nice (faintly of rosewater) and not being greasy/oily.</li>
            <li> it works extremely well (an absolute statement).  </li>
            <li> I had a dark patch on my left elbow that would never go away, no matter how much I exfoliated that spot.  </li>
            <li> If you do the math, this product is actually cheaper in the long run compared to products like olay, nivea, and the like.</li>

            <li> In addition, a small amount of cream really goes a long way and lasts all day.</li>

            <li> I have noticed a difference in my skin done and won&#x27;t use any other product.</li>
            <li> However, as with other \\&quot;firming\\&quot; creams I&#x27;ve tried, this one produced no noticeable firming.</li>
            <li> As a previous reviewer said, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> However, it was just average and did not seem to moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> the lotion is thick so only a small amount is needed...</li>

            <li> I have been using it for a few months already</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing luxurious about this cream. The rose smell is very faint and it goes away very quickly. I bought this along with the Nuelle Triple Action Anti Cellulite serum but didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have just finished my first bottle and I did not see any effective on firming my skin.  It&#x27;s not bad as a daily body cream but not for this price.  I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I would actually give it 6 stars if I could. My husband have given me this creme for my birthday. He&#x27;s bought it based on the description since there was no comments. And let me tell you ladies, this creme is the sexiest thing out there. It&#x27;s so creamy and has very pampering feel to it, leaving your skin so velvety and smooth. The scent is something esle that I have to elaborate. It&#x27;s brought me back to those days when I was a young girl, first time in love, who was going on a date for a Valentine&#x27;s day. And the boy she liked would give her those first fresh roses and you would get those butterflies in your tummy. That&#x27;s how this cream smells. Like LOVE. Looking through the ingredients I am figuring that it is a blend of Rose with Sandalwood, but it can be something else in it too. The scent reminds me of a very slight scent of a fresh Rose but there is something else in it too, which make it all that much more interesting. I love my husband for making a great choice and I love this cream.</li>
            <li> I received this cream along with a few other products right before the holidays, and I must say, this was the best gift I have ever gotten for myself.  I wish I had a way to shout out to everyone how wonderful and delicious this cream is.  Every time I put it on my body I feel like a princess!!  It&#x27;s fluffy yet creamy texture and delicious scent is just perfect.... a little bit of roses, a little bit of sandalwood, a little bit of citrus &amp; lots of amazing vitamins/antioxidants that make this cream so moisturizing. The best part is that it absorbs into the skin leaving just the perfect amount of glow.  I can honestly say that ever since I discovered Skin QR Organics and Sweetsation Therapy products, I do not use anything else... there is simply no need for anything else!!  One of the best things is that the owner is the sweetest lady ever, so accommodating and so lovely, I feel that I have known her forever, even though we have never met!!  That&#x27;s quite a quality.  Order this cream and I promise you will not regret it, it will become your only favorite!!</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased the QR luxury bath salts which I love, so decided to try this.   I&#x27;m a self proclaimed beauty product junkie and tried tons of expensive body firming/lotion/cremes on the market.  This one by far is one of the best.  I really felt a difference, almost as if my skin was soaking up the vitamins immediately, and saying thank you. I know that sounds weird, but it really feels that good when you put it on after a bath or shower.  I also must say I noticed an immediate improvement in the elasticity of my skin, and I even use it on my face!  My face after using this had a healthy glow and wonderful feel.  I put makeup on over it, and it didn&#x27;t make my face look greasy either. I put it on a scar and experienced an improvement/lightening in the appearance!  I was really impressed with this creme and will always buy it.  The container is large, and looks very spa like, so I proudly display it on my bathroom counter. The smell is not that noticeable very faint roses, but something that works this well does not need alot of heavy fragrance to cover it up.  Last but not least, the packaging is professional, and the box stuffing smells nice!</li>
            <li> The cream has this pure, uplifting, natural, soft, sensual scent that truly takes your mind to another place. Yes, it really has all of these qualities (amazed me when first tried it). This product makes even me feel sexy. After applying it your skin feels satiny soft without the wetness and greasy feeling you get from products like Olay or Nivea. To be honest, I almost feel lucky using this cream,like it is a hidden secret or something. I don&#x27;t think it would be possible for anyone to regret purchasing a jar as it is well worth the money. A little bit really goes such a long way and the fact that it lasts all day makes it by far a superior product. I really can&#x27;t think of anything negative to say, and I would share of there were something.      This body cream, as another review said, is extremely sexy. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. Its not greasy like many commercial products, doesn&#x27;t feel wet after you apply, and doesn&#x27;t linger a strong fragrance that overpowers or causes irritation in anyway. In addition, a small amount of cream really goes a long way and lasts all day. You don&#x27;t have to apply and reapply like many other lotions. I often see people reaching for their lotion what seems like hourly because their hands are constantly dry. I can&#x27;t imagine it being all that healthy applying lotion with chemicals in it several times a day.     It is completely different and better than any product as it really is natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any chemicals whats so ever. I would recommend this to anyone who uses lotion. Don&#x27;t waste your money on products that say, \\&quot;All natural\\&quot; when they really are not. So many people buy new brands of lotion regularly always looking for a better product. Buy this lotion, I promise you will not need nor want to look further. The ingredients are healthy, safe, completely natural, have great benefits, and just all around feels great. Lastly, and just as important, the customer service is wonderful. The company really cares about your hard earned money. If you do the math, this product is actually cheaper in the long run compared to products like olay, nivea, and the like. I wish I had come across this cream years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of rose water, but this product feels very cool and silky on your skin. It did improve the texture, but I don&#x27;t  know that it firmed my skin. It&#x27;s still a great product though. Thinking about buying another jar!</li>
            <li> If this didn&#x27;t smell like old-lady grandma rose I would have rated it 5 stars and I&#x27;d still be buying it.  It makes the skin unbelievably soft and not greasy.  But I can&#x27;t deal with the smell.  I am in LOVE with their other product the seaweed body scrub though.  Glowing review on that one.</li>
            <li> I am over 50 &amp; needed a great body creme for aging skin since I am doing a figure competition &amp; will be onstage in a bikini.  My skin just needed that little extra boost to look good.  This stuff works great &amp; for as much as you get, the price isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> The firming cream has helped me in just a short amount of time. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and my skin already feels more firm. The combination of this cream and diet and exercise are helping this 40 year old body!</li>
            <li> This is literally the best body cream that I have ever used, I am that type of person who has to put lotion on every morning after my shower and most times would have to later in the day since I don&#x27;t like the feeling of dry skin. But ever since I started using this product I have not had to do so and my skin feels more soft, firmer and just plain looks better too. I also have eczema on my legs and this product has helped it calm down and is practically gone! The smell is really mild and divine, my husband loves the smell as well and it&#x27;s supper relaxing. I call it my liquid gold, it&#x27;s a great size and seems to last a long time. Well worth the price if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because I like roses and I loved the ingredients. However, it was just average and did not seem to moisturize my skin. But I do give this cream credit for smelling nice (faintly of rosewater) and not being greasy/oily.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than one year and I am delighted with it.&lt;br /&gt;Its texture is creamy to spread on the skin allowing massaging the treated area  without turning lumpy. It then does absorb well and does not let sticky sensation. The scent is discrete and pleasant and does not interfere with the other products or perfumes I use.&lt;br /&gt;It is very important for me to specify that I have a delicate skin and easily reacts allergically to similar creams. With the Skin QR Firming Luxury Body Creme however, I did not feel any unpleasant reaction although I apply it to my body every day after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;The 1 lbs container is quite large for this kind of items and hold enough product for a couple of months without getting dry or loosing its aspect and properties.</li>
            <li> Great as an anti-frizz hair smoother.  I am not making that up.  I live in the DC area, and the humidity is just unbelievable.  I have lots of very fine but very curly hair.  I straighten it, but the weather in DC destroys that in about 3 seconds.  Don&#x27;t ask me why I thought of putting this cream on my hair.  Probably desperation as I have a vanity full of hair care products and I had been using them all to no avail.  But I tried Luxe on my hair, and it&#x27;s unbelievable.  It works not only better than everything else (a relative statement), but it works extremely well (an absolute statement).  It only takes a little, so this huge jar can last almost a year.    Update 6 months later: Just ordered the cream again and also gave one as a gift for Christmas.  What more can I say--it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this body cream for at least 2 months now.  A little bit goes a long way.  Also, the body cream does not have a perfume fragance to it.  The cream is very rich, creamy, but does not get sticky at all.  I have tried a lot (I mean A LOT) of body cream products but this cream not only moisture, it nourishes and firms my skin amazingly.  My skin stays soft until the next shower.  The dryness goes away and I don&#x27;t mean temporarily.  Especially after the sun, I put it on I don&#x27;t see the dryness, wrinkles on my hands while other creams only moisturize my skin for few hours or so and my skin dries again.  It acts as an anti aging cream for body!  I see a huge change on my hands, arms and legs.  Also it is an extra large size jar, I use it twice a day  for 2 months I still have quite a bit.  After 2 months using the Luxury body cream, I can swear that the cream really firms your skin!. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the most luxurious cream that I&#x27;ve ever used!  It&#x27;s made my skin smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom and it makes me feel good! Definitely a must buy!</li>
            <li> Ummmm yes!!!! The smell of a million red roses kissing my skin:) swimming in luxury with this one. So worth the price. I love this company. Client for life!:) the lotion is thick so only a small amount is needed... It really feels amazing especially after a good workout and cold shower. Yes indeed... Swimming in luxury:)</li>
            <li> Love love this body cream. I like its texture and smell. It makes my skin hydrated and soft. The cream is absorbed really well and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I received this cream a few days ago and although I am not a fan of rosewater, I love the way it softens my skin.  I had a dark patch on my left elbow that would never go away, no matter how much I exfoliated that spot.  This cream has remedied the problem!  I apply the cream at night after my shower and my skin is still soft and silky the next day.  This is a great product.  The large size will last a while.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier that I found this product. Even in the harshest Chicago winter, my skin stays moisturized and firm. I have noticed a difference in my skin done and won&#x27;t use any other product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, thick cream with a light fragrance. As a previous reviewer said, a little goes a long way. However, as with other \\&quot;firming\\&quot; creams I&#x27;ve tried, this one produced no noticeable firming. Considering the hefty price, a drugstore firming cream is a better value.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for your skin. Leaves it soft and firm...and smells great. I will keep repurchasing. The best body cream i have ever used!</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this product...I was looking for a product with natural ingredients. After reading the ingredients I thought why not give it a try! I am so happy and grateful I did just that!!!!!!! This is my 2nd tub...I love it!!! It does feel good on the skin excellent might I add. This is important to me. ...absorbed into my skin, non-greasy, does help with toning and tightening! I am happy, happy!&lt;br /&gt;I had now shared it with my sister from Cali. When I find something so good that actually works...I love to share it with others. I have owned and operated a Health Food Store In NJ late 70&#x27;s.  Worked in the Health Food Industry all my life...I am very familiar with products &amp;amp;  ingredients...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please  do continue giving the public such a good product with natural ingredients!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using it. I also like the Organic Brightening Toner with Vit. C awesome. It brightens and tones my skin...I have not had any problems skin wise with this product. Enjoy...treat yourself to some wonderful products that actually work!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product along with the nuelle triple action anti cellulite firming concentrate and i couldnt be happier with the way my skin looks feels smells i literally look forward to putting on these products theyre amazing. Trying really hard to firm up my mommy belly and thighs and all theyre products are aiding me greatly in this lengthly proccess. And theyre customer service rocks.</li>
            <li> This is one good firming cream that I use from neck to feet. I have been using it for a few months already and I don&#x27;t think I will ever have a plan to go back to using the old cream that I used before this. You&#x27;d feel moisturized the whole day. The scent is very mild, too.</li>
            <li> This product is rare in that It actually does what it says.  It hydrates and firms making my skin feel smoother to the touch.  Not a big fan of rose scented products but the scent is not overpowering.</li>
