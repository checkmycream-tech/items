            <li>Good for professionals as well.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>taupe color is a good neutral tone, not reddish as it seems in the photo.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brow filler!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>My brows have never looked better!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing for filling in sparse areas and for thickening and defining the brows.</li>
            <li>It applies smooth, feels lightweight, lasts all day, and looks great.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that I do not set my eyebrows with any kind of sealer, or powder.)</li>
            <li>Seems to work well, stays on all day and fills in the shape nicely, I found the sponge applicators for eyeshadow&lt;br /&gt;Work</li>
            <li>helps define eyebrows nicely.</li>
            <li>i was super happy with this product until this.</li>
            <li>Great product - stays put - looks natural - love it!!  </li>
            <li>However, the texture is amazing and it goes on very smooth and even.</li>
            <li>Went to ulta and purchased the soft brown which was perfect.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect for everyone&#x27;s natural hair colour.</li>
            <li>was surprised to find that the Taupe shade was the best match (the blond shade would have worked too).  </li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>i just pick a very light coler</li>
            <li>Should be used very lightly as the pigments are a bit dense.  </li>
            <li>Im glad i bought this.</li>
            <li>I really love this color toupe matches perfect with blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I find its better than a pencil any day.</li>
            <li>once i practice more maybe it&#x27;ll look better.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>love it, but need to change to lighter color.</li>
            <li>I bought the blonde and am very, very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>I thought the Dipbrow Pomade would stay on better</li>
            <li>Be sure to purchase the applicator brush as I use both the brush and the wire end when applying.  </li>
            <li>But it looks so much more real/natural than what I was using before and it stays on all day/night.</li>
            <li>now I think and I am still so in love.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite part of my makeup routine at the moment.</li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>I LOVE Dipbrow Pomade</li>
            <li>I love this eyebrow pomade from Anastasia.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and it sure met my needs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but I found the taupe to be darker than I like.</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this.</li>
            <li>But better to go to a store to have someone match the correct shade.</li>
            <li>I have tried many powders and pencils but they never lasted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My brows have never looked better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS DIPBROW.  </li>
            <li>I now first so her pencil (brow wiz) to fill holes and then this over to create a flawless brow that looks completely natural.</li>
            <li>She was really happy with the outcome stating it looked really natural for her skin tone and hair color.  </li>
            <li>Loved it so much</li>
            <li>Never change, I love you so much!!!</li>
            <li>but other than that it is a great product!</li>
            <li>I have a medium to fair skin with a cool undertone and light brown hair with blonde high lights and this is the perfect color for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not as easy to use as a pencil or powder, but this stuff has staying power.</li>
            <li>This pomade is creamy aand easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and stays put all day.</li>
            <li>So easy to apply and to control.  </li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair, and this works wonderful!</li>
            <li>Anyway, I just tried this for the first time last night and it is AWESOME.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and wipes off easily if you need it to.</li>
            <li>Way more powerful and precise than a pencil.</li>
            <li>free shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this color lightly with my spooley brush</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair and bought the taupe.</li>
            <li>Great with my blonde hair, and lasts all night (or day, if you&#x27;re wearing it during the day).  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and does not rub off.</li>
            <li>Do use  a light touch  and a brush to blend when finished to soften the look.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it says it goes on very easily</li>
            <li>I was using bare minerals brow powder, which I loved, they discontinued my color</li>
            <li>duo #12) and just barely dip the tip, and it will cover the good part of a brow.  </li>
            <li>Glides on super smooth.</li>
            <li>I felt like this is too dark and bold for very fair hair, unless that&#x27;s the look you&#x27;re going for.</li>
            <li>I have very light colored and sparse eyebrows, they are very patchy and bald in some areas</li>
            <li>color just right!</li>
            <li>Full disclosure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m blonde and this color does look good.  </li>
            <li>; This is probably a good product if that&#x27;s the unnatural look you&#x27;re going for...which I am definitely NOT!!!</li>
            <li>This product is very light (unlike a lot of brow pencils) so that it doesn&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;ve done my brows, and the results look awesome--super natural-looking, although I&#x27;ve seen people accomplish more stylized brows with the same product, too.  </li>
            <li>I still love my pencil and sigma powder, but this product is well worth the money considering how much you get.  </li>
            <li>but once you try it on it&#x27;s a lot darker and more universal of a shade :)</li>
            <li>Luckily, I had the day off, so I sat in front of my vanity mirror applying, wiping off, then applying again.</li>
            <li>(Anastasia #12  spoolie/brush) into the product, then dab it quickly on a tissue to soften the color.</li>
            <li>and it goes great not too dark and</li>
            <li>This dipbrow pomade seemed really light at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of ABH products!</li>
            <li>Im light skinned with very light blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Takes a little practice to get the hang of applying, but looks great and stays all day.</li>
            <li>Worth the $$.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice shade for my strawberry blonde hair, and stays all day.  </li>
            <li>I bought the taupe color and it is just right.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff...was a little weary purchasing this for the very first time online without being able to test it</li>
            <li>Looks very natural (I have light eyebrows</li>
            <li>The taupe goes better on those with ash blonde and that it would look greenish on me and, after trying both, she was right.  </li>
            <li>So far, though, this is working fine with my hair, so I guess I will use it up</li>
            <li>Tried this for the first time last night on a blonde friend with extremely fair and thin eye brows and the Taupe was perfect to add color, shape and depth.</li>
            <li>No weird tints to it.</li>
            <li>sure if it&#x27;s a sale or a discount, so this may not apply at a later date.)&lt;br /&gt;5.)</li>
            <li>- I bought this at Ulta because I wasn&#x27;t sure whether I needed the blonde or the taupe</li>
            <li>First off: This product is a bit tricky, so I&#x27;d beware, if you&#x27;re buying pomade for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the blonde shade for many months now</li>
            <li>I expected there to be some kind of difference between the blonde and the taupe but truthfully, I don&#x27;t see any at all.  </li>
            <li>The taupe is more for lighter and darker blondes without the red tint.  </li>
            <li>I have searched for a brow product that will hold up to the hot, humid conditions in Florida.</li>
            <li>Once that&#x27;s done, I take a white eye pencil and clean up the under-arch area, making a defined, clean line and blend it in.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the blonde color because I was under the impression that it was more suitable for strawberry blonde and light red.  </li>
            <li>It took a couple tries to get it just perfect, so I would say to practice a little bit before you wear it out.</li>
            <li>Wrong color for me, but that&#x27;s kind of my own fault.</li>
            <li>Seriously, just a quick &amp;#34;tap&amp;#34; with the tip of an angled brush, and there&#x27;s plenty to get a couple good strokes on my eyebrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, I used the ardell double sided brush and it worked well.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a brow product that lasts throughout the entire day!</li>
            <li>My hair varies from light blonde to platinum to silver and I&#x27;m very fair-skinned.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t like it nearly as much as this</li>
            <li>maybe because i need to learn not to put so much</li>
            <li>Here are some pros and cons just to make the review straight to</li>
            <li>Ulta sales person knew what she was doing and told me that with a more golden blonde hair color I should go with the blonde.  </li>
            <li>Worked really well, but I&#x27;ve moved to a very humid climate and it seems to wear off easier.  </li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic and definitely lives up to the hype.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>After reading reviews about the taupe being very versatile however, I decided I would try it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a taupe brow liner for years and began applying Anastasia&#x27;s blonde brow gel over it, just to get a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>Pomade goes on VERY heavily, so it&#x27;s important to take very little at a time and apply with a light touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to get full and lasting coverage with very little effort, but it also isn&#x27;t hard to remove with a little bit of makeup remover, which is the best of both worlds.  </li>
            <li>Easy to build up with the pomade for a more dramatic flare if you want.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I feel the product doesn&#x27;t go on great unless there is a build up of product on the brush.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have dark blonde to light brown hair with very light blonde eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I finally have brows that look natural and full</li>
            <li>so I was worried about finding a new one.</li>
            <li>I use a small elf concealer brush to apply, which nmaybe isn&#x27;t the correct thing to do, but it makes it very accurate.</li>
            <li>I bought the taupe and it is light enough to loo match well with my blonde hair and&lt;br /&gt;Light eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a blonde with light skin and blue eyes.  </li>
            <li>Very natural looking (</li>
            <li>Very natural.  </li>
            <li>The beauty of this color though is that you CAN make it as dark or as light as you please.</li>
            <li>As an esthetician that works on brows daily, I can say that this is my current favorite (and has been for several months now) brow shaping and filling product and recommend it to all my clients.</li>
            <li>but it was pretty obvious when I would wear it</li>
            <li>just to prove how natural this product looks!</li>
            <li>I used the Ardell double sided brow brush and it really didn&#x27;t take much to fill in both of my brows, so the small amount of product won&#x27;t run out as fast as I had originally thought.</li>
            <li>To find the right color for me, I looked at google images and saw what it looked like on other women who had tried it which really helped finding the color.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and light brown hair, and taupe is just slightly maybe a little too dark, but still wearable.</li>
            <li>I think the darker brown colors would have been too dark, even though they technically match my hair more closely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m dark blond to light brown and 47 years old....</li>
            <li>They can be soft and full or sharp and en point with this.</li>
            <li>I dip the brush in very lightly and then dab on the back of my hand in order to control the amount and avoid applying too heavily.</li>
            <li>I use a hard, narrow eyeliner brush instead of a brow brush, and I can achieve some really great results with this.  </li>
            <li>This stuff actually works very well.</li>
            <li>I finally got it right on the fourth try.</li>
            <li>but we&#x27;ll worth as it will last you a long time.</li>
            <li>I have been using ABH brow pro pallet in &amp;#34; brunette&amp;#34; for the past few years and loved it.</li>
            <li>Use a small amount with a light touch and it works well.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t normally wear makeup or fill in her eyebrows, She texted me this morning to say she received lots of compliments whilst out last nite</li>
            <li>The texture is amaze and budge-proof and makes my brows look really full, however the color is a bit green...</li>
            <li>Seriously, taupe is good for a girl with medium to dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>I watched a YouTube video on how to apply it because I didn&#x27;t want to put too much or too little, which I found very helpful.</li>
            <li>My natural brows are sparse and so light that they&#x27;re almost colorless and I have a hard time finding a brow product that works.  </li>
            <li>I do the front of the brows last, and then I feather in the color, hardly ever having to dip the brush more than once for both brows.</li>
            <li>I really love how very little goes a long way but</li>
            <li>my eyebrows have nearly disappeared these last 3 years and nothing can touch this product for natural looking brows.</li>
            <li>little of this goes a long way and it can be easy to over-apply.  </li>
            <li>think I probably need to use some other pencil form of eyebrow product on my eyebrow first, so this would stay on the end of my eyebrow...</li>
            <li>This will probably last me a pretty long time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very blonde and was afraid this would be too dark but is perfect.</li>
            <li>This will look silly for a girl with light blonde hair, unless bold brows are your look, then rock on, gal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought Auburn, but I&#x27;ve recently colored my hair to a deep, rich dark cherry shade and am wondering if I should check out another color.</li>
            <li>I now just barely tap the angled brush</li>
            <li>This product fills in areas that I over plucked way back when, and looks reasonably natural.</li>
            <li>my brows look kind of fake now.  </li>
            <li>Nice product wrong color sent.</li>
            <li>I personally like to do the inner brow with the blonde pomade (just a lighter ever so slightly caramel taupe) and finish off the wings with the slightly darker taupe shade for a more natural gradient effect!</li>
            <li>I have dark blonde hair and light brown eyebrows, this color was off, it almost had a slightly orange tint to it?</li>
            <li>(if I don&#x27;t die first; this stuff will last FOREVER, you need so little of it).</li>
            <li>My hair is a very ashy blonde color, almost white and this is entirely too dark for my hair</li>
            <li>If you are tired of searching for the right product in a natural shade, well Anastasia has got you!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of great reviews about ABH dipbrow and decided it was time to take the plunge after struggling to find a drugstore color match.</li>
            <li> I really am happy with this product</li>
            <li> Like all Ana products, it&#x27;s great.</li>

            <li> This is a great brow pomade.</li>
            <li> LOVE all anastasia products!!</li>
            <li> so I ordered the medium brown too, love!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!!</li>
            <li> Most amazing brow liner/filler EVER!!</li>
            <li> My brows look perfect, and I&#x27;m very happy with how natural they look.</li>
            <li> It would even be perfect for light brown hair.</li>

            <li> and they&#x27;ve loved the result.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Good for professionals as well.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> taupe color is a good neutral tone, not reddish as it seems in the photo.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brow filler!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> My brows have never looked better!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> I love this!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing for filling in sparse areas and for thickening and defining the brows.</li>
            <li> It applies smooth, feels lightweight, lasts all day, and looks great.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that I do not set my eyebrows with any kind of sealer, or powder.)</li>
            <li> Seems to work well, stays on all day and fills in the shape nicely, I found the sponge applicators for eyeshadow&lt;br /&gt;Work</li>
            <li> helps define eyebrows nicely.</li>
            <li> i was super happy with this product until this.</li>
            <li> Great product - stays put - looks natural - love it!!  </li>
            <li> However, the texture is amazing and it goes on very smooth and even.</li>
            <li> Went to ulta and purchased the soft brown which was perfect.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect for everyone&#x27;s natural hair colour.</li>
            <li> was surprised to find that the Taupe shade was the best match (the blond shade would have worked too).  </li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> i just pick a very light coler</li>
            <li> Should be used very lightly as the pigments are a bit dense.  </li>
            <li> Im glad i bought this.</li>
            <li> I really love this color toupe matches perfect with blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I find its better than a pencil any day.</li>
            <li> once i practice more maybe it&#x27;ll look better.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> love it, but need to change to lighter color.</li>
            <li> I bought the blonde and am very, very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> I thought the Dipbrow Pomade would stay on better</li>
            <li> Be sure to purchase the applicator brush as I use both the brush and the wire end when applying.  </li>
            <li> But it looks so much more real/natural than what I was using before and it stays on all day/night.</li>
            <li> now I think and I am still so in love.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite part of my makeup routine at the moment.</li>
            <li> Love love love</li>
            <li> I LOVE Dipbrow Pomade</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow pomade from Anastasia.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and it sure met my needs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I found the taupe to be darker than I like.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this.</li>
            <li> But better to go to a store to have someone match the correct shade.</li>
            <li> I have tried many powders and pencils but they never lasted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My brows have never looked better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS DIPBROW.  </li>
            <li> I now first so her pencil (brow wiz) to fill holes and then this over to create a flawless brow that looks completely natural.</li>
            <li> She was really happy with the outcome stating it looked really natural for her skin tone and hair color.  </li>
            <li> Loved it so much</li>
            <li> Never change, I love you so much!!!</li>
            <li> but other than that it is a great product!</li>
            <li> I have a medium to fair skin with a cool undertone and light brown hair with blonde high lights and this is the perfect color for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not as easy to use as a pencil or powder, but this stuff has staying power.</li>
            <li> This pomade is creamy aand easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply and stays put all day.</li>
            <li> So easy to apply and to control.  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair, and this works wonderful!</li>
            <li> Anyway, I just tried this for the first time last night and it is AWESOME.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and wipes off easily if you need it to.</li>
            <li> Way more powerful and precise than a pencil.</li>
            <li> free shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this color lightly with my spooley brush</li>
            <li> I have light brown hair and bought the taupe.</li>
            <li> Great with my blonde hair, and lasts all night (or day, if you&#x27;re wearing it during the day).  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and does not rub off.</li>
            <li> Do use  a light touch  and a brush to blend when finished to soften the look.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it says it goes on very easily</li>
            <li> I was using bare minerals brow powder, which I loved, they discontinued my color</li>
            <li> duo #12) and just barely dip the tip, and it will cover the good part of a brow.  </li>
            <li> Glides on super smooth.</li>
            <li> I felt like this is too dark and bold for very fair hair, unless that&#x27;s the look you&#x27;re going for.</li>
            <li> I have very light colored and sparse eyebrows, they are very patchy and bald in some areas</li>
            <li> color just right!</li>
            <li> Full disclosure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blonde and this color does look good.  </li>
            <li> ; This is probably a good product if that&#x27;s the unnatural look you&#x27;re going for...which I am definitely NOT!!!</li>
            <li> This product is very light (unlike a lot of brow pencils) so that it doesn&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;ve done my brows, and the results look awesome--super natural-looking, although I&#x27;ve seen people accomplish more stylized brows with the same product, too.  </li>
            <li> I still love my pencil and sigma powder, but this product is well worth the money considering how much you get.  </li>
            <li> but once you try it on it&#x27;s a lot darker and more universal of a shade :)</li>
            <li> Luckily, I had the day off, so I sat in front of my vanity mirror applying, wiping off, then applying again.</li>
            <li> (Anastasia #12  spoolie/brush) into the product, then dab it quickly on a tissue to soften the color.</li>
            <li> and it goes great not too dark and</li>
            <li> This dipbrow pomade seemed really light at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of ABH products!</li>
            <li> Im light skinned with very light blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice to get the hang of applying, but looks great and stays all day.</li>
            <li> Worth the $$.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice shade for my strawberry blonde hair, and stays all day.  </li>
            <li> I bought the taupe color and it is just right.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...was a little weary purchasing this for the very first time online without being able to test it</li>
            <li> Looks very natural (I have light eyebrows</li>
            <li> The taupe goes better on those with ash blonde and that it would look greenish on me and, after trying both, she was right.  </li>
            <li> So far, though, this is working fine with my hair, so I guess I will use it up</li>
            <li> Tried this for the first time last night on a blonde friend with extremely fair and thin eye brows and the Taupe was perfect to add color, shape and depth.</li>
            <li> No weird tints to it.</li>
            <li> sure if it&#x27;s a sale or a discount, so this may not apply at a later date.)&lt;br /&gt;5.)</li>
            <li> - I bought this at Ulta because I wasn&#x27;t sure whether I needed the blonde or the taupe</li>
            <li> First off: This product is a bit tricky, so I&#x27;d beware, if you&#x27;re buying pomade for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the blonde shade for many months now</li>
            <li> I expected there to be some kind of difference between the blonde and the taupe but truthfully, I don&#x27;t see any at all.  </li>
            <li> The taupe is more for lighter and darker blondes without the red tint.  </li>
            <li> I have searched for a brow product that will hold up to the hot, humid conditions in Florida.</li>
            <li> Once that&#x27;s done, I take a white eye pencil and clean up the under-arch area, making a defined, clean line and blend it in.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the blonde color because I was under the impression that it was more suitable for strawberry blonde and light red.  </li>
            <li> It took a couple tries to get it just perfect, so I would say to practice a little bit before you wear it out.</li>
            <li> Wrong color for me, but that&#x27;s kind of my own fault.</li>
            <li> Seriously, just a quick &amp;#34;tap&amp;#34; with the tip of an angled brush, and there&#x27;s plenty to get a couple good strokes on my eyebrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, I used the ardell double sided brush and it worked well.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a brow product that lasts throughout the entire day!</li>
            <li> My hair varies from light blonde to platinum to silver and I&#x27;m very fair-skinned.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t like it nearly as much as this</li>
            <li> maybe because i need to learn not to put so much</li>
            <li> Here are some pros and cons just to make the review straight to</li>
            <li> Ulta sales person knew what she was doing and told me that with a more golden blonde hair color I should go with the blonde.  </li>
            <li> Worked really well, but I&#x27;ve moved to a very humid climate and it seems to wear off easier.  </li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic and definitely lives up to the hype.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> After reading reviews about the taupe being very versatile however, I decided I would try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a taupe brow liner for years and began applying Anastasia&#x27;s blonde brow gel over it, just to get a more natural look.  </li>
            <li> Pomade goes on VERY heavily, so it&#x27;s important to take very little at a time and apply with a light touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to get full and lasting coverage with very little effort, but it also isn&#x27;t hard to remove with a little bit of makeup remover, which is the best of both worlds.  </li>
            <li> Easy to build up with the pomade for a more dramatic flare if you want.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I feel the product doesn&#x27;t go on great unless there is a build up of product on the brush.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have dark blonde to light brown hair with very light blonde eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I finally have brows that look natural and full</li>
            <li> so I was worried about finding a new one.</li>
            <li> I use a small elf concealer brush to apply, which nmaybe isn&#x27;t the correct thing to do, but it makes it very accurate.</li>
            <li> I bought the taupe and it is light enough to loo match well with my blonde hair and&lt;br /&gt;Light eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blonde with light skin and blue eyes.  </li>
            <li> Very natural looking (</li>
            <li> Very natural.  </li>
            <li> The beauty of this color though is that you CAN make it as dark or as light as you please.</li>
            <li> As an esthetician that works on brows daily, I can say that this is my current favorite (and has been for several months now) brow shaping and filling product and recommend it to all my clients.</li>
            <li> but it was pretty obvious when I would wear it</li>
            <li> just to prove how natural this product looks!</li>
            <li> I used the Ardell double sided brow brush and it really didn&#x27;t take much to fill in both of my brows, so the small amount of product won&#x27;t run out as fast as I had originally thought.</li>
            <li> To find the right color for me, I looked at google images and saw what it looked like on other women who had tried it which really helped finding the color.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and light brown hair, and taupe is just slightly maybe a little too dark, but still wearable.</li>
            <li> I think the darker brown colors would have been too dark, even though they technically match my hair more closely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dark blond to light brown and 47 years old....</li>
            <li> They can be soft and full or sharp and en point with this.</li>
            <li> I dip the brush in very lightly and then dab on the back of my hand in order to control the amount and avoid applying too heavily.</li>
            <li> I use a hard, narrow eyeliner brush instead of a brow brush, and I can achieve some really great results with this.  </li>
            <li> This stuff actually works very well.</li>
            <li> I finally got it right on the fourth try.</li>
            <li> but we&#x27;ll worth as it will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using ABH brow pro pallet in &amp;#34; brunette&amp;#34; for the past few years and loved it.</li>
            <li> Use a small amount with a light touch and it works well.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t normally wear makeup or fill in her eyebrows, She texted me this morning to say she received lots of compliments whilst out last nite</li>
            <li> The texture is amaze and budge-proof and makes my brows look really full, however the color is a bit green...</li>
            <li> Seriously, taupe is good for a girl with medium to dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I watched a YouTube video on how to apply it because I didn&#x27;t want to put too much or too little, which I found very helpful.</li>
            <li> My natural brows are sparse and so light that they&#x27;re almost colorless and I have a hard time finding a brow product that works.  </li>
            <li> I do the front of the brows last, and then I feather in the color, hardly ever having to dip the brush more than once for both brows.</li>
            <li> I really love how very little goes a long way but</li>
            <li> my eyebrows have nearly disappeared these last 3 years and nothing can touch this product for natural looking brows.</li>
            <li> little of this goes a long way and it can be easy to over-apply.  </li>
            <li> think I probably need to use some other pencil form of eyebrow product on my eyebrow first, so this would stay on the end of my eyebrow...</li>
            <li> This will probably last me a pretty long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very blonde and was afraid this would be too dark but is perfect.</li>
            <li> This will look silly for a girl with light blonde hair, unless bold brows are your look, then rock on, gal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought Auburn, but I&#x27;ve recently colored my hair to a deep, rich dark cherry shade and am wondering if I should check out another color.</li>
            <li> I now just barely tap the angled brush</li>
            <li> This product fills in areas that I over plucked way back when, and looks reasonably natural.</li>
            <li> my brows look kind of fake now.  </li>
            <li> Nice product wrong color sent.</li>
            <li> I personally like to do the inner brow with the blonde pomade (just a lighter ever so slightly caramel taupe) and finish off the wings with the slightly darker taupe shade for a more natural gradient effect!</li>
            <li> I have dark blonde hair and light brown eyebrows, this color was off, it almost had a slightly orange tint to it?</li>
            <li> (if I don&#x27;t die first; this stuff will last FOREVER, you need so little of it).</li>
            <li> My hair is a very ashy blonde color, almost white and this is entirely too dark for my hair</li>
            <li> If you are tired of searching for the right product in a natural shade, well Anastasia has got you!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about purchasing this looking at the cost, but it was well worth it, and that small amount of product will last me a very very very long time.</li>
            <li> Then I use a dab of High Brow (from High Beam) highlighter stick to give the brow bone some subtle sparkle.</li>
            <li> Another plus is that you get so much for your money - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny bit, this will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I am in my sixties (hence, my joke about possible not living long enough to use up the pot).</li>
            <li> Also, it seems as though it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> A TINY BIT goes a very, very long way.</li>
            <li> but it looks like it will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> cuz it fades during the day and this one stays put like glue all day long.</li>
            <li> It stays put all day (sweat proof &amp; water proof) and the tiniest bit of product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, too.</li>
            <li> I wish there had been a swatch on skin or something similar, as in a photo of the product not in the package, as it is darker than I expected.</li>
            <li> I would like to try lighter shade IN The future, But The Darker shades like this can be toned down simply by combing through.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend being light-handed when using this product, as it can be a bit on the dark side.</li>
            <li> This little pot will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Anastasia colors are as expected....</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: After five months of everyday use I finally ran out.</li>
            <li> I have used ABH dipbrow in dark brown for over a year, but it has become dry and crumbly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blonde and this is a little too dark, but I can use it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This stuff lasts forever and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way and the matching brush (#12 at $18) is the tool I also bought for the application.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pricey</li>
            <li> those gradient looking things with the really sharp line underneath, often accompanied with concealer over and under them.  </li>
            <li> when I run out, which probably won&#x27;t be soon since a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> My hair is salt and pepper/ dark</li>
            <li> Taupe is way to dark for me.</li>
            <li> When you apply it to your brows it looks like you applied dark gray lipstick to them.  </li>
            <li> I have medium brown (level 5) hair and didn&#x27;t want something too reddish or too dark.  </li>
            <li> but it was slightly too dark.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see the other reviews that said it has a slight green tint</li>
            <li> A little goes a LOOOOONG way.</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;after just a few uses with this stuff</li>
            <li> ash brown/ weird dark blonde brows/ growing out any dyed ends.  </li>
            <li> I did worry about it being &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; looking or too heavy for me since I don&#x27;t like a ton of make up everyday, it isn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> it became very hard and very dry and did not apply well.</li>
            <li> but too bad it does last long on the end of my eyebrow, compared to the eyebrow powder product I had before</li>
            <li> I use a small double-sided brow brush (the Anastasia brush</li>
            <li> :/...</li>
            <li> Maybe I am blind but the two shades look the same both in the container and on my brows.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day, no more disappearing brow product.</li>
            <li> dunno, it didn&#x27;t seem so hard to master to me.</li>
            <li> Bought the taupe because I have dirty blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Its late</li>
            <li> I seriously wish I found it sooner.</li>
            <li> does require a bit of precision to apply, so I recommend using a very small and thin angled brush.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s why I want to give it a 5, but I am slightly disappointed by the Taupe color I recently ordered which makes me want to give a 4.</li>
            <li> I was worried that the taupe might be too dark (I have dirty blond hair)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to choose for yourself merely from swatches.</li>
            <li> Just disappointed that it&#x27;s not what I expected.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff! I was hoping it would work out, mostly because its $18.00!!!! I have blonde hair and olive skin. I always have issues with eyebrow fillers to he reddish or orangeish, BUT this taupe is perfect. No weird tints to it. It would even be perfect for light brown hair. Im glad i bought this. A little goes a LOOOOONG way. :-D</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. I&#x27;ve tried the ABH brow wiz to but I didn&#x27;t like it nearly as much as this cuz it fades during the day and this one stays put like glue all day long.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but has lots of unpronounceable ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Cyclopentasiloxane, Isododecane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Silica, Polyethylene, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Ozokerite/Synthetic Wax, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Silica Dimethyl Silylate, Mica, Tocopheryl Acetate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Propylparaben, May Contain: (+/-) Iron Oxides (Ci 77491, Ci 77492, Ci 77499), Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Bismuth Oxychloride (Ci 77163).</li>
            <li> Life changing.  I still love my pencil and sigma powder, but this product is well worth the money considering how much you get.  Takes a little practice to get the hang of applying, but looks great and stays all day.</li>
            <li> I really love this color toupe matches perfect with blonde hair. I find its better than a pencil any day.</li>
            <li> all my brow pencils are in the color taupe so i got this in taupe but it was slightly too dark. maybe because i need to learn not to put so much lol. once i practice more maybe it&#x27;ll look better. but other than that it is a great product!</li>
            <li> love it i just pick a very light coler</li>
            <li> My hair is salt and pepper/ dark ash brown/ weird dark blonde brows/ growing out any dyed ends.  I have used ABH dipbrow in dark brown for over a year, but it has become dry and crumbly. I ordered &amp;#34;taupe&amp;#34; because of my ... greying situation....but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  For me and my skin tone [light/medium with freckles] the taupe turned out greenish.  I tried it once then sent it back.  Also, the product dries up after six months, you have to reconstitute it in the back end of the cap to get it to work and even then it&#x27;s not at it&#x27;s peak performance.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Dipbrow in Taupe. My hair is a very ashy blonde color, almost white and this is entirely too dark for my hair color.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is really good. Here are some pros and cons just to make the review straight to the point&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Great product. Well made.&lt;br /&gt;2.) A TINY BIT goes a very, very long way. This stuff would last forever, even if you use it every day&lt;br /&gt;3.) Very natural looking (if applied correctly)&lt;br /&gt;4.) Great price. I&#x27;ve seen this stuff at Sephora and ULTA for probably around 20$. I got this for 16$ with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;(not sure if it&#x27;s a sale or a discount, so this may not apply at a later date.)&lt;br /&gt;5.) TO ALL THE BLONDE GALS, ORDER THE BLONDE COLOR. Seriously, taupe is good for a girl with medium to dark brown hair. This will look silly for a girl with light blonde hair, unless bold brows are your look, then rock on, gal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Wrong color for me, but that&#x27;s kind of my own fault. I ordered the wrong color.&lt;br /&gt;2.) It isn&#x27;t smudge proof (For me. Keep in mind that I do not set my eyebrows with any kind of sealer, or powder.)</li>
            <li> Great product and lasts all day</li>
            <li> My brows have found their best friend!</li>
            <li> love it, but need to change to lighter color. Taupe is way to dark for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is REALLY great. I was using bare minerals brow powder, which I loved, they discontinued my color so I decided to try this. I did worry about it being &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; looking or too heavy for me since I don&#x27;t like a ton of make up everyday, it isn&#x27;t! It&#x27;s totally buildable and you control what goes on your brush, you can also get rid of excess by using the lid. I now first so her pencil (brow wiz) to fill holes and then this over to create a flawless brow that looks completely natural. Can&#x27;t rave enough about this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using drug store pencils to fill in my brows for a couple months now, but I&#x27;d still consider myself a beginner when it comes to filling in my brows. I used the Ardell double sided brow brush and it really didn&#x27;t take much to fill in both of my brows, so the small amount of product won&#x27;t run out as fast as I had originally thought. I&#x27;m actually very happy with how it turned out. I will attach a photo when I can figure out how!</li>
            <li> Full disclosure - I bought this at Ulta because I wasn&#x27;t sure whether I needed the blonde or the taupe and I wanted to try before buying to avoid the hassle of returning if it didn&#x27;t work.  My natural brows are sparse and so light that they&#x27;re almost colorless and I have a hard time finding a brow product that works.  L&#x27;Oreal Paris Brow Stylist Sculptor, 355 Blonde has been the closest so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ulta sales person knew what she was doing and told me that with a more golden blonde hair color I should go with the blonde.  The taupe goes better on those with ash blonde and that it would look greenish on me and, after trying both, she was right.  I bought the blonde and am very, very happy with the product.  I finally have brows that look natural and full and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it running or fading over the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little of this goes a long way and it can be easy to over-apply.  I dip the brush in very lightly and then dab on the back of my hand in order to control the amount and avoid applying too heavily. This little pot will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brow filler!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a taupe brow liner for years and began applying Anastasia&#x27;s blonde brow gel over it, just to get a more natural look.  Worked really well, but I&#x27;ve moved to a very humid climate and it seems to wear off easier.  I thought the Dipbrow Pomade would stay on better and it does...really does!  It&#x27;s just such a darker taupe, my brows look kind of fake now.  Great product...really great.  Just got the wrong color.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. I can&#x27;t see myself ever running out of this stuff. Seriously, just a quick &amp;#34;tap&amp;#34; with the tip of an angled brush, and there&#x27;s plenty to get a couple good strokes on my eyebrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not as easy to use as a pencil or powder, but this stuff has staying power. I have fair skin and light brown hair, and taupe is just slightly maybe a little too dark, but still wearable.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!!  I&#x27;m blonde and this color does look good.  I was fearful that it would be too dark but it&#x27;s just perfect.  Be sure to purchase the applicator brush as I use both the brush and the wire end when applying.  I would never ever use anything else.  This will last a million years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look younger.  Really.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well, stays on all day and fills in the shape nicely, I found the sponge applicators for eyeshadow&lt;br /&gt;Work best for me as I can blend it easier. I bought the taupe and it is light enough to loo match well with my blonde hair and&lt;br /&gt;Light eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day with no touchups! color just right! LOVE all anastasia products!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but Anastasia has perfected the formula for flawless brows. The taupe is very good for ash to platinum blondes. Im light skinned with very light blonde hair. I use this color lightly with my spooley brush and I think it matches perfectly with my coloring. I&#x27;d definitely recommend being light-handed when using this product, as it can be a bit on the dark side. The beauty of this color though is that you CAN make it as dark or as light as you please.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! This stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge. Great color for medium-dark blondes.</li>
            <li> Great product! A little pricey but we&#x27;ll worth as it will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works very well. Easy to apply, I used the ardell double sided brush and it worked well. Doesn&#x27;t smudge and the color is awesome, I have very blonde hair almost platinum and I got the taupe and it goes great not too dark and not orangey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;after just a few uses with this stuff it became very hard and very dry and did not apply well. i was super happy with this product until this. i am very disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of great reviews about ABH dipbrow and decided it was time to take the plunge after struggling to find a drugstore color match. My brows look perfect, and I&#x27;m very happy with how natural they look. I was hesitant about purchasing this looking at the cost, but it was well worth it, and that small amount of product will last me a very very very long time. When it does run out, you can bet I&#x27;ll repurchase.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product because I was searching through youtube eyebrow tutorials and a ton of girls were using it, so I decided to look it up and do some research on it. I have very light colored and sparse eyebrows, they are very patchy and bald in some areas so I&#x27;ve always penciled them in but a product I was using before was discontinued so I was worried about finding a new one. Another concern of mine was the fact that I am going on a camping trip for three days in about a month so I needed something waterproof that will stay on for a while! Anyway, I just tried this for the first time last night and it is AWESOME. I seriously wish I found it sooner. To find the right color for me, I looked at google images and saw what it looked like on other women who had tried it which really helped finding the color. It even stayed on overnight and I always sleep all over my face and it didn&#x27;t rub off. I would definitely recommend this. It took a couple tries to get it just perfect, so I would say to practice a little bit before you wear it out. But it looks so much more real/natural than what I was using before and it stays on all day/night. I really am happy with this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE*** I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now I think and I am still so in love. I tried Wunderbrow but nothing compares to Anastasia Dipbrow. Never change, I love you so much!!!</li>
            <li> Really good product and stays on forever!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Water resistant/proof.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic and definitely lives up to the hype. My brows have never looked better! As a blonde, I&#x27;ve often struggled to find a brow product that wasn&#x27;t too red toned or too ashy &amp; now I&#x27;ve finally found one. The Anastasia Dipbrow Pomade in Taupe goes perfectly with my hair shade. It&#x27;s amazing for filling in sparse areas and for thickening and defining the brows. It stays put all day (sweat proof &amp; water proof) and the tiniest bit of product goes a long way. I&#x27;ve used this on clients as well and they&#x27;ve loved the result.&lt;br /&gt;This does require a bit of precision to apply, so I recommend using a very small and thin angled brush. It&#x27;s my favorite part of my makeup routine at the moment.</li>
            <li> Anastasia colors are as expected....it works beautifully on eyebrows.  You only need a tiny bit, this will last a very long time. The Pomade cause no skin irritation...pure quality ingredients.!</li>
            <li> First off: This product is a bit tricky, so I&#x27;d beware, if you&#x27;re buying pomade for the first time.  I use a small double-sided brow brush (the Anastasia brush duo #12) and just barely dip the tip, and it will cover the good part of a brow.  Pomade goes on VERY heavily, so it&#x27;s important to take very little at a time and apply with a light touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the product itself: Awesome.  This product is very light (unlike a lot of brow pencils) so that it doesn&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;ve done my brows, and the results look awesome--super natural-looking, although I&#x27;ve seen people accomplish more stylized brows with the same product, too.  It&#x27;s very easy to get full and lasting coverage with very little effort, but it also isn&#x27;t hard to remove with a little bit of makeup remover, which is the best of both worlds.  Definitely treat your face to this pomade.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Bought the taupe because I have dirty blonde hair. I didn&#x27;t see the other reviews that said it has a slight green tint :/... It does!! Went to ulta and purchased the soft brown which was perfect. The #12 brush works like a charm with this product. Highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After five months of everyday use I finally ran out. So in my opinion $18 is a steal for this product.</li>
            <li> This truly is the best eyebrow filler for my overtweazed brows. I have light brown hair and bought the taupe. It stays on all day and even survives a dip or 2 in the pool! Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This color is basically gray/brown. Not at all how I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Love love love this will buy again</li>
            <li> I am torn between giving this product 4 or 5 stars.  I LOVE Dipbrow Pomade so that&#x27;s why I want to give it a 5, but I am slightly disappointed by the Taupe color I recently ordered which makes me want to give a 4. I have been using the blonde shade for many months now and I really like it.  After reading reviews about the taupe being very versatile however, I decided I would try it. I expected there to be some kind of difference between the blonde and the taupe but truthfully, I don&#x27;t see any at all.  Maybe I am blind but the two shades look the same both in the container and on my brows. Just disappointed that it&#x27;s not what I expected.  I will continue to use it though and have plenty now to last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> Tried this for the first time last night on a blonde friend with extremely fair and thin eye brows and the Taupe was perfect to add color, shape and depth. I used the Anatasia brow brush to apply.  She was really happy with the outcome stating it looked really natural for her skin tone and hair color.  She doesn&#x27;t normally wear makeup or fill in her eyebrows, She texted me this morning to say she received lots of compliments whilst out last nite</li>
            <li> Nice product wrong color sent.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazeballs</li>
            <li> My hair varies from light blonde to platinum to silver and I&#x27;m very fair-skinned. I felt like this is too dark and bold for very fair hair, unless that&#x27;s the look you&#x27;re going for. However, the texture is amazing and it goes on very smooth and even.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a brow product that lasts throughout the entire day! Another plus is that you get so much for your money - a little goes a long way. As an esthetician that works on brows daily, I can say that this is my current favorite (and has been for several months now) brow shaping and filling product and recommend it to all my clients.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color (taupe).  Great with my blonde hair, and lasts all night (or day, if you&#x27;re wearing it during the day).  Goes on smoothly and does not rub off.</li>
            <li> It was in the correct packaging but the product was actually in blonde instead of taupe .</li>
            <li> Like all Ana products, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow pomade from Anastasia.  Should be used very lightly as the pigments are a bit dense.  I would like to recommend the Anastasia brush with spoolie #12 to apply.  I&#x27;m a blonde with light skin and blue eyes.  I didn&#x27;t get the blonde color because I was under the impression that it was more suitable for strawberry blonde and light red.  The taupe is more for lighter and darker blondes without the red tint.  I know this by researching the internet.  Great price and beauty product.  Good for professionals as well.</li>
            <li> Most amazing brow liner/filler EVER!! Taupe is a bit to ashy for me so I ordered the medium brown too, love!!</li>
            <li> I have this in taupe and it perfectly matches! I use a small elf concealer brush to apply, which nmaybe isn&#x27;t the correct thing to do, but it makes it very accurate. This stuff lasts forever and a little bit goes a long way. Way more powerful and precise than a pencil. I get compliments whenever i use this. love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I love it and it sure met my needs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I found the taupe to be darker than I like. No red to it though and that&#x27;s good. It lasts a long time, too.</li>
            <li> I like it but too bad it does last long on the end of my eyebrow, compared to the eyebrow powder product I had before (I got it from Taiwan and it was from Chic Choc. The best eyebrow powder in the world).&lt;br /&gt;I think I probably need to use some other pencil form of eyebrow product on my eyebrow first, so this would stay on the end of my eyebrow...&lt;br /&gt;overall, I still like this brand and their products.</li>
            <li> It was a gift to my daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it says it goes on very easily And it stays on. She is very happy. It arrived on time.</li>
            <li> No orangey tones whatsoever. Goes on beautifully. Stays all day. Fell asleep in my makeup and it was still perfect.</li>
            <li> I use a hard, narrow eyeliner brush instead of a brow brush, and I can achieve some really great results with this.  Very natural.  Stays put all day.</li>
            <li> Love love love! I have dark blonde to light brown hair with very light blonde eyebrows. I purchased the &amp;#34;Taupe&amp;#34;. I know the struggle! I have been using ABH brow pro pallet in &amp;#34; brunette&amp;#34; for the past few years and loved it. But this is way easier to use and play around with! Easy to build up with the pomade for a more dramatic flare if you want. A little does go a long way. This will probably last me a pretty long time! Worth the $$.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very blonde and was afraid this would be too dark but is perfect.</li>
            <li> This pomade is creamy aand easy to use.  Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!! I got a sample of this at Sephora and then took the plunge and bought it on Amazon. I am so in love with this. Easy to apply and stays put all day. Glides on super smooth. I apply with the Anastasia brow brush with spoolie. I have a medium to fair skin with a cool undertone and light brown hair with blonde high lights and this is the perfect color for me. I will definitely buy this again when I run out, which probably won&#x27;t be soon since a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and will purchase it again</li>
            <li> The texture is amaze and budge-proof and makes my brows look really full, however the color is a bit green...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...was a little weary purchasing this for the very first time online without being able to test it but it is great and lives up to the hype. I was worried that the taupe might be too dark (I have dirty blond hair) but it is perfect. Also, it seems as though it will last me a long time. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of ABH products!</li>
            <li> I love this!  It&#x27;s a nice shade for my strawberry blonde hair, and stays all day.  An angled brush is a MUST for application.  My only complaint is that I feel the product doesn&#x27;t go on great unless there is a build up of product on the brush.  Otherwise, a great product.</li>
            <li> This dipbrow pomade seemed really light at first but once you try it on it&#x27;s a lot darker and more universal of a shade :) it&#x27;s perfect for everyone&#x27;s natural hair colour.</li>
            <li> Best Eyebrow product I&#x27;ve ever used!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blonde and this is a little too dark, but I can use it. Stays on all day.</li>
            <li> This is the consistency of creamy pot lipstick. When you apply it to your brows it looks like you applied dark gray lipstick to them.  Visualize that!!!</li>
            <li> First time, I looked pretty scary. Luckily, I had the day off, so I sat in front of my vanity mirror applying, wiping off, then applying again. I finally got it right on the fourth try. It can be tricky until you get the feel for the amount needed to do the job. I now just barely tap the angled brush (Anastasia #12  spoolie/brush) into the product, then dab it quickly on a tissue to soften the color. I bought Auburn, but I&#x27;ve recently colored my hair to a deep, rich dark cherry shade and am wondering if I should check out another color. So far, though, this is working fine with my hair, so I guess I will use it up (if I don&#x27;t die first; this stuff will last FOREVER, you need so little of it). You have to sweep in tiny strokes; I start with the arch, then feather out to the tips. I do the front of the brows last, and then I feather in the color, hardly ever having to dip the brush more than once for both brows. Once that&#x27;s done, I take a white eye pencil and clean up the under-arch area, making a defined, clean line and blend it in. Then I use a dab of High Brow (from High Beam) highlighter stick to give the brow bone some subtle sparkle. Best eyebrow product I have ever tried, and I am in my sixties (hence, my joke about possible not living long enough to use up the pot). Recommend.  But better to go to a store to have someone match the correct shade. It&#x27;s hard to choose for yourself merely from swatches.</li>
            <li> This is a great brow pomade. It goes on smoothly and wipes off easily if you need it to. I bought the taupe color, and I have medium-brown hair. It&#x27;s the perfect color - I think the darker brown colors would have been too dark, even though they technically match my hair more closely. (My coloring and hair is similar to Natalie Portman, for reference.)</li>
            <li> I have dark blonde hair and light brown eyebrows, this color was off, it almost had a slightly orange tint to it? I don&#x27;t know but it was pretty obvious when I would wear it and i&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered the taupe color because online it looks brown, when I tried the product it turned my eyebrow hairs gray!</li>
            <li> After my friend raved about this product, I had to give it a try. I watched a YouTube video on how to apply it because I didn&#x27;t want to put too much or too little, which I found very helpful. I really love how very little goes a long way but helps define eyebrows nicely. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wish there had been a swatch on skin or something similar, as in a photo of the product not in the package, as it is darker than I expected. Stays on all day, which is great!</li>
            <li> Loved it so much I also got it for a friend, and she loves it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taupe color is a good neutral tone, not reddish as it seems in the photo.  Also, it has a softer effect than a pencil, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dip your angle brush in the product, then wipe against your hand to take off the excess.  You need only a wee bit to apply to the brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews caution that it takes a lot of practice to learn to use this stuff - I dunno, it didn&#x27;t seem so hard to master to me.</li>
            <li> Perfect shade for my brown eyebrows!</li>
            <li> Great product - stays put - looks natural - love it!!  Do use  a light touch  and a brush to blend when finished to soften the look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into &amp;#34;instagram eyebrows&amp;#34;...those gradient looking things with the really sharp line underneath, often accompanied with concealer over and under them.  YIKES!!!  Can you say &amp;#34;DRAG QUEEN?&amp;#34; This is probably a good product if that&#x27;s the unnatural look you&#x27;re going for...which I am definitely NOT!!!</li>
            <li> Where has this product been all my life? The taupe is perfect.  I have medium brown (level 5) hair and didn&#x27;t want something too reddish or too dark.  So easy to apply and to control.  I also ordered the Anastasia brush, which I would say is a must.  This product fills in areas that I over plucked way back when, and looks reasonably natural. Stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t budge.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different things.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> Lasts all day, no more disappearing brow product. I have medium/dark brown hair with highlights and do not like to darken my brows, just fill them in. I bought the taupe color and it is just right. Use a small amount with a light touch and it works well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!!! I have dark brown hair, and this works wonderful! So glad I purchased!!!</li>
            <li> Best brow product everrrr!!</li>
            <li> I have searched for a brow product that will hold up to the hot, humid conditions in Florida. I have tried many powders and pencils but they never lasted.&lt;br /&gt;But, this Dipbrow is the best thing I have found, bar none.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on and bought it from  the Sephora store in my local JC Penneys.  My hair is medium brown and what brows I have left are almost black.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to find that the Taupe shade was the best match (the blond shade would have worked too).  All of the brown shades were too dark.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way and the matching brush (#12 at $18) is the tool I also bought for the application.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pricey but it looks like it will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dark blond to light brown and 47 years old....my eyebrows have nearly disappeared these last 3 years and nothing can touch this product for natural looking brows. Ive tried powders, pencils, waxes, and every combination in between! If you are tired of searching for the right product in a natural shade, well Anastasia has got you! I personally like to do the inner brow with the blonde pomade (just a lighter ever so slightly caramel taupe) and finish off the wings with the slightly darker taupe shade for a more natural gradient effect! Its late and Ive already washed my face, but I may post a photo here soon ...just to prove how natural this product looks!</li>
            <li> It applies smooth, feels lightweight, lasts all day, and looks great. My brows have never looked better. They can be soft and full or sharp and en point with this. I would like to try lighter shade IN The future, But The Darker shades like this can be toned down simply by combing through.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok. I&#x27;ll stick with Brow Wiz.</li>
            <li> Anastasia is perfect as always</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS DIPBROW.  Looks very natural (I have light eyebrows and they&#x27;re tricky to fill in without looking weird) and stays on all day. Highly recommend.</li>
