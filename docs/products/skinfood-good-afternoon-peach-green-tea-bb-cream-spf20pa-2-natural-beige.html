    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best BB Cream I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>I am a tea lover, so this was perfect.</li>
            <li>It also came with some great samples!</li>
            <li>smells great</li>
            <li>Love this product goes on even and looks great all day!</li>
            <li>I have relatively good skin</li>
            <li>so using a moisturizer before or along with it is a good idea anyway.  </li>
            <li>There was no chalkiness, the scent was not overpowering, and it provides good coverage.</li>
            <li>The product is good but the package broke from the bottom.</li>
            <li>This smells good, feels good and does good for your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very matte, does a great job at flawless foundation coverage, and smells very nice.</li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s a great, healthy BB, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ideal for those with oily skin with a light dusting of powder over the oily areas.</li>
            <li>Smells great ok coverage but broke me out</li>
            <li>(I mix it with my lotion and that works nicely)</li>
            <li>and it does smell really nice and peachy.</li>
            <li>nice</li>
            <li>Easy application and good match with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>It has a light pleasant smell that I also like.  </li>
            <li>i like this bb cream, smell good ,and easy to apply on your face.</li>
            <li>Pretty good!</li>
            <li>Also nice to have SPF on in this heat wave :)</li>
            <li>Plus, it has a light, sweet, fresh scent that is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>It was an okay BB cream.</li>
            <li>I like this BB more than the Peach Sake one.</li>
            <li>This is a bit more matte</li>
            <li>I habitually buy the lightest shade in many things and then listen to everyone tell me how tired/sick/</li>
            <li>Plus since it is a darker shade it has more of an orange to it than the cooler #1 shade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been able to use it</li>
            <li>and I have to exfoliate more often because my skin cracks with use of the product,</li>
            <li>Smells lovely, is not oily or greasy, &amp; applies nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>Okay, this is so much better than tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Make sure you check how light/tone the bb cream</li>
            <li>but I found this one at a better price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it has sunscreen, too!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love this product; the color is perfect for me;  quality is not greasy or heavy; i where my serum and then put this on top.  </li>
            <li>Peach Sake BB is way too light coverage and has more sunscreen to foundation ratio.</li>
            <li>It is very lightly scented but is more noticeable during application and doesn&#x27;t last all day, which I liked because scents give me a headache.  </li>
            <li>I look, so I thought I would buy the #2 shade since commenters said the #1 was too light for them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>light wear for all day.</li>
            <li>was thinking about trying the red bean BB cream which would probably have a heavier, muskier kind of scent, so I&#x27;m glad I chose this one instead.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really see if it has made my skin any better, but it works well as a foundation.</li>
            <li>new favorite BB right now is Holika Petit Pore Control BB.</li>
            <li>It covers pretty well and gives a sense of elasticity.</li>
            <li>This is my first BB cream.</li>
            <li>I have used many BB creams and this is higher pigment, so make sure you get a shade lighter than you normally do because these seem to run dark.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking at Skinfood products online for a while and some of them were pretty pricey</li>
            <li>Gives a nice all over complexion, a very good base product.</li>
            <li>usually wear shades that are titled &amp;#34;natural beige&amp;#34; so I am fair but not porcelain or anything.</li>
            <li>I like that it is easy enough to apply and blend.</li>
            <li>The packaging is super-cute and the product is nice and even, leaving a slightly matte finish on the skin.</li>
            <li>If you have large pores, the cream does sit in your pores, so I avoid too much of it on my nose because you can tell I&#x27;m wearing something.</li>
            <li>but it does mean there isn&#x27;t as much pigment and the makeup wears off much more easily.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t look like I have heavy makeup/foundation on, but makes my face look smooth and even.</li>
            <li>It really helps with my pores.</li>
            <li>The cream is very drying</li>
            <li>and it really worked well.  </li>
            <li>Ive experimented with most bb creams drugstore, high end and international brands, and this is by far the most long lasting blendable bb cream.</li>
            <li>With SPF and high quality &amp;#34;ingredients,&amp;#34; it does me wonders.</li>
            <li>but I thought it would be worth mentioning in a review in case anyone was having similar issues deciding between the two colors.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>far as the product, it is a really nice thick consistency</li>
            <li>I will most likely re-purchase this BB cream over some other&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I plan to use this on hot summer days only.</li>
            <li>I had to water it down with lotion to get it to go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it because the cream is thick</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I mainly chose it for the green tea extract and peach scent.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t stay on all day and makes my face a little oily than normal.</li>
            <li> This shade was far too dark.</li>
            <li> However, I find that if I use this for a few days straight, my skin will get very dry and get flaky.</li>
            <li> Will try other skinfood products in the future.</li>
            <li> Made me look pale and yellow.</li>
            <li> and I have to use twice as much on my skin or thin it with moisturizer to get the effects of the previous BB cream I was using.</li>
            <li> Delivery take a couple of weeks due to seller&#x27;s location at China.</li>
            <li> thing I would change is I&#x27;d like a slightly darker tint</li>
            <li> so a little works for quite a lot</li>
            <li> It also matched my skin-tone well, which is usually a tough feat considering my mixed background and the fact that this product came all the way from Korea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about mattefying since I have to mix it with lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t particularly care for the scent (I am used to I unscented) and disappointed that in spite of it being Korean-made, it does not match my skin tone...</li>
            <li> but I like wearing foundation on cold months instead of face powder.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> smells great do not want to put on face though gave as gift to smeone as color of bb does not suit my skintone</li>
            <li> It was an okay BB cream. It covers pretty well and gives a sense of elasticity. But it doesn&#x27;t stay on all day and makes my face a little oily than normal.</li>
            <li> love this product; the color is perfect for me;  quality is not greasy or heavy; i where my serum and then put this on top.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I like this BB more than the Peach Sake one. Peach Sake BB is way too light coverage and has more sunscreen to foundation ratio. This is a bit more matte but I still don&#x27;t get the amount of coverage I want. Though it&#x27;s a great, healthy BB, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new favorite BB right now is Holika Petit Pore Control BB. It&#x27;s very matte, does a great job at flawless foundation coverage, and smells very nice. It really helps with my pores.</li>
            <li> This is my first BB cream. Decided to try a Korean brand since I am Asian. To me this bb cream is nothing different than a foundation in terms of coverage. I have relatively good skin but I like wearing foundation on cold months instead of face powder. I have only been wearing it a week and I don&#x27;t really see if it has made my skin any better, but it works well as a foundation. I like that it is easy enough to apply and blend. However, I don&#x27;t particularly care for the scent (I am used to I unscented) and disappointed that in spite of it being Korean-made, it does not match my skin tone... Too pinkish. I may try something else after this runs out.</li>
            <li> I habitually buy the lightest shade in many things and then listen to everyone tell me how tired/sick/etc I look, so I thought I would buy the #2 shade since commenters said the #1 was too light for them.&lt;br /&gt;I usually wear shades that are titled &amp;#34;natural beige&amp;#34; so I am fair but not porcelain or anything. This shade was far too dark. Plus since it is a darker shade it has more of an orange to it than the cooler #1 shade.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been able to use it (I mix it with my lotion and that works nicely) but it does mean there isn&#x27;t as much pigment and the makeup wears off much more easily. I realize this is my error but I thought it would be worth mentioning in a review in case anyone was having similar issues deciding between the two colors.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product, it is a really nice thick consistency so a little works for quite a lot and it does smell really nice and peachy. I&#x27;m not sure about mattefying since I have to mix it with lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to try this again but it would have to be in a lighter shade!</li>
            <li> I have used many BB creams and this is higher pigment, so make sure you get a shade lighter than you normally do because these seem to run dark.  I don&#x27;t love it because the cream is thick and I have to use twice as much on my skin or thin it with moisturizer to get the effects of the previous BB cream I was using. The cream is very drying and I have to exfoliate more often because my skin cracks with use of the product, so using a moisturizer before or along with it is a good idea anyway.

It is very lightly scented but is more noticeable during application and doesn&#x27;t last all day, which I liked because scents give me a headache.  Will try other skinfood products in the future. -Valerie [...]</li>
            <li> Love this product goes on even and looks great all day!</li>
            <li> Easy application and good match with my skin tone.  I used this after my morning skincare routine  and it really worked well.  There was no chalkiness, the scent was not overpowering, and it provides good coverage.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice all over complexion, a very good base product. Also nice to have SPF on in this heat wave :) Smells lovely, is not oily or greasy, &amp; applies nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I would change is I&#x27;d like a slightly darker tint</li>
            <li> I like tone, it match my skin. I like the texture, and I like the smell. Delivery take a couple of weeks due to seller&#x27;s location at China.</li>
            <li> Best BB Cream I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Ive experimented with most bb creams drugstore, high end and international brands, and this is by far the most long lasting blendable bb cream. Ideal for those with oily skin with a light dusting of powder over the oily areas. Would definately buy again!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a BB cream that suits my skin.  I like this one because it&#x27;s a matte BB cream; and I have combo skin &amp; tend to get quite oily in my t-zone.  This particular BB cream works and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face so much as other matte BB creams have.  It has a light pleasant smell that I also like.  I will most likely re-purchase this BB cream over some other&#x27;s I have tried in the skin food brand.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make me break out, but went on chalky.  I had to water it down with lotion to get it to go on smoothly.  Made me look pale and yellow.</li>
            <li> i like this bb cream, smell good ,and easy to apply on your face. light wear for all day. nice</li>
            <li> Smells great ok coverage but broke me out</li>
            <li> Okay, this is so much better than tinted moisturizer. This smells good, feels good and does good for your skin. With SPF and high quality &amp;#34;ingredients,&amp;#34; it does me wonders. Make sure you check how light/tone the bb cream (you can find the color tone in blogs).</li>
            <li> Pretty good! Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t look like I have heavy makeup/foundation on, but makes my face look smooth and even.</li>
            <li> I have been looking at Skinfood products online for a while and some of them were pretty pricey but I found this one at a better price and I mainly chose it for the green tea extract and peach scent. I am a tea lover, so this was perfect. The packaging is super-cute and the product is nice and even, leaving a slightly matte finish on the skin. Plus, it has a light, sweet, fresh scent that is very pleasant. It also matched my skin-tone well, which is usually a tough feat considering my mixed background and the fact that this product came all the way from Korea. I&#x27;m glad it has sunscreen, too!&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking about trying the red bean BB cream which would probably have a heavier, muskier kind of scent, so I&#x27;m glad I chose this one instead. It also came with some great samples!</li>
            <li> This BB cream does what it claims and will help with oil control. However, I find that if I use this for a few days straight, my skin will get very dry and get flaky. I like the scent and the way it feels on my skin. I plan to use this on hot summer days only.</li>
            <li> The product is good but the package broke from the bottom.</li>
