            <li>I have used this product and it really is very good.  </li>
            <li>Great for men with medium length hair.  </li>
            <li>Just what I wanted at a great price.</li>
            <li>Now I still use it, because it provides very effective lift and volume ESP on the crown.  </li>
            <li>and this product is excellent for giving me more volume and body.</li>
            <li>Great for my fine hair!!</li>
            <li>Pantene Pro-V for fine hair performed the best!</li>
            <li>Good value/price.  </li>
            <li>This root lifter was a great find for the price, provided the right amount of lift and provided a perfect body shape  *</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still effective.  </li>
            <li>I love this Pantene product because it gives my very fine hair body.</li>
            <li>Good product for thinning hair, especially older women.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice too, and not too strong like some products.</li>
            <li>Nothing else is as effective for my fine, mid-length hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this alcohol based, but it sure seems like it.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great spray product.</li>
            <li>It works but not my favorite root lifter</li>
            <li>Great product, no perfume odor and not too much stiffness like hair spay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having better luck with mousses.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>you decide to purchase this hair gel and do not mind when you get it, then get it from this seller for sure.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thinning hair, about shoulder length</li>
            <li>Originally I bought this at a Walmart</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good that I have a back up bottle</li>
            <li>It holds my super fine hair very well, and lasts through the day.  </li>
            <li>But it provides very good lift and the appearance of volume for my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair and this stuff really does work.  </li>
            <li>It does an excellent job on my very fine hair of adding body, but it makes my hair a little bit stiff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a beauty product junkie, and since I have fine, thin hair, I&#x27;m always on the hunt for great volume-boosting products.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced, too.</li>
            <li>and it did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>This really works.  </li>
            <li>It is an OK product, but I have used other spray gels, (herbal essences and suave) that are much better at keeping the frizz away and they are a little cheaper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been looking for a gel spray that I could use with velcro rollers, that wouldn&#x27;t be sticky/flaky but would still have a decent hold.  </li>
            <li>It gives lots of body to fine, limp hair without any weight.  </li>
            <li>A good buy for anyone, but may not work for those with super thick hair...will have to hear if it does work for thick hair gals</li>
            <li>reaaly lifts my hair and I have blonde hair that is very fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have thin baby fine hair that I am loosing as I am old.  </li>

            <li> reaaly lifts my hair and I have blonde hair that is very fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thin baby fine hair that I am loosing as I am old.  </li>
            <li> I have tried using a lot of this, but only regretted it when my hair was crispy dry.  </li>
            <li> Comb into damp hair, re-comb in a few minutes for soft hold.</li>
            <li> but they only weight down my hair and it is still sparce and flat.  </li>
            <li> I tried 4 different brands when my previous root lifter was no longer being made.  </li>
            <li> This lifter is the only thing I find that works to give me a little lift to my style.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t happen with other products.</li>
            <li> It makes my thin hair look fuller and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 2 star rating, not because it is a horrible product, but because I feel the company should include that little (very important) &amp;#34;for short hair&amp;#34; detail in the name of the product so those of us with longer hair don&#x27;t waste our money.</li>
            <li> I just much less, like 5 or 6 little sprays,and then, according to directions, rub it in my hair with fingertips.  </li>
            <li> I use this as a finishing spray everyday.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not worried about excessive dryness.</li>
            <li> but I usually have oily hair</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> Does the job, but I find my hair looks dirty the next day.  </li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve experience a lot of breakage and I wonder if this product contributes to that.</li>
            <li> the gel has become difficult to find, and I wonder if it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
            <li> It is nearly impossible to find in stores anymore, so I order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I always go to Amazon when I cannot find things I have used or heard about that I cannot find in stores and have never been  disappointed.</li>
            <li> I spray it at the base of the roller so that I&#x27;m not covering my hair in product.  </li>

            <li> Arrived on time and well packaged.  Does the job, but I find my hair looks dirty the next day.  This doesn&#x27;t happen with other products.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thinning hair, about shoulder length and this product is excellent for giving me more volume and body. Will definitely buy again. It does contain alcohol which may lead to dryness, but I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day so I&#x27;m not worried about excessive dryness. Good product for thinning hair, especially older women. Reasonably priced, too.</li>
            <li> Great for my fine hair!!</li>
            <li> Works Great!  I could no longer find this at the store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a gel spray that I could use with velcro rollers, that wouldn&#x27;t be sticky/flaky but would still have a decent hold.  This product works.

I just much less, like 5 or 6 little sprays,and then, according to directions, rub it in my hair with fingertips.  It&#x27;s still effective.  Frankly it&#x27;s still drying.  But it provides very good lift and the appearance of volume for my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great spray product.</li>
            <li> the gel has become difficult to find, and I wonder if it&#x27;s been discontinued. It does an excellent job on my very fine hair of adding body, but it makes my hair a little bit stiff. Lately I&#x27;ve experience a lot of breakage and I wonder if this product contributes to that.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to start reading this</li>
            <li> I have been using Pantene root lifter for years now and I keep coming back to recorder it so it must be working.&lt;br /&gt;It reaaly lifts my hair and I have blonde hair that is very fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair and this stuff really does work.  It makes my hair look thicker and fuller.  Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> It works but not my favorite root lifter</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my wife; she loves this product!</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.  Great product, no perfume odor and not too much stiffness like hair spay.  Great for men with medium length hair.  Good value/price.  Comb into damp hair, re-comb in a few minutes for soft hold.</li>
            <li> I use this as a finishing spray everyday. It smooths my frizzies and gives me some volume @ the same time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beauty product junkie, and since I have fine, thin hair, I&#x27;m always on the hunt for great volume-boosting products.  This is one product I&#x27;m never without!  It adds a lot of volume to my hair without drying it out.  When I don&#x27;t use it, my hair doesn&#x27;t come out the same.  I even take it with me when I travel!  Definetely recommend!</li>
            <li> I tried 4 different brands when my previous root lifter was no longer being made.  Pantene Pro-V for fine hair performed the best!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it until after I purchased it but the instructions state that it is for short hair.  Since I had already purchased it I gave it a try on my waist length hair and it did absolutely nothing.  I&#x27;m giving this a 2 star rating, not because it is a horrible product, but because I feel the company should include that little (very important) &amp;#34;for short hair&amp;#34; detail in the name of the product so those of us with longer hair don&#x27;t waste our money.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped on my baby-fine hair. I&#x27;m having better luck with mousses.</li>
            <li> Originally I bought this at a Walmart but now I cannot find it in any store.  I have thin baby fine hair that I am loosing as I am old.  This lifter is the only thing I find that works to give me a little lift to my style.  I have not found it to be drying but I usually have oily hair and I do not wash it every day.  I have shelves of volume moussse, shampoo, sprays and gels but they only weight down my hair and it is still sparce and flat.  This really works.  I always go to Amazon when I cannot find things I have used or heard about that I cannot find in stores and have never been  disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ll never be without it again. It makes my thin hair look fuller and soft.It&#x27;s so good that I have a back up bottle</li>
            <li> I love this Pantene product because it gives my very fine hair body. It is nearly impossible to find in stores anymore, so I order it from Amazon. Nothing else is as effective for my fine, mid-length hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product and it really is very good.  It gives lots of body to fine, limp hair without any weight.  It leaves hair shiny and feeling a lot thicker than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to purchase this hair gel and do not mind when you get it, then get it from this seller for sure.  However if you would like to receive your gel before the Christmas Holidays, purchase it elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still waiting in Houston</li>
            <li> I love it. Just what I wanted at a great price.</li>
            <li> It is an OK product, but I have used other spray gels, (herbal essences and suave) that are much better at keeping the frizz away and they are a little cheaper.</li>
    </ol>
