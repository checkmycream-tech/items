            <li>I am really loving this Anti Aging face cream!  </li>
            <li>It is an excellent product with outstanding customer service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use this, which says a lot as I try many creams in search of the perfect one.  </li>
            <li>To be honest!</li>
            <li>The instructions say that you&#x27;ll see more results over time, but I&#x27;m already seeing great results!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was sent this product for review purposes but my review is 100% my own opinion!</li>
            <li>All in all, I am very pleased with Andre Lorent Beautiful Cream.</li>
            <li>I am loving this face cream!</li>
            <li>I am also very happy with the fact that it is paraben,SLS and additive free!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the most anti-aging best thing in the world, however I did already buy one for my mother to try.</li>
            <li>and I can see a remarkable difference in the hydration of my skin - but</li>
            <li>even more impressive is that my friends and family do, too!!</li>
            <li>This was a gift ( I&#x27;m a man, I dont use creams :) ) and the person who received this is actually very happy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight on my skin and has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>I did feel a pleasant tightening of the skin that it was working.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and is moisturizing as well.  </li>
            <li>it does not leave my skin feeling greasy and it has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Many people don&#x27;t want any kind of fragrance so this is probably the perfect anti aging formula for them.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for a good face cream that doesn&#x27;t feel like I am wearing a mask.</li>
            <li>Waited to post review to make a fair assessment.</li>
            <li>Feels good on skin.</li>
            <li>It still a good moisturizer, just not all that people talk , happened to me.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and then found a good buy on some retinol cream.</li>
            <li>but I think this product for the price has some really good ingredients.</li>
            <li>probably not but cream feels good on my face</li>
            <li>Seems to be doing a good job.</li>

            <li>The first month I loved the cream.</li>
            <li>Strange name for a creme, but over all very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>My first impression was a  good one.</li>
            <li>It feels good to find a reasonably priced product that is made in the U.S.A. and doesn&#x27;t have harmful additives!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy, and I am excited to begin seeing an improvement and  difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance!</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it does have any kind of scent whatsoever to it and blends in fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>and it is perfect for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin quickly and gives you a nice glow.</li>

            <li>When I first put it on it felt a bit &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; but it soaked in quickly and felt great</li>
            <li>Their products are SLS, paraben and cruelty free which is something that is very important to me when looking for an quality skin product.</li>
            <li>This is my new face cream for sure!!</li>
            <li>This is the best face cream I have ever used on my dry aging face!</li>
            <li>This works fine, but what I like most was</li>
            <li>but I do notice an improvement in the fine lines, I am sure it will work on the others with extended use.</li>
            <li>Overall - pleasant!</li>
            <li>It has done an awesome job moisturizing my very dry face.</li>
            <li>This cream goes on smooth on the skin, absorbs very quickly, and makes your skin feel very smooth.  </li>
            <li>so I was hesitant to try it at first but must say I am very glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>Great for my highly sensitive skin (eczema prone).  </li>
            <li>After the 5 days, I did notice my skin a lot more smooth and softer.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth but doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy which I love.  </li>
            <li>I just received this product today, first thing that I noticed that it is vertically fragrant free, and that&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was very pleased from the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>So far i&#x27;m seeing great results.</li>

            <li>It goes on smoothly and has a nice mild scent.</li>
            <li>My new anti-aging face cream by Andre Lorent is so amazing that I am canceling my monthly Nerium product immediately!  </li>
            <li>Which is remarkable, considering I live in the desert.</li>
            <li>This face cream has a nice smooth consistency that absorbs into the skin easily and quickly without a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>far as face creams go, this one is very nice.</li>
            <li>Very lightly scented as well, almost fragrance free it is so light.</li>
            <li>Very nice, but my wrinkles are too far gone to be erased.  </li>

            <li>Im pretty sure this is going to be your holy grail!</li>
            <li>Will continue purchasing this wonderful product and try other products too.</li>
            <li>It is fragrance free and great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It would be easy to walk by this in the store, when it is one that should be tried.</li>
            <li>It washes off easily and afterward my face still feels moisturized.</li>
            <li>This cream will help me feel more attractive, without the deep ruts of those mouth wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I ordered more for my family members to use.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the fact that it is not greasy as I tend to breakout easily.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and absorbs well with a non-greasy feel.</li>
            <li>PRODUCT WAS EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li>but this has a very mild smell.</li>
            <li>I like this because it is easy to apply and feels like it does moisturize my face.</li>
            <li>Seller was very quick in responding to this review offering a refund.</li>
            <li>with anything, I have written pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s of the product so that it is easy to see why I rated this product a 5 out of 5 stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels so clean and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Makeup goes on easily</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t rub in easily and does no provide any moisture.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I cant wait to continue using it more in the future.</li>
            <li>It is nice  (and probably a good idea) to stat using a quality facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Like that it does not have a strong odor.</li>
            <li>I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a really strong smell like a lot of creams.</li>
            <li>(I do not like when cream are strong smelling).I</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it since my skin is so sensitive to many products, but I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products and this is nothing special in my opinion...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d certainly recommend it as a good, clean feeling moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and absorbs quickly into your skin with no greasy residue after.</li>
            <li>It is very light and seeps into your skin quite quickly.</li>
            <li>In just a couple of days skin feels much smoother and very healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use, seeing results of those fine lines.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li>I wash my face first and rinse with warm water and then put the cream on before I go to bed</li>
            <li>Hands down, the best moisturizing cream ever.  </li>
            <li>I see a lot of reviewers think it has a light, pleasant scent, but to my overly sensitive nose,  it smells like a combination of spoiled grapes and mint toothpaste!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if its as good as the new l&#x27;dara serum that&#x27;s out, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>As with its eye cream, the texture is light and can be easily applied.</li>
            <li>I noticed fine lines around my eyes fill in and fade away.  </li>
            <li>and I am seeing a decrease in fine lines.</li>
            <li>By day 3, I am seeing it help with fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I then applied the cream to my face and do have to say I feel like some of the fine lines that I have seem to be gone or fainter.  </li>
            <li>I have some sunspots, fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I cant comment on how it works for fine lines and wrinkles because its to soon, but I do think that it will definetly make a difference.</li>
            <li>The texture is smooth and creamy and blends into the skin easily.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and have noticed fine lines demenishing.  </li>
            <li>I can already see a noticeable difference in the fine lines on my forehead and eyes.</li>
            <li>I believe my fine lines are truly diminishing.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin (oily in some sections dry in others) and this is ideal for my skin type.</li>
            <li>I noticed the fine lines around my eyes just vanish.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, spreads easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin well hydrated, and I see some reduction in fine lines already.  </li>
            <li>It is light and non-sticky, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It does minimize your pores and fine lines.</li>
            <li>The CRAZY BEAUTIFUL Anti Aging Face Creme is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Crazy Beautiful is awesome!!</li>
            <li>After just a couple of days using this face cream, I can already notice some fine lines disappearing on my forehead and around my eyes.</li>

            <li>but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Bummer... didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.. was really hoping for something great, I&#x27;m not glowing or softer or really anything...</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Felt really good last night  before bed and now this morning I love how it feels on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizer goes on smoothly and hydrates my skin very well!!!  </li>
            <li>In all honestly, I was really looking forward to wonderful results - but after using the Andre Lorent Face Cream for 3 weeks (as a test), this face cream did not perform as promised, unfortunatelly my face was actually looking older and drier than before using this product.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs right away and doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice face cream and daily moisturizer, after applying my skin does feel smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>overall it is a very nice face cream</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool to the skin and has a mild fragrance like fresh clean smell!!</li>
            <li>but nothing &#x27;amazing&#x27; or particularly anti-aging.</li>
            <li>It feels very hydrating, absorbs quickly and has a nice light scent.  </li>
            <li>But the smell isn&#x27;t strong and goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, dries quickly, and does not leave a sticky or greasy residue.</li>
            <li>this good surely must have sustained, long term results!</li>
            <li>There is no fragrance, which is nice, and it makes me skin feel very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have not had any breakouts and my skin is so soft and my fine lines are disappearing!!  </li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling soft and smooth, great for your hands too!</li>
            <li>I must say I have tried many different creams and this one has definitely impressed me in a short period of time.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited to see what it does for my skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>I was excited to give this a try.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I am excited to continue  with it and see the changes.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and was so excited when it arrived.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact this small business is taking portions of products sold and donating to charities that&#x27;s AWESOME.</li>
            <li>I could see a remarkable change, moisture levels, in my face, after only 2 uses.</li>
            <li>It is so rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>Nice pleasant feel and no strong chemical smell, seems to be tightening the skin to remove the wrinkles just as advertised..</li>
            <li>So first off the jar is a decent size and you get a fair amount of product for the money.</li>
            <li>I will say the product is very creamy and easy to apply!  </li>
            <li>Very light fragrance (pleasant), spreads smoothly and evenly, soft on the skin, leaves my skin feeling moisturized and youthful; skin now seems to have a soft glow.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping for great long term results!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and absorbs into skin quickly.</li>

            <li>My husband has allergies too and has commented that he likes the clean scent when he hugged me in the morning</li>
            <li>After using this for four days now I can honestly say that it most definitely  rejuvenated, nourished, moisturized, and smoothed my face and neck areas.  </li>
            <li>The cream goes on smooth and does not leave my skin greasy, just a nice soft feel.</li>

            <li>Really good stuff, reasonable, will get again, thanks</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that there were no added fragrances or colors because my skin is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>So far I love it!</li>
            <li>and my skin already feels so soft and smooth!!  </li>

            <li>It was easy to apply and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>The Crazy beautiful face cream by Andre Lorent is one of the face creams that has combined the best ingredients to make sure your skin is well nourished and at the same time reduces fine lines and wrinkles and also plumps it up and gives it a fresh glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>In no time my skin was soft and feeling amazing.</li>

            <li>I love the fact that it is paraben free and makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>the price 2oz jar was so reasonable and to top that off</li>
            <li>be fair, at the same time this cream arrived</li>
            <li>Its a thick consistency so in the fall and winter its best to use it.</li>
            <li>I really like the way my skin feels after I use this face cream - so smooth!  </li>
            <li>far I am loving my face cream.</li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t do before and after pictures, so I don&#x27;t have my own personal yardstick.  </li>
            <li>Still too early to know if it is a favorite of mine yet.</li>
            <li>and I love it so far.</li>
            <li>It is quite nice actually.</li>
            <li>but so far this is a favorite.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is made from natural ingredients and has no additives or fillers.</li>
            <li>So far, just ok.</li>
            <li>So far I am pleased.</li>
            <li>in all, weighing the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s, you will see that this creme is definitely worth the 5 out of 5 star rating I give it.  </li>
            <li>feels so fresh</li>
            <li>My skin definitely feels nice once it soaks all the way in</li>
            <li>It is easily absorbed, never greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and will be buying more and will be buying some for my 74 year old mom.</li>
            <li>, fresh scent does what it says.</li>
            <li>but I love how soft it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it uses natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>However, this cream I believe is good for young and old.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer so far I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain about it because it&#x27;s just a nice simple cream.  </li>
            <li>For the $20 it is well worth a try.</li>
            <li>At first I thought the consistency may be too light due to being in my &amp;#34;golden years&amp;#34;, but it works great and a little bit goes a long way - great for the budget!</li>
            <li>, this moisturizer slides on, melts into the skin, and is absorbed quickly, leaving your skin super soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This makes it worth the money right there.</li>
            <li>My skin is more toned and radiant probably due to more collagen production.</li>
            <li>After searching high and low for a product the would help with the crows feet around my eyes, I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very easily and really makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>Other than that its a good product</li>
            <li>Soaks right into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I can tell right away is that it&#x27;s creamy and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>and I like how it soaks right into my skin</li>
            <li>I received the Face Creme sample on Wednesday and started using it right away that evening.</li>
            <li>I used it right away</li>
            <li>the price is right on</li>
            <li>It was not greasy or overpowering, just the right amount of moisturizer for my face.</li>
            <li>As of right now, I like the feel of the cream.  </li>
            <li>So results right away</li>
            <li>Non-comodogenic,non greasy,soaks in right away.</li>
            <li>I will need more time to figure out if it really helps erase fine lines but so far I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It is super light weight and my skin has never felt so soft .</li>
            <li>I am 53 and time &amp; gravity has started catching up to me, but Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Anti-Aging Cream has really made a difference!</li>
            <li>The cream goes on smoothly, it is non greasy and it makes my skin feel real soft .</li>
            <li>This is a full 2oz which doesn&#x27;t seem like much</li>
            <li>Love the texture and feel of this cream and almost instantly made my face feel more alive and glowing.  </li>
            <li>I am a 41 year old lady and from time to time I love to treat myself with different face creams, to see if I can find something better than what I am using.  </li>
            <li>Given the price of the product, it&#x27;s really nice for it to go a long way before needing to replace.  </li>
            <li>It is very lightly scented which is nice and delicate.</li>
            <li>This product left my skin looking fresh and feeling healthy.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any anti aging benefits yet because its too soon to tell but overall its doing its job as a fragrance, free of dyes and chemicals free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>So far so good, I will definitely buy this again.  </li>
            <li>my skin in very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it is unscented is a huge bonus to me as I am very sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and smooth, glides onto your skin without making it feel greasy or sticky.  </li>
            <li>I was ready to make my own when I found Andre Lorent CRAZY BEAUTIFUL and</li>
            <li>For the price I think this is the perfect way for me to keep my face looking young as possible as long as I can.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing with no unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li>Also love that is made by a company who believes in giving back and is made right here in the USA.</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>The price was for a 2oz jar which is very unusual all others are for a 1oz</li>
            <li>You can tell when you put it on and massage it in to your face and next that is very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>Not greasy left my face very smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used the high end products and got to say that this is right up there with them!</li>
            <li>I received this amazing cream today and put it on the dry patches and they feel softer already!  </li>
            <li>What a pleasant surprise to find after only a few days, age lines softened and my skin feels fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive my new anti-aging face cream.  </li>
            <li>So far I love everything about it and it doesnt have a heavy scent, just very light and mild which I like.</li>
            <li>No heavy scent which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>This premium face cream comes exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>there is no sunscreen in this product, necessitating a second product over the top.  </li>
            <li>The next morning, my skin still looked better.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy &amp; leaves your skin smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>It feels soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>how soft and smooth it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>currently use Cindy Crawford&#x27;s Meaningful Beauty Products, but I am going to cancel my  membership and use this cream...</li>
            <li>It worked as far as my skin being smooth and not having any breakouts or issues, but just not the results I had read about.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Great product exactly as described.</li>
            <li>skin feels soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and I feel like my face is burning for the first 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I actually think that my skin is better</li>
            <li>Love it and will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li>Thanks to the the makers of this product; please continue with the quality ingredients and affordable price!</li>
            <li>So it seems like a great value because it should last a long time.</li>
            <li>The first day I waited until night to use it before bed.</li>
            <li>I use this at night only and it works out better for me that</li>
            <li>To early to tell, but it goes on well and feels smooth.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>After only using it for two days I am pleased with the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>I use this daily, and love it.</li>

            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>

            <li>Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I have several items from Andre Lorent and love them all.  </li>
            <li>Much like my review of the eye cream, I also like the face cream!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different high-end products (including Rodan &amp; Fields, Dr. Perricone, etc)</li>
            <li>I have been applying first thing in morning and before bed.</li>
            <li>I am very please with the improvement!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I need for my type of skin.</li>
            <li>I have some red spots on my cheeks from dryness and most of those are already gone.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>The first thing that got my attention is the aroma.</li>
            <li>so I have only been able to use it 2 times after returning home.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different face creams, from drugstores to department stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I purchased this cream, I&#x27;m definitely integrating it into my beauty routine!</li>
            <li>This cream makes your face feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Thanks for your help!</li>
            <li>First off....</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and creamy,no oily feeling  and no heavy smell to it.  </li>
            <li>but I make sure to put this on daily.  </li>
            <li>I put it on for the first time, and just forgot about it.</li>
            <li>Definitely a winner in my book. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 years old and my skin felt so smooth and it felt like the moisturizer seeped into my skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and leaves your skin so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>and this is the first face cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I was particularly interested in the product because it contains argirelene which can help with under eye puffiness.  </li>
            <li>From the first day I&#x27;ve used it</li>
            <li>+ year old skin feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>Whether you use them as an extra moisturizer, under your makeup, as a sunscreen etc I&#x27;m pretty sure everybody owns a face cream.</li>
            <li>I apply it first thing in the morning after washing my face and before going to bed.</li>
            <li>This is the first time purchase.</li>
            <li>Other than that I love it!</li>
            <li>It makes my face so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It seems promising!</li>
            <li>I have eczema and was hesitant to try this at first, but after all the glowing reviews, decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for about a month on and off (not as consistently as I&#x27;d like)</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this cream is free from parabens, sulfates and other chemical additives!  </li>
            <li>With a very light scent, it is absorbed quickly, leaving no greasy residue, and gentle enough for even the very sensitive skin on my neck.</li>
            <li>I am honestly feeling excited because my fine lines are starting to become less visible</li>
            <li>This product super light on my skin and made it feel like I had just had a facial.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and leaves my dry skin feeling silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>This product is very creamy, absorbs quickly and seems to hydrate very well.</li>
            <li>This face cream goes on smooth and quickly absorbs into the skin with no oily sheen left on your face.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and absorbs very quickly with absolutely no greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Crazy Beautiful creme for just a couple of days, but so far I love it!</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s also great about it ,is that a little bit goes a long way, and it has a very pleasant scent, rather delicate.</li>
            <li>And even though I had too much, it was not overly greasy or tacky; it soaked right in, no problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this cream, it definitely surprise me to see the positive results.</li>
            <li>I am imagine it will take a few weeks to get the Full effects of it!!!</li>
            <li>Despite nearing 40 years old, my skin is very oily, sensitive, and dries very easily.</li>
            <li>So far my skin feels nice and has not had any breakouts which is not usually the case when I try a new cream.</li>
            <li>The cream itself is rich and creamy, and it leaves your skin so soft in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and works easily under my foundation and other cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used it long enough to observe whether fine lines on my face are reduced, but I do love the way it makes my skin feel and have even used it more than once a day, as suggested, which I almost never do with other products (in an effort to cheap out and stretch it).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly what&#x27;s in this little jar of magic, but it&#x27;s worth every dollar!</li>
            <li>This is amazing for those with sensitive skin such as myself.&lt;br /&gt;-  </li>
            <li>Only been using for 12 days and my whole complexion looks better, face is moisturized, even skin tone, and skin is plumper.  </li>
            <li>My face feels so nice and soft after using these for only a week!</li>
            <li>Overall a good hydrating facial cream.</li>
            <li>In overall it gives a nice fresh glow and has made the fine lines less visible.</li>
            <li>In overall it gives a nice fresh glow and has made the fine lines less visible.</li>
            <li>Best of all, I have no more dry patches.  </li>
            <li>It does have a VERY light scent, it won&#x27;t burn, or dry you out</li>
            <li>but if these few days are any indication, I think I will be very pleased.</li>
            <li>Not the least bit greasy, faces feels soft and smooth , is a good value.</li>
            <li>My blotchiness was pretty much gone</li>
            <li>I recently ordered my first jar of André Lorent CRAZY BEAUTIFUL Anti-Aging Face Cream, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term effects :)</li>
            <li>this is 100% free from parabens, sodium lauryl sulfate, and petro-chemical derivatives; so I felt confident that it wouldn&#x27;t irritates my skin; After using this myself, I&#x27;ve had no issues with any sensitivity to my skin, and have seen results in keeps and bounds in only a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice texture but not worth the money.</li>
            <li>I must say, I did not expect that it would be as good as the one I usually use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had the opportunity to use it twice, so I haven&#x27;t noticed a decrease in fine lines yet, but it seems promising!</li>
            <li>It was absorbed very well by my skin and left it feeling soft and lovely.</li>
            <li>Many other creams cause me to break out into a rash because my face is so sensitive, but this one leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>It hydrates the skin with a small amount of use and is light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy or cause breakouts (I have super sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>so far I find that it absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>yet it soaks in quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>This cream is certainly a keeper for me</li>
            <li>I purchased this product based purely on the reviews and at this price it is a value.  </li>
            <li>I certainly recommend this product, based on my experience.</li>
            <li>Found my new moisturizer!!</li>
            <li>I have been using the cream for a few days and love the softness and can feel the tightening of the skin already!</li>
            <li>I do not normally use anything on my face, be it makeup or moisturizer, but I really love the way this makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin so for the first night I applied the cream to the back of my hand to make sure that it would not break me out.</li>
            <li>I used the eye cream immediately and LOVED it (and still do, and it is going to last a very long time), but I was using another face cream at the time and wanted to finish that before I opened this.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin with a mild firmness feeling but not tight.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li>It comes in a decent size tub and its full, not partially full like many creams or cosmetics sometimes are.</li>
            <li>I have fine lines around my eyes and deeper ones on my forehead and décolletage and have not seen any change in them after using this twice daily.  </li>
            <li>Using it for about two weeks, I have noticed a definite improvement in fine lines.</li>
            <li>My fine lines are almost gone and my deep lines are coming up to fill in the groove.</li>
            <li>In the short amount of time I have used I can see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a reduction in fine lines after using it for just a short while.</li>
            <li>The texture is a little think but it rubs in to your skin nicely.</li>
            <li>Having only used this for a couple of days, I have appreciated the fact that it is non-greasy and leaves my skin feeling smooth and supple.  </li>
            <li>It feels very silky as you smooth it on your face and absorbs into your skin almost instantly.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this face cream to anyone looking for a no-nonsense hydrating routine!   </li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>My eyelids are especially sensitive and this cream has not caused a problem at all.  </li>
            <li>The cream really doesn&#x27;t have any scent.</li>
            <li>so there isn&#x27;t much improvement yet</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It softens and smooths the skin gently without that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I really like this face cream.  </li>
            <li>The hand that I applied the cream on feels much smoother and softer.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face feel very moisturized but not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Great customer service...not to see a company that cares and stands behind its product.  </li>
            <li>This cream is really nice...not greasy.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice a change from the cream after two weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Really like it.  </li>
            <li>It make my skin very try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The combination of Matrixyl, Argireline, Hyaluronic Acid and manual stimulation really does stimulate the production of collagen beneath the skin, filling the wrinkles and reversing the aging.</li>
            <li>Over the years, I have found brands and formulas that work really well with me and my troublesome skin</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think to take a before picture because I really didn&#x27;t think that this would work</li>
            <li>I bought this moisturizer after spending too much time in the sun.</li>
            <li>This worked way better than expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very optimistic.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the scent much, but since I wear it at night before bed  it&#x27;s not much of an issue for me, although it might be for someone that is more sensitive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not irritating.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t break out as much.</li>
            <li>It is light enough youse on oily skin</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I also really like how I can feel the creme &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; up my skin as it dries.</li>
            <li>I just ordered it and the shipping was Fast.</li>
            <li>I really see softer skin in the area of  my nose/eye.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t normally purchase a face cream over the internet unless I knew the product first</li>
            <li>The cream works well both night and day- under makeup and primer really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this face cream.</li>
            <li>Though I have skin on the oily side, it&#x27;s not too much for it.</li>
            <li>Really works well under make up, make up just glides on.</li>
            <li>Very creamy and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>so I really wanted to test it out.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this face cream to anyone looking for a no-nonsense hydrating routine!</li>
            <li>I really like this and will buy again.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been usining this product in the AM and PM and noticing this moisturizer to be working out very well.  </li>
            <li>Is it really smells like?</li>
            <li>It goes on and doesn&#x27;t feel very moisturizing at all.</li>

            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Feels very soothing when applied.</li>
            <li>so cannot really speak about the anti aging aspect of it yet.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin feel smooth overall.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much</li>
            <li>It may be too soon to notice any visible signs of anti-aging, but my skin is much softer and feels \\&quot;tighter\\&quot; after application.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This instantly made my skin feel hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really testify on reducing wrinkle because I do t have any just yet.  </li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like this face cream.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s concentrated it doesn&#x27;t take much  </li>
            <li>The lotion has a very creamy texture.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I am very picky with what I use on my face</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have been using for about 10 days and with the 5-In-1 repair formula they have you can really tell a difference.</li>
            <li>It really works well with the eye crèam they have also.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the ingredients in this cream.</li>
            <li>but it has improved my skins appearance its very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I really like this face cream.  </li>
            <li>It is truly the consistency of a cream and is not thin like a lotion.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not overpowering and does not take much at all to cover the problem areas.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about textures/consistencies of lotions and creams.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this face cream to anyone looking for a no-nonsense hydrating routine!</li>
            <li>I really like the way this feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like the cream and the smell of it.</li>
            <li>It feels light enough that it may not.  </li>
            <li>In the week that I&#x27;ve used it, I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in aging</li>
            <li>My skin is firmer and I really think it is helping with the wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>When you open up the lid you will notice the creme is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>so much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well without being greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>Its like a drink for my very thirsty skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so much softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li>It does help some but not as much as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li>She makes you feel like you really are a friend.  </li>
            <li>Very prompt.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see much difference on my face.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t notice much of a difference since I have been using the product.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this cream feels on my face.</li>
            <li>and it did not cause any breakouts ( that is a real plus with me ).</li>
            <li>It is light enough to use as a day cream, yet feels nourishing as a night cream too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this face cream!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several days and already my face feels smooth and softer.</li>
            <li>I really like the whipped consistency and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t seem to see any real progress in removing my wrinkles</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see any &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; benefits, but I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>- I have never been so surprised by a face cream (and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything!)  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and looks more radiant already, when I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I may not purchase again is because I prefer a nice fragrance, especially at night.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received this product at a heavily discounted price/free in exchange for an unbiased, honest review, which I gave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like that this cream has no scent and is not thick at all!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had this product long, but I love it so far!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue like other creams I have used in the past and also has a light pleasant smell to it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products, but none that compare to this one.</li>
            <li>As a test I also applied the cream to the top of one hand and not to the other.  </li>
            <li>But I like it better than an other cream I ordered for anti-aging type issues.</li>
            <li>After only 1 week of use it has significantly diminished my age spots/freckles, and my forehead, eye, and around the mouth wrinkles have noticably softened.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way making it a great value.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to recieve this facial cream in the mail today and couldnt wait to try it.</li>
            <li>I have used many other creams</li>
            <li>Love that it dont make my face feelin greasy like the other moisturiser I was using..</li>
            <li>I excited to see the effects after using this on a regular basis!</li>
            <li>It does have a rich texture and you can feel the tightening effect instantly.  </li>
            <li>I know I sound like a TV commercial, but I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>How it does it, I&#x27;m not sure, but I will definitely buy again and hope to continue seeing great results.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has 5 active ingredients in 1 jar to fight wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Now that I am getting older, I really care what I put onto/into my body.</li>
            <li>The second ingredient is green tea extract so the cream smells amazing to me!  </li>
            <li>I just used the cream for the first time tonight and so far really like it.</li>
            <li>While the cream does feel thick upon applying it quickly gets absorbed into your skin leavinging feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>Very comparable to high priced creams.</li>
            <li>The first thing I have to say I noticed about this face cream is how silky soft my face felt.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how effective it is</li>
            <li>Skin felt so soft since the first use..</li>
            <li>My face never peeled, and after the first application, my face felt soft.</li>
            <li>That being said, so far I really like it!</li>
            <li>I believe with daily use this could certainly slow the additional formation of wrinkles, and give me more healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft after using this for the first time.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that after the first night I used it</li>
            <li>I still need to use it more to compare the results of wrinkles and dark spots.</li>
            <li>So far,  I&#x27;m really liking it!  </li>
            <li>The first night i used it made my skin so soft and</li>
            <li>I have only used this a couple of days so far, so I can&#x27;t speak as to results, but I love that it is natural ingredients and not a bunch of junk.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this for a few days, but wanted to say that really feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;ve only been using this cream a few days, it seems to be a very nice moisturizer for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Two thumbs up for this Daily Moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>It goes on white but quickly absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for several days now and my skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The product made my skin left feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have a newborn and must say my face, cheeks especially feel almost as soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Seems to be decent.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel very soft and silky!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very affordable while containing all the anti oxidants skin needs to stay young and radiant!</li>
            <li>The one thing I really like is that I have incredibly sensitive skin, and I didn&#x27;t have any reactions to this at all!</li>
            <li>I have to say that the face cream is very creamy and it took only a small amount for good coverage.</li>
            <li>Works very well when used right after a bath or shower locking in extra</li>
            <li>My laugh lines are not as noticeable, my skin looks full and less &amp;#34;droopy&amp;#34; and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>The product is packaged well and has a high end appearance, presentation and feel.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly allergic to smells</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a thick, rich cream that leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li>I like that they use pure natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>but so far am liking cream!!</li>
            <li>I then put just a little on the top of my hand and rub it in just as I would on my face.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li>This is extremely lightweight and absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this was quite gentle on my face.</li>
            <li>So far, I really like this cream.  </li>
            <li>I am not one of those women who believe there is any product that can take away the natural aging process, so my expectations are reasonable.</li>
            <li>I have not broken out while using it as that was a concern since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I started using this cream like month ago ,this cream really works, my skin is so much soft .</li>
            <li>I was really surprised because I started noticing changes on my skin and feeling really</li>
            <li>The cream texture is very moistened and soft.</li>
            <li>I do like that it does not have an odor to it and is not thick and sticky.  </li>
            <li>I am sensitive to real perfumy smells</li>
            <li>I was surprised how fast it was shipped and received.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating and is making my fine lines and wrinkles much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Even just after a few days, I noticed a difference, to the point where I&#x27;m confident to walk out of the house without any makeup on.  </li>
            <li>Being fair skinned and having stayed out of the sun or using sunscreen, my face is not  leathery and people usually guess my age about 10 years younger.  </li>
            <li>to what it will do in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>I cannot attest to the &amp;#34;anti aging&amp;#34; claim yet as I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference, but I can see how it could give those results after more use.</li>
            <li>It smells like your normal skin cream.</li>
            <li>I love the fluffy feel of the product.  </li>
            <li>Nice thick consistency.</li>
            <li>Another nice benefit was it didn&#x27;t react to my rosacea and actually calmed down the reddening on my face.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, my dry skin still feels soft and moisturized 12 hours later - not greasy in the least, but</li>
            <li>As one who has had very sensitive skin all her life, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>And if the product works, it&#x27;s worth a few minutes of mild discomfort.</li>
            <li>If I have questions she gets right back to me.  </li>
            <li>A huge plus for me is the omission of harmful ingredients and it is hard to find a quality product attached to a reasonable price that actually makes your face feel smooth as well as give it a supple appearance.  </li>
            <li>Throughout the week I have noticed that my wrinkle lines are becoming less visible.</li>
            <li>same, fine wrinkles on cheeks were same.</li>
            <li>This cream is CRAZY good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my fine lines are starting to be less noticeable and it seems to have helped with my smile lines.</li>
            <li>It is light when it is applied but is extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I do have some and want to make sure I look young as long as possible.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m hoping that someone from the company&#x27;s customer service department will let me exchange this for a new jar because I can&#x27;t use this product if the smell makes me want to puke from just a whiff of it.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to someone wanting to try something new for skincare.</li>
            <li>I was a bit unsure about using a new face cream, as a lot of time, I have breakouts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always hesitant to try new face creams as one never knows what it may do.  </li>
            <li>Being in my thirties, it is very important to moisturize everyday!</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and the dry patches are gone!!!</li>
            <li>Of course having only applied this cream to my face for 2 days I haven&#x27;t really noticed much difference in wrinkle lines or skin firming.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this face cream especially if you have sensitive or easily irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This cream instantly absorbs into skin and is light enough to wear under makeup during the day.  </li>
            <li>I am 50+ and spend as much time as possible outdoors, so it would not be reasonable to expect my wrinkles to disappear, but what the cream has done is give me noticeably softer, healthier-looking skin.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely continue buying this CRAZY BEAUTIFUL Anti Aging Face Cream!</li>
            <li>This cream is thick enough to be a good night cream but not too greasy.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I must say I&#x27;m very surprised.</li>
            <li>This face cream is unscented which was a plus for me as I am very sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have combination, very sensitive skin and am 35.</li>
            <li>not greasy at all and leaves my skin feeling very soft an supple.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes well and leaves my skin very soft and supple.</li>
            <li>and I woke up to very soft skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Feels very soft and non greasy.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and a lot of moisturizers</li>
            <li>but I have already noticed that it leaves my skin feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s texture and makes my face feel very soft.</li>
            <li>I was a Lil reluctant because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly I want to add that my skin is very sensitive, and at times can be overly oily.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is very soft.</li>
            <li>I love how a very small amount of the cream spreads over a large skin surface area so no waste!.</li>
            <li>I have seen a huge difference in the dark patches.  </li>
            <li>The all natural composition makes this even more appealing because you know you are not putting dangerous, synthetic substances on your skin.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I actually double took my face the morning after the first night of use.</li>
            <li>and I am surprised at the quality!</li>
            <li>This cream seems to make me look slightly younger after using it consistently twice a day.</li>
            <li>Nothing has ever made my skin feel so soft!  </li>
            <li>The first thing I do when I open a jar is to smell.  </li>
            <li>Have only used once but interested to see longer term results.</li>
            <li>Just my Crazy Beautiful moisturizer you want to give it a try?  </li>
            <li>Also ANDRE LORENT CRAZY BEAUTIFUL</li>
            <li>This facial cream most definitely has essential oils and nutrients that made my skin thrive and glow.  </li>
            <li>Skin felt soft and lines seem to plump up reducing the depth of the wrinkles!  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Crazy Beautiful Anti Aging Face Cream for about one week.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several anti aging products (yes I&#x27;m fighting it ;-) )</li>
            <li>Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Anti Aging Face Crème</li>
            <li>and was appreciatively surprised!</li>
            <li>B00N9D8PES Andre Lorent CRAZY BEAUTIFUL Anti Aging Face Cream &amp;#x25CF; Revolutionary 5-In-1 Skin Repair Formula</li>
            <li>Crazy Beautiful Face Cream</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Time will tell if it helps these old wrinkles !  </li>
            <li>I work 8 hour shifts and wear Crazy Beautiful under my make-up and it lasts</li>
            <li>and this face cream absorbed very well and did not feel greasy like other creams I have used.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, smooth and creamy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I find it to be a nice creamy consistancy and that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have used many very expensive face creams in the past and this stuff is better in many ways.  </li>
            <li>I am sensitive to a lot of fragrance and was nervous to try something new.</li>
            <li>It smells like big red on someone&#x27;s breathe sweet but spicy.</li>
            <li>Crazy beautiful face creme so far is living up to its name.</li>
            <li>And it works in conjunction with the rest of my skin care line which also surprised me since I have very sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li>It actually works better than my other cream!</li>
            <li>Andre Lorent is helping this 41 year old continue to look like I am in my early 30s!</li>
            <li>Now that we are going into the cold winter months , my face  gets really dry and this face cream is perfect .thankyou</li>
            <li>I am almost 44 and have been seeing the signs of aging lately, so when I saw this product I just had to give it a try and see if it helped with these fine lines!</li>
            <li>This cream has a delicate, very light scent and has visibly helped with the wrinkles around my mouth.</li>
            <li>I have only used Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Face Cream for a few days and my face is smoother and more hydrated than it was before.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t wear any makeup and for the past few days my face and neck have really looked more colorful - glowing</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to really notice a change in the wrinkles, but my skin is hydrated and soft without being oily and I am looking forward to continuing to use Crazy Beautiful!</li>
            <li>Within just a few days there was a noticeable difference in the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good that a very small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>It also absorbs quickly and hydrates my skin without being sticky or greasy like a lot of other creams out there.</li>
            <li>I have noticed my skin smoother, not as dry, and better coloring due to being moisturized.</li>
            <li>I really like this facial cream so far.</li>
            <li>I am 64 years young and have been using a variety of serums including high-end Kate Somerville.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face soft after use.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have had no problems at all with irritation.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This cream doesn&#x27;t have any smell and it does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far this is just what I need.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight enough that I can even wear it under makeup, but it still feels very nourishing to my skin.</li>
            <li>There is a seal on the outside of the plastic container to protect the product until you are ready to use it/for evidence of tampering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and makes my skin feel so soft and gives it a youthful glow.  </li>

            <li>Theres no harsh smells.</li>

            <li>My skin is sensitive and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Leaves my face soft and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>So far I give it a two thumbs up.</li>
            <li>Although I can&#x27;t really see any reduction of facial lines, at the age of  68</li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>All around my face too, I have now sensitive skin and completely lost smoothness.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making and selling such an awese and affordable product!</li>
            <li>I have mature aging skin and this cream keeps my face moist all day.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and I have not seen any adverse reactions to this product.  </li>
            <li>Makes skin really soft, and it has softened lines in my neck and face.</li>
            <li>I guess this means I&#x27;m old....</li>
            <li>I am almost 69 years old and am trying to grow old gracefully.</li>
            <li>I like everything about it so far</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft all day and</li>
            <li>I give most face creams at least two weeks to impress me.</li>
            <li>It is not a heavy cream so can be used by people with oily skin.</li>
            <li>but I have sensitive skin &amp; no problems there.</li>
            <li>That being said, I like what I have seen of this product so far.</li>
            <li>It does not have much, if any scent, which is a big plus for me.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and even toned.</li>
            <li>the cream is so soft and luxurious.  </li>
            <li>It melts into my skin, leaving it soft and supple.</li>
            <li>It has my forty-nine year old complexion looking plumped and smoothed.</li>
            <li>+ year old skin</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels soft already.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>This cream made my face wonderfully soft immediately after putting it on.  </li>
            <li>I just received this product recently so far</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still to early to tell about the anti aging aspect</li>
            <li>Skin is soft, no sensitivity issues.  </li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t take much to completely cover your face.</li>
            <li>My skin is also sensitive.</li>
            <li>I shall not grow old gracefully...</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and have had no problems with this cream.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy..</li>
            <li>Too soon to tell what the results will be but so far I am liking it.</li>
            <li>My face really does look healthier and younger.</li>
            <li>Because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Some lines and wrinkles did not go away completely, but  there was a difference.</li>
            <li>It really penetrated into my skin and left my skin feeling nourished.  </li>
            <li>I finally received my much anticipated face cream from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 58 years old and have been feeling and seeing my face showing signs age.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>I got mine 2 days ago, I already felt my face smoother and soft.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also love that it goes a long way and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the only face cream I will be using!!!</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and plump.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling hydrated and soft.  </li>
            <li>Natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>but so far so</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>It is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs completely and does not leave my skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>but it does leave my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and moisturized all day</li>
            <li>It has a natural feel.</li>
            <li>This has not done that so far.  </li>
            <li>You can actually feel your face tightening as it  was absorbing.</li>
            <li>at the end of the day, my skin was not oily like it was with my old face cream.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and eaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried creams for sensitive skin, moisturizing, combination skin....</li>
            <li>It does leave my skin soft and no break outs.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it seems to be working well for my skin type.</li>
            <li>I can immediately feel it absorb into my skin and my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily, yet skin is soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>My skin is so incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>That being said I am starting to get a few crows feet, some laugh lines and its not as much fun as I thought.</li>
            <li>Soft, light scent not overpowering, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li>I love that because I have tried lotions that simply leave your skin greasy and with a heavy residue and then feel the need to wash it off.</li>
            <li>Ive only been using this cream for a few days now and I am already in love with this cream.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this cream for a few days, but I love it.  </li>
            <li>This cream is very light and a little but goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>and it sinks right into the skin.</li>
            <li>Great product, a little bit goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way which I love about this product.  </li>
            <li>I first wanted to try the texture and allergy reaction on the back of my hand, before using it on my face - it does feel silky on the back on my hand and no reaction (I have sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>It has an extremely creamy texture and is quickly absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I notice that the little fine lines are a lot smoother or gone my skin looks right and tight.</li>
            <li>but let&#x27;s be real, we all hope to stay young long.</li>
            <li>Has made my skin soft and smooth, and cleared up small bumps on my forehead that appear when the seasons change.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using facial moisturizer along with the Crazy Beautiful Eye Creme</li>
            <li>I use it morning and night, and still have almost a quarter of a jar left in the first one, so one jar is lasting me</li>
            <li>I have fine lines around my eyes and they seem to be less obvious than before.  </li>
            <li>It reduces the wrinkles in my face that makes me feel older and it makes me feel and look younger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days but my skin already looks and feels smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of this little gem in the future.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see see a huge change in the facial appearance, but I do notice that my face feels slightly tighter.</li>
            <li>The cream absorbs quickly not oily just smooth and you only need a dap on your finger.  </li>
            <li>It is free of fragrances that usually make my skin irritated.</li>
            <li>My husband even complimented me on how smooth my skin felt (and trust me, my guy usually don&#x27;t notice that).  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it for long but is a very cream.  </li>
            <li>Only used it twice so far but makes my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li>The only problem is, wrinkle cream normally breaks me out.  </li>
            <li>The first day it felt a little heavy on my skin but the second day was better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy like some creams and it seems to be working because my fine lines aren&#x27;t as noticeable as they used to be and doesn&#x27;t make my makeup look wonky.</li>
            <li>You only need a little and it is so light that you don&#x27;t even feel it.</li>
            <li>My face tends to be dry and this cream left my face feeling soft and supple after the first use.  </li>
            <li>People are actually asking me if I&#x27;m using a new make-up...</li>
            <li>Definitely a new addition to my daily regimen.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to seeing my new younger skin!</li>
            <li>The cream itself is very creamy and light not runny or thin.</li>
            <li>I usually have trouble with face creams becoming oily on my skin as the day goes by, but this cream moisturizes the dry patches that have been flaky, leaving them silky smooth</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t smell, and it is sensitive enough for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen improvement in the lines around my mouth after only a few days and it leaves my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It is light and non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;After only a few days wrinkles appeared softer as this cream was plumping and firming.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much either, just add a few dots to your skin and gently rub it in.</li>
            <li>I do not yet know about long term results,but the first application will make your skin noticeably different in texture and appearance!  </li>
            <li>I have been using it in the morning and at bedtime and my skin is feeling soft and not dry or greasy.  </li>
            <li>Odorless, fluffy cream that absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too thick and also does not have a strong scent at all.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very supple and soft in general, but its still very dry.</li>
            <li>The results of using this are very apparent.</li>
            <li>So many very expensive creams do nothing at all for wrinkles but are great moisturizers or charge a ridiculous amount of money to do the same thing.</li>
            <li>Have only been using for a day and my skin is already so soft and supple!</li>
            <li>It absorbs easily, it does not smell and you only need to use a small amount.</li>
            <li>The wrinkles around my mouth (laugh lines) seem less apparent.</li>
            <li>At first I was surprised at how small the bottle was, but I found that a little goes a long way, so there is more product there than it appears.</li>
            <li>Within two days of using Crazy Beautiful cream, my dry, flaky skin was gone!</li>
            <li>A very subtle, but good feeling which I hadn&#x27;t expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m revising this review after using it for another 3-4 days, my face feels drier than ever, when I smile all the fine lines are more accentuated and worst of it all, the eye cream of the same brand I am using started causing this burning sensation around my eyes and the next thing I realize this morning that I have white small pimples on top of my eyelids and my eyelids are red and very sensitive.</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;m a 60 plus year old guy with little experience in this area, but I take lots of vitamins and supplements.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually use face cream because it&#x27;s hard to find a good one.</li>
            <li>Your face cream has not caused breakouts and seems to help clear up and heal the breakout that I had prior to using your cream.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely purchase this again and recommend to those interested to at least try it.</li>
            <li>This cream goes on so smooth and you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel really soft and dewy,even the next morning.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, which is also mixed.  </li>
            <li>I initially took the equivalent of a small marble when I first opened the container, and that was too much.  </li>
            <li>After just one use, my face was so soft the next morning...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and any time I used any facial cream</li>
            <li>I like that it is not heavily scented and is an actual cream</li>
            <li>My face looks younger and feels soft.  </li>
            <li>It is thick and creamy with a light fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so thick but goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>When you apply the face creme for the first time (I applied it to my face after washingit in the evening and even put some down on my chin and neck.)</li>
            <li>Have only been using cream for less than 1 week and so far no breakouts which is plus for me with my very oily skin!  </li>
            <li>Every face cream I have ever used has been either too heavy or too light and didn&#x27;t help my dry skin issues.  </li>
            <li>Last two days I noticed it has left my face very soft.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way - I definitely grabbed too much the first time.</li>
            <li>There was a slight tingle when first applied but that went away in a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>I also noticed my skin was not getting super oily like it usually does.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for a few days but so far I do like it very much.</li>
            <li>Some other reviews say they don&#x27;t like the smell of this cream, but I have yet to smell really anything from it.</li>
            <li>Like the feel and texture of the face cream,  It&#x27;s thick and rich, any difference in my skin...</li>
            <li>I am always concerned about trying new creams due to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The other nice thing is that it will last a long time since  you need very little.  </li>
            <li>This is a true premium high quality active anti aging facial cream based on organic Camellia, Green Tea Extract, &amp; Sunflower Seed Oil, plus it&#x27;s  enriched with additional herbal extracts.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got some sun damage (I live in Texas), I smoke(trying to quit), and I&#x27;m menopausal (dry skin).</li>
            <li>I know I sound shallow</li>
            <li>My skin feels firmer but not dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product for one day and one night, but it goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t too thick.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t see much of a difference, but other than that the smell isn&#x27;t bad and the texture is nice!</li>
            <li>I have used this moisturizer for the past three days and find my skin is smooth and no longer dry.  </li>
            <li>Face creams are one of the most necessary things to have because your face skin is very delicate and needs extra nourishment.</li>
            <li>I have no regrets and will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>I have only used this for a few days, but so far my skin feels so much softer.  </li>
            <li>I cannot yet say if it works as well as my normal anti aging moisturizer as I&#x27;ve not used it long enough, but it seems to be about the same as my $70 cream.  </li>
            <li>I will be interested to see how my skin looks in another few weeks.</li>
            <li>this face cream is perfect, it keeps my skin moisture all day, and that usually doesn&#x27;t happen, because I get dry patches all through the cold season.</li>
            <li>(at first, I thought this was an unscented product), but I am very sensitive to scents - I either love or hate them - and this one I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive dry skin and living in Alaska does not help.  </li>
            <li>My previous night cream went so fast,</li>
            <li>My skin had some dry patches and this cream completely took care of the dryness.</li>
            <li>my skin has felt baby soft, my adult acne has cleared by day 5 and my skin has brightened up a lot including dark spots.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say anything about the anti aging benefits, but I do like it so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always found it impossible to find a face cream with the trifecta: one that&#x27;s anti-aging, but also a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The cream itself is pretty thick and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or greasy after applying, it just feels soft and deeply moisturized.</li>
            <li>The cream itself is pretty thick and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or greasy after applying, it just feels soft and deeply moisturized.</li>
            <li>I love that it is FREE of all the bad things and was MADE IN THE USA!</li>
            <li>Greatly decreased fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Added a little roundness that I wasn&#x27;t expecting and wasn&#x27;t real fond of.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how far a little goes, which should make this last quite awhile.  </li>
            <li>It smells sour and a little sweet in a gross way.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have to admit Dr Oz recommend to search for Vitamin C &amp; Hauluriic Acid in your Mositurizer for best results in reducing fine lines and hydrating your face!  </li>

            <li> I am really loving this Anti Aging face cream!  </li>
            <li> It is an excellent product with outstanding customer service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use this, which says a lot as I try many creams in search of the perfect one.  </li>
            <li> To be honest!</li>
            <li> The instructions say that you&#x27;ll see more results over time, but I&#x27;m already seeing great results!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was sent this product for review purposes but my review is 100% my own opinion!</li>
            <li> All in all, I am very pleased with Andre Lorent Beautiful Cream.</li>
            <li> I am loving this face cream!</li>
            <li> I am also very happy with the fact that it is paraben,SLS and additive free!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the most anti-aging best thing in the world, however I did already buy one for my mother to try.</li>
            <li> and I can see a remarkable difference in the hydration of my skin - but</li>
            <li> even more impressive is that my friends and family do, too!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift ( I&#x27;m a man, I dont use creams :) ) and the person who received this is actually very happy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight on my skin and has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> I did feel a pleasant tightening of the skin that it was working.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell and is moisturizing as well.  </li>
            <li> it does not leave my skin feeling greasy and it has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Many people don&#x27;t want any kind of fragrance so this is probably the perfect anti aging formula for them.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a good face cream that doesn&#x27;t feel like I am wearing a mask.</li>
            <li> Waited to post review to make a fair assessment.</li>
            <li> Feels good on skin.</li>
            <li> It still a good moisturizer, just not all that people talk , happened to me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and then found a good buy on some retinol cream.</li>
            <li> but I think this product for the price has some really good ingredients.</li>
            <li> probably not but cream feels good on my face</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing a good job.</li>
            <li> But I would not be a good judge.</li>

            <li> The first month I loved the cream.</li>
            <li> Strange name for a creme, but over all very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> My first impression was a  good one.</li>
            <li> It feels good to find a reasonably priced product that is made in the U.S.A. and doesn&#x27;t have harmful additives!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy, and I am excited to begin seeing an improvement and  difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it does have any kind of scent whatsoever to it and blends in fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> and it is perfect for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin quickly and gives you a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I love this blend because it doesn&#x27;t make me break out and most importantly</li>

            <li> When I first put it on it felt a bit &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; but it soaked in quickly and felt great</li>
            <li> Their products are SLS, paraben and cruelty free which is something that is very important to me when looking for an quality skin product.</li>
            <li> This is my new face cream for sure!!</li>
            <li> This is the best face cream I have ever used on my dry aging face!</li>
            <li> This works fine, but what I like most was</li>
            <li> but I do notice an improvement in the fine lines, I am sure it will work on the others with extended use.</li>
            <li> Overall - pleasant!</li>
            <li> It has done an awesome job moisturizing my very dry face.</li>
            <li> This cream goes on smooth on the skin, absorbs very quickly, and makes your skin feel very smooth.  </li>
            <li> so I was hesitant to try it at first but must say I am very glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li> Great for my highly sensitive skin (eczema prone).  </li>
            <li> After the 5 days, I did notice my skin a lot more smooth and softer.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth but doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy which I love.  </li>
            <li> I just received this product today, first thing that I noticed that it is vertically fragrant free, and that&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was very pleased from the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> So far i&#x27;m seeing great results.</li>
            <li> I love the light scene and keeps my skin hydrated.  </li>

            <li> It goes on smoothly and has a nice mild scent.</li>
            <li> My new anti-aging face cream by Andre Lorent is so amazing that I am canceling my monthly Nerium product immediately!  </li>
            <li> Which is remarkable, considering I live in the desert.</li>
            <li> This face cream has a nice smooth consistency that absorbs into the skin easily and quickly without a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> far as face creams go, this one is very nice.</li>
            <li> Very lightly scented as well, almost fragrance free it is so light.</li>
            <li> Very nice, but my wrinkles are too far gone to be erased.  </li>
            <li> Please come out with a full line!    </li>
            <li> This face cream is perfect for my extreme combination complexion.</li>

            <li> I love how rich and creamy it is</li>
            <li> Im pretty sure this is going to be your holy grail!</li>
            <li> Will continue purchasing this wonderful product and try other products too.</li>
            <li> It is fragrance free and great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It would be easy to walk by this in the store, when it is one that should be tried.</li>
            <li> It washes off easily and afterward my face still feels moisturized.</li>
            <li> This cream will help me feel more attractive, without the deep ruts of those mouth wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much I ordered more for my family members to use.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the fact that it is not greasy as I tend to breakout easily.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and absorbs well with a non-greasy feel.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT WAS EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li> but this has a very mild smell.</li>
            <li> I like this because it is easy to apply and feels like it does moisturize my face.</li>
            <li> Seller was very quick in responding to this review offering a refund.</li>
            <li> with anything, I have written pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s of the product so that it is easy to see why I rated this product a 5 out of 5 stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels so clean and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Makeup goes on easily</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rub in easily and does no provide any moisture.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I cant wait to continue using it more in the future.</li>
            <li> It is nice  (and probably a good idea) to stat using a quality facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Like that it does not have a strong odor.</li>
            <li> I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a really strong smell like a lot of creams.</li>
            <li> (I do not like when cream are strong smelling).I</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it since my skin is so sensitive to many products, but I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li> I have tried many products and this is nothing special in my opinion...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d certainly recommend it as a good, clean feeling moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and absorbs quickly into your skin with no greasy residue after.</li>
            <li> It is very light and seeps into your skin quite quickly.</li>
            <li> In just a couple of days skin feels much smoother and very healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use, seeing results of those fine lines.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> I wash my face first and rinse with warm water and then put the cream on before I go to bed</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best moisturizing cream ever.  </li>
            <li> I see a lot of reviewers think it has a light, pleasant scent, but to my overly sensitive nose,  it smells like a combination of spoiled grapes and mint toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if its as good as the new l&#x27;dara serum that&#x27;s out, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> As with its eye cream, the texture is light and can be easily applied.</li>
            <li> I noticed fine lines around my eyes fill in and fade away.  </li>
            <li> and I am seeing a decrease in fine lines.</li>
            <li> By day 3, I am seeing it help with fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I then applied the cream to my face and do have to say I feel like some of the fine lines that I have seem to be gone or fainter.  </li>
            <li> I have some sunspots, fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I cant comment on how it works for fine lines and wrinkles because its to soon, but I do think that it will definetly make a difference.</li>
            <li> The texture is smooth and creamy and blends into the skin easily.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and have noticed fine lines demenishing.  </li>
            <li> I can already see a noticeable difference in the fine lines on my forehead and eyes.</li>
            <li> I believe my fine lines are truly diminishing.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin (oily in some sections dry in others) and this is ideal for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I noticed the fine lines around my eyes just vanish.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, spreads easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin well hydrated, and I see some reduction in fine lines already.  </li>
            <li> It is light and non-sticky, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It does minimize your pores and fine lines.</li>

            <li> Over all I will enjoy the effect of the creams and plan to continue using the.</li>
            <li> and so far so good.</li>
            <li> many noticed that my face has become lighter and my wrinkles not that deep anymore.the price is good too for the size.</li>
            <li> but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Bummer... didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.. was really hoping for something great, I&#x27;m not glowing or softer or really anything...</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Felt really good last night  before bed and now this morning I love how it feels on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> The moisturizer goes on smoothly and hydrates my skin very well!!!  </li>
            <li> In all honestly, I was really looking forward to wonderful results - but after using the Andre Lorent Face Cream for 3 weeks (as a test), this face cream did not perform as promised, unfortunatelly my face was actually looking older and drier than before using this product.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs right away and doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice face cream and daily moisturizer, after applying my skin does feel smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> overall it is a very nice face cream</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool to the skin and has a mild fragrance like fresh clean smell!!</li>
            <li> but nothing &#x27;amazing&#x27; or particularly anti-aging.</li>
            <li> It feels very hydrating, absorbs quickly and has a nice light scent.  </li>
            <li> But the smell isn&#x27;t strong and goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy, dries quickly, and does not leave a sticky or greasy residue.</li>
            <li> this good surely must have sustained, long term results!</li>
            <li> There is no fragrance, which is nice, and it makes me skin feel very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any breakouts and my skin is so soft and my fine lines are disappearing!!  </li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling soft and smooth, great for your hands too!</li>
            <li> I must say I have tried many different creams and this one has definitely impressed me in a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited to see what it does for my skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I was excited to give this a try.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I am excited to continue  with it and see the changes.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and was so excited when it arrived.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact this small business is taking portions of products sold and donating to charities that&#x27;s AWESOME.</li>
            <li> I could see a remarkable change, moisture levels, in my face, after only 2 uses.</li>
            <li> It is so rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> Nice pleasant feel and no strong chemical smell, seems to be tightening the skin to remove the wrinkles just as advertised..</li>
            <li> So first off the jar is a decent size and you get a fair amount of product for the money.</li>
            <li> I will say the product is very creamy and easy to apply!  </li>
            <li> Very light fragrance (pleasant), spreads smoothly and evenly, soft on the skin, leaves my skin feeling moisturized and youthful; skin now seems to have a soft glow.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping for great long term results!</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and absorbs into skin quickly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light and absorbs quickly and is not breaking my skin out.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> My husband has allergies too and has commented that he likes the clean scent when he hugged me in the morning</li>
            <li> After using this for four days now I can honestly say that it most definitely  rejuvenated, nourished, moisturized, and smoothed my face and neck areas.  </li>
            <li> The cream goes on smooth and does not leave my skin greasy, just a nice soft feel.</li>
            <li> The cream goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly</li>

            <li> Absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling smooth, even overnight.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this cream works great and does not leave my skin feeling greasy like some creams do.  </li>
            <li> Really good stuff, reasonable, will get again, thanks</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that there were no added fragrances or colors because my skin is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> So far I love it!</li>
            <li> and my skin already feels so soft and smooth!!  </li>
            <li> It is very creamy and goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it works better than I thought, makes my skin feel soft and smooth, absorbs nicely and no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy, the scent is pleasant and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> It goes on very nicely and hydrates all day - even in my dry climate.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> The Crazy beautiful face cream by Andre Lorent is one of the face creams that has combined the best ingredients to make sure your skin is well nourished and at the same time reduces fine lines and wrinkles and also plumps it up and gives it a fresh glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not been using this long, but so far I am impressed.</li>
            <li> In no time my skin was soft and feeling amazing.</li>
            <li> I use this cream as my serum and then apply a moisturizer over this cream-incredible results after a full week.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and does not feel greasy at all, like many of the products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> So far I am loving this product.  </li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m eager to see the full result in 30 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Full disclosure this was provided to me by the seller to review.</li>
            <li> Creamy, soothing, and chock full of all of the anti-aging ingredients recommended by physicians</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is paraben free and makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> the price 2oz jar was so reasonable and to top that off</li>
            <li> be fair, at the same time this cream arrived</li>
            <li> Its a thick consistency so in the fall and winter its best to use it.</li>
            <li> I really like the way my skin feels after I use this face cream - so smooth!  </li>
            <li> far I am loving my face cream.</li>
            <li> But the wrinkles do not show as much as before since my face is more moist than before.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love having all these ingredients in one jar and at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> This really helps hydrate my skin, and makes it appear even better than before.</li>
            <li> although 72 hrs is hardly enough time to decide how good a skin care product is working.</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to putting this on now because it does feel good, and hopefully, it will help my skin over time.</li>
            <li> Just like any girl I am CONSTANTLY looking for a good face creme.  </li>

            <li> I will continue to use this product because I  love how my skin looks and feels so far.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, leaves a wonderful tightness and adds visible radiance after only a few minutes of application.</li>
            <li> I went to Ultra and was surprised how many products didn&#x27;t contain these 2 items.  </li>
            <li> so far, will want to order more.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do before and after pictures, so I don&#x27;t have my own personal yardstick.  </li>
            <li> Still too early to know if it is a favorite of mine yet.</li>
            <li> and I love it so far.</li>
            <li> It is quite nice actually.</li>
            <li> but so far this is a favorite.  </li>
            <li> Love that it is made from natural ingredients and has no additives or fillers.</li>
            <li> So far, just ok.</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased.</li>
            <li> in all, weighing the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s, you will see that this creme is definitely worth the 5 out of 5 star rating I give it.  </li>
            <li> feels so fresh</li>
            <li> My skin definitely feels nice once it soaks all the way in</li>
            <li> It is easily absorbed, never greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and will be buying more and will be buying some for my 74 year old mom.</li>
            <li> , fresh scent does what it says.</li>
            <li> but I love how soft it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that it uses natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> However, this cream I believe is good for young and old.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer so far I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain about it because it&#x27;s just a nice simple cream.  </li>
            <li> For the $20 it is well worth a try.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the consistency may be too light due to being in my &amp;#34;golden years&amp;#34;, but it works great and a little bit goes a long way - great for the budget!</li>
            <li> , this moisturizer slides on, melts into the skin, and is absorbed quickly, leaving your skin super soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This makes it worth the money right there.</li>
            <li> My skin is more toned and radiant probably due to more collagen production.</li>
            <li> After searching high and low for a product the would help with the crows feet around my eyes, I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li> It goes on very easily and really makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> Other than that its a good product</li>
            <li> Soaks right into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I can tell right away is that it&#x27;s creamy and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> and I like how it soaks right into my skin</li>
            <li> I received the Face Creme sample on Wednesday and started using it right away that evening.</li>
            <li> I used it right away</li>
            <li> the price is right on</li>
            <li> It was not greasy or overpowering, just the right amount of moisturizer for my face.</li>
            <li> As of right now, I like the feel of the cream.  </li>
            <li> So results right away</li>
            <li> Non-comodogenic,non greasy,soaks in right away.</li>
            <li> I will need more time to figure out if it really helps erase fine lines but so far I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It is super light weight and my skin has never felt so soft .</li>
            <li> I am 53 and time &amp; gravity has started catching up to me, but Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Anti-Aging Cream has really made a difference!</li>
            <li> The cream goes on smoothly, it is non greasy and it makes my skin feel real soft .</li>
            <li> This is a full 2oz which doesn&#x27;t seem like much</li>
            <li> Love the texture and feel of this cream and almost instantly made my face feel more alive and glowing.  </li>
            <li> I am a 41 year old lady and from time to time I love to treat myself with different face creams, to see if I can find something better than what I am using.  </li>
            <li> Given the price of the product, it&#x27;s really nice for it to go a long way before needing to replace.  </li>
            <li> It is very lightly scented which is nice and delicate.</li>
            <li> This product left my skin looking fresh and feeling healthy.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any anti aging benefits yet because its too soon to tell but overall its doing its job as a fragrance, free of dyes and chemicals free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I will definitely buy this again.  </li>
            <li> my skin in very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The fact that it is unscented is a huge bonus to me as I am very sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and smooth, glides onto your skin without making it feel greasy or sticky.  </li>
            <li> I was ready to make my own when I found Andre Lorent CRAZY BEAUTIFUL and</li>
            <li> For the price I think this is the perfect way for me to keep my face looking young as possible as long as I can.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing with no unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> Also love that is made by a company who believes in giving back and is made right here in the USA.</li>
            <li> I like it very much</li>
            <li> The price was for a 2oz jar which is very unusual all others are for a 1oz</li>
            <li> You can tell when you put it on and massage it in to your face and next that is very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Not greasy left my face very smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used the high end products and got to say that this is right up there with them!</li>

            <li> I was so excited to receive my new anti-aging face cream.  </li>
            <li> So far I love everything about it and it doesnt have a heavy scent, just very light and mild which I like.</li>
            <li> No heavy scent which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>

            <li> This premium face cream comes exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li> there is no sunscreen in this product, necessitating a second product over the top.  </li>
            <li> The next morning, my skin still looked better.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy &amp; leaves your skin smooth &amp; soft.</li>

            <li> It worked as far as my skin being smooth and not having any breakouts or issues, but just not the results I had read about.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Great product exactly as described.</li>

            <li> So it seems like a great value because it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> The first day I waited until night to use it before bed.</li>
            <li> I use this at night only and it works out better for me that</li>
            <li> To early to tell, but it goes on well and feels smooth.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>

            <li> Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I have several items from Andre Lorent and love them all.  </li>
            <li> Much like my review of the eye cream, I also like the face cream!  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different high-end products (including Rodan &amp; Fields, Dr. Perricone, etc)</li>
            <li> I have been applying first thing in morning and before bed.</li>
            <li> I am very please with the improvement!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I need for my type of skin.</li>
            <li> I have some red spots on my cheeks from dryness and most of those are already gone.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> The first thing that got my attention is the aroma.</li>
            <li> so I have only been able to use it 2 times after returning home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different face creams, from drugstores to department stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I purchased this cream, I&#x27;m definitely integrating it into my beauty routine!</li>
            <li> This cream makes your face feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Thanks for your help!</li>
            <li> First off....</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and creamy,no oily feeling  and no heavy smell to it.  </li>
            <li> but I make sure to put this on daily.  </li>
            <li> I put it on for the first time, and just forgot about it.</li>
            <li> Definitely a winner in my book. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 years old and my skin felt so smooth and it felt like the moisturizer seeped into my skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth and leaves your skin so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> and this is the first face cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I was particularly interested in the product because it contains argirelene which can help with under eye puffiness.  </li>
            <li> From the first day I&#x27;ve used it</li>
            <li> + year old skin feels fantastic.</li>
            <li> Whether you use them as an extra moisturizer, under your makeup, as a sunscreen etc I&#x27;m pretty sure everybody owns a face cream.</li>
            <li> I apply it first thing in the morning after washing my face and before going to bed.</li>
            <li> This is the first time purchase.</li>
            <li> Other than that I love it!</li>
            <li> It makes my face so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It seems promising!</li>
            <li> I have eczema and was hesitant to try this at first, but after all the glowing reviews, decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about a month on and off (not as consistently as I&#x27;d like)</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this cream is free from parabens, sulfates and other chemical additives!  </li>
            <li> With a very light scent, it is absorbed quickly, leaving no greasy residue, and gentle enough for even the very sensitive skin on my neck.</li>
            <li> I am honestly feeling excited because my fine lines are starting to become less visible</li>
            <li> This product super light on my skin and made it feel like I had just had a facial.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth and leaves my dry skin feeling silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is very creamy, absorbs quickly and seems to hydrate very well.</li>
            <li> This face cream goes on smooth and quickly absorbs into the skin with no oily sheen left on your face.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and absorbs very quickly with absolutely no greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Crazy Beautiful creme for just a couple of days, but so far I love it!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s also great about it ,is that a little bit goes a long way, and it has a very pleasant scent, rather delicate.</li>
            <li> And even though I had too much, it was not overly greasy or tacky; it soaked right in, no problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this cream, it definitely surprise me to see the positive results.</li>
            <li> I am imagine it will take a few weeks to get the Full effects of it!!!</li>
            <li> Despite nearing 40 years old, my skin is very oily, sensitive, and dries very easily.</li>
            <li> So far my skin feels nice and has not had any breakouts which is not usually the case when I try a new cream.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is rich and creamy, and it leaves your skin so soft in the morning.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and works easily under my foundation and other cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to observe whether fine lines on my face are reduced, but I do love the way it makes my skin feel and have even used it more than once a day, as suggested, which I almost never do with other products (in an effort to cheap out and stretch it).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly what&#x27;s in this little jar of magic, but it&#x27;s worth every dollar!</li>
            <li> This is amazing for those with sensitive skin such as myself.&lt;br /&gt;-  </li>
            <li> Only been using for 12 days and my whole complexion looks better, face is moisturized, even skin tone, and skin is plumper.  </li>
            <li> My face feels so nice and soft after using these for only a week!</li>
            <li> Overall a good hydrating facial cream.</li>
            <li> In overall it gives a nice fresh glow and has made the fine lines less visible.</li>
            <li> In overall it gives a nice fresh glow and has made the fine lines less visible.</li>
            <li> Best of all, I have no more dry patches.  </li>
            <li> It does have a VERY light scent, it won&#x27;t burn, or dry you out</li>
            <li> but if these few days are any indication, I think I will be very pleased.</li>
            <li> Not the least bit greasy, faces feels soft and smooth , is a good value.</li>
            <li> My blotchiness was pretty much gone</li>
            <li> I recently ordered my first jar of André Lorent CRAZY BEAUTIFUL Anti-Aging Face Cream, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term effects :)</li>
            <li> this is 100% free from parabens, sodium lauryl sulfate, and petro-chemical derivatives; so I felt confident that it wouldn&#x27;t irritates my skin; After using this myself, I&#x27;ve had no issues with any sensitivity to my skin, and have seen results in keeps and bounds in only a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice texture but not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I must say, I did not expect that it would be as good as the one I usually use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the opportunity to use it twice, so I haven&#x27;t noticed a decrease in fine lines yet, but it seems promising!</li>
            <li> It was absorbed very well by my skin and left it feeling soft and lovely.</li>
            <li> Many other creams cause me to break out into a rash because my face is so sensitive, but this one leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> It hydrates the skin with a small amount of use and is light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy or cause breakouts (I have super sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> so far I find that it absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> yet it soaks in quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> This cream is certainly a keeper for me</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based purely on the reviews and at this price it is a value.  </li>
            <li> I certainly recommend this product, based on my experience.</li>
            <li> Found my new moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for a few days and love the softness and can feel the tightening of the skin already!</li>
            <li> I do not normally use anything on my face, be it makeup or moisturizer, but I really love the way this makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so for the first night I applied the cream to the back of my hand to make sure that it would not break me out.</li>
            <li> I used the eye cream immediately and LOVED it (and still do, and it is going to last a very long time), but I was using another face cream at the time and wanted to finish that before I opened this.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin with a mild firmness feeling but not tight.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li> It comes in a decent size tub and its full, not partially full like many creams or cosmetics sometimes are.</li>
            <li> I have fine lines around my eyes and deeper ones on my forehead and décolletage and have not seen any change in them after using this twice daily.  </li>
            <li> Using it for about two weeks, I have noticed a definite improvement in fine lines.</li>
            <li> My fine lines are almost gone and my deep lines are coming up to fill in the groove.</li>
            <li> In the short amount of time I have used I can see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a reduction in fine lines after using it for just a short while.</li>
            <li> The texture is a little think but it rubs in to your skin nicely.</li>
            <li> Having only used this for a couple of days, I have appreciated the fact that it is non-greasy and leaves my skin feeling smooth and supple.  </li>
            <li> It feels very silky as you smooth it on your face and absorbs into your skin almost instantly.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this face cream to anyone looking for a no-nonsense hydrating routine!   </li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> My eyelids are especially sensitive and this cream has not caused a problem at all.  </li>
            <li> The cream really doesn&#x27;t have any scent.</li>
            <li> so there isn&#x27;t much improvement yet</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It softens and smooths the skin gently without that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I really like this face cream.  </li>
            <li> The hand that I applied the cream on feels much smoother and softer.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face feel very moisturized but not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Great customer service...not to see a company that cares and stands behind its product.  </li>
            <li> This cream is really nice...not greasy.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a change from the cream after two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Really like it.  </li>
            <li> It make my skin very try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The combination of Matrixyl, Argireline, Hyaluronic Acid and manual stimulation really does stimulate the production of collagen beneath the skin, filling the wrinkles and reversing the aging.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have found brands and formulas that work really well with me and my troublesome skin</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think to take a before picture because I really didn&#x27;t think that this would work</li>
            <li> I bought this moisturizer after spending too much time in the sun.</li>
            <li> This worked way better than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very optimistic.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the scent much, but since I wear it at night before bed  it&#x27;s not much of an issue for me, although it might be for someone that is more sensitive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not irritating.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t break out as much.</li>
            <li> It is light enough youse on oily skin</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I also really like how I can feel the creme &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; up my skin as it dries.</li>
            <li> I just ordered it and the shipping was Fast.</li>
            <li> I really see softer skin in the area of  my nose/eye.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t normally purchase a face cream over the internet unless I knew the product first</li>
            <li> The cream works well both night and day- under makeup and primer really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this face cream.</li>
            <li> Though I have skin on the oily side, it&#x27;s not too much for it.</li>
            <li> Really works well under make up, make up just glides on.</li>
            <li> Very creamy and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> so I really wanted to test it out.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this face cream to anyone looking for a no-nonsense hydrating routine!</li>
            <li> I really like this and will buy again.  </li>

            <li> It has made my skin feel smooth overall.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much</li>

            <li> I would highly recommend this face cream to anyone looking for a no-nonsense hydrating routine!</li>
            <li> I really like the way this feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the cream and the smell of it.</li>
            <li> It feels light enough that it may not.  </li>
            <li> In the week that I&#x27;ve used it, I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in aging</li>
            <li> My skin is firmer and I really think it is helping with the wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> When you open up the lid you will notice the creme is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> so much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It moisturizes very well without being greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> Its like a drink for my very thirsty skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so much softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li> It does help some but not as much as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li> She makes you feel like you really are a friend.  </li>
            <li> Very prompt.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see much difference on my face.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t notice much of a difference since I have been using the product.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this cream feels on my face.</li>
            <li> and it did not cause any breakouts ( that is a real plus with me ).</li>
            <li> It is light enough to use as a day cream, yet feels nourishing as a night cream too.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this face cream!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several days and already my face feels smooth and softer.</li>
            <li> I really like the whipped consistency and</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t seem to see any real progress in removing my wrinkles</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see any &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; benefits, but I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> - I have never been so surprised by a face cream (and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything!)  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and looks more radiant already, when I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I may not purchase again is because I prefer a nice fragrance, especially at night.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received this product at a heavily discounted price/free in exchange for an unbiased, honest review, which I gave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like that this cream has no scent and is not thick at all!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product long, but I love it so far!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue like other creams I have used in the past and also has a light pleasant smell to it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products, but none that compare to this one.</li>
            <li> As a test I also applied the cream to the top of one hand and not to the other.  </li>
            <li> But I like it better than an other cream I ordered for anti-aging type issues.</li>
            <li> After only 1 week of use it has significantly diminished my age spots/freckles, and my forehead, eye, and around the mouth wrinkles have noticably softened.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way making it a great value.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to recieve this facial cream in the mail today and couldnt wait to try it.</li>
            <li> I have used many other creams</li>
            <li> Love that it dont make my face feelin greasy like the other moisturiser I was using..</li>
            <li> I excited to see the effects after using this on a regular basis!</li>
            <li> It does have a rich texture and you can feel the tightening effect instantly.  </li>
            <li> I know I sound like a TV commercial, but I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> How it does it, I&#x27;m not sure, but I will definitely buy again and hope to continue seeing great results.  </li>
            <li> I love that it has 5 active ingredients in 1 jar to fight wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Now that I am getting older, I really care what I put onto/into my body.</li>
            <li> The second ingredient is green tea extract so the cream smells amazing to me!  </li>
            <li> I just used the cream for the first time tonight and so far really like it.</li>
            <li> While the cream does feel thick upon applying it quickly gets absorbed into your skin leavinging feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Very comparable to high priced creams.</li>
            <li> The first thing I have to say I noticed about this face cream is how silky soft my face felt.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how effective it is</li>
            <li> Skin felt so soft since the first use..</li>
            <li> My face never peeled, and after the first application, my face felt soft.</li>
            <li> That being said, so far I really like it!</li>
            <li> I believe with daily use this could certainly slow the additional formation of wrinkles, and give me more healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft after using this for the first time.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that after the first night I used it</li>
            <li> I still need to use it more to compare the results of wrinkles and dark spots.</li>
            <li> So far,  I&#x27;m really liking it!  </li>
            <li> The first night i used it made my skin so soft and</li>
            <li> I have only used this a couple of days so far, so I can&#x27;t speak as to results, but I love that it is natural ingredients and not a bunch of junk.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days, but wanted to say that really feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;ve only been using this cream a few days, it seems to be a very nice moisturizer for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Two thumbs up for this Daily Moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> It goes on white but quickly absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for several days now and my skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The product made my skin left feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have a newborn and must say my face, cheeks especially feel almost as soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Seems to be decent.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel very soft and silky!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very affordable while containing all the anti oxidants skin needs to stay young and radiant!</li>
            <li> The one thing I really like is that I have incredibly sensitive skin, and I didn&#x27;t have any reactions to this at all!</li>
            <li> I have to say that the face cream is very creamy and it took only a small amount for good coverage.</li>
            <li> Works very well when used right after a bath or shower locking in extra</li>
            <li> My laugh lines are not as noticeable, my skin looks full and less &amp;#34;droopy&amp;#34; and</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> The product is packaged well and has a high end appearance, presentation and feel.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly allergic to smells</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a thick, rich cream that leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I like that they use pure natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> but so far am liking cream!!</li>
            <li> I then put just a little on the top of my hand and rub it in just as I would on my face.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li> This is extremely lightweight and absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this was quite gentle on my face.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like this cream.  </li>
            <li> I am not one of those women who believe there is any product that can take away the natural aging process, so my expectations are reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have not broken out while using it as that was a concern since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I started using this cream like month ago ,this cream really works, my skin is so much soft .</li>
            <li> I was really surprised because I started noticing changes on my skin and feeling really</li>
            <li> The cream texture is very moistened and soft.</li>
            <li> I do like that it does not have an odor to it and is not thick and sticky.  </li>
            <li> I am sensitive to real perfumy smells</li>
            <li> I was surprised how fast it was shipped and received.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating and is making my fine lines and wrinkles much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Even just after a few days, I noticed a difference, to the point where I&#x27;m confident to walk out of the house without any makeup on.  </li>
            <li> Being fair skinned and having stayed out of the sun or using sunscreen, my face is not  leathery and people usually guess my age about 10 years younger.  </li>
            <li> to what it will do in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> I cannot attest to the &amp;#34;anti aging&amp;#34; claim yet as I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference, but I can see how it could give those results after more use.</li>
            <li> It smells like your normal skin cream.</li>
            <li> I love the fluffy feel of the product.  </li>
            <li> Nice thick consistency.</li>
            <li> Another nice benefit was it didn&#x27;t react to my rosacea and actually calmed down the reddening on my face.  </li>
            <li> Best of all, my dry skin still feels soft and moisturized 12 hours later - not greasy in the least, but</li>
            <li> As one who has had very sensitive skin all her life, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> And if the product works, it&#x27;s worth a few minutes of mild discomfort.</li>
            <li> If I have questions she gets right back to me.  </li>
            <li> A huge plus for me is the omission of harmful ingredients and it is hard to find a quality product attached to a reasonable price that actually makes your face feel smooth as well as give it a supple appearance.  </li>
            <li> Throughout the week I have noticed that my wrinkle lines are becoming less visible.</li>
            <li> same, fine wrinkles on cheeks were same.</li>
            <li> This cream is CRAZY good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my fine lines are starting to be less noticeable and it seems to have helped with my smile lines.</li>
            <li> It is light when it is applied but is extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I do have some and want to make sure I look young as long as possible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping that someone from the company&#x27;s customer service department will let me exchange this for a new jar because I can&#x27;t use this product if the smell makes me want to puke from just a whiff of it.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to someone wanting to try something new for skincare.</li>
            <li> I was a bit unsure about using a new face cream, as a lot of time, I have breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always hesitant to try new face creams as one never knows what it may do.  </li>
            <li> Being in my thirties, it is very important to moisturize everyday!</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and the dry patches are gone!!!</li>
            <li> Of course having only applied this cream to my face for 2 days I haven&#x27;t really noticed much difference in wrinkle lines or skin firming.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this face cream especially if you have sensitive or easily irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This cream instantly absorbs into skin and is light enough to wear under makeup during the day.  </li>
            <li> I am 50+ and spend as much time as possible outdoors, so it would not be reasonable to expect my wrinkles to disappear, but what the cream has done is give me noticeably softer, healthier-looking skin.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely continue buying this CRAZY BEAUTIFUL Anti Aging Face Cream!</li>
            <li> This cream is thick enough to be a good night cream but not too greasy.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I must say I&#x27;m very surprised.</li>
            <li> This face cream is unscented which was a plus for me as I am very sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have combination, very sensitive skin and am 35.</li>
            <li> not greasy at all and leaves my skin feeling very soft an supple.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes well and leaves my skin very soft and supple.</li>
            <li> and I woke up to very soft skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Feels very soft and non greasy.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and a lot of moisturizers</li>
            <li> but I have already noticed that it leaves my skin feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s texture and makes my face feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I was a Lil reluctant because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly I want to add that my skin is very sensitive, and at times can be overly oily.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> I love how a very small amount of the cream spreads over a large skin surface area so no waste!.</li>
            <li> I have seen a huge difference in the dark patches.  </li>
            <li> The all natural composition makes this even more appealing because you know you are not putting dangerous, synthetic substances on your skin.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I actually double took my face the morning after the first night of use.</li>
            <li> and I am surprised at the quality!</li>
            <li> This cream seems to make me look slightly younger after using it consistently twice a day.</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever made my skin feel so soft!  </li>
            <li> The first thing I do when I open a jar is to smell.  </li>
            <li> Have only used once but interested to see longer term results.</li>
            <li> Just my Crazy Beautiful moisturizer you want to give it a try?  </li>
            <li> Also ANDRE LORENT CRAZY BEAUTIFUL</li>
            <li> This facial cream most definitely has essential oils and nutrients that made my skin thrive and glow.  </li>
            <li> Skin felt soft and lines seem to plump up reducing the depth of the wrinkles!  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Crazy Beautiful Anti Aging Face Cream for about one week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several anti aging products (yes I&#x27;m fighting it ;-) )</li>
            <li> Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Anti Aging Face Crème</li>
            <li> and was appreciatively surprised!</li>
            <li> B00N9D8PES Andre Lorent CRAZY BEAUTIFUL Anti Aging Face Cream &amp;#x25CF; Revolutionary 5-In-1 Skin Repair Formula</li>
            <li> Crazy Beautiful Face Cream</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Time will tell if it helps these old wrinkles !  </li>
            <li> I work 8 hour shifts and wear Crazy Beautiful under my make-up and it lasts</li>
            <li> and this face cream absorbed very well and did not feel greasy like other creams I have used.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, smooth and creamy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I find it to be a nice creamy consistancy and that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have used many very expensive face creams in the past and this stuff is better in many ways.  </li>
            <li> I am sensitive to a lot of fragrance and was nervous to try something new.</li>
            <li> It smells like big red on someone&#x27;s breathe sweet but spicy.</li>
            <li> Crazy beautiful face creme so far is living up to its name.</li>
            <li> And it works in conjunction with the rest of my skin care line which also surprised me since I have very sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> It actually works better than my other cream!</li>
            <li> Andre Lorent is helping this 41 year old continue to look like I am in my early 30s!</li>
            <li> Now that we are going into the cold winter months , my face  gets really dry and this face cream is perfect .thankyou</li>
            <li> I am almost 44 and have been seeing the signs of aging lately, so when I saw this product I just had to give it a try and see if it helped with these fine lines!</li>
            <li> This cream has a delicate, very light scent and has visibly helped with the wrinkles around my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have only used Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Face Cream for a few days and my face is smoother and more hydrated than it was before.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t wear any makeup and for the past few days my face and neck have really looked more colorful - glowing</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to really notice a change in the wrinkles, but my skin is hydrated and soft without being oily and I am looking forward to continuing to use Crazy Beautiful!</li>
            <li> Within just a few days there was a noticeable difference in the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good that a very small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It also absorbs quickly and hydrates my skin without being sticky or greasy like a lot of other creams out there.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin smoother, not as dry, and better coloring due to being moisturized.</li>
            <li> I really like this facial cream so far.</li>
            <li> I am 64 years young and have been using a variety of serums including high-end Kate Somerville.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face soft after use.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have had no problems at all with irritation.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This cream doesn&#x27;t have any smell and it does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far this is just what I need.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight enough that I can even wear it under makeup, but it still feels very nourishing to my skin.</li>
            <li> There is a seal on the outside of the plastic container to protect the product until you are ready to use it/for evidence of tampering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and makes my skin feel so soft and gives it a youthful glow.  </li>
            <li> In just the short time I have been using it my skin feels so much softer.  </li>
            <li> Theres no harsh smells.</li>
            <li> The cream is light, not oily or heavy.  </li>
            <li> so far.  </li>
            <li> .so far. .</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Leaves my face soft and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> So far I give it a two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Although I can&#x27;t really see any reduction of facial lines, at the age of  68</li>
            <li> It leaves your face feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> All around my face too, I have now sensitive skin and completely lost smoothness.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making and selling such an awese and affordable product!</li>
            <li> I have mature aging skin and this cream keeps my face moist all day.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and I have not seen any adverse reactions to this product.  </li>
            <li> Makes skin really soft, and it has softened lines in my neck and face.</li>
            <li> I guess this means I&#x27;m old....</li>
            <li> I am almost 69 years old and am trying to grow old gracefully.</li>
            <li> I like everything about it so far</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft all day and</li>
            <li> I give most face creams at least two weeks to impress me.</li>
            <li> It is not a heavy cream so can be used by people with oily skin.</li>
            <li> but I have sensitive skin &amp; no problems there.</li>
            <li> That being said, I like what I have seen of this product so far.</li>
            <li> It does not have much, if any scent, which is a big plus for me.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and even toned.</li>
            <li> the cream is so soft and luxurious.  </li>
            <li> It melts into my skin, leaving it soft and supple.</li>
            <li> It has my forty-nine year old complexion looking plumped and smoothed.</li>
            <li> + year old skin</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels soft already.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> This cream made my face wonderfully soft immediately after putting it on.  </li>
            <li> I just received this product recently so far</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still to early to tell about the anti aging aspect</li>
            <li> Skin is soft, no sensitivity issues.  </li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t take much to completely cover your face.</li>
            <li> My skin is also sensitive.</li>
            <li> I shall not grow old gracefully...</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and have had no problems with this cream.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy..</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell what the results will be but so far I am liking it.</li>
            <li> My face really does look healthier and younger.</li>
            <li> Because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Some lines and wrinkles did not go away completely, but  there was a difference.</li>
            <li> It really penetrated into my skin and left my skin feeling nourished.  </li>
            <li> I finally received my much anticipated face cream from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 58 years old and have been feeling and seeing my face showing signs age.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> I got mine 2 days ago, I already felt my face smoother and soft.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also love that it goes a long way and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the only face cream I will be using!!!</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and plump.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling hydrated and soft.  </li>
            <li> Natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> but so far so</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> It is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs completely and does not leave my skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> but it does leave my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft and moisturized all day</li>
            <li> It has a natural feel.</li>
            <li> This has not done that so far.  </li>
            <li> You can actually feel your face tightening as it  was absorbing.</li>
            <li> at the end of the day, my skin was not oily like it was with my old face cream.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and eaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried creams for sensitive skin, moisturizing, combination skin....</li>
            <li> It does leave my skin soft and no break outs.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it seems to be working well for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I can immediately feel it absorb into my skin and my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily, yet skin is soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> My skin is so incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> That being said I am starting to get a few crows feet, some laugh lines and its not as much fun as I thought.</li>
            <li> Soft, light scent not overpowering, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I love that because I have tried lotions that simply leave your skin greasy and with a heavy residue and then feel the need to wash it off.</li>
            <li> Ive only been using this cream for a few days now and I am already in love with this cream.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this cream for a few days, but I love it.  </li>
            <li> This cream is very light and a little but goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> and it sinks right into the skin.</li>
            <li> Great product, a little bit goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way which I love about this product.  </li>
            <li> I first wanted to try the texture and allergy reaction on the back of my hand, before using it on my face - it does feel silky on the back on my hand and no reaction (I have sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li> It has an extremely creamy texture and is quickly absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> I notice that the little fine lines are a lot smoother or gone my skin looks right and tight.</li>
            <li> but let&#x27;s be real, we all hope to stay young long.</li>
            <li> Has made my skin soft and smooth, and cleared up small bumps on my forehead that appear when the seasons change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using facial moisturizer along with the Crazy Beautiful Eye Creme</li>
            <li> I use it morning and night, and still have almost a quarter of a jar left in the first one, so one jar is lasting me</li>
            <li> I have fine lines around my eyes and they seem to be less obvious than before.  </li>
            <li> It reduces the wrinkles in my face that makes me feel older and it makes me feel and look younger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days but my skin already looks and feels smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more of this little gem in the future.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see see a huge change in the facial appearance, but I do notice that my face feels slightly tighter.</li>
            <li> The cream absorbs quickly not oily just smooth and you only need a dap on your finger.  </li>
            <li> It is free of fragrances that usually make my skin irritated.</li>
            <li> My husband even complimented me on how smooth my skin felt (and trust me, my guy usually don&#x27;t notice that).  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for long but is a very cream.  </li>
            <li> Only used it twice so far but makes my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li> The only problem is, wrinkle cream normally breaks me out.  </li>
            <li> The first day it felt a little heavy on my skin but the second day was better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy like some creams and it seems to be working because my fine lines aren&#x27;t as noticeable as they used to be and doesn&#x27;t make my makeup look wonky.</li>
            <li> You only need a little and it is so light that you don&#x27;t even feel it.</li>
            <li> My face tends to be dry and this cream left my face feeling soft and supple after the first use.  </li>
            <li> People are actually asking me if I&#x27;m using a new make-up...</li>
            <li> Definitely a new addition to my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to seeing my new younger skin!</li>
            <li> The cream itself is very creamy and light not runny or thin.</li>
            <li> I usually have trouble with face creams becoming oily on my skin as the day goes by, but this cream moisturizes the dry patches that have been flaky, leaving them silky smooth</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t smell, and it is sensitive enough for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen improvement in the lines around my mouth after only a few days and it leaves my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It is light and non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;After only a few days wrinkles appeared softer as this cream was plumping and firming.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much either, just add a few dots to your skin and gently rub it in.</li>
            <li> I do not yet know about long term results,but the first application will make your skin noticeably different in texture and appearance!  </li>
            <li> I have been using it in the morning and at bedtime and my skin is feeling soft and not dry or greasy.  </li>
            <li> Odorless, fluffy cream that absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick and also does not have a strong scent at all.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very supple and soft in general, but its still very dry.</li>
            <li> The results of using this are very apparent.</li>
            <li> So many very expensive creams do nothing at all for wrinkles but are great moisturizers or charge a ridiculous amount of money to do the same thing.</li>
            <li> Have only been using for a day and my skin is already so soft and supple!</li>
            <li> It absorbs easily, it does not smell and you only need to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> The wrinkles around my mouth (laugh lines) seem less apparent.</li>
            <li> At first I was surprised at how small the bottle was, but I found that a little goes a long way, so there is more product there than it appears.</li>
            <li> Within two days of using Crazy Beautiful cream, my dry, flaky skin was gone!</li>
            <li> A very subtle, but good feeling which I hadn&#x27;t expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m revising this review after using it for another 3-4 days, my face feels drier than ever, when I smile all the fine lines are more accentuated and worst of it all, the eye cream of the same brand I am using started causing this burning sensation around my eyes and the next thing I realize this morning that I have white small pimples on top of my eyelids and my eyelids are red and very sensitive.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m a 60 plus year old guy with little experience in this area, but I take lots of vitamins and supplements.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use face cream because it&#x27;s hard to find a good one.</li>
            <li> Your face cream has not caused breakouts and seems to help clear up and heal the breakout that I had prior to using your cream.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely purchase this again and recommend to those interested to at least try it.</li>
            <li> This cream goes on so smooth and you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel really soft and dewy,even the next morning.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, which is also mixed.  </li>
            <li> I initially took the equivalent of a small marble when I first opened the container, and that was too much.  </li>
            <li> After just one use, my face was so soft the next morning...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and any time I used any facial cream</li>
            <li> I like that it is not heavily scented and is an actual cream</li>
            <li> My face looks younger and feels soft.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and creamy with a light fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick but goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li> When you apply the face creme for the first time (I applied it to my face after washingit in the evening and even put some down on my chin and neck.)</li>
            <li> Have only been using cream for less than 1 week and so far no breakouts which is plus for me with my very oily skin!  </li>
            <li> Every face cream I have ever used has been either too heavy or too light and didn&#x27;t help my dry skin issues.  </li>
            <li> Last two days I noticed it has left my face very soft.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way - I definitely grabbed too much the first time.</li>
            <li> There was a slight tingle when first applied but that went away in a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> I also noticed my skin was not getting super oily like it usually does.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few days but so far I do like it very much.</li>
            <li> Some other reviews say they don&#x27;t like the smell of this cream, but I have yet to smell really anything from it.</li>
            <li> Like the feel and texture of the face cream,  It&#x27;s thick and rich, any difference in my skin...</li>
            <li> I am always concerned about trying new creams due to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The other nice thing is that it will last a long time since  you need very little.  </li>
            <li> This is a true premium high quality active anti aging facial cream based on organic Camellia, Green Tea Extract, &amp; Sunflower Seed Oil, plus it&#x27;s  enriched with additional herbal extracts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got some sun damage (I live in Texas), I smoke(trying to quit), and I&#x27;m menopausal (dry skin).</li>
            <li> I know I sound shallow</li>
            <li> My skin feels firmer but not dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for one day and one night, but it goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t too thick.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t see much of a difference, but other than that the smell isn&#x27;t bad and the texture is nice!</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer for the past three days and find my skin is smooth and no longer dry.  </li>
            <li> Face creams are one of the most necessary things to have because your face skin is very delicate and needs extra nourishment.</li>
            <li> I have no regrets and will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a few days, but so far my skin feels so much softer.  </li>
            <li> I cannot yet say if it works as well as my normal anti aging moisturizer as I&#x27;ve not used it long enough, but it seems to be about the same as my $70 cream.  </li>
            <li> I will be interested to see how my skin looks in another few weeks.</li>
            <li> this face cream is perfect, it keeps my skin moisture all day, and that usually doesn&#x27;t happen, because I get dry patches all through the cold season.</li>
            <li> (at first, I thought this was an unscented product), but I am very sensitive to scents - I either love or hate them - and this one I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive dry skin and living in Alaska does not help.  </li>
            <li> My previous night cream went so fast,</li>
            <li> My skin had some dry patches and this cream completely took care of the dryness.</li>
            <li> my skin has felt baby soft, my adult acne has cleared by day 5 and my skin has brightened up a lot including dark spots.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say anything about the anti aging benefits, but I do like it so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always found it impossible to find a face cream with the trifecta: one that&#x27;s anti-aging, but also a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is pretty thick and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or greasy after applying, it just feels soft and deeply moisturized.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is pretty thick and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or greasy after applying, it just feels soft and deeply moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love that it is FREE of all the bad things and was MADE IN THE USA!</li>
            <li> Greatly decreased fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Added a little roundness that I wasn&#x27;t expecting and wasn&#x27;t real fond of.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised how far a little goes, which should make this last quite awhile.  </li>
            <li> It smells sour and a little sweet in a gross way.</li>
            <li> But not the case here, it sinks right in and leaves your skin feeling very soft and subtle.  </li>
            <li> It was just the right texture, not too thick to apply and did not feel oily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will notice much as far as skin improvement goes, since I have been using other products that include some of the same ingredients.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy and doesn&#x27;t absorb particularly well.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t speak to how it will be long term because I have only had it a few days</li>
            <li> I gave this four stars simply because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see what type of improvement or change it may/may not make for my skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t quite used it long enough to give a solid review</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say how it works on wrinkles but will update later.</li>
            <li> The two products together have significantly reduced lines in my face, especially the forehead area, over the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used it long enough to benefit from all of the manufacturer&#x27;s claims but I am using it as recommended and have no doubts it won&#x27;t be long before I&#x27;m back online following up.</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and more subtle  after only a few uses!  </li>
            <li> I could feel firming of my skin after the first application and the lines around my neck and upper chest area are a lot less noticeable in less than a week.</li>
            <li> it is hard to really review!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it very long to see the effects for aging but it will be a facial cream that I will use daily!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m typically picky about lotions and creams, especially because I am sensitive to processed additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this product, especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27; very true where they say it&#x27;s non irritating!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t decide on a skin product until I&#x27;ve used consistently for at least two months.  </li>
            <li> I think 3 months ago and now almost out because it last that long.  </li>
            <li> so I like that this will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I have not been using long enough to see any anti aging benefits.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a lot in the jar so should last me quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> normally I&#x27;m feeling &amp;#34;parched&amp;#34; within a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for&lt;br /&gt;Several days and immediately,with the first use received compliments on how glowy my face was, it&#x27;s not greasy but the thick cream leaves you well moisturizer all day.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed (with no change in sleep) is that I looked less tired, much fresher.</li>
            <li> Due to illness and heredity, I have some major wrinkles, grandma-lines as my granddaughters call them.</li>
            <li> and you only need to use a very small amount for the whole face so the jar will last a while.</li>
            <li> It is very long lasting and seems to continue to moisturize all day.  </li>
            <li> creases in my forehead are far less pronounced, softer and far less visible.  </li>
            <li> I can definitely tell that they are softer and not as dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few days and so far my skin seems a lot softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> Only used a few times so far</li>
            <li> Nice cream that is not too thick or thin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick, and it sinks right into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Siobhan</li>
            <li> Did not seem to be doing anything different than any other facial cream.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very natural, and not strong at all.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and only need one coverage versus others that I have used that would need a couple applications.</li>
            <li> The only drawback for me was that I prefer a heavier moisturizing cream as my skin is very dry.</li>
            <li> and so far have little results.  </li>
            <li> Consequently I decided to stop using this product, and right away went back to my previous beauty routine, which is Merle Norman Anti-Aging Complex Night Cream and La Roche-Posay Redermic R</li>
            <li> you will notice your skin feels like it has been plumped, any little problem laugh lines or small wrinkles feel like they are being removed (or stretched out by the fullness in your face).  </li>
            <li> Too bad because it feels and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this lotion as it says small family run business,  but now after weeks of use its really just not good.</li>
            <li> way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent to me is more of a cold cream, vitamin type smell.</li>
            <li> If you are not sensitive to scents, I wouldn&#x27;t factor the scent into your purchase of this</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using that long</li>
            <li> but it did cause some minor breakouts on my face.  </li>
            <li> but if you have any questions about my long term experience with a product please leave a comment</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I haven&#x27;t been using this cream too long</li>
            <li> I have used it a few days and there is marked improvement on the skin surface.</li>
            <li> and I see myself using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> As long as it doesn&#x27;t irritate or inflame my skin</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> and i hope it works for long</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long but can see the difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> my skin has a different glow to it - this one is harder to explain</li>
            <li> Looking forward to seeing long term use effects.  </li>
            <li> I am looking forward to see the long term results.</li>
            <li> do not know what long term results may be.</li>
            <li> I will be using this face creme for a long time to come!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels hydrated all day long.</li>
            <li> goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Ill use it daily to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my normal dry skin, which is difficult in the winter season, much softer already.</li>
            <li> Another thing that I&#x27;ve noticed is that my skin tends to dry out after a few hours of wearing foundation and so far I haven&#x27;t noticed it doing that since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> A little bit went a long way and I will definitely purchase this face cream in the future.  </li>
            <li> I cant wait to see the long term effects of using this cream!</li>
            <li> I look forward to seeing how this creme works over the long haul!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be looking into other products made by Andre Lorent&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> , I won&#x27;t get them for a long while!</li>
            <li> I have tried several other product for twice the cost that did not have the results this crème provided.</li>
            <li> I am 34 and just begun noticing some little lines around my eyes (especially with another newborn around) and those have diminished quite a lot actually.</li>
            <li> I will be using this for a long time!</li>
            <li> and hopefully in the long run, I&#x27;ll be glowing and look 25 again!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long, long way - this is important to me because facial creams tend to be expensive and I never feel the value is there for what you get.</li>
            <li> The moistened feeling lasts very long.</li>
            <li> I havent had the cream very long.</li>
            <li> My husband has dry skin and none of the department store creams he has tried have worked well for him.  </li>

            <li> I have really dry skin in the winter time</li>
            <li> I cannot function without moisturizers and serums because my skin is perpetually dry and problematic.</li>
            <li> Helps with my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This one does NOTHING except dry &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and not irritate.  </li>
            <li> The dry winter months are</li>
            <li> then it is \\&quot;must have\\&quot; item because it soothes the dry skin after sweating without any stimulation.</li>
            <li> As soon as the Indiana weather becomes dry, my eyebrows and face start getting flaky.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this every morning and night and says it has helped with her dry skin areas and has made her skin softer.</li>
            <li> I have been fighting dry patches on my face that are so dry</li>
            <li> It has helped with my winter time dry skin.</li>
            <li> I swear my sensative itchy dry skin has gone away since I have started using this product.</li>

            <li> I Luv supporting small Buisness!!</li>
            <li> I find that this cream is just as good and a lot less painful and costly than the other option.  </li>
            <li> I never really noticed a difference with other face creams, but this one definitely leaves my face feeling moisturized, which lasts throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it so much that I had to snap this pic of the boxes since the jar looks extremely used and not photograble due to excessive use</li>
            <li> I will do an update on the wrinkles and dark spots at a later time.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The cream leaves your skin soft and radiant without excessive shine.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my dark spot on my face is fading definitely will recommend it.</li>
            <li> I usually have problems with breakouts when I use some face creams but no breakouts so far.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of buying this, as I am with many beauty products.  </li>
            <li> That took a long time!!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way as well so used sparingly it should last quite a while!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant at first because others mentioned it was thick and greasy.  </li>
            <li> The dry patches are gone!  </li>
            <li> When I got the Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Anti Aging face Cream, I was skeptical about the quality of the product I was receiving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for less than a week and my skin feels obviously softer and looks smoother.</li>
            <li> They are just starting to appear and I want them to be as small as possible or not even there.  </li>
            <li> and I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> With that said, I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and winter is hell on it.  </li>
            <li> but I have a very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Skin feels tight after putting it on, looks like there is not enough moisturizer in it.</li>
            <li> This little jar will last a long long time as a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I am very curious to see what the long term holds for this skin cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great in the morning because we have had some very cold weather lately.</li>
            <li> I also like my facial cream a little creamier feeling.</li>
            <li> It left my face a little oily.</li>
            <li> I also like that you only need to use a little bit of this cream..</li>
            <li> It absorbs quick and doesnt leave a weird film/coating on your face like some other creams.  </li>
            <li> I can say that I haven&#x27;t noticed the miraculous changes that some have claimed to have after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> Only been using it a few days</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t left my face feeling greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li> Especially with the harsh Winter coming. . .</li>
            <li> Have only been using for a few days, but I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> That is harder to find than it should be!&lt;br</li>
            <li> will get back to my review on the results after a few days.</li>
            <li> Only a few procducts that cost up $100+</li>
            <li> Not very moisturizing,but also not greasy.</li>
            <li> i have only used it for a few days</li>
            <li> Only been using a few days but</li>
            <li> I have only been using this face cream for a few days, ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to see what it does over the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for only a few days...</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few days</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days</li>
            <li> However it arrived faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I only had this cream for a few day and already I&#x27;m seeing a difference.  </li>
            <li> Too soon to tell if it has softened up my wrinkles, but will give an update after the jar is empty.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like heavy creams that leave your face feeling so sludgy and this one definitely doesn&#x27;t!!</li>
            <li> I have only used a few days.</li>
            <li> I have only been using for a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product a few days</li>
            <li> A woman in her 60&#x27;s, I see results in my aging, dry skin especially around the creases of my nose which usually has flaking.</li>
            <li> I have only used for a few days and my skin already feels softer and less dry and wrinkly.  </li>
            <li> I expected to wake up with oil around my T-Zone like with other products</li>
            <li> The only minor complaint that I have is that the packaging does not do it justice.</li>
            <li> cream is one of those where a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a LONG way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> After applying the face creme (remember with this stuff a LITTLE goes a LONG way)</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> product is creamy &amp; very, very little is needed, therefore should last for months!  </li>
            <li> This cream is thick enough that it only takes a little.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have any unpleasant odor and is paba free.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount of the product and rub it into your skin.  </li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t leave a trail of white heads on my face like other brands that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I am assuming that is due to the plumping effect because it does go away</li>
            <li> According to the other reviews, I thought this product was supposed to be fragrance-free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is lightweight but extremely moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I usually stop using a moisturizer when I don&#x27;t feel any improvement after a week to 10 days , this one I will definitely keep buying !</li>
            <li> I have noticed some changes in my skin tone due to the hydration of my skin.  </li>
            <li> so it past his nose test which is a big plus!!!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how one knows when a facial product is working.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with your perfume or other scents you&#x27;re wearing.  </li>
            <li> my face would instantly burn and itch and unlike other products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I left a review 3 days ago, with a rating of 4 because I like the product, but was not sure if all the claims on the package would work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy this product again and try other products from this company.</li>
            <li> The other advantage is that you use this cream for the morning and evening.</li>
            <li> but just because of the other ways on which I can tell that it has already made a difference, I am sold.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel sticky like some other products I have used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review in 30 days with other changes made to my skin from this product.</li>
            <li> It also does not make my skin feel greasy as some other face creams do.</li>
            <li> Unlike other anti-aging creams I&#x27;ve tried, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin with a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling, and it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;ball-up&amp;#34; like some creams do when I&#x27;m applying my makeup foundation.</li>
            <li> I began using anti-aging products a few years back with little satisfaciton.  </li>
            <li> so I have to be very careful and diligent with products I can use on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical when I ordered this cream, based on the price, but the other reviews were so positive, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days since I began using this product so I&#x27;ll update again in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Then less than a half hour later, I noticed the skin around my eyes felt a slight tingling and a slight tightening.</li>
            <li> No strong odors or irritation,and definately is keeping dry winter skin at bay.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this cream for a week now so it is hard to give a review.  </li>
            <li> It feels like it&#x27;s whipped and a small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> And I looked refreshed.the bags and dark circles are virtually gone</li>
            <li> only complaint is the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skincare junkie, so I had to try this for at least 2 weeks before I could generate a proper opinion.</li>
            <li> I started started using this for dark pigmentation areas.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This isn&#x27;t too heavy, the additives are minimal, and it still performing as intended to, and seeing some results on my face already with lines softening.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the worst, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it good either.</li>
            <li> and I have not experienced any breakouts (I have sensitive skin.)  </li>
            <li> It made my face feel very dry and stiff.</li>
            <li> the ingredient list is also a perk, as it does not include parabens and some other yuckies!</li>
            <li> At first I was afraid that it would feel to heavy and greasy on my face, but just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> No more dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on other creams.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days so it hard to speak to the anti-aging aspects of the cream</li>
            <li> but it has been less than 1 week.  </li>
            <li> After a couple days of use I&#x27;ve already noticed a slight tightening of lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that I will, as I have seen others reviewers telling that they already felt a slight firmer in their cheeks.</li>
            <li> I felt a slight change in my skin.</li>
            <li> and I do believe it is making a difference - less lines and smoother look.  </li>
            <li> A slight scent of cucumber.  </li>
            <li> The lines on my forehead are so less noticeable and even my crows feet are softening.</li>
            <li> Well maybe slight,</li>
            <li> So it may be slightly balancing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me break out like my previous moisturizer did.</li>
            <li> I should have stuck with my previous moisturizer as the look of my skin has declined since using this.</li>
            <li> I have used it for less than a week, but can already see improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s one less step.</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and my wrinkles are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Wrinkles are less defined and texture has improved.</li>
            <li> I think someone mentioned an odd smell, I don&#x27;t notice anything that bothers me.</li>
            <li> my skin feel tight and smoother</li>
            <li> but I did notice after waking up in the morning before my shower and reapplying the lotion my face skin feels tight and not as smooth.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get tight as it drys.</li>
            <li> you will feel as if your skin is being pulled tight.  </li>
            <li> In a few days I noticed that my skin appeared brighter, clearer, softer and wrinkles less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> absorbs quickly, not greasy or heavy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind a little bit of a mellow fragrance, but this one just smells funky and unnatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could feel my face tighten a little after I put it on.  </li>
            <li> There is little to no scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a little over a week.  </li>
            <li> And a little goes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit on the heavier side, but it hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores or caused me any acne.</li>
            <li> A little dab will do it.</li>
            <li> A very small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that I wouldn&#x27;t like the smell because I&#x27;ve had that trouble with creams before</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few days now and the jury is still out.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes I saw lines and wrinkles softening .</li>
            <li> Works well and does not leave a heavy feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li> Been using for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> so it gives you the illusion of losing your wrinkles for a few hours</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Noticeable results within few days.  </li>
            <li> While it feels firm upon application, I don&#x27;t think it does a thing.</li>
            <li> like the way it smooths on my face without feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> No smell, goes on smoothly, no stinging, burning, or drying effect.  </li>
            <li> I do like the ingredients that are used to make this cream though, a few of my favorites being Hyaluronic Acid, and Vitamin C &amp; E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy &amp; my face glows after I&#x27;m done massaging it in.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in my complexion after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll revisit it in a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few days now.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a few days.  </li>
            <li> Thank goodness for Prime because I&#x27;m sort of impatient when it comes to waiting and getting a product within 2 days of ordering</li>
            <li> I can already feel the difference in my skin just after a few applications.</li>
            <li> and I can make a few observations.  </li>
            <li> I would give it a few minutes to absorb before applying makeup because it&#x27;s a thicker cream.</li>
            <li> Too heavy to wear in the morning</li>
            <li> I found this cream to moisturizing without leaving a heavy, greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for just a few days now</li>
            <li> I have used it a few days</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily, but my skin feels moisturized, and it has anti-aging componets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it both morning and night for a few days now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t too heavy or greasy while also doing what it&#x27;s intended to do.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy like some that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t heavy and greasy.  </li>
            <li> In just a few days, I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> After just a few days of using this product it&lt;br /&gt;tightened</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, I can feel it tighten after putting it on slightly</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that there is not a strong perfume smell to it.  </li>
            <li> Not strong and over powering.  </li>
            <li> It has no strong scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is not strong.</li>
            <li> There is a very slight spicy scent that I cant quite put my finger</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Crazy Beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this face cream for the past few days. .</li>
            <li> I must admit I feel a little weird using this since i&#x27;m only 34</li>
            <li> A little goes a&lt;br /&gt;long way!</li>
            <li> You have to use very little</li>
            <li> Have few wrinkles on my face so hard to tell if any change to them.  </li>
            <li> have two small complaints: 1.</li>
            <li> A lot of creams usually will make my skin breakout, but this cream does not.  </li>
            <li> I usually cannot wear face cream during the day, but this cream I have no problem with.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to see the difference in my skin. .</li>
            <li> I have had reactions to creams in the past</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have any heavy perfume fragrance which is a pet peeve of mine!</li>
            <li> I usually have problems with break outs</li>
            <li> My eye area appears smoother... Am anxious to see how this continues to work.</li>
            <li> and I can use it several times a day without feeling that it is expensive.</li>
            <li> Have used for past 6 months and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> but I took a chance with this one because of past experience with Andre Lorent products.  </li>
            <li> I usually use this one after working out in a gym</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually allergic to everything</li>
            <li> Also it will take years off your face if you use moisturizer containing those 2 ingredients over a period of a few months!    </li>
            <li> Sometimes I have a burning, stinging reaction to skin products, not sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens over the past year and there was no miracle that took place</li>
            <li> Usually you spend a lot of money on face creams that promise results.  </li>
            <li> NOT SURE YET IF IT IS REMOVING MY WRINKLES</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face cream for the past three days.  </li>
            <li> (I blend it with a small dab of the cream).</li>
            <li> Not sure if it helps with wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I typically shy away from anti-aging products because I&#x27;m only 34!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about if anything would be noticeable and was very surprised to see a softening of the line around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing.</li>
            <li> but I think in that time period, it would be darn near impossible to see a noticeable improvement.  </li>
            <li> I am a hard sell when it comes to face creams.</li>
            <li> , they feel hard and I keep picking at them.  </li>
            <li> I added it into my nighttime skincare routine and have nothing bad to say so far.</li>
            <li> - didn&#x27;t leave any type of icky residue on my face.</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s odorless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has no sun protection, so that is a negative and why I didn&#x27;t give it five stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am in my late 30s and don&#x27;t have a ton of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I can not stand thick creams that you need to wait forever to absorbe.</li>
            <li> The texture of the Creme is thick but it isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> A thick and creamy consistency</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick cream with a mild/light fragrance</li>
            <li> OUR COUNTRY NEEDS AND ARE BASED ON SMALL BUISNESSES!  </li>
            <li> My husband is a survivor of a small business!</li>
            <li> Usually I can find one of these qualities in a cream, but this one has all three!</li>
            <li> I am very anxious to keep using it.</li>
            <li> Also like the fact that its scent is subtle.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, and it is admittedly subtle</li>
            <li> and I finally gave in because I wanted to try this so bad.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers thought it smelled bad, I think it simply lacks skin-irritating perfumes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive serums.</li>
            <li> After a few days of use you will notice a dramatic difference in your skin texture!</li>
            <li> Anti-aging, wrinkle reducing products don&#x27;t do much usually and are expensive.  </li>
            <li> I would try a different product :-(</li>
            <li> Not very impressed at all.</li>
            <li> A SMALL DONATION WITH EACH SELL!!</li>
            <li> It has a middle of the road smell, not to bad but not wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t feel as if it fully absorbs so it can feel as if there is a thin layer caked on.</li>
            <li> It is also unscented and non irritating.</li>
            <li> I just purchased my second jar of this cream, so have two months of use on which to base my review.  </li>
            <li> I shared my secret with them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a smidge uncomfortable because it&#x27;s not a sensation you are used to having, at least I am not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it hasn&#x27;t decreased any lines.</li>
            <li> The cream is lightweight and contains very serious, proven ingrediants.  </li>
            <li> it was a small business!!!</li>
            <li> It takes a few minutes to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; but is not greasy at all, something I hate in creams.</li>
            <li> I will admit I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and was skeptical about how it would work on my skin.</li>
            <li> Not really impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I think trash is too unfair.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> something tells me a lot of these reviews are fake on here, anyway.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say did not sit well upon applying.</li>
            <li> USELESS.  </li>
            <li> Boy, was I proved wrong.</li>
            <li> but it was getting just to expensive.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasantly faint</li>
            <li> No perfumes or weird ingredients.</li>
            <li> but I am writing review before it slips my feeble mind.  </li>
            <li> He tried the Andre Lorent Crazy</li>
            <li> The texture is that of a cold cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too bad, but I just prefer my cream to feel weightless.</li>
            <li> Which I received the smell is bad.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this cream and opened it as soon as it arrived, but I&#x27;m writing to say that I&#x27;m thoroughly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate when I put something on my face and can smell it, so</li>
            <li> It smells really bad!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the worst moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to work for me.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one!!!  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few days now and the jury is still out. I can say that I haven&#x27;t noticed the miraculous changes that some have claimed to have after only a few uses. I am a bit dissapointed as I was expecting more.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing anti-aging cream. I am 64 years young and have been using a variety of serums including high-end Kate Somerville. This Andre Lorent face cream has produced the most noticeable and best results I have seen yet.  I noticed after three days that the creases and lines around my eyes are dramatically softer and, visually, almost gone. The &amp;#34;mouth lines&amp;#34; and creases in my forehead are far less pronounced, softer and far less visible.  My skin tone is brighter and seems more even than ever. This cream absorbs into the tissue of the skin after rubbing for it in for 15 seconds or so-then no trace, -no greasy residue. I use this cream as my serum and then apply a moisturizer over this cream-incredible results after a full week. I just ordered another jar. I love how a very small amount of the cream spreads over a large skin surface area so no waste!. BRAVO Andre Lorent! The price for this is fantastic. Please keep this affordable and keep it in stock.  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This face cream is great! It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly so there&#x27;s no sticky or greasy residue. It&#x27;s so easy to use that even my husband started using it! I would highly recommend this face cream to anyone looking for a no-nonsense hydrating routine!   Update: I can&#x27;t express how much I love the product from Andre Lorent! This is one of several products I use of theirs and I love all of them. Their products are SLS, paraben and cruelty free which is something that is very important to me when looking for an quality skin product. Andre Lorent is helping this 41 year old continue to look like I am in my early 30s!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product, my wife really likes it!</li>
            <li> I am really loving this Anti Aging face cream!  The cream is easy to apply and has a nice smell.  It also absorbs quickly and hydrates my skin without being sticky or greasy like a lot of other creams out there.</li>
            <li> No scent. Not greasy. Very light feeling cream. Dries quickly and I like that it&#x27;s paraben  free.</li>
            <li> My wife tried it last night and loved it!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel really soft and dewy,even the next morning. Really like it.</li>
            <li> Very nice cream for the price.</li>
            <li> As with its eye cream, the texture is light and can be easily applied. It leaves my face soft after use. It absorbed so quickly and my face felt hydrated.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This is the cream I have been looking for!  I have been using it as directed for 2 weeks now and the difference is noticeable.  When I look in the mirror I see fewer wrinkles and a glow that hasn&#x27;t been there in many years.  I have tried many other products, but none that compare to this one. I actually had a colleague comment on how I looked younger.  It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that!</li>
            <li> This face cream is wonderful! It makes your skin feel very soft and silky! The texture is a little think but it rubs in to your skin nicely. After a few days of use you will notice a dramatic difference in your skin texture! I will definitely continue using this product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> A-MA-ZING! - I have very sensitive skin so I 1st applied it to my hand... within minutes my hand looked smoother. My co-worker was speechless. Once 24 hours had passed and I hadn&#x27;t had an allergic reaction, I used it on my face and neck. People are actually asking me if I&#x27;m using a new make-up... the compliments just keep coming. The fact that your product is so great and doesn&#x27;t have any perfumy smell is wonderful. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Happy with this product. I&#x27;m typically picky about lotions and creams, especially because I am sensitive to processed additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t too heavy, the additives are minimal, and it still performing as intended to, and seeing some results on my face already with lines softening.</li>
            <li> I like this cream.  I&#x27;ve been using it during the day under my makeup.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any earth shattering results but it has been less than 1 week.  I have sensitive skin and have had no problems at all with irritation.  My eyelids are especially sensitive and this cream has not caused a problem at all.  I will be interested to see how my skin looks in another few weeks.</li>
            <li> This face cream feels amazing instantly. I have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t bother me at all. The cream really doesn&#x27;t have any scent. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just added this cream to my nightly routine and I love it. It goes on very light and does NOT irritate my skin as so man others do. Left my skin feeling soft and smooth, great for your hands too! My skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream.  I have extremely sensitive skin, which is also mixed.  Now that it is getting chillier this face cream is perfect, it keeps my skin moisture all day, and that usually doesn&#x27;t happen, because I get dry patches all through the cold season. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks, I can tell the difference in my complexion. This cream doesn&#x27;t have any smell and it does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth and creamy. Makes my skin feel great. Only been using it a few days so there isn&#x27;t much improvement yet but hopefully over time.</li>
            <li> Great product, a little bit goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all. After a couple days of use I&#x27;ve already noticed a slight tightening of lines around my eyes. Another thing that I&#x27;ve noticed is that my skin tends to dry out after a few hours of wearing foundation and so far I haven&#x27;t noticed it doing that since I started using this product. I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing skin cream.  I have sensitive eyes and most creams that I apply to my face burn my eyes.  This one doesn&#x27;t.  I also like the fact that there is not a strong perfume smell to it.  I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few days and so far my skin seems a lot softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I have Sjogrens syndrome and I have very dry skin. Every face cream I have ever used has been either too heavy or too light and didn&#x27;t help my dry skin issues.  This cream is just perfect! My face feels smooth and the dry patches are gone!!! I love this face cream!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is not greasy or heavy. It goes on very smooth</li>
            <li> The cream goes on light and makes my skin feel great. I have used it for about a week and so far so good. I lovd to light scent and fact that it is non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this was quite gentle on my face. Not greasy. No overpowering fragrance. Very nice! Of course having only applied this cream to my face for 2 days I haven&#x27;t really noticed much difference in wrinkle lines or skin firming. I&#x27;m hoping that I will, as I have seen others reviewers telling that they already felt a slight firmer in their cheeks. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s this Face Cream but my face does feel smoother and softer. I will continue to use this and see if it does a great deal of what it says within the next month. If it can, you can bet it will be on my Christmas List this year if I haven&#x27;t bought it already for myself! :)</li>
            <li> Arrived in a nice box, love the size of the jar, easy to travel with. It is very lightly scented which is nice and delicate. A little goes a long way, smooth and creamy and absorbs quickly. I have very dry skin and only need one coverage versus others that I have used that would need a couple applications. Feels nice on skin all day. I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it very long to see the effects for aging but it will be a facial cream that I will use daily!</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a good face cream that doesn&#x27;t feel like I am wearing a mask. It is lightweight without feeling sticky. So far this is just what I need. It is lightweight enough that I can even wear it under makeup, but it still feels very nourishing to my skin. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see any &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; benefits, but I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I began using anti-aging products a few years back with little satisfaciton.  Creams that I’ve tried tend to be either oily or sticky.  Yuck!  Andre Lorent&#x27;s face cream is truly revolutionary!  This product arrived just in the knick of time!  I love it!  My skin feels firmer but not dry.  I wake up and my skin still feels moisturized but not oily.  A must have!</li>
            <li> I have been using this face cream for about a week and can honestly say I love it! I forgot to use it one night, but still felt the effects from the day before! I would definitely recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I liked the way the Andre Lorent face cream makes my face feel.  It feels moisturized without that greasy feeling.  Also like the fact that its scent is subtle.  Not strong and over powering.  Looks like you have a winner here.</li>
            <li> This premium face cream comes exactly as pictured.  There is a seal on the outside of the plastic container to protect the product until you are ready to use it/for evidence of tampering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is one of those where a little goes a long way.  I initially took the equivalent of a small marble when I first opened the container, and that was too much.  Given the price of the product, it&#x27;s really nice for it to go a long way before needing to replace.  And even though I had too much, it was not overly greasy or tacky; it soaked right in, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying the cream, I found my face felt silky smooth all day long; really nice quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two small complaints: 1. there is no sunscreen in this product, necessitating a second product over the top.  I would think any product trying to help protect and heal skin would include something that would protect from the aging effects of the sun.  2. For me, the scent is somewhat off-putting.  I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, and it is admittedly subtle (at first, I thought this was an unscented product), but I am very sensitive to scents - I either love or hate them - and this one I don&#x27;t like.  If you are not sensitive to scents, I wouldn&#x27;t factor the scent into your purchase of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to observe whether fine lines on my face are reduced, but I do love the way it makes my skin feel and have even used it more than once a day, as suggested, which I almost never do with other products (in an effort to cheap out and stretch it).</li>
            <li> The item isn&#x27;t what it looks like in the picture. So I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars</li>
            <li> This cream is great.  It is not greasy and makes my skin feel so soft and gives it a youthful glow.  A lot of creams usually will make my skin breakout, but this cream does not.  Ok to use both morning and evening without the feeling of being too greasy or oily.  This cream is CRAZY good!</li>
            <li> I love the results of this cream for both morning and night use. It hydrates the skin with a small amount of use and is light and refreshing. A woman in her 60&#x27;s, I see results in my aging, dry skin especially around the creases of my nose which usually has flaking. I am well pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The facial cream is great! It&#x27;s lightweight non greasy, and absorbs quickly. I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days but my skin already looks and feels smooth and soft! Thanks for making such a great product!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Having only used this for a couple of days, I have appreciated the fact that it is non-greasy and leaves my skin feeling smooth and supple.  Not having an odor is also a plus.</li>
            <li> This cream is light yet effective. It softens and smooths the skin gently without that greasy feeling. Many of the  ingredients are things that are good for the skin as well. The only minor complaint that I have is that the packaging does not do it justice. It would be easy to walk by this in the store, when it is one that should be tried.</li>
            <li> I really like this face cream.  I just started using it recently and already see a difference.  This cream goes on smooth on the skin, absorbs very quickly, and makes your skin feel very smooth.  In just the short time I have been using it my skin feels so much softer.  As a test I also applied the cream to the top of one hand and not to the other.  The hand that I applied the cream on feels much smoother and softer.  I usually cannot wear face cream during the day, but this cream I have no problem with.  There is no unwanted residue.  My husband has dry skin and none of the department store creams he has tried have worked well for him.  He tried the Andre Lorent Crazy Beautify Anti Aging Face Cream and his skin is no longer visibly dry and is smoother.</li>
            <li> The first thing I have to say I noticed about this face cream is how silky soft my face felt. I have been using this every night and have totally noticed a change in my skin . I highly recommend Crazy Beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;By Darla</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. It feels amazing as you are putting it on and really rejuvenates your skin. It absorbs quick and doesnt leave a weird film/coating on your face like some other creams.  Theres no harsh smells. It actually has a very pleasant smell. I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving it! I can&#x27;t wait to keep using it and see how the results end up!!</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m pretty impressed with Andre Lorent&#x27;s CRAZY BEAUTIFUL anti-aging face cream thus far.  I was a little hesitant at first because others mentioned it was thick and greasy.  I have combination skin but I decided to take a chance anyway. BEST decision ever!  While the cream does feel thick upon applying it quickly gets absorbed into your skin leavinging feeling smooth. I noticed fine lines around my eyes fill in and fade away.  It hasn&#x27;t left my face feeling greasy or heavy.  It&#x27;s only been a few days since I began using this product so I&#x27;ll update again in a few weeks. So far so good!</li>
            <li> The cream is light, not oily or heavy.  Soaks right into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have rosacea as well as dry skin.  I did not find the cream to be all that moisturizing and it did make my rosacea flare up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this face cream for the past few days. . .and so far.  .so good!  The feel on my face is something completely different than others I&#x27;ve tried. . .and like many. . I have tried a ton of them!!  I&#x27;m anxious to see the difference in my skin. . after a month of use!  It just seems like something different. . .than most. . and I think. . .so far. . it is all good!  Especially with the harsh Winter coming. . .</li>
            <li> Smells good and my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> After searching high and low for a product the would help with the crows feet around my eyes, I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect solution.  And I&#x27;m not just using it around my eyes; I&#x27;m using it on my entire face as part of my nightly cleansing regime.  This product left my skin looking fresh and feeling healthy.  Even just after a few days, I noticed a difference, to the point where I&#x27;m confident to walk out of the house without any makeup on.  And I love the fact that for every skin cream sold, a portion of the proceeds goes to underfunded charities across the United States.</li>
            <li> I like using this cream as a night time cream. It takes a few minutes to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; but is not greasy at all, something I hate in creams. It has done an awesome job moisturizing my very dry face. I have noticed my skin smoother, not as dry, and better coloring due to being moisturized.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!!!!! I will admit I was skeptical. Anti-aging, wrinkle reducing products don&#x27;t do much usually and are expensive.  I received it on Friday. I used it that night. I felt a slight change in my skin. After a few minutes I saw lines and wrinkles softening . Hmmm, probably my imagination! The next morning, my skin still looked better. I applied again and as the day wore on, I was simply amazed at the changes to my face. I didn&#x27;t use it Saturday night, but when I awoke, my lines were still diminished &amp; softened.&lt;br /&gt;The product is creamy &amp; very, very little is needed, therefore should last for months!  The scent, to me is neutral. It has no strong scent. It is not greasy &amp; leaves your skin smooth &amp; soft. This is a GREAT product that delivers. The results are well worth the price. Suitable for men or women. I am 53 and time &amp; gravity has started catching up to me, but Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Anti-Aging Cream has really made a difference!</li>
            <li> What a pleasant surprise to find after only a few days, age lines softened and my skin feels fantastic!  I must say I have tried many different creams and this one has definitely impressed me in a short period of time.  I have had reactions to creams in the past so I was hesitant to try it at first but must say I am very glad I tried it.  Much better than the creams purchased at the drug stores</li>
            <li> great product and I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Have only used a short while and have noticed increased hydration and smoother skin...TY!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a short while but I can feel a difference in my skin.  It feels soft and smooth.  I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It makes my face feel very moisturized but not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I love it!! You have to use very little and it dries quickly. My makeup goes on very smooth over it.</li>
            <li> I really love the stuff.  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> So far this cream is great! I like that it doesn&#x27;t smell, and it is sensitive enough for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing! I could feel it working as soon as I put it on. I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality of this product and how soft and smooth it makes my skin feel. I was a little worried that I wouldn&#x27;t like the smell because I&#x27;ve had that trouble with creams before but it&#x27;s actually very pleasant. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone at any age. I feel like it makes my skin glow and it does make me feel more beautiful.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like this cream.  I have tried MANY creams, but always seem to be on the hunt for the next best thing!  There is no fragrance, which is nice, and it makes me skin feel very soft and smooth.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using that long but I like that the cream is not greasy and blends into my face nicely. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get moisture either. So the amount that they give is great!</li>
            <li> I have been using your product for 4 days, and in that short time, I have already seen a difference in the softness of my skin, my skin looks brighter...I use it both in the morning and at night , after I remove my makeup from the day, and wash my face...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently use Cindy Crawford&#x27;s Meaningful Beauty Products, but I am going to cancel my  membership and use this cream...I just like the way my face feels when I touch it and how much better my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;your product is definitely a must have!</li>
            <li> Outstanding product. I&#x27;ve seen improvement in the lines around my mouth after only a few days and it leaves my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a couple of days now. I must say I&#x27;m very surprised. I represent another brand of prestige skin care but wanted to size up the competition and now I&#x27;m wondering where it&#x27;s been all my life! I have oily skin and was skeptical about how it would work on my skin. It actually works better than my other cream! And it works in conjunction with the rest of my skin care line which also surprised me since I have very sensitive skin too. I have been using it night and day and can feel the difference in my skin already! Please come out with a full line!    Update feb 2015. The first month I loved the cream. It felt great on my skin. But after a month I noticed no results. It worked as far as my skin being smooth and not having any breakouts or issues, but just not the results I had read about.</li>
            <li> Great Product ... I was surprised how far a little goes, which should make this last quite awhile.  Very moisturizing and does not feel greasy at all, like many of the products I&#x27;ve tried.  Very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Love this face cream.  Has made my skin soft and smooth, and cleared up small bumps on my forehead that appear when the seasons change.</li>
            <li> This product super light on my skin and made it feel like I had just had a facial. I am adding this as a must have to my skin care regiment?</li>
            <li> This face cream is unscented which was a plus for me as I am very sensitive to fragrance. It is light and non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;After only a few days wrinkles appeared softer as this cream was plumping and firming. The only drawback for me was that I prefer a heavier moisturizing cream as my skin is very dry. This is a wonderful face cream for those with sensitive skin that prefer the light non-greasy formulas.</li>
            <li> This is seriously one of the best face creams I have ever seen. I&#x27;m 27, but have always had very deep expression lines, and this cream works wonderfully for softening the appearance of them. It goes on lightweight and smells wonderful, and best of all doesn&#x27;t leave my combination skin feeling greasy. I will definitely stick with Andre Lorentz in the future!</li>
            <li> I have used it twice and I can already feel a difference.  Will be great for winter skin.</li>
            <li> I am a hard sell when it comes to face creams. I can not stand thick creams that you need to wait forever to absorbe. This is NOT the case with this product. You only need a little and it is so light that you don&#x27;t even feel it. This makes it worth the money right there. I have only added it to my skin routine recently, but I am living it. Makes my skin glow</li>
            <li> This is the best face cream I have ever used on my dry aging face! It is an excellent product with outstanding customer service. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cream! I use it in the morning and in the evening. A little goes a&lt;br /&gt;long way! In the short time I have been using it my skin texture has improved&lt;br /&gt;considerably. I also enjoy that it is fragarance free. My skin is sensitive and&lt;br /&gt;I have had no issues. I would definitely buy again, especially at this&lt;br /&gt;reasonable price point.</li>
            <li> I like the product and I do believe it is making a difference - less lines and smoother look.  It is a little heavy for me and I always wear lotions with sunscreen in them, so that is why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Great cream.  Leaves my face soft and lasts all day.  Cannot speak to the anti aging claim just yet.  But I am impressed as I have very sensitive skin and it feels wonderful!</li>
            <li> I was inpressed with this product.  It arrived on the date promised, it has mostly all natural ingrediants and it is made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product as directed.  Applying in the morning and at night prior to bed.  You only need a small amount of the product and rub it into your skin.  The first day it felt a little heavy on my skin but the second day was better.  Applys nicely and does make you skin feel smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this product outside of the testing phase.</li>
            <li> Nice cream that is not too thick or thin. It goes on very nicely and hydrates all day - even in my dry climate. Have only been using for a few days, but I will continue to use. I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars only because I just started using.</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;ve only been using this cream a few days, it seems to be a very nice moisturizer for my sensitive skin. It is free of fragrances that usually make my skin irritated. I&#x27;m enjoying trying this new product.</li>
            <li> Works well and does not leave a heavy feeling on your skin. Quickly absorbs</li>
            <li> The product is &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; like some moisturizers can be. I can wear it under makeup.</li>
            <li> So far I am loving this product.  It&#x27;s not greasy which I love.  I have oily skin so this is a plus.  Sometimes when you buy a product and it says for oily skin but in reality it&#x27;s not. I also love the texture of the cream.  It feels like it&#x27;s whipped and a small amount goes a long way.  So far I give it a two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Great product exactly as described. Been using for a few weeks now and I am seeing a decrease in fine lines. My face looks and feels younger.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Although I can&#x27;t really see any reduction of facial lines, at the age of  68 I don&#x27;t expect miracles.  As a moisturizing cream is very good.  Most creams leave you with a greasy feeling.  This cream doesn&#x27;t.  It leaves your face feeling soft.  It washes off easily and afterward my face still feels moisturized. I&#x27;d certainly recommend it as a good, clean feeling moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> Umm I&#x27;m younger so I don&#x27;t see much of a difference, but other than that the smell isn&#x27;t bad and the texture is nice! I&#x27;m going to have my mother try this product!</li>
            <li> Have not noticed any improvement</li>
            <li> Love this cream! Will buy again and again!!!</li>
            <li> I love this face cream! My face feels moisturized throughout the day. At first I thought the consistency may be too light due to being in my &amp;#34;golden years&amp;#34;, but it works great and a little bit goes a long way - great for the budget! I don&#x27;t think the ingredients can be beat considering their benefits to help keep the skin healthy and supple. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66, so this cream had its work cut out for it. Waited to post review to make a fair assessment. I&#x27;m very happy with it! Softens lines and makes the skin feel hydrated. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy or cause breakouts (I have super sensitive skin). I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A very good product, great quality.</li>
            <li> After 1 day, my skin felt softer, hydrated.  After 2 weeks improvement with crows feet and frown lines.  My skin is more plump. Definitely a new addition to my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> Great customer service...not to see a company that cares and stands behind its product.  This cream is really nice...not greasy. Absorbs into skin nicely. Great for under make up.  Wonderful smell... A slight scent of cucumber.  Very refreshing.  Best of all, I have no more dry patches.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this, which says a lot as I try many creams in search of the perfect one.  Rarely buy any one twice.  But I would buy this again.  Wish they had something for rosecea. I will be trying their eye cream next.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels soft and smooth.  Not a miracle cream--i still have wrinkles-- but it seems to plump up my face a bit more. Will update this after continued use...it&#x27;s only been about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m revising this review after using it for another 3-4 days, my face feels drier than ever, when I smile all the fine lines are more accentuated and worst of it all, the eye cream of the same brand I am using started causing this burning sensation around my eyes and the next thing I realize this morning that I have white small pimples on top of my eyelids and my eyelids are red and very sensitive. All around my face too, I have now sensitive skin and completely lost smoothness. I&#x27;m thinking, whatever the ingredient to stretch your face so it gives you the illusion of losing your wrinkles for a few hours has some side effects and thats what I&#x27;m seeing. Anybody who doesn&#x27;t have oily skin, I would not recommend using this product. I&#x27;m returning my creams first thing in the morning!</li>
            <li> Was not moisturizing at all for me. I returned it</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a change from the cream after two weeks of use. I also like my facial cream a little creamier feeling.</li>
            <li> Just started using this and I love it I feel like it is already working</li>
            <li> Very nice cream.  I break out easily and this cream is well tolerated by my skin and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Great lotion. Great consistency. Feels good on skin. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Did not seem to be doing anything different than any other facial cream.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Great product, very happy so far.</li>
            <li> To be honest! I liked but I could not see all the benefits I saw on people reviews, anyway, I am using and It still a good moisturizer, just not all that people talk , happened to me.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m a 60 plus year old guy with little experience in this area, but I take lots of vitamins and supplements. I ordered this and then found a good buy on some retinol cream. The two products together have significantly reduced lines in my face, especially the forehead area, over the past few weeks. This cream feels nice and I like the ingredients. No one product can have everything and not all works well for everyone. But I like it better than an other cream I ordered for anti-aging type issues. Also check out Jarrow Formulas JarroSil or Biosil for healthy skin, hair and nails. One of many things I take that may help reduce the effects aging.</li>
            <li> Very good product, its incredible the fast it works. Very smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.  Non-greasy, absorbs quickly into skin.  Noticeable results within few days.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> I liked how this felt going on but it did cause some minor breakouts on my face.  Too bad because it feels and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I love this anti-aging face cream!  It leaves my face feeling taut, not sticky or oily.  It does wonders for my décolleté and neck.  I purchased this face cream based on the reviews.  I have no regrets and will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this cream for a week now and i love the results. many noticed that my face has become lighter and my wrinkles not that deep anymore.the price is good too for the size. I will definitely buy another jar and recommened this.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this lotion as it says small family run business,  but now after weeks of use its really just not good. Its drying actually &amp; doesn&#x27;t moisturize.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, it definitely surprise me to see the positive results. I can see the difference on my facial expressions as soon as I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;I just turn 38, and feel great specially after putting this &amp;#34;crazy&amp;#34; cream on my face. Strange name for a creme, but over all very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin so a moisturizer that absorbs quickly and leaves no greasy film is a must. This one does it! Combine that with the lack of fragrance and you have a winner (albeit a bit pricey).</li>
            <li> Really like it.  No fragrance in it.</li>
            <li> very nice product, diminishes ages lines for a while.</li>
            <li> So, I will be in the vast minority of users posting reviews. I am a man! I use this product every morning and every evening. It goes on very easily and really makes my skin feel soft. I have not dropped 10 years yet but I think this product for the price has some really good ingredients. I will buy again. Jim</li>
            <li> It make my skin very try. Do not buy it again</li>
            <li> Saw a big difference in lines around eyes and face. Love it. Definitely buy again and would recommend.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well. I love how it makes skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Not really impressed with this product. I noticed no difference using it twice a day for quite a while. Nice texture but not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Been useing it for about a week now I use it morning and night the area around my eyes do look better.</li>
            <li> I really love this face cream! It goes on so smooth and leaves my dry skin feeling silky and smooth. The lines on my forehead are so less noticeable and even my crows feet are softening. It makes my makeup go on alot better too. This is a great product and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.  I&#x27;m 26 and decided to start using facial creams to prevent signs of aging.  I have used this every day for a month on my very fine lines around my eyes.  While it feels firm upon application, I don&#x27;t think it does a thing.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! I could feel this stuff working instantly. After only 1 week of use it has significantly diminished my age spots/freckles, and my forehead, eye, and around the mouth wrinkles have noticably softened. Works much better than Nerium and for a fraction of the cost! I will re-order when I start getting low so that I don&#x27;t run out. Thanks for making and selling such an awese and affordable product!</li>
            <li> They make my face break out.</li>
            <li> Great product! A+++ Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> AMAZING - After lots of research, I bought this along with Regal Age Control night cream and a derma roller. My wife has been them for only 3 weeks, along with a moisturizer to give the Matrixyl, water to bind with. THIS WORKS. The years are rolling back. She looks amazing and I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s just getting started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of Matrixyl, Argireline, Hyaluronic Acid and manual stimulation really does stimulate the production of collagen beneath the skin, filling the wrinkles and reversing the aging. Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive serums. These three chemicals and manual stimulation are the keys to turning that clock backwards.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the way it smelled and wasn&#x27;t appealing on my face.</li>
            <li> So far I am well pleased with this cream. I have mature aging skin and this cream keeps my face moist all day.</li>
            <li> Love it so far.  Odorless, fluffy cream that absorbs quickly.  Great for my highly sensitive skin (eczema prone).  Leaves skin with a mild firmness feeling but not tight.  A little bit goes a long way.  Great product!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t see any improvement of my skin.</li>
            <li> Definetly fights wrinkles.  Greatly decreased fine lines.  Don&#x27;t know if its as good as the new l&#x27;dara serum that&#x27;s out, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last 6 months and I am very happy with it.  My skin is sensitive and I have not seen any adverse reactions to this product.  It very creamy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Makes skin really soft, and it has softened lines in my neck and face. I have only been using this product for about a week. Very good price too. Finally a product that does what it claims to do!!</li>
            <li> I love this product  - as good as Lancome - wish it had sunscreen it in.  I put Lancome over it or makeup for sunscreen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen tons of 5-star reviews and people just love about how great this is. I have really dry skin in the winter time and it does work for me, I don&#x27;t know, it doesn&#x27;t smell good, and when I apply it it does not go on to my face very smooth and I feel like my face is burning for the first 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is the second product from Andre Lorent that I have tried and fallen in love with! I cannot function without moisturizers and serums because my skin is perpetually dry and problematic. Over the years, I have found brands and formulas that work really well with me and my troublesome skin - Andre Lorent being one of them! I love this blend because it doesn&#x27;t make me break out and most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t leave a trail of white heads on my face like other brands that I have tried in the past. Two thumbs up for this Daily Moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Very light fragrance (pleasant), spreads smoothly and evenly, soft on the skin, leaves my skin feeling moisturized and youthful; skin now seems to have a soft glow.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more of this.</li>
            <li> Really liked this cream. I use it in con junction with Retin A and am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Helps with my dry skin.  Haven&#x27;t had a problem with using under make-up.  Doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.  The smell is acceptable.  After researching ingredients that are effective for anti-aging, this contains almost everything I was looking for, except for DMAE.  I never really noticed a difference with other face creams, but this one definitely leaves my face feeling moisturized, which lasts throughout the day.  Which is remarkable, considering I live in the desert.</li>
            <li> The best anti-aging cream!  my skin has a clarity to it, it look clean, fresh and moisturized.  I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on my skin and I have been using it for only 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I am almost 44 and have been seeing the signs of aging lately, so when I saw this product I just had to give it a try and see if it helped with these fine lines! The first thing I noticed was the lack of smell! It didn&#x27;t have any heavy perfume fragrance which is a pet peeve of mine! I hate when I put something on my face and can smell it, so a lack of scent is awesome for me! I love the fact that it had so many anti-aging ingredients like Hyaluronic acid, and Vitamins C &amp; E. It also has Matrixyl and Agireline which I had read about their anit-aging benefits but never tried. That&#x27;s 5 things in 1 jar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it smooths on my face without feeling heavy or greasy. The instructions say that you&#x27;ll see more results over time, but I&#x27;m already seeing great results! It&#x27; very true where they say it&#x27;s non irritating! My under eye area gets irritated very easily by many creams and this one didn&#x27;t bother me at all...it just felt wonderful! I would definitely recommend this face cream especially if you have sensitive or easily irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;I received a jar of this cream in exchange for my honest review. Photos, experiences and opinions are all my own.</li>
            <li> Skin feels tight after putting it on, looks like there is not enough moisturizer in it.</li>
            <li> I did not see any improvements. You get what you pay for,</li>
            <li> I am not sure how effective it is but I don&#x27;t like the smell of the cream.  My husband said it smells like trash and asked me if it is expired.  I think trash is too unfair. It is somewhat mixture of unidentifiable smell.  The smell from the bottle seems ok but when I used on my face it changes.  I cannot finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the cream. Skin felt so soft since the first use..</li>
            <li> I am 23 and although I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles or expression lines I do have some and want to make sure I look young as long as possible. I know I sound shallow but let&#x27;s be real, we all hope to stay young long. I didn&#x27;t think to take a before picture because I really didn&#x27;t think that this would work but I do have a picture where you can see my wrinkles a tad if you look in the white circle closely you can see them. I have been using this face Creme for a week and saw results after one day! The texture of the Creme is thick but it isn&#x27;t greasy. The smell hits you as soon as you open it. It smells like big red on someone&#x27;s breathe sweet but spicy. I actually double took my face the morning after the first night of use. I woke up and my expression lines were visibly relaxed from the Argireline just as it claims! Throughout the week I have noticed that my wrinkle lines are becoming less visible. My skin does look younger! The reason I am giving this a 4 instead of a 5 is because for about 10 minutes after I put this on my skin is red and blotchy. I am assuming that is due to the plumping effect because it does go away but at the time it worries me. I actually think that my skin is better then it&#x27;s been in a while even though I just started using this. I loved this so much I went back and requested to try the eye creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product for review purposes but my review is 100% my own opinion!</li>
            <li> Received this yesterday. Used it twice and I am surprised at the quality! The texture is great, it blends in quickly, and leaves a &amp;#34;velvety&amp;#34; appearance on my skin. Very comparable to high priced creams.</li>
            <li> Feels amazing! Love it and will definitely be purchasing again! Great company</li>
            <li> Like the feel and texture of the face cream,  It&#x27;s thick and rich, any difference in my skin...probably not but cream feels good on my face</li>
            <li> I bought this moisturizer after spending too much time in the sun. My face never peeled, and after the first application, my face felt soft. I&#x27;m pretty sure I ordered the anti aging eye cream, but I like this product better so far.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Will order again</li>
            <li> Really good stuff, reasonable, will get again, thanks</li>
            <li> I like the cream. It has no unpleasant smell and it feels good. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I guess this means I&#x27;m old.... honestly though the face cream has been a favorite. I&#x27;ve been using it so much that I had to snap this pic of the boxes since the jar looks extremely used and not photograble due to excessive use lol. Good Stuff!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Actually eliminates wrinkles!!!</li>
            <li> Reading all the rave reviews, I thought I would give it a try. Not believing in &amp;#34;overnight&amp;#34; miracles, I used it for 30 days, twice a day after cleansing face and saw no change. Laugh lines around eyes were same, fine wrinkles on cheeks were same. I decided to use it on just one side of my face to see if there would be any noticeable difference, but after three more weeks, no change. Being fair skinned and having stayed out of the sun or using sunscreen, my face is not  leathery and people usually guess my age about 10 years younger.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me, or maybe the rave reviews are coming from 20 something&#x27;s that have the same wrinkles I thought I had at that age.</li>
            <li> I love, love, LOVE this product!! - I have never been so surprised by a face cream (and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything!)  it&#x27;s truly amazing how immediately I felt and saw a difference.  My skin feels soft and looks more radiant already, when I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2 weeks.  I am honestly feeling excited because my fine lines are starting to become less visible and I have not felt &amp;#34;excited&amp;#34; about anything to do with fine lines in years! 😊 I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> tightens and softens my skin. great under makeup as well. absolutely wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping, great product! I am very happy with this face cream. It goes on smoothly and sinks in quickly. I use it morning and night, I can already see a difference in my skin tone and texture. I would definitely recommend this lotion, and will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 5 days now.  I changed out my regular Clinque Moisture Surge for this product.  I first wanted to try the texture and allergy reaction on the back of my hand, before using it on my face - it does feel silky on the back on my hand and no reaction (I have sensitive skin).  The smell is very natural, and not strong at all. After the 5 days, I did notice my skin a lot more smooth and softer.  I have only been using a dime sized amount, and I think this cream will last me 2-3 months (I only use it at night before bed). My pores have shrunken. My husband even complimented me on how smooth my skin felt (and trust me, my guy usually don&#x27;t notice that).  I&#x27;m eager to see the full result in 30 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free, for an unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I have not been using this long, but so far I am impressed. I am not one of those women who believe there is any product that can take away the natural aging process, so my expectations are reasonable. This cream has a delicate, very light scent and has visibly helped with the wrinkles around my mouth. Those are my biggest concern. I am almost 69 years old and am trying to grow old gracefully. This cream will help me feel more attractive, without the deep ruts of those mouth wrinkles. Bravo Andre Lorent!</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  I have tried many products and this is nothing special in my opinion...something tells me a lot of these reviews are fake on here, anyway. I am going back to my St. Ives moisturizing cream I buy on here.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see see a huge change in the facial appearance, but I do notice that my face feels slightly tighter. No visible difference though so it wouldn&#x27;t be considered a miracle facial cream. Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t feel as if it fully absorbs so it can feel as if there is a thin layer caked on. This is even after the 3 minutes that it claims to take. It&#x27;s not too bad, but I just prefer my cream to feel weightless. It&#x27;s not the worst moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to work for me.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for a month and it has made an amazing improvement, brightening and smoothing my face. I liked it so much I ordered more for my family members to use.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say did not sit well upon applying. It never sank in. Irritated my face. May work wonders for others though</li>
            <li> This works fine, but what I like most was it directed me to dab on the moisturizer and not rub it in. I had always rubbed moisturizer in and it left a film.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  No smell, goes on smoothly, no stinging, burning, or drying effect.  I noticed results immediately and it&#x27;s only getting better!  Only been using for 12 days and my whole complexion looks better, face is moisturized, even skin tone, and skin is plumper.  How it does it, I&#x27;m not sure, but I will definitely buy again and hope to continue seeing great results.  Thanks to the the makers of this product; please continue with the quality ingredients and affordable price!</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels after using this product! I use morning and night and it feels perfect in terms of weight (not too heavy, not too light). I have combination, very sensitive skin and am 35. I don&#x27;t think I look younger ( my wrinkles certainly didn&#x27;t go away), but my skin definitely feels good.</li>
            <li> This worked way better than expected.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  Have only been using cream for less than 1 week and so far no breakouts which is plus for me with my very oily skin!  Does not leave my face greasy feeling. Have few wrinkles on my face so hard to tell if any change to them.  Will be able to give more thorough review in couple weeks but so far am liking cream!!</li>
            <li> This is the best cream. It is thick and creamy with a light fragrance. It makes your face feel wonderful!</li>
            <li> I gave this four stars simply because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see what type of improvement or change it may/may not make for my skin. That being said, so far I really like it! It comes in a decent size tub and its full, not partially full like many creams or cosmetics sometimes are. I love that it is basically fragrance free - it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything, which is great, because I dislike creams that I can smell on my face all day. When I first put it on it felt a bit &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; but it soaked in quickly and felt great - didn&#x27;t leave any type of icky residue on my face. It feels very moisturizing and smooth. A little bit goes a long way - I definitely grabbed too much the first time. So it seems like a great value because it should last a long time. Suggested use is twice a day, which I like because it&#x27;s low maintenance and they don&#x27;t expect you to apply six times a day to see results. I&#x27;m very optimistic. I like everything about it so far and I&#x27;m excited to see what it does for my skin. the ingredient list is also a perk, as it does not include parabens and some other yuckies! Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Bought six months ago.  Same review as for the eye cream from the same maker.  USELESS.  I don&#x27;t decide on a skin product until I&#x27;ve used consistently for at least two months.  This one does NOTHING except dry &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and not irritate.  At least it&#x27;s odorless.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:3d405c9a85a4660969c1781a2b8cc0cd]] I don&#x27;t think I am the target market for this product. I am a 30 something dad who is a wash and go kind of guy. I have always believed in aging gracefully and just taking what nature and my body threw at me. That being said I am starting to get a few crows feet, some laugh lines and its not as much fun as I thought. I was excited to give this a try. Does it reduce wrinkles? The jury is still out there. Maybe, maybe not. It is nice  (and probably a good idea) to stat using a quality facial moisturizer. I believe with daily use this could certainly slow the additional formation of wrinkles, and give me more healthy looking skin. The product is packaged well and has a high end appearance, presentation and feel. Applies smoothly and evenly. It is quickly absorbed without having a greasy lotion-y feel. There is a very slight spicy scent that I cant quite put my finger on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope the video and review helps.If you have any questions please do not hesitate to leave a comment and ask and I would be happy to respond.

            <li> My skin is so soft after using this for the first time.</li>
            <li> I like the way my skin feels after putting the creme on...I usually have problems with break outs but so far so good.  My eye area appears smoother... Am anxious to see how this continues to work.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I use it every morning under makeup and at night before I go to bed. It keeps my skin soft all day and I like that it&#x27;s not greasy. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using facial moisturizer along with the Crazy Beautiful Eye Creme and I love how soft my face feels! I sometimes find myself touching my face do to the softness.  I don&#x27;t have any drying effect as others have had.</li>
            <li> When I got the Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Anti Aging face Cream, I was skeptical about the quality of the product I was receiving. Boy, was I proved wrong. The face cream is amazing! The first day I waited until night to use it before bed. My first impression was a  good one. It goes on nicely and is non-greasy when applied. There is very little-to no scent at all which is nice. I have not broken out while using it as that was a concern since I have sensitive skin. All in all, I am very pleased with Andre Lorent Beautiful Cream. I cant wait to see the long term effects of using this cream!</li>
            <li> Feels creamy and moisturizing.  I have been using it for about two weeks.</li>
            <li> I started using this cream like month ago ,this cream really works, my skin is so much soft .</li>
            <li> Really love this cream A little goes a long way It really helps smooth out your skin And the price is awesome This is a great staple to have around for your skincare</li>
            <li> I can see a noticeable difference in the depth of my facial wrinkles after the initial use.  Will see if it continues to deliver results overtime.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best moisturizing cream ever.  Creamy, soothing, and chock full of all of the anti-aging ingredients recommended by physicians, this moisturizer slides on, melts into the skin, and is absorbed quickly, leaving your skin super soft and smooth.  I absolutely love this stuff - if stuck on a desert island, it&#x27;s the only product for my skin I&#x27;d need.</li>
            <li> I purchase this fabulous cream I think 3 months ago and now almost out because it last that long.  I absolutely love it, it has made my face and neck nice smooth and beautiful. I always get comments on my face/appearance.  I notice that the little fine lines are a lot smoother or gone my skin looks right and tight. The cream absorbs quickly not oily just smooth and you only need a dap on your finger.  I  love it can&#x27;t wait to order more!! #realtalk #mypicturesspeakforitself</li>
            <li> This is a very nice face cream and daily moisturizer, after applying my skin does feel smoother and softer. I don&#x27;t think I will notice much as far as skin improvement goes, since I have been using other products that include some of the same ingredients. I do like the ingredients that are used to make this cream though, a few of my favorites being Hyaluronic Acid, and Vitamin C &amp; E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel of this cream is very creamy and feels great on my skin. I use it on my face, neck area, and the back of my hands before I go to bed. It absorbs well but I found if I use this during the day my face would start feeling sweaty, so I use this at night only and it works out better for me that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent to me is more of a cold cream, vitamin type smell. I don&#x27;t really like the scent much, but since I wear it at night before bed  it&#x27;s not much of an issue for me, although it might be for someone that is more sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as face creams go, this one is very nice. It doesn&#x27;t take much either, just add a few dots to your skin and gently rub it in. My skin feels and looks great after I apply this, it helps keep my skin feeling moisturized. Works very well when used right after a bath or shower locking in extra moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product sample received for review purposes.</li>
            <li> Make me redness on my face</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this cream and opened it as soon as it arrived, but I&#x27;m writing to say that I&#x27;m thoroughly disappointed. It smells really bad! According to the other reviews, I thought this product was supposed to be fragrance-free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I received an off product or not, but the smell makes me want to gag. It smells sour and a little sweet in a gross way. Maybe some bacteria got into the jar or something, because I don&#x27;t think a face cream should smell like this. I don&#x27;t mind a little bit of a mellow fragrance, but this one just smells funky and unnatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping that someone from the company&#x27;s customer service department will let me exchange this for a new jar because I can&#x27;t use this product if the smell makes me want to puke from just a whiff of it.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any difference with this product.</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing a good job. But I would not be a good judge.</li>
            <li> My mother love it very much, She said: it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell if it&#x27;s going to work, but going by the ingredients it should.  What I can tell right away is that it&#x27;s creamy and not greasy.  It also doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water like so many face creams do because of the scent.  There&#x27;s no scent to this.  Well maybe slight, but it&#x27;s not irritating.</li>
            <li> To early to tell, but it goes on well and feels smooth.</li>
            <li> Great product! I bought this product because I love using Estee Lauder&#x27;s products but it was getting just to expensive. I am 26 and I started noticing some aging lines and decided to try different products than Estee Lauder&#x27;s. I was really surprised because I started noticing changes on my skin and feeling really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it has a nice soft scent and the texture is very similar to Estee Lauder products. For this price I do believe it&#x27;s an excellent product and I can use it several times a day without feeling that it is expensive. I love this product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s A LOT of reviews here by people that have been GIVEN PRODUCT FOR FREE.  No way would I try this now...</li>
            <li> Love this face cream.  Have tried many over the years and this one is far better than any of the high dollar face creams! Have used for past 6 months and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I have noticed an improvement under my eyes but still waiting to see what it does for my forehead.  I&#x27;ve only used this product for a week now but I will update my results later.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT ~LOVED IT!!</li>
            <li> This face cream is AWESOME! I love that it is FREE of all the bad things and was MADE IN THE USA! Very creamy with a nice feel. not greasy at all and leaves my skin feeling very soft an supple. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I give most face creams at least two weeks to impress me. This cream seems to make me look slightly younger after using it consistently twice a day. It is not a heavy cream so can be used by people with oily skin. I like that this has hyaluronic acid in it which helps skin retain moisture. It is also unscented and non irritating. It seemed to calm my skin quite a bit and I didn&#x27;t break out as much. I also noticed my skin was not getting super oily like it usually does. So it may be slightly balancing. The results of using this are very apparent. My skin is more toned and radiant probably due to more collagen production. If you want to look younger than your age you may want to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one free container for review purposes. This review is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the last two days and I already notice my skin looking and feeling better!</li>
            <li> I waited to review this product for a while so that I could see how well it worked. I really love it. It&#x27;s not heavy like some creams and it seems to be working because my fine lines aren&#x27;t as noticeable as they used to be and doesn&#x27;t make my makeup look wonky. I would recommend this, for sure.</li>
            <li> I love my new AL face creme. It&#x27;s not too heavy &amp; my face glows after I&#x27;m done massaging it in. I love that I only need this one product now because all the best ingredients are in one jar. Definitely will be purchasing again!!</li>
            <li> The wife loves it!! She couldn&#x27;t be happier!! Nice pleasant feel and no strong chemical smell, seems to be tightening the skin to remove the wrinkles just as advertised..Happy wife equals happy life..</li>
            <li> I am using Andre Lorent facial  cream with the eye cream they work wonders together</li>
            <li> This :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my skin hydrated,&lt;br /&gt;Is light feeling,&lt;br /&gt;Hasn&#x27;t broken me out,&lt;br /&gt;Is unscented and has no garish smells.</li>
            <li> Being in my thirties, it is very important to moisturize everyday! Andre Lorent&#x27;s Anti Aging face cream gives you a luxurious and affordable way to hydrate your skin and prevent wrinkles. My face feels so nice and soft after using these for only a week! Plus, the brand is just amazing, I love their stuff!</li>
            <li> The face cream is nice and goes on smoothly.  I could feel my face tighten a little after I put it on.  It has a nice smell to it.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this facial cream so far. It&#x27;s very creamy and goes on smoothly. I appreciate the fact that it is not greasy as I tend to breakout easily.</li>
            <li> Wonderful quality!!! My face feels so refreshed after using this cream. This is a high quality and effective product that I HIGHLY recommend! A+++++ seller!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great skin cream. It is light enough youse on oily skin and after I apply it, I can feel my skin getting a bit tighter. Time will tell how it works on my sun spots.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this anti aging face cream. In no time my skin was soft and feeling amazing. It goes on easy and absorbs well with a non-greasy feel. The price is wonderful for the product, in just a few short days I have noticed a huge difference as has my husband! Thanks!</li>
            <li> So far so good. I haven&#x27;t quite used it long enough to give a solid review but I haven&#x27;t haf any breakouts from it and I have super&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive skin</li>
            <li> A great face cream! Smells nice and goes on smoothly! I highly recommend! Check out the rest of this line.</li>
            <li> Soft, light scent not overpowering, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I haven&#x27;t been using this cream too long but so far I love it. The scent is light, the texture of the cream is light and velvety. I use this cream mostly at night after my normal cleansing routine. It goes on smooth and absorbs into skin quickly. I use it on my face, neck and chest. So far I love it.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful!  After using this for 3 days I feel it will work wonders.  After applying it to my face I didn&#x27;t even know I did. This cream leaves no residue or greasy feeling. If you are looking for an anti aging cream that doesn&#x27;t make your face feel greasy this is definitely the cream for you.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this anti-aging cream because of the price.  I have been using a cream that costs about $60 for the same size container.  I must say, I did not expect that it would be as good as the one I usually use.  However, I am happy to say it is GREAT.  I highly recommend this product.  I was surprised that after the first night I used it, I could tell a difference in the smoothness of my skin.  By day 3, I am seeing it help with fine lines.  I am really happy with this anti-aging cream, and even happier with the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this skin cream for my mom. I chose it because of the great reviews and it being Paraben, SLS, and fragrance free. I also love that it comes backed with a satisfaction guarantee. Looks like a great choice for skin care.</li>
            <li> The product met my expectations. I am happy with the purchase and the seller.&lt;br /&gt;The face cream feels good on my skin . After only using it for two days I am pleased with the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I use this daily, and love it. It goes on white but quickly absorbs into the skin. My face feels hydrated, and smooth. I even  wear this under my makeup. No odors, no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer! Light and creamy. Absorbs quickly and leaves you face feeling soft and smooth and healthy. Also love that is made by a company who believes in giving back and is made right here in the USA. I highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever made my skin feel so soft!  It absorbs quickly and feels unbelievably good.  I do not yet know about long term results,but the first application will make your skin noticeably different in texture and appearance!  Something this good surely must have sustained, long term results! The all natural composition makes this even more appealing because you know you are not putting dangerous, synthetic substances on your skin.</li>
            <li> Nice smell &amp; feels good. Only used a few times so far but I have sensitive skin &amp; no problems there.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and smooth.  I could tell a difference in my complexion after a few uses. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this creme for 2 days- so this review is on two days worth of use. That being said, I like what I have seen of this product so far. It does not have much, if any scent, which is a big plus for me. I also really like how I can feel the creme &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; up my skin as it dries. I look forward to seeing how this creme works over the long haul!</li>
            <li> Just received this product a few days ago and I am happy with the results already. It has helped smooth my skin in my thighs and buttocks.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This product came as a suprize to me. Here I thought just another cream, but it is actually amazing. I have used it a few days and there is marked improvement on the skin surface. My skin is soft and even toned. And I looked refreshed.the bags and dark circles are virtually gone and I look fantastic without make up. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I just ordered it and the shipping was Fast. Customer service has been excellent. I started using the cream the day I received it. It goes on smooth but doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy which I love.  I will need more time to figure out if it really helps erase fine lines but so far I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Goes on nicely and leaves no sticky feeling. Fine lines are reducing and my face feels great</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the Andre Lorent Face Cream.  The first thing I do when I open a jar is to smell.  I was delighted that this is truly fragrance free.  I then put just a little on the top of my hand and rub it in just as I would on my face.  This gives me an idea of the consistency of the product, how well it absorbs into my skin and whether or not it leaves an oily feeling when I have finished.  I have to say that the face cream is very creamy and it took only a small amount for good coverage. I did not have any residual oiliness left on my skin.  I am a homemaker and do not wear makeup most days.  I then applied the cream to my face and do have to say I feel like some of the fine lines that I have seem to be gone or fainter.  As an added benefit when I was finished applying to my face, I rubbed the remainder on my finger into my hands.  I can definitely tell that they are softer and not as dry.</li>
            <li> Feels very smooth on my face and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! It&#x27;s not too heavy, the scent is pleasant and the price can&#x27;t be beat! I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream!  It hydrates well and really give my skin a glow!  I can feel my skin tightening too!!  I feel like my skin looks better as the day goes on.  I would purchase again!</li>
            <li> The cream goes on smoothly and adbsorbs into the skin.  No more dry skin.  It is not greasy and i would recomend this product.</li>
            <li> This cream instantly absorbs into skin and is light enough to wear under makeup during the day.  It is also great if you are not wearing any makeup, because it does not leave a greasy residue on your face, like some heavier creams do.  Andre Lorent moisturizer has become a staple for both my morning and evening beauty routine!</li>
            <li> It made my face feel very dry and stiff.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the fact that it has no scent. That is harder to find than it should be!&lt;br /&gt;It is a thick, rich cream that leaves skin smooth. The dry winter months are&lt;br /&gt;coming and this cream seems like it would be excellent at keeping skin&lt;br /&gt;hydrated. I am also going to try it on my hands!</li>
            <li> This cream is very light and a little but goes a long way.  After applied skin feels very smooth and hydrated. Can use day or night and it is not oily at all. Have used in the morning and then applied make it without a problem.  In just a couple of days skin feels much smoother and very healthy.</li>
            <li> Love that there is no smell and makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.  Would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> the cream is so soft and luxurious.  Leave my face feeling great.  Not oily or greasy.  Noticed a difference in my skin in just three applications.  Loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to give this a few weeks before really accessing it. Product arrived quickly! Nice thick consistency.</li>
            <li> Product is perfume free, does not bother my sensitive eyes, applies easily, and quickly absorbs. I received three days ago as promised in proper packaging ; started using that day. It appears to be giving my skin moisture and softness in just three days use. I really see softer skin in the area of  my nose/eye. I plan to keep using.</li>
            <li> Very Nice product. My skin Feels great!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for several days now and my skin is soft and smooth. I like the fact that it does have any kind of scent whatsoever to it and blends in fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> This skin cream is fabulous. It melts into my skin, leaving it soft and supple. No strong odors or irritation,and definately is keeping dry winter skin at bay. It has my forty-nine year old complexion looking plumped and smoothed. I am a fan and will definately purchase again if I ever get to the bottom of the jar. A little goes a long way making it a great value. Thank you, Andre Lorent.   Richard&#x27;s wife.</li>
            <li> My experience with the Andrea Lorent Anti Aging Face Cream has been excellent. I received the cream within the promised time. The cream has a light feel on my face and works well under makeup. I have used just this cream, except face cleanser, and I am very pleased and suprised with the improvement I already see.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t normally purchase a face cream over the internet unless I knew the product first but I took a chance with this one because of past experience with Andre Lorent products.  I have rosacea so I have to be very careful and diligent with products I can use on my skin.  This product exceeded my expectations 100%.  it&#x27;s light and absorbs quickly and is not breaking my skin out.  In fact, my skin tone has actually improved in a week of using it.  I can personally recommend this product and I plan to keep using it for sure.</li>
            <li> This is a preliminary review as I have only used this once. I&#x27;ll revisit it in a few days. The cream is nice and light and goes on smoothly.  That is important to me. Whether or not it affects my skin texture or wrinkles is to be determined.&lt;br /&gt;It has no sun protection, so that is a negative and why I didn&#x27;t give it five stars.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll revisit the review in a week.</li>
            <li> The cream texture is very moistened and soft. So it is very easy to apply to my face and neck. I usually use this one after working out in a gym then it is \\&quot;must have\\&quot; item because it soothes the dry skin after sweating without any stimulation. The moistened feeling lasts very long. Nice comforting cream.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed my anti aging face cream. It is lightweight but extremely moisturizing without being greasy. This has now become my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few days now. The scent is pleasantly faint and it melts into my skin. I have noticed my normal dry skin, which is difficult in the winter season, much softer already. I am excited to continue using this product for even more awesome results!</li>
            <li> I just received this product today, first thing that I noticed that it is vertically fragrant free, and that&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;I will get back to my review on the results after a few days. So far so good.</li>
            <li> The Anre Lorent cream is truly amazing I have been using it for about a week now and I can see a definite improvement in my skin . The cream goes on smoothly, it is non greasy and it makes my skin feel real soft . What&#x27;s also great about it ,is that a little bit goes a long way, and it has a very pleasant scent, rather delicate. I usually stop using a moisturizer when I don&#x27;t feel any improvement after a week to 10 days , this one I will definitely keep buying ! It is truly the best one I have ever bought!!!</li>
            <li> thank you i have been using the cream since i got it and i love how my skin feels. will for sure be ordering more when this runs out. Thank you again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a few days.  My skin feels and looks better.  As a nice clean scent.  I am in my 40s.  I have some sunspots, fine lines.  I feel they have diminished by using this product.</li>
            <li> I am loving this face cream! I usually have trouble with face creams becoming oily on my skin as the day goes by, but this cream moisturizes the dry patches that have been flaky, leaving them silky smooth and it never feels greasy.  It has a very light feeling on my face, and it has a &amp;#34;barely there&amp;#34; fragrance.  I have 50+ year old skin and I would recommend this product highly, especially for combination skin.</li>
            <li> The cream is lightweight and contains very serious, proven ingrediants.  Somehow my skin feels firmer, more youthful.  The cream works well both night and day- under makeup and primer really well. The cream is also very light in fragrance. Overall - pleasant!</li>
            <li> I have only used it 5 times but I do notice an improvement in the fine lines, I am sure it will work on the others with extended use. I do like that it does not have an odor to it and is not thick and sticky.  My skin looks and feels soft already.</li>
            <li> I love this new face cream! As soon as the Indiana weather becomes dry, my eyebrows and face start getting flaky. Within two days of using Crazy Beautiful cream, my dry, flaky skin was gone! An awesome product I look forward to using from now on!</li>
            <li> Product feels great on the skin. No greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this face cream. Though I have skin on the oily side, it&#x27;s not too much for it. It&#x27;s been great in the morning because we have had some very cold weather lately. It absorbs right away and doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of my skin. I&#x27;m sure if you try it you&#x27;ll have great results also!</li>
            <li> Great Product! Have only been using for a day and my skin is already so soft and supple! Can&#x27;t wait to see what my face will look like in the next month! I also like the fact that this cream does not leave my face feeling oily!</li>
            <li> I really like this product! There is little to no scent. It has a light and creamy consistency. Absorbs quickly and leaves no greasy feel. Leaves my skin so soft. Plumps up my skin and keeps it well hydrated. Really works well under make up, make up just glides on. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase again. Very happy with this face cream.</li>
            <li> This cream made my face wonderfully soft immediately after putting it on.  Will buy again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I just received this product recently so far I like it very much it moisturizes my face and leaves it feeling very clean I am imagine it will take a few weeks to get the Full effects of it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used the high end products and got to say that this is right up there with them! This would be great even for people with greasy skin.  With that said, I have very dry skin and this works great too.</li>
            <li> This product is very creamy, absorbs quickly and seems to hydrate very well. I&#x27;m usually allergic to everything but I was able to use this cream with no problem. It&#x27;s still to early to tell about the anti aging aspect but I will continue using it and update</li>
            <li> Very creamy and moisturizing.  I have noticed some changes in my skin tone due to the hydration of my skin.  Would recommend to someone wanting to try something new for skincare.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to say that this face cream is wonderful!  It is not heavy or sticky and completly disappears within seconds leaving my skin feeling firm and soft.  I am also very happy with the fact that it is paraben,SLS and additive free!  What a wonderful combination.  I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> This is great! Only used it twice so far but makes my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has a nice silky feel and makes skin look great. Have only used once but interested to see longer term results.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to recieve this facial cream in the mail today and couldnt wait to try it. It has great anti aging nutrients in it so I really wanted to test it out. Thank goodness for Prime because I&#x27;m sort of impatient when it comes to waiting and getting a product within 2 days of ordering is so worth it to me. So first off the jar is a decent size and you get a fair amount of product for the money. The cream itself is very creamy and light not runny or thin. At first I was afraid that it would feel to heavy and greasy on my face, but just a little goes a long way. It goes on very smooth and absorbs quickly into your skin with no greasy residue after. I love that because I have tried lotions that simply leave your skin greasy and with a heavy residue and then feel the need to wash it off. But not the case here, it sinks right in and leaves your skin feeling very soft and subtle.  I did feel a bit of tingling sensation after applying so Im assuming thats the nutrients doing thier job. I&#x27;ve  been using it for 2 days and love how my skin feels after application and lasts soft and hydrated all day and night. I have been applying at bedtime and in the morning. So far I love everything about it and it doesnt have a heavy scent, just very light and mild which I like. I cant comment on how it works for fine lines and wrinkles because its to soon, but I do think that it will definetly make a difference. I can already feel the difference in my skin just after a few applications. I will continue to use this product because I  love how my skin looks and feels so far.</li>
            <li> This face cream is great! It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly so there&#x27;s no sticky or greasy residue. It&#x27;s so easy to use, seeing results of those fine lines.  I would highly recommend this face cream to anyone looking for a no-nonsense hydrating routine!</li>
            <li> I have only used Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Face Cream for a few days and my face is smoother and more hydrated than it was before. I can&#x27;t wait to see the long-term results after such an awesome start!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this and will buy again.  I think  my face looks firmer and feels smoother.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying using this quick-absorbing cream! It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy, and I am excited to begin seeing an improvement and  difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. It is exactly as described. I love the fact that it is paraben free and makes my skin so soft and smooth. Great product and I see myself using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this cream for a week now so it is hard to give a review.  The texture is smooth and creamy and blends into the skin easily. You can feel the tightening effect quickly. I can&#x27;t wait to see my skin after one month of use.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This product  smells really nice and the fragrance is light. It is not greasy at all. It makes my skin feel nice and smooth. I still need to use it more to compare the results of wrinkles and dark spots. The good thing about this is I have very sensitive skin and I am not allergic to it...I will do an update on the wrinkles and dark spots at a later time.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So far love it.my skin feels smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, leaves a wonderful tightness and adds visible radiance after only a few minutes of application. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product! After just one use, my face was so soft the next morning...I will continue to use this face cream!!</li>
            <li> Ok for moisturizing, but don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> I Luv my Crazy Beautiful moisturizer!  The price was for a 2oz jar which is very unusual all others are for a 1oz so it&#x27;s a great deal!  The moisturizer goes on smoothly and hydrates my skin very well!!!  I&#x27;ve been usining this product in the AM and PM and noticing this moisturizer to be working out very well.  It absorbs within 30sec to a min the longest!!  It&#x27;s cool to the skin and has a mild fragrance like fresh clean smell!! I&#x27;m highly allergic to smells but this fragrance I have had no problem with it!  My husband has allergies too and has commented that he likes the clean scent when he hugged me in the morning so it past his nose test which is a big plus!!!    My daughter commented that my face looked radiant what was I using! Just my Crazy Beautiful moisturizer you want to give it a try?  I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and have noticed fine lines demenishing.  I just love this stuff and I love shopping at Amazon!    I have to admit Dr Oz recommend to search for Vitamin C &amp; Hauluriic Acid in your Mositurizer for best results in reducing fine lines and hydrating your face!  Also it will take years off your face if you use moisturizer containing those 2 ingredients over a period of a few months!    I went to Ultra and was surprised how many products didn&#x27;t contain these 2 items.  Then searched all Amazon moisturizers.  That took a long time!! Only a few procducts that cost up $100+ for 1oz had those 2 items in their products!! I was ready to make my own when I found Andre Lorent CRAZY BEAUTIFUL and the price 2oz jar was so reasonable and to top that off it was a small business!!! Luv it. I Luv supporting small Buisness!! OUR COUNTRY NEEDS AND ARE BASED ON SMALL BUISNESSES!  My husband is a survivor of a small business! My son has started a plumbing Co going on 2nd year!  Also ANDRE LORENT CRAZY BEAUTIFUL MAKES A SMALL DONATION WITH EACH SELL!! Win win!!! I just love our Country!!!! ❤❤❤ Texas</li>
            <li> I really like this cream, great product so far, will want to order more. Great service as well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
            <li> Ive only been using this cream for a few days now and I am already in love with this cream. I can already see a noticeable difference in the fine lines on my forehead and eyes. Some other reviews say they don&#x27;t like the smell of this cream, but I have yet to smell really anything from it. This cream is certainly a keeper for me</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based purely on the reviews and at this price it is a value.  I was very pleased from the first time I used it.  My skin immediately felt tighter and firmer.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now and I can make a few observations.  1) It doesn&#x27;t make me break out like my previous moisturizer did. 2) My skin feels moisturized all day without feeling greasy. 3) There is no scent to the cream at all. 4) I believe my fine lines are truly diminishing.</li>
            <li> I bought the eye and face cream.  I have no complaints.  Skin is soft, no sensitivity issues.  I didn&#x27;t do before and after pictures, so I don&#x27;t have my own personal yardstick.  This company has great customer service, and really wants to know what you think, so give it a try!</li>
            <li> This product has made my face a lot softer and smoother.  I will continue to use this product. thank you!!</li>
            <li> I just purchased my second jar of this cream, so have two months of use on which to base my review.  I use it morning and night, and still have almost a quarter of a jar left in the first one, so one jar is lasting me almost 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product, but it is of excellent quality.  I am 50+ and spend as much time as possible outdoors, so it would not be reasonable to expect my wrinkles to disappear, but what the cream has done is give me noticeably softer, healthier-looking skin.  It moisturizes without being oily, which is important to me, and my skin still feels supple 10-12 hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with both value and quality and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Which I received the smell is bad. Is it really smells like? Could someone answer to me please.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this face cream for a couple weeks but it seems to be helping with the tiny lines around my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, at the same time this cream arrived I started taking 120mg of hyaluronic acid. So together, I think it&#x27;s successfully&lt;br /&gt;plumping up my skin so it looks fuller and healthier. Sometimes I have a burning, stinging reaction to skin products, not sure&lt;br /&gt;which ingredient causes this, but it&#x27;s not happening with this face cream. I&#x27;m pretty impressed!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how one knows when a facial product is working. I&#x27;ve tried dozens over the past year and there was no miracle that took place so how do you know? As long as it doesn&#x27;t irritate or inflame my skin I&#x27;m calling it good...</li>
            <li> Bummer... didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.. was really hoping for something great, I&#x27;m not glowing or softer or really anything... I would try a different product :-(</li>
            <li> Still using this product.  Goes on smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a little over a week.  My skin is softer and smoother. I have fine lines around my eyes and they seem to be less obvious than before.  I was quite skeptical when I ordered this cream, based on the price, but the other reviews were so positive, I decided to give it a try.  Usually you spend a lot of money on face creams that promise results.  I will recommend to my friends and I would purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> it take a bit with this cream like it did for the eye cream and you will start to notice that your skin appears to look better and better.</li>
            <li> The container that holds this moisturizer is much smaller than the photo shown. However, it doesn&#x27;t take much to completely cover your face. I have combination skin (oily in some sections dry in others) and this is ideal for my skin type. It alleviates the dryness within minutes of using without causing oiliness. My skin is also sensitive. I haven&#x27;t had issues with burning or redness from this product. I have used this before bed and before makeup application. I would give it a few minutes to absorb before applying makeup because it&#x27;s a thicker cream. The moisture it adds to my skin lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month now and so far have little results.  I have fine lines around my eyes and deeper ones on my forehead and décolletage and have not seen any change in them after using this twice daily.  After their excellent customer service, I have decided to try another jar and hope to get the same results so many others have raved about.  Perhaps it just takes longterm use to gain the better visible results, we shall see!</li>
            <li> I just got this and I love it!! my skin feel tight and smoother</li>
            <li> NOT SURE YET IF IT IS REMOVING MY WRINKLES BUT IT DOES FEEL GOOD ON MY FACE</li>
            <li> PRODUCT WAS EASY TO USE. IT PROVIDED SOFTER SKIN  WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK OF USE.</li>
            <li> Nice light, smooth texture.</li>
            <li> Not very moisturizing,but also not greasy. Still too early to know if it is a favorite of mine yet.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of buying this, as I am with many beauty products.  I have to say that I do see and feel a difference after a week. I am prone to breakouts and that has not happened either 😀. So far so good.</li>
            <li> This product comes out of the bottle feeling like a creamy moisturizer. It goes on and doesn&#x27;t feel very moisturizing at all. There is no scent. I guess you could say it absorbs into the skin, but doesn&#x27;t leave any excess moisture. I should have stuck with my previous moisturizer as the look of my skin has declined since using this. It&#x27;s not the worst, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it good either.</li>
            <li> I love this prouduct... fast shipping... I shall not grow old gracefully...lol...Thank you</li>
            <li> I can feel it working! It does decrease the crows feet.</li>
            <li> I had been using a vitamin C &amp; E serum and would follow with a moisturizer but this has everything I need in one jar. Feels great and makes me look my best. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a good cream surprisingly. It moisturizes well and leaves my skin very soft and supple. Its a thick consistency so in the fall and winter its best to use it. I haven&#x27;t seen any anti aging benefits yet because its too soon to tell but overall its doing its job as a fragrance, free of dyes and chemicals free moisturizer. No bad reactions or rashes. Good for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I tried to leave a video review to enter the amazon contest but my file was too big and I sent my video link to the customer service after being told they would make the file smaller, but I got no response since then.</li>
            <li> Very nice! It is creamy and smooth and goes on very easily. It has no smell which is a big bonus too. My face feels refreshed and moisturized after I use this. I really like it!</li>
            <li> Love the feel and texture.  The cream leaves your skin soft and radiant without excessive shine.</li>
            <li> This anti-aging cream is wonderful! I&#x27;ve only been using it for 4 days and I see and feel the difference in my skin already. I can only imagine how incredible my skin will be with continued use! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazing, I love the feeling when you apply it it&#x27;s not that sticky at all. I also noticed that my dark spot on my face is fading definitely will recommend it.</li>
            <li> I found the cream to smell great. It was easy to apply and absorbed quickly. I think it is a great facial cream.</li>
            <li> I really liked the way this cream felt on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this cream is free from parabens, sulfates and other chemical additives!  That is a number one concern of mine now when I&#x27;m searching for products I&#x27;m applying to my skin.  It feels very hydrating, absorbs quickly and has a nice light scent.  I also have sensitive skin and have had no problems with this cream.  I love it!</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I&#x27;ve only used this product for one day and one night, but it goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t too thick. And a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the smell. I see a lot of reviewers think it has a light, pleasant scent, but to my overly sensitive nose,  it smells like a combination of spoiled grapes and mint toothpaste! But the smell isn&#x27;t strong and goes away quickly. And if the product works, it&#x27;s worth a few minutes of mild discomfort.</li>
            <li> Got this too in a very good deal, fast shipping and in very nice package...thanks</li>
            <li> This is amazing cream. Love the feel of it on my face and neck. And the smell is delightful. So far i&#x27;m seeing great results. Thanks so much. Love it.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Smells great....and feels good too.. Not heavy..just right&amp;#34;  Will definitely buy again!!</li>
            <li> Delivery was of course spot on time and undamaged. The container is pleasing to look at and the cream smells good and feels good going on. No oily feeling afterwards. I am using it every night before bed and I love it so far.</li>
            <li> Feels very soothing when applied. Too soon to tell what the results will be but so far I am liking it.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and moisturized---lasts all day! Very smooth consistency, nice addition to my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Feels nice. Only been using it for a couple days, so don&#x27;t know about long-term results.  Goes on smoothly, &amp; isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> Works great. Makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this cream. I noticed the fine lines around my eyes just vanish. My face really does look healthier and younger.</li>
            <li> The texture is that of a cold cream. It absorbs quickly and is not greasy. I have only just started using it so cannot really speak about the anti aging aspect of it yet.</li>
            <li> My second jar! Love it! I have oily skin so I just use a dab each time.</li>
            <li> Super smooth and creamy!  Doesn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin!! Always a plus! Smells great too :). Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I love it!  Its actually decreasing the size of my pores..  It&#x27;s only been a week and I see results.  Thanks guys!</li>
            <li> This product has a nice smooth feeling to it without all the greasy feel and has a nice clean smell to it. No perfumes or weird ingredients. A little bit goes a LONG way so I like that this will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> While I have only used this for a few days, I really do like it. It has no parabens, which is a huge thing for me. I am sensitive to real perfumy smells but this has a very mild smell. It is quite nice actually. It has made my skin feel smooth overall. I really can&#x27;t speak to how it will be long term because I have only had it a few days but if these few days are any indication, I think I will be very pleased.</li>
            <li> I Love this crazy beautiful face cream. It makes my skin feel so amazing!</li>
            <li> Very nice cream to use day or night!</li>
            <li> I really like the way my skin feels after I use this face cream - so smooth!  It must be the vitamins C and E.  Because I have sensitive skin I was worried that it might irritate my skin but it didn&#x27;t at all.  In fact, it seemed to smooth out my skin.  I also liked the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with your perfume or other scents you&#x27;re wearing.  It&#x27; has a nice consistency and isn&#x27;t too &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s light and works easily under my foundation and other cosmetics.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good face cream that makes your face look and feel wonderful, you should try this.</li>
            <li> I noticed some improvement. Which I was very happy to see. Some lines and wrinkles did not go away completely, but  there was a difference. Thank you</li>
            <li> Product is nice and light feeling on my skin and does not leave me feeling greasy later. A little goes a long way as well so used sparingly it should last quite a while! Very lightly scented as well, almost fragrance free it is so light.</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for two days and I love it. It is very light and it feels wonderful on my face. You don&#x27;t have to use much so it looks like the jar would last a while. I usually have problems with breakouts when I use some face creams but no breakouts so far. I am looking forward to seeing my new younger skin! Thank you for the opportunity to use this product at such an awesome price!  : )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for&lt;br /&gt;Several days and immediately,with the first use received compliments on how glowy my face was, it&#x27;s not greasy but the thick cream leaves you well moisturizer all day.</li>
            <li> This has been wonderful cream sofar.  I have sensitive dry skin and living in Alaska does not help.  Whenever I try to use moisturizing ream I always seem to break out.........not with this stuff!  I have had zero issues and I love how there is no off putting smell with it.  My face does not feel greasy and no break outs!  This little jar will last a long long time as a little goes a long way!  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face cream for the past three days.  It&#x27;s lightweight on my skin and has a pleasant smell.  It may be too soon to notice any visible signs of anti-aging, but my skin is much softer and feels \\&quot;tighter\\&quot; after application.  I&#x27;m taking that as a sign that it&#x27;s working and will continue to use it twice daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this amazing cream for just over a week.&lt;br /&gt;I must say it is totally amazing !!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Feels great on my skin and isn&#x27;t greasy at all!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! It&#x27;s so thick but goes on so smoothly.  I love the light scene and keeps my skin hydrated.  It&#x27;s not greasy.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> The product lives up to its name.  I began using it and saw results almost instantly.  In a few days I noticed that my skin appeared brighter, clearer, softer and wrinkles less noticeable.  I like that they use pure natural ingredients.  Most face creams are too oily for my skin, however this product isn&#x27;t too oily yet still adds moisture to my skin.  I don&#x27;t need to wear foundation since I started using this cream.  The Andre Lorent Anti Aging Face cream exceeded my expectations and I strongly recommend this product to anyone who wants to preserve their youthfulness.</li>
            <li> Have only used a couple of days. Like that it does not have a strong odor. It is nice and silky.</li>
            <li> This is a true premium high quality active anti aging facial cream based on organic Camellia, Green Tea Extract, &amp; Sunflower Seed Oil, plus it&#x27;s  enriched with additional herbal extracts.  After using this for four days now I can honestly say that it most definitely  rejuvenated, nourished, moisturized, and smoothed my face and neck areas.  I applied this each evening and I woke up to very soft skin.  It has this very light airy feel and an awesome refreshing scent. The thing I loved the most is how soft it left my skin. It really penetrated into my skin and left my skin feeling nourished.  This facial cream most definitely has essential oils and nutrients that made my skin thrive and glow.  I am very big on not putting just anything on my skin; but this worked great and left my skin feeling awesome! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> i have only used it for a few days so i can&#x27;t say for sure about helping wrinkles yet, but the cream makes my skin feel very soft and the no overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> I really like that this cream has no scent and is not thick at all! It goes on really smooth and absorbs fast. I have sensitive skin and any time I used any facial cream my face would instantly burn and itch and unlike other products I&#x27;ve used in the past. This instantly made my skin feel hydrated and smooth. I will definitely be looking into other products made by Andre Lorent&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I finally received my much anticipated face cream from Amazon. It was lost, but finally found&lt;br /&gt;So far I am loving my face cream. I have used it for less than a week, but can already see improvement in my skin. I was a bit unsure about using a new face cream, as a lot of time, I have breakouts. Your face cream has not caused breakouts and seems to help clear up and heal the breakout that I had prior to using your cream.</li>
            <li> Super, must try this! Skin looks &amp; feels great!!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and light. Not the least bit greasy, faces feels soft and smooth , is a good value. feels like is could cost much more . would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I left a review 3 days ago, with a rating of 4 because I like the product, but was not sure if all the claims on the package would work for me. I will now increase my rating because with 6 days use, there is definitly a change in my skin. This product is great!</li>
            <li> I have been using this morning and night and especially love the results on my neck. The cream goes on smooth and does not leave my skin greasy, just a nice soft feel. No heavy scent which is a huge plus. The lines on my face and neck are not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> I like it and i hope it works for long</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing after using this product!  I don&#x27;t know exactly what&#x27;s in this little jar of magic, but it&#x27;s worth every dollar! I will definitely be purchasing more of this little gem in the future. On a side note, the customer service is excellent!  They have been wonderful in providing followup and checking to see if I&#x27;ve been happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Fabulous hydrating cream that is a wonderful complement to any skin care regime! Light and non greasy, this cream packs a moisturizing punch! Light scent. I applied after a day in the sun and wind and my skin was happy, happy, happy.</li>
            <li> Love this cream. Very light weight &amp; feels great. Absorbs quickly. I love that it has 5 active ingredients in 1 jar to fight wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Great face cream!! Only been using a few days but my skin in very soft and smooth.  It is a nice creamy face cream with no scent to me.  Does not leave my skin feeling oily or sticky.  I can&#x27;t really testify on reducing wrinkle because I do t have any just yet.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> Delivered immediately. Very pleased. Not greasy absorbs fast!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I couldn&#x27;t wait for it to arrive. It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have been using the face cream for over a week and am very happy so far.  I love the creamy, light texture.  It&#x27;s not greasy at all and I have not experienced any breakouts (I have sensitive skin.)  I am hoping for great long term results!</li>
            <li> I love a good face cream and this is one.. works great :)</li>
            <li> Love this cream. I use it in the morning and at night plus it has a moisturizer in it so it&#x27;s one less step. The cream goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.  I&#x27;ve noticed my fine lines are starting to be less noticeable and it seems to have helped with my smile lines. I&#x27;ll buy this product again and try other products from this company.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This cream is great. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, I cannot tolerate &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; scents. It goes on smoothly, spreads easily. Using it for about two weeks, I have noticed a definite improvement in fine lines. Due to illness and heredity, I have some major wrinkles, grandma-lines as my granddaughters call them. But the wrinkles do not show as much as before since my face is more moist than before.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I cannot rave about this stuff enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this face cream shortly after buying their eye cream. I used the eye cream immediately and LOVED it (and still do, and it is going to last a very long time), but I was using another face cream at the time and wanted to finish that before I opened this. Well, I made it about a month and I finally gave in because I wanted to try this so bad. It was about a week into using it when I touched my face and noticed that it literally felt like baby skin. I wondered what I had done differently and thinking back this is the only thing different in my skin care routine at the moment. This is by far the BEST face cream I have tried. It is so silky smooth. No scent. Perfect. Highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My new anti-aging face cream by Andre Lorent is so amazing that I am canceling my monthly Nerium product immediately!  Love the way it makes my face feel and the results I am getting already in just one week. :-)</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion ! I put it on at night and I like how it soaks right into my skin - there is no greasy feeling afterwards. My skin feels very soft and smooth afterwards.  Would definitely recommend this product, especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife, she says: I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about  a week now, and love the way it makes my skin feel and look. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a really strong smell like a lot of creams. It smells fresh and clean. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does for me after continued use!</li>
            <li> Having just received the product and only 2 days of use it is hard to really review!  I will say the product is very creamy and easy to apply!  I did feel a pleasant tightening of the skin that it was working.  Skin felt soft and lines seem to plump up reducing the depth of the wrinkles!  I will continue to use for continued results.</li>
            <li> I am loving this face cream. I added it into my nighttime skincare routine and have nothing bad to say so far. Very moisturizing! A thick and creamy consistency and you only need to use a very small amount for the whole face so the jar will last a while. Too heavy to wear in the morning u see my makeup but that&#x27;s bc of my oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this face cream for a few days, ... and I Love it!!  It has a very light scent to it and it goes on, smoothly and firms, without leaving your face  greasy !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a night time cream.  So far,  I&#x27;m really liking it!  It&#x27;s not too thick, and it sinks right into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Siobhan</li>
            <li> After applying this cream my face seems more hydrated and smooth.  I&#x27;m looking forward to see what it does over the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!!! I have very sensitive skin so I tried it on my hand and saw immediate results. After 24 hours, there were no signs of an allergic reaction so I tried it on my face, neck and chest... 100% sold on this product. It isn&#x27;t greasy or perfumy. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for a few days and love the softness and can feel the tightening of the skin already!</li>
            <li> Great moisture without feeling heavy or oily. So far my skin feels nice and has not had any breakouts which is not usually the case when I try a new cream. So far I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for 3 days now and i must say it is amazing. I love that its not sticky or greasy and absorbs into my skin quickly. The first night i used it made my skin so soft and the next morning my face look so refreshed! I will definitely continue to use this as well as purchase some for my sisters and mother as hoilday stocking stuffers! Great product...cant wait to try the anti cellulite cream next week!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!!!  It isn&#x27;t greasy, and soaks into the skin quite well... you can even feel it working!  The cream itself is rich and creamy, and it leaves your skin so soft in the morning.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Crazy Beautiful Anti Aging Face Cream for about one week.  I am impressed so far.  I&#x27;m 58 years old and have been feeling and seeing my face showing signs age.  My wife could even tell my face is looking better within just the one week.  I can feel the difference already and I&#x27;m look forward seeing what the next 3 weeks have in store.  I do recommend trying this product.  It is a good one.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this every morning and night and says it has helped with her dry skin areas and has made her skin softer.</li>
            <li> like this anti aging cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks. I don&#x27;t expect miracles from any product. I like this because it is easy to apply and feels like it does moisturize my face. The price is very fair as well.</li>
            <li> The creme is light and peasant with no fragrance I could detect. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now. It is lessening the age lines around my mouth, my area of concern. Dana</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s definitely not a miracle/restoring cream. It&#x27;s your basic drugstore quality moisturizer. For the price, I&#x27;d have done just as well with a product 1/3 the price. It&#x27;s a little greasy and doesn&#x27;t absorb particularly well. It&#x27;s a thick cream with a mild/light fragrance but nothing &#x27;amazing&#x27; or particularly anti-aging. The ingredients don&#x27;t have any specific anti-aging  power houses in it. My Neutrogena cream works better and is cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a couple days now and I am in love with this face cream.  It has a pleasant smell and is moisturizing as well.  I can already tell my skin is getting smoother.  I highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s account. I purchased this face cream because of the great deal bit I am so happy that I did. It&#x27;s moisturizing and just feels great. I would absolutely purchase this again and recommend to those interested to at least try it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I have several items from Andre Lorent and love them all.  This is extremely lightweight and absorbs easily.  It is not greasy and I can wear it under my makeup.  It keeps my skin soft and supple.  It has a mild, pleasant aroma.  I do not have wrinkles yet and am hoping by using this product line, I won&#x27;t get them for a long while!</li>
            <li> It arrived within days after ordering it. I was surprised how fast it was shipped and received. The product made my skin left feeling soft and smooth. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results of the product after using it for a length of time. Would defiantly purchase again !!</li>
            <li> Good product..absorbs to the skin fast..Nt sticky..but not a fan of the smell...</li>
            <li> I love, Love, LOVE this cream.  It&#x27;s so creamy going on but doesn&#x27;t leave your face greasy.</li>
            <li> Much like my review of the eye cream, I also like the face cream!  The texture is very smooth and glides onto the face,no greasy residue. I wash my face first and rinse with warm water and then put the cream on before I go to bed and it sinks right into the skin. I like that there is not an overwhelming fragrance, it is a nice light scent. My skin looks smoother and plumper and so far I am very happy with this cream. It&#x27;s very affordable while containing all the anti oxidants skin needs to stay young and radiant!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! My skin feels so silky smooth and refreshed!! Thank you so much for a wonderful cream!</li>
            <li> I like this cream a lot. I&#x27;ve been using it about a week now. It&#x27;s a little bit on the heavier side, but it hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores or caused me any acne.</li>
            <li> Great product and company.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> This face cream is perfect for my extreme combination complexion. Despite nearing 40 years old, my skin is very oily, sensitive, and dries very easily. I found this cream to moisturizing without leaving a heavy, greasy feeling. I love that it is not heavily perfumed! Some reviewers thought it smelled bad, I think it simply lacks skin-irritating perfumes. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love it..  From the first application,  my skin felt so wonderful.  I am excited to continue  with it and see the changes.</li>
            <li> I use this as a face cleaner, it leaves my face smooth and hydrated feeling. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue. It smells really great and its a nice sized jar. So I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll run out for a while.</li>
            <li> been using this product for 2 days now and my face feels smoother.</li>
            <li> I got mine 2 days ago, I already felt my face smoother and soft. I&#x27;m so happy with it. I really love it</li>
            <li> I really like this face cream. The texture is nice and creamy, and it does not leave my face feeling greasy. My skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Because it&#x27;s concentrated it doesn&#x27;t take much  I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up (only lowder), so this feels great on my skin while allowing the powder to set perfectly. I&#x27;ve not used it long enough to benefit from all of the manufacturer&#x27;s claims but I am using it as recommended and have no doubts it won&#x27;t be long before I&#x27;m back online following up. So far..so good :-)</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream based on all the great reviews, and I&#x27;m thrilled that I did!  I have tried many different high-end products (including Rodan &amp; Fields, Dr. Perricone, etc) but this will be my go-to moisturizer.  The cream is fragrance free, but has a slightly sweet smell (a good thing).  It&#x27;s lightweight but fully absorbs into the skin.  Best of all, my dry skin still feels soft and moisturized 12 hours later - not greasy in the least, but normally I&#x27;m feeling &amp;#34;parched&amp;#34; within a few hours.  Definitely adding this to my regular regime.</li>
            <li> Love this skin care cream.  Not perfume or chemical smell and not greasy.  Amazing</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week.  I suffer from rosacea.  This cream does not cause my rosacea to flare up but it is not quite as moisturizing as I was hoping.  I have not been using long enough to see any anti aging benefits.</li>
            <li> Love the creamy texture and how it feels on. I will definitely keep using!</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing.  I have used many very expensive face creams in the past and this stuff is better in many ways.  It leaves my face feeling hydrated and really does fill in some of the fine lines.  I have only been using it for 3 days and can&#x27;t wait to see the results I get after 30 days.</li>
            <li> I received the Face Creme sample on Wednesday and started using it right away that evening. I have been applying first thing in morning and before bed. I do not normally use anything on my face, be it makeup or moisturizer, but I really love the way this makes my skin feel.  The product makes my face feel hydrated and softer. Since I use my fingertips to apply the cream, when I finish with my face I rub my fingers over the backs of my hands and have noticed a difference here too. I will definitely buy another jar when this one is gone. Thank you for letting me participate in trying this Face Creme.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin. There was a slight tingle when first applied but that went away in a couple minutes. The lotion has a very creamy texture. I plan on using it to see if the tingling sensation stops.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crazy Beautiful creme for just a couple of days, but so far I love it! It feels great on my skin and isn&#x27;t greasy like a lot of other products. It absorbs nicely and the scent is very pleasant. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to really notice a change in the wrinkles, but my skin is hydrated and soft without being oily and I am looking forward to continuing to use Crazy Beautiful!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Recently received this product - so far I find that it absorbs quickly it does not leave my skin feeling greasy and it has a pleasant smell. I will definitely be purchasing this again in the future!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have only used this a couple of days so far, so I can&#x27;t speak as to results, but I love that it is natural ingredients and not a bunch of junk. Now that I am getting older, I really care what I put onto/into my body. I also love that it goes a long way and will last a long time. My previous night cream went so fast, b/c I needed a lot to cover my face. I will update my review after I have used it awhile, but for now I am so happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this 5 in 1 anti aging face cream.  I love having all these ingredients in one jar and at a reasonable price.  It only takes a short time to apply morning and night.  I have used many other creams but so far this is a favorite.  It absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  My skin feels well hydrated and plumped up and it does not irritate my skin at all.  I have just started using this and can&#x27;t wait to see the results after continued use.  So happy I gave this a try.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and winter is hell on it.  I have been fighting dry patches on my face that are so dry, they feel hard and I keep picking at them.  I received this amazing cream today and put it on the dry patches and they feel softer already!  I am very please with the improvement!  I can&#x27;t wait to reapply it tonight after showering and see the improvement in the morning!  Very very happy!      I&#x27;ve been using this cream now for 5 day and my skin is in so much better shape.  The dry patches are gone!  This really is great face cream!</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels. I don&#x27;t wear makeup and people are saying my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It has an attractive and easy to use package.  The scent is light and very pleasant.  It goes on smoothly and is absorbed very quickly leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth.  I have been using it in the morning and at bedtime and my skin is feeling soft and not dry or greasy.  I love it and will order it again and refer it to my friends</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels and looks with this face cream. I haven&#x27;t been using it long but can see the difference in the appearance of my skin. It absorbs easily, it does not smell and you only need to use a small amount. The other advantage is that you use this cream for the morning and evening.</li>
            <li> I  have been using this product for 3 days &amp; I LOVE it!!  It is a very light cream and makes my face feel very smooth... This is absolutely the only face cream I will be using!!!</li>
            <li> Started using this on Monday (today is Thursday) I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in the fine lines around my eyes.  My face feels softer &amp; my skin looks healthier.  I&#x27;ve tried several anti aging products (yes I&#x27;m fighting it ;-) ) this has shown the fastest improvements of any of them.  The fact that it is unscented is a huge bonus to me as I am very sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> This face cream goes on smooth and quickly absorbs into the skin with no oily sheen left on your face. It has helped with my winter time dry skin. The fragrance is very light and not over powering. Overall a good hydrating facial cream.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Product makes my skin feels smooth when first applying it but I did notice after waking up in the morning before my shower and reapplying the lotion my face skin feels tight and not as smooth.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great face cream! It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly so there&#x27;s no sticky or greasy residue. Makes you skin feel softer and is fragrance free. I am very picky with what I use on my face but this is a truly great product.  I use in morning and at bedtime. And thank you for donating to smaller charities in need.</li>
            <li> I love this !  I used it right away and it felt like silk on my face.  I would recomend this product to all women!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for only a few days...after the first use I noticed an even tone in my skin!  My blotchiness was pretty much gone and my face just looks smooth!  I&#x27;m loving it!  --Libby Beier</li>
            <li> Hands down one of the best products I have tried for fine line, wrinkles and glowing soft for the face. Within just a few days there was a noticeable difference in the fine lines around my eyes. It was just the right texture, not too thick to apply and did not feel oily. I have tried several other product for twice the cost that did not have the results this crème provided. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The product is wonderful. My skin feels so soft and plump. I am so glad I decided to order this product. I will recommend this to all my friends.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for one week and my co-workers wanted to know what I have been using on my face as my complexion is brighter and smoother.  I shared my secret with them.  Can&#x27;t wait to see and feel the difference a month from now.  This doesn&#x27;t have any unpleasant odor and is paba free.  I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this face cream ! It is super light weight and my skin has never felt so soft . I even use it on the back of my hands. Now that we are going into the cold winter months , my face  gets really dry and this face cream is perfect .thankyou for such an amazing product .</li>
            <li> Not very impressed at all. I read all the reviews and was so excited when it arrived. It left my face sticky and after a week of using it my face started breaking out on the check area. Very disappointed. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so it may work for you but will not order again .</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  Leaves my skin well hydrated, and I see some reduction in fine lines already.  would recommend!!</li>
            <li> Loved the feel of this anti aging face cream. Goes on smooth and gently firms skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll order it again. It&#x27;s exactly what I need for my type of skin.</li>
            <li> I love the silky feel of my skin after my skin absorbs it. I can&lt;br /&gt;already see a difference in some of my wrinkles becoming finer and look&lt;br /&gt;forward to what it will do in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this face cream.  It is very soft and smooth, glides onto your skin without making it feel greasy or sticky.  Leaves my skin feeling hydrated and soft.  I have used many different creams and I have to say this one is by far the best.  I have only used it for a couple of days and my skin already feels smoother and softer.  I have some red spots on my cheeks from dryness and most of those are already gone.  ABSOLUTELY LOVE!  Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent facial cream. I have been using for about 10 days and with the 5-In-1 repair formula they have you can really tell a difference. My face  feels fuller and has plumped out in places that I feel were sunk in from losing weight. My fine lines are almost gone and my deep lines are coming up to fill in the groove. I use this crèam in the morning before make-up and in the night before bed after washing face. It really works well with the eye crèam they have also. They have great customer service that will make sure you know when your product is shipped, ask if you received your product, and also do follow ups to make sure you know how to use, what to expect and make sure you are happy with product. I also like the fact this small business is taking portions of products sold and donating to charities that&#x27;s AWESOME.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice moisturizer - rich and creamy, but not greasy. It was absorbed very well by my skin and left it feeling soft and lovely. I&#x27;ve only had the opportunity to use it twice, so I haven&#x27;t noticed a decrease in fine lines yet, but it seems promising!</li>
            <li> This face cream feels light and non greasy.  My skin feels softer and more subtle  after only a few uses!  Smells good, too.  Natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer for the past three days and find my skin is smooth and no longer dry.  I am looking forward to seeing additional results as I continue to use this great product.</li>
            <li> Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Anti Aging Face Crème… It is great! I’ve been using it for the last 3 days and LOVE how my skin feels! I have a newborn and must say my face, cheeks especially feel almost as soft and smooth. I like that it is not heavily scented and is an actual cream (many face creams are too runny to be considered a cream). I am 34 and just begun noticing some little lines around my eyes (especially with another newborn around) and those have diminished quite a lot actually. I will be back for more!</li>
            <li> Lovely face cream. Feels very soft and non greasy. Love the way it makes my skin feel. Doesn&#x27;t get tight as it drys.</li>
            <li> Hi! So far I love it! My skin is very sensitive and a lot of moisturizers&lt;br /&gt;actually burn and sting. Not this one! It feels great going on and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;tight!&amp;#34; Have only used it for 2 days but so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Tami</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for just a few days now but already I am pleased with my purchase and here is why:&lt;br /&gt;1) it is not an oily product&lt;br /&gt;2) A little goes a long, long way - this is important to me because facial creams tend to be expensive and I never feel the value is there for what you get. This is a full 2oz which doesn&#x27;t seem like much but when you get the jar, you&#x27;ll see that it more than expected.&lt;br /&gt;3) it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated&lt;br /&gt;4) my skin has a different glow to it - this one is harder to explain but I don&#x27;t wear any makeup and for the past few days my face and neck have really looked more colorful - glowing&lt;br /&gt;5) the price is right on&lt;br /&gt;This is the type of facial cream that I have been looking for, not expensive, feels good on my skin. I have only been using this for a few days so it hard to speak to the anti-aging aspects of the cream but just because of the other ways on which I can tell that it has already made a difference, I am sold. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skincare junkie, so I had to try this for at least 2 weeks before I could generate a proper opinion. After using it for a few weeks, I&#x27;m very impressed. My skin is very supple and soft in general, but its still very dry. This really helps hydrate my skin, and makes it appear even better than before. I&#x27;m only 26, so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the most anti-aging best thing in the world, however I did already buy one for my mother to try. The one thing I really like is that I have incredibly sensitive skin, and I didn&#x27;t have any reactions to this at all!</li>
            <li> Extremely smooth and feels like nothing on your face. Love it.</li>
            <li> absorbs quickly, not greasy or heavy</li>
            <li> The first thing that got my attention is the aroma. The second ingredient is green tea extract so the cream smells amazing to me!  I have sensitive skin so for the first night I applied the cream to the back of my hand to make sure that it would not break me out. My hands felt velvet like and smooth! I&#x27;ve then tried the product on my face. Same reaction! I have only been using the product for two days and I remain optimistic that I will have a great result in a few weeks. I will update my post once I have had the opportunity to use the product for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> I could see a remarkable change, moisture levels, in my face, after only 2 uses. I am lucky and don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles, but laugh lines appeared to be lessened. No greasy feeling, just a nice feeling.I reccomend this product, to everyone. I even used a touch on the back of my hands because it felt so great on my face!</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased the Andre Lorent Face Cream. It is very creamy and goes on very smooth. I am always concerned about trying new creams due to my sensitive skin. I have used it a few days and I haven&#x27;t had a problem yet. I like that it seems really fragrant free. (I do not like when cream are strong smelling).I will continue to try it and see how my skin turns out.</li>
            <li> LOVE the way it makes my skin feel! LOVE the way it makes my skin look!</li>
            <li> I received this purchase while I was on vacation so I have only been able to use it 2 times after returning home. I like the consistency of the cream. It is light and non-sticky, easy to apply. I also was pleased with how quickly it absorbs into the skin. It doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of the skin. The fragrance is very light, if any. I hope that this cream works as great on wrinkles and firming as what I have experienced so far. I really appreciate the ingredients in this cream. No SLS or parabens.</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;ve only used this product for a short period, my face already feels smoother and firmer.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I can now buy this product on Amazon!</li>
            <li> An amazing product! My husband ordered this for me because he heard me lamenting the aging process. It leaves my skin refreshed and rejuvenated. I know I sound like a TV commercial, but I highly recommend this product. Michelle S.</li>
            <li> It is a great cream. Made my face feel firmer. Would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Love this face cream! It is not heavy or greasy. Love that it is made from natural ingredients and has no additives or fillers. Great product!</li>
            <li> Absoultley wonderful i have only been using for a couple of days but it has improved my skins appearance its very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I really like this face cream.  It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel sticky like some other products I have used.  Its light, has a nice scent.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this this because after days I feel so much better. It reduces the wrinkles in my face that makes me feel older and it makes me feel and look younger. It is a miracle item. I love the feeling and remarks I get from people since I started using this.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer, I have only been using it a week so I can&#x27;t comment on the anti aging benefits yet, but it is hydrating and it absorbs nicely.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Just got this in the mail two days ago and can tell this product is going to work!! Love the way it makes my skin feel. You have to try this one for yourself</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that there were no added fragrances or colors because my skin is very sensitive.  This cream goes on so smooth and you only need a small amount. I love the way my skin feels. I can go all day without the greasy feel of most moisturizers.  I will be using this for a long time!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing cream! I expected to wake up with oil around my T-Zone like with other products but I did not and was appreciatively surprised! It&#x27;s very light weight and not oily at all. I&#x27;ve been using this product for less than a week and my skin feels obviously softer and looks smoother. I&#x27;ll update this review in 30 days with other changes made to my skin from this product. Overall, I would recommend this product - great price too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this cream for a few days, but I find it is very moisturizing without being greasy.  I used it this morning, and my skin still fills silky at 6 pm!  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say anything about the anti aging benefits, but I do like it so far.</li>
            <li> Noticed and almost immediate difference and will be adding it to my routine.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once, but this cream is wonderful so far. It does not have a smell that is overpowering and the cream when applied does not feel greasy and soaks in immediately. Will update as to effectiveness after a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my new anti-aging face cream.  Love the texture and feel of this cream and almost instantly made my face feel more alive and glowing.  Look forward to it each morning and night.  Really a nice healthy product to pamper yourself!!</li>
            <li> This cream is thick enough to be a good night cream but not too greasy. Absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling smooth, even overnight.</li>

            <li> I recently ordered my first jar of André Lorent CRAZY BEAUTIFUL Anti-Aging Face Cream, and I&#x27;m so glad I did! I&#x27;ve tried so many different face creams, from drugstores to department stores. I&#x27;ve always found it impossible to find a face cream with the trifecta: one that&#x27;s anti-aging, but also a good moisturizer. A moisturizer that isn&#x27;t oily. Even though it&#x27;s not oily, one that moisturizes my skin well. Usually I can find one of these qualities in a cream, but this one has all three! It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily, but my skin feels moisturized, and it has anti-aging componets. I&#x27;m so glad that I purchased this cream, I&#x27;m definitely integrating it into my beauty routine! Love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use face cream because it&#x27;s hard to find a good one. This is an excellent product,it goes on smooth and does not leave a greasy feeling. The scent is not strong. This cream makes your face feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always hesitant to try new face creams as one never knows what it may do.  I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  It has an extremely creamy texture and is quickly absorbed into the skin.  You can feel the product working almost immediately - tightening and moisturizing.  A little goes a long way ladies - so use sparingly.  Looking forward to seeing long term use effects.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Not greasy.  Makes my face feel softer.  Will definitely continuing using this product.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Great cream. Would definitely recommend it to others. Very smooth and thick.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thanks for your help! If there is anything I can do for you, please let me know. We will take good care of you!</li>
            <li> Crazy beautiful face creme so far is living up to its name. I have only used for a few days and my skin already feels softer and less dry and wrinkly.  It goes on smoothly and has a nice mild scent. It does feel greasy it oily either.  I am looking forward to see the long term results.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an AWESOME anti-aging face cream than this is it!!!  I LOVE this cream.  It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve found that does not feel greasy at all and rubs in very easily. It&#x27;s not too thick and also does not have a strong scent at all.  I&#x27;ve used it both morning and night for a few days now and my skin already feels so soft and smooth!!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one!!!  This is my new face cream for sure!!</li>
            <li> I had never used this cream until this week and I can honestly say it has really got my attention. I use face cream nightly not out of vanity but out of habit from my younger years. This cream does not lay on the top of your face and you have that greasy feeling. It absorbs into your skin and to me that is a wonderful feeling. Now I can go to bed without smearing grease all over my pillow. Also, I have to use a C-Pap and my mask seals instantly. I know using a C-Pap has nothing to do with your face cream, but had to just throw that in there.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It absorbs into my skin quickly and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and hydrated. It is light, and does not leave a greasy or oily feel after application.  Also, it is 100% free from parabens!  My skin is softer, noticeably smoother, and definitely feels healthier.  It feels good to find a reasonably priced product that is made in the U.S.A. and doesn&#x27;t have harmful additives!</li>
            <li> First off....I liked it had no scent. The texture was silky. A little dab will do it. Ill use it daily to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> I just received the face cream two days ago, and can tell already that I&#x27;m going to love it. Goes on smooth and creamy,no oily feeling  and no heavy smell to it.  You can tell when you put it on and massage it in to your face and next that is very comfortable to wear. I am very anxious to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this face cream.  It is truly the consistency of a cream and is not thin like a lotion.  It absorbs completely and does not leave my skin feeling greasy.  I have only used it a few days so I haven&#x27;t seen any reversal of aging but it does leave my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and makes my skin feel silky with no greasy feeling. I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday but I make sure to put this on daily.  Anything extra I rub on the back of my hands.  In the short amount of time I have used I can see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and my mouth.  The smell is not overpowering and does not take much at all to cover the problem areas.</li>
            <li> I have received my product . although 72 hrs is hardly enough time to decide how good a skin care product is working. I am impressed so far. I love that it not greasy and absorbs beautifully into my skin. It does minimize your pores and fine lines. My makeup goes on and looks great. All in all I enjoyed the product and may purchase and  continue to use it . Thank you for making me a part of your reviews.</li>
            <li> This cream has a very light indescribable but unobtrusive fragrance which dissipates very quickly.  It goes on smooth and absorbs very quickly with absolutely no greasy feel.  It keeps my skin soft and moisturized all day and I also use it at night.  I cannot yet say if it works as well as my normal anti aging moisturizer as I&#x27;ve not used it long enough, but it seems to be about the same as my $70 cream.  The only reason I may not purchase again is because I prefer a nice fragrance, especially at night.  Many people don&#x27;t want any kind of fragrance so this is probably the perfect anti aging formula for them.</li>
            <li> I really liked the anti aging face cream. It re-hydrated the area around my eyes (not too close) which did lessen the wrinkles at the corners.  The only dislike that I had was that it plumped my cheeks a bit. Added a little roundness that I wasn&#x27;t expecting and wasn&#x27;t real fond of.  I did lend it to my mother for her to try on the lines around her lips.  Haven&#x27;t heard yet if it&#x27;s help her yet.  Will definitely use it again.  Thank you for letting me try it.</li>
            <li> This cream is perfect for daily use. With a very light scent, it is absorbed quickly, leaving no greasy residue, and gentle enough for even the very sensitive skin on my neck.</li>
            <li> So far, just ok. Feels good on your face but I have just begun using so do not know what long term results may be. Seller was very quick in responding to this review offering a refund. I would prefer to use the product awhile before I judge it further.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Really happy with this product.  I&#x27;m very picky about textures/consistencies of lotions and creams.  This isn&#x27;t too heavy or greasy while also doing what it&#x27;s intended to do.  I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> This face cream is great! It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly so there&#x27;s no sticky or greasy residue. It&#x27;s so easy to use that even my husband started using it! I would highly recommend this face cream to anyone looking for a no-nonsense hydrating routine!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days, but wanted to say that really feels good on my skin. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect because I&#x27;ve never used an anti aging face cream before. I put it on for the first time, and just forgot about it. Then less than a half hour later, I noticed the skin around my eyes felt a slight tingling and a slight tightening. A very subtle, but good feeling which I hadn&#x27;t expected. I actually look forward to putting this on now because it does feel good, and hopefully, it will help my skin over time. At first I was surprised at how small the bottle was, but I found that a little goes a long way, so there is more product there than it appears.</li>
            <li> No stickiness or greasiness and maximum hydration!  Definitely a winner in my book. :)</li>
            <li> It left my face a little oily. Other than that its a good product</li>
            <li> I love this-feels so soft and tingly!  I can feel my face tighten up, which means something&#x27;s working!!!!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days but I have already noticed that it leaves my skin feeling very soft.  It also does not make my skin feel greasy as some other face creams do.</li>
            <li> Crazy Beautiful Face Cream: I received My package yesterday! I can honesty say it&#x27;s amazing... You can feel it working as soon as you apply to your face!my face felt smooth and firm!I&#x27;m definitely including this in my beauty routine.  I&#x27;m so happy that i received this deal,I can&#x27;t wait for the next one :) 10/23/2014 Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really like the way this feels on my skin. I&#x27;m hoping to see great results!</li>
            <li> I really love this cream. I have oily skin so most anti-aging creams don&#x27;t work well for me. This one isn&#x27;t greasy feeling. I have noticed a reduction in fine lines after using it for just a short while.</li>
            <li> This is the best face cream I have used. It is so rich and creamy. The first face cream that I don&#x27;t have to apply another cream on top of it!</li>
            <li> This face cream is awesome. I love how rich and creamy it is and it is perfect for my dry skin. It was not greasy or overpowering, just the right amount of moisturizer for my face. My skin had some dry patches and this cream completely took care of the dryness. I really like the cream and the smell of it. It has a natural feel. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this cream for about a week so I&#x27;ll also update at the six week mark to see if my opinion has changed.  As of right now, I like the feel of the cream.  It isn&#x27;t too greasy or heavy.  It&#x27;s very light and soaks in great.  I have problematic skin because I&#x27;ve always had a problem with acne and now I&#x27;m worried about wrinkles.  The only problem is, wrinkle cream normally breaks me out.  This has not done that so far.  It feels light enough that it may not.  In the week that I&#x27;ve used it, I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in aging but I think in that time period, it would be darn near impossible to see a noticeable improvement.  I&#x27;ll keep using it and hopefully in the long run, I&#x27;ll be glowing and look 25 again! Ha.</li>
            <li> I am in love with all your creams!!  I swear my sensative itchy dry skin has gone away since I have started using this product. Will buy again and again!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this face cream for about a week and I already feel and see a difference!  My skin is firmer and I really think it is helping with the wrinkles around my eyes.  So far so good, I will definitely buy this again.  Linda H fro Grants Pass Oregon</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for long but is a very cream.  I like it&#x27;s texture and makes my face feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 years old and my skin felt so smooth and it felt like the moisturizer seeped into my skin. The price is great!</li>
            <li> This cream is thick enough that it only takes a little.  So far I am pleased. I will continue using it so that I can give a better review later.&lt;br /&gt;But as of now I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Just like any girl I am CONSTANTLY looking for a good face creme.  Hence my order of the Andre Lorent Anti-Aging Face Creme that boasts it rejuvenates your skin and helps fight or prevent wrinkles (since I am now in my 30&#x27;s these are things I worry about now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with anything, I have written pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s of the product so that it is easy to see why I rated this product a 5 out of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andre Lorent Anti-Aging Face Creme Pro&#x27;s and Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;-  The face creme has Vitamin C and Vitamin E contained in it.  Both are amazing vitamins that contain LOTS of healing and nourishing elements for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;-  It&#x27;s Paraben-Free, SLS, and petrochemical derivative FREE!!! This is important when the creme is being used on your face.  You don&#x27;t want anything on your skin that contains these things.&lt;br /&gt;-  Once you open up the box you receive, the jar also has an extra plastic sealant around it.  Thus further ensuring you no tampering of the product has occurred.  It also makes leaking or accidental removal of the top impossible.&lt;br /&gt;-  When you open up the lid you will notice the creme is fragrance free.  This is amazing for those with sensitive skin such as myself.&lt;br /&gt;-  After applying the face creme (remember with this stuff a LITTLE goes a LONG way) you will notice your skin feels like it has been plumped, any little problem laugh lines or small wrinkles feel like they are being removed (or stretched out by the fullness in your face).  You&#x27;ll also notice that your face feels very soft and looks good as well.&lt;br /&gt;-  After over a week of using this I have noticed my pores that are normally larger in areas have shrunk in size.  This is a BIG bonus.&lt;br /&gt;-  My face also seems to be more youthful appearing as well. My laugh lines are not as noticeable, my skin looks full and less &amp;#34;droopy&amp;#34; and so much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;-  When you apply the face creme for the first time (I applied it to my face after washingit in the evening and even put some down on my chin and neck.) you will feel as if your skin is being pulled tight.  It&#x27;s a smidge uncomfortable because it&#x27;s not a sensation you are used to having, at least I am not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, weighing the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s, you will see that this creme is definitely worth the 5 out of 5 star rating I give it.  I will be using this face creme for a long time to come!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product at a heavily discounted price/free in exchange for an unbiased, honest review, which I gave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, feel free to ask!! :-)</li>
            <li> The lotion has a light scent and is very creamy.  It was delivered timely.  I know I will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I havent had the cream very long. However it arrived faster than expected. I have used it for a couple nights and under my makeup. This cream is light and absorbs well into the skin. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few days and am really liking it.  It isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy like some that I have tried.  I am in my late 30s and don&#x27;t have a ton of wrinkles. They are just starting to appear and I want them to be as small as possible or not even there.  For the price I think this is the perfect way for me to keep my face looking young as possible as long as I can.</li>
            <li> Love this!!  Feels so smooth.  Love the feeling on my face.  Feels so clean and refreshing.  Will refinery buy this,again.</li>
            <li> I only had this cream for a few day and already I&#x27;m seeing a difference.  I was a Lil reluctant because I have very sensitive skin. This cream made my face feel very smooth . I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product long, but I love it so far!  I have dry skin and this cream works great and does not leave my skin feeling greasy like some creams do.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term effects :)</li>
            <li> makes your skin feel wonderful. You can actually feel your face tightening as it  was absorbing.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way which I love about this product.  Also makes my face feel supple and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  I put it on as before I put on my make up.  Too soon to tell if it has softened up my wrinkles, but will give an update after the jar is empty.  So far, very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This cream is light and leaves skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Thank you. The CRAZY BEAUTIFUL Anti Aging Face Creme is wonderful. It goes on smooth, and is non-greasy. I love that it is for morning and evening use. One product does it all. My husband does not like face creams that have perfume in them, and this has no odor at all. This is a great product. A++</li>
            <li> Great product.  I love the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> This face cream has a nice smooth consistency that absorbs into the skin easily and quickly without a greasy feel.  My skin feels softer and my wrinkles are less noticeable.  I love that it is made in the USA and uses high quality ingredients.  I would highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> love it! Would order again! Love that it dont make my face feelin greasy like the other moisturiser I was using..</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I love this face cream. For 20 years, I have used oil of olay. I am sensitive to a lot of fragrance and was nervous to try something new. This cream tightens and firms your skin. It is light when it is applied but is extremely moisturizing. The best part...at the end of the day, my skin was not oily like it was with my old face cream. I am sold! Thank you!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This cream is silky smooth. It goes on really easy and blends into the skin nicely. I have only used it for two days and I look forward to seeing results soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week.  Already my skin feels softer and tighter.</li>
            <li> Love the cream. feels so fresh and my skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li> Wow! This product is amazing. My skin is so much softer, and the lines and wrinkles are fading in just a few days of use. I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have only used for one day but I am writing review before it slips my feeble mind.  I love it!  Felt really good last night  before bed and now this morning I love how it feels on my face and neck.  Time will tell if it helps these old wrinkles !  I will update when I think I can see results</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this face cream. Noticeable diffrence after just one use. Leaves skin soft and smooth. Fantastic value. A very small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this cream! I got it in the mail last night and used it last night and this morning and I&#x27;m so happy with it! It goes on so smooth and leaves your skin so soft and silky. I don&#x27;t like heavy creams that leave your face feeling so sludgy and this one definitely doesn&#x27;t!! I would buy this again and again!</li>
            <li> Very rich and creamy. Feels good on my face and I am awaiting the positive results of this cream.</li>
            <li> Just received this face cream and am already in love!  It&#x27;s light, non greasy, and very hydrating.  My skin still feels smooth and moisturized without being greasy.  I cannot attest to the &amp;#34;anti aging&amp;#34; claim yet as I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference, but I can see how it could give those results after more use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40-something and this is the first face cream I have ever used. It&#x27;s about time I start facing the fact that I need anti-aging help! I just used the cream for the first time tonight and so far really like it. It has a very mild fragrance and goes on very smooth without being greasy. It absorbs into the skin quickly and gives you a nice glow. I excited to see the effects after using this on a regular basis!</li>
            <li> I have only used this for two days but my skin already feels better.  It moisturizes very well without being greasy at all.  I also like the light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few days but so far I do like it very much. It feels good when I put it on and I use it on my face, neck and chest. It seems to be a lot in the jar so should last me quite a long time. Time will tell if I look any younger but I do think it will help. I will try and add to this after I use it for awhile!</li>
            <li> This is a nice cream but heavier than I am used to. My skin definitely feels nice once it soaks all the way in but I don&#x27;t care for how it feels initially.</li>
            <li> Seems to be decent. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice a difference. Doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!! I have been using it for about two weeks and I can see a remarkable difference in the hydration of my skin - but even more impressive is that my friends and family do, too!!</li>
            <li> Not greasy left my face very smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this face cream.  Its like a drink for my very thirsty skin.  Very hydrating and is making my fine lines and wrinkles much less noticeable.  I love how it absorbs quickly and it isn&#x27;t heavy and greasy.  My skin feels so much softer and smoother.  I will definitely continue buying this CRAZY BEAUTIFUL Anti Aging Face Cream!</li>
            <li> Love the smooth creamy texture. This cream makes your face feel amazing.</li>
            <li> A must buy!!!!! Dont waste your money on other creams. Im pretty sure this is going to be your holy grail!</li>
            <li> I am truly amazed by the effectiveness of this Andre Lorent  face cream. I had to wait to try it because of an allergic reaction to a much better known brand. I even had open sores on my face. Now that  I&#x27;ve used this cream/moisturizer  for a week,  I have seen daily improvement. It is easily absorbed, never greasy. Makeup goes on easily (I blend it with a small dab of the cream). As one who has had very sensitive skin all her life, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:75a878d7ce6a0a07bfc5cf0a62d3b8d7]]I apply this twice a day to my skin, once in the morning before applying my makeup, and again after I wash my makeup off/after my shower...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly I want to add that my skin is very sensitive, and at times can be overly oily. This doesn&#x27;t make my skin (more) oily, instead it really does balance my skin out. Second I want to point out this is 100% free from parabens, sodium lauryl sulfate, and petro-chemical derivatives; so I felt confident that it wouldn&#x27;t irritates my skin; After using this myself, I&#x27;ve had no issues with any sensitivity to my skin, and have seen results in keeps and bounds in only a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is very rich and creamy and absorbes in the skin quickly. Andr&amp;egrave; Lorent has outdone themselves with this face cream, with ingredients like vitamins C+E, hyaluronic acid, argiraline and matrixyl this one bottle will help combat the signs of aging, and who doesn&#x27;t want to look and feel younger.</li>
            <li> I do like the face cream. I was particularly interested in the product because it contains argirelene which can help with under eye puffiness.  It does help some but not as much as I&#x27;d hoped.  I will continue to use it in order to find out if it&#x27;s just what I&#x27;m looking for or if I need to look further. overall it is a very nice face cream</li>
            <li> Excellent  facial cream</li>
            <li> Love it!  Will order more...</li>
            <li> I am a 41 year old lady and from time to time I love to treat myself with different face creams, to see if I can find something better than what I am using.  In all honestly, I was really looking forward to wonderful results - but after using the Andre Lorent Face Cream for 3 weeks (as a test), this face cream did not perform as promised, unfortunatelly my face was actually looking older and drier than before using this product.  Consequently I decided to stop using this product, and right away went back to my previous beauty routine, which is Merle Norman Anti-Aging Complex Night Cream and La Roche-Posay Redermic R, my face looks so much better now and the wrinkles and dryness have been minimized.</li>
            <li> I have been using the face crean with the eye wrinkle and so far feels very good , no irritation what so ever&lt;br /&gt;very good formula …. looking forward to see the results I will update my results.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. From the first day I&#x27;ve used it my skin has felt baby soft, my adult acne has cleared by day 5 and my skin has brightened up a lot including dark spots. I will be buying this product again special with it being a great price anyone can afford.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin which as I age wrinkles. This product is so smooth and silky on my face.  It is very long lasting and seems to continue to moisturize all day.  It is very soothing with no unpleasant odor.  I would buy it again.  It&#x27;s nice not to have to reapply during the day.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is excellent and Emily is there to help you with any questions or recommendations.  She makes you feel like you really are a friend.  If I have questions she gets right back to me.  Very prompt.  I like the fact that a part of your purchase is donated to charitable organizations.</li>
            <li> This was a gift ( I&#x27;m a man, I dont use creams :) ) and the person who received this is actually very happy. This formula worked out and that&#x27;s all that matters. Excellent feedback either with the seller. I&#x27;ll definitely shop again</li>
            <li> This face cream is AMAZING!! In just a few days, I noticed a difference. The first thing I noticed (with no change in sleep) is that I looked less tired, much fresher. My 45+ year old skin feels fantastic. You will not be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Very nice, but my wrinkles are too far gone to be erased.  I use it every night anyway.  Not greasy and eaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Face creams are one of the most necessary things to have because your face skin is very delicate and needs extra nourishment. Whether you use them as an extra moisturizer, under your makeup, as a sunscreen etc I&#x27;m pretty sure everybody owns a face cream. There are a lot of different face creams with different ingredients out there so you have to do a thorough research to find what works the best for you. The Crazy beautiful face cream by Andre Lorent is one of the face creams that has combined the best ingredients to make sure your skin is well nourished and at the same time reduces fine lines and wrinkles and also plumps it up and gives it a fresh glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got 5 amazing ingredients all combined in one jar: Matrixyl, Argireline, Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamins C &amp; E. Let me give you an overview of each one of them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matrixul -  It is a palmitoyl-pentapeptide 3 and this is a peptide that specifically stimulates collagen synthesis and skin repair. This means it qualifies as a long-term aging system;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argireline - is a synthetic anti-wrinkle cosmetics ingredient. It  is used in attempts to decrease the visible effects of aging by reducing the deep wrinkles and lines that occur around the forehead and eyes;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid - It is actually a substance that is naturally present in the human body. You can apply hyaluronic acid to the skin for healing wounds, burns, skin ulcers, and as a moisturizer. It is  used to treat facial wrinkles and folds, and lip augmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C - Produces collagen, a protein that gives your skin its elasticity. Vitamin C can help to counteract wrinkle formation by increasing collagen production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E - is a great moisturizer and over time fades acne scars and keeps your skin firm and youthful looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a couple of days and my skin feels a lot softer and smoother. I apply it first thing in the morning after washing my face and before going to bed. In overall it gives a nice fresh glow and has made the fine lines less visible. The cream itself is pretty thick and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or greasy after applying, it just feels soft and deeply moisturized. It doesn&#x27;t really have any scent to it which is great. I would definitely recommend it because instead of buying different face creams you have all the best ingredients combined into this cream and it works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free copy of product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.g to bed. In overall it gives a nice fresh glow and has made the fine lines less visible.

            <li> Good product, but I have a very dry skin and it doesnt work for me.</li>
            <li> but... This stuff feels good!</li>
            <li> Amazing. Very very impressive! This is the first time purchase. Will continue purchasing this wonderful product and try other products too. Can not wait 😃. The best skin care product I ever use!</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say anything but good things about this face cream...I&#x27;ve got some sun damage (I live in Texas), I smoke(trying to quit), and I&#x27;m menopausal (dry skin). I&#x27;ve tried creams that you can buy in drug stores and department stores. I&#x27;ve tried creams for sensitive skin, moisturizing, combination skin....you name it, I&#x27;ve probably tried it - UGH none of them worked! They made my face break out, or were too greasy to wear under make-up, some of them even burned!! Not Crazy Beautiful!!! I LOVE IT!! I use it twice a day and it&#x27;s great! I work 8 hour shifts and wear Crazy Beautiful under my make-up and it lasts, it doesn&#x27;t make my make-up melt off. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and will be buying more and will be buying some for my 74 year old mom. It does have a VERY light scent, it won&#x27;t burn, or dry you out but it also won&#x27;t make your face greasy. Crazy Beautiful is awesome!! I&#x27;m also going to be buying the eye cream.</li>
            <li> Lite weight day cream. Use in summer and fall for transitions before winter dryness sets in.</li>
            <li> So results right away</li>
            <li> Finally something that works!  Love this product.  I could feel firming of my skin after the first application and the lines around my neck and upper chest area are a lot less noticeable in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for a month and I don&#x27;t see much difference on my face.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I think it even left me with more wrinkles around my eyes!</li>
            <li> I have only used a few days. Will know more in a month. Feels good on the skin!</li>
            <li> The best!!! I recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a few days, but so far my skin feels so much softer.  The wrinkles around my mouth (laugh lines) seem less apparent. I will give more feedback in one month.</li>
            <li> This cream doesn&#x27;t feel like cream at all. It doesn&#x27;t rub in easily and does no provide any moisture. Not sure if it helps with wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have only been using for a few days but I can see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Lovely cream, fresh scent does what it says.</li>
            <li> I have often had Botox treatments to help my skin keep a younger look.  I find that this cream is just as good and a lot less painful and costly than the other option.  How about a great cream for my whole face!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  My face looks younger and feels soft.  I will definitely buy this forever!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t notice much of a difference since I have been using the product. It does leave my skin soft and no break outs.</li>
            <li> I loved the cream it felt really good going on my skin. Found my new moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> Good quality, fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is a great face cream. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy. I just started using it but I love how soft it makes my skin feel and I love the fact that it uses natural ingredients. The only thing I wish it had is SPF. Other than that I love it!</li>
            <li> I really like the way this cream feels on my face. Many other creams cause me to break out into a rash because my face is so sensitive, but this one leaves my skin feeling smooth. I just started using this product but can tell that my skin is going to respond well to it. :) So glad I purchased it!</li>
            <li> I love the way this product feels as soon as you touch it.  It is very smooth and silky to the touch and feels wonderful when putting it on my face.  My skin feels hydrated all day long. I also love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume or chemicals.  Excellent job!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great cream! I noticed it almost immediately after putting it on. My face seems smoother with a nice glow. A little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> What a great moisturizer!  My face tends to be dry and this cream left my face feeling soft and supple after the first use.  The face cream was&lt;br /&gt;gentle on my skin and had a very light scent to it.  My face had a noticeable radiance and glow after I used the face cream.  I didn&#x27;t need to&lt;br /&gt;reapply the cream to my face through out the day.  A little bit went a long way and I will definitely purchase this face cream in the future.  I can&#x27;t rave enough to my friends and family about this product.  I typically shy away from anti-aging products because I&#x27;m only 34! However, this cream I believe is good for young and old. I&#x27;m glad I got to try it.</li>
            <li> Love this product, does a great job moisturizing. Within three days I could notice improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing cream in a tiny jar! Makes my skin feel so soft.I have actually using this on my neck and chest.Non-comodogenic,non greasy,soaks in right away.They need to offer this in a much bigger jar!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and creamy.  Leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft.  With continued use, I am looking forward to fewer wrinkles!</li>
            <li> Love it.  This cream is light and non greasy it absorbs quickly. Love the light scent. I have very sensitive skin and it did not cause any breakouts ( that is a real plus with me ). I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say how it works on wrinkles but will update later. Great moisturizer so far I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it since my skin is so sensitive to many products, but I LOVE this product!  I have not had any breakouts and my skin is so soft and my fine lines are disappearing!!  It is very light so I can wear it under my makeup during the day and use it again at night after I wash my face.  The other nice thing is that it will last a long time since  you need very little.  I am now a fan of Andre Lorent products!!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic face cream. It is very light and seeps into your skin quite quickly. It is light enough to use as a day cream, yet feels nourishing as a night cream too. After just a couple of days using this face cream, I can already notice some fine lines disappearing on my forehead and around my eyes. I highly recommend this face cream!</li>
            <li> I just received your product and started to use it immediately. Last two days I noticed it has left my face very soft. I like that it is free of parabens. I have sensitive skin and it seems to be working well for my skin type.</li>
            <li> Love it ! Very light but yet creamy.I combined it with my foundation and it went on very smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several days and already my face feels smooth and softer. It goes on easy, dries quickly, and does not leave a sticky or greasy residue. This is a great product and I cant wait to continue using it more in the future.</li>
            <li> I really love this product! I can immediately feel it absorb into my skin and my skin so soft. I have oily skin, but this doesn&#x27;t make my skin extra greasy or anything. It just feels smooth and supple.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It goes on so smooth and is great to use prior to applying foundation. I also apply before Bed and my skin just  soaks it in.</li>
            <li> I love  the face cream. It makes my face so smooth and soft. Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product a few days but I can already see a difference in my skin. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice light cream that leaves my skin feeling softer, younger and more hydrated from the first couple times that I used this product. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue like other creams I have used in the past and also has a light pleasant smell to it. I also like that you only need to use a little bit of this cream.. I will definitely be buying this product again!</li>
            <li> I received your product about 2 days ago.  I have been using it since..... every morning and night. I find it to be a nice creamy consistancy and that a little goes a long way. It keeps my face hydrated all day.  All in all a good product.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this cream for a few days, but I love it.  I wear it under my make up during the day and I also apply at night before bedtime. Unlike other anti-aging creams I&#x27;ve tried, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin with a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling, and it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;ball-up&amp;#34; like some creams do when I&#x27;m applying my makeup foundation. It is fragrance free and great for my sensitive skin. I certainly recommend this product, based on my experience.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve used this cream day and night... I really like the whipped consistency and yet it soaks in quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. I would recommend it, especially for those who like a one cream does it all! The price is great!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Excellent anti aging facial Creme. It&#x27;s not oily, yet skin is soft and hydrated. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have just had the skin cream for about a week so that is only reason for 3 stars. It has a middle of the road smell, not to bad but not wonderful.  It smells like your normal skin cream. It does have a rich texture and you can feel the tightening effect instantly.  I am very curious to see what the long term holds for this skin cream. It seems promising!</li>
            <li> I have eczema and was hesitant to try this at first, but after all the glowing reviews, decided to give it a try. My skin is so incredibly soft. I love it. No redness, no patches of dry skin. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  This arrived in record time and I started using it immediately.  There is no cloying odor and it is very light in texture.  It feels very silky as you smooth it on your face and absorbs into your skin almost instantly.  There is no greasy feel like many creams have.  A huge plus for me is the omission of harmful ingredients and it is hard to find a quality product attached to a reasonable price that actually makes your face feel smooth as well as give it a supple appearance.  So yourself a favor and try this anti-aging cream.</li>
            <li> This face cream has a very good consistency and a nice, clean scent.  I have very dry skin and this face cream absorbed very well and did not feel greasy like other creams I have used.  My face feels very smooth after applying the cream.</li>
            <li> As a guy, I think it&#x27;s a nice cream. I must admit I feel a little weird using this since i&#x27;m only 34 but I have those wrinkles under my eye and crows feet.  I&#x27;ve used it for about a month on and off (not as consistently as I&#x27;d like) and I don&#x27;t seem to see any real progress in removing my wrinkles but it&#x27;s a nice face cream.  I like to use it after a shower or when I wash my face.  I can&#x27;t complain about it because it&#x27;s just a nice simple cream.  Overall, great cream.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth, don&#x27;t need a lot, make up seems to go on easier too</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping after 8 days of use. Wrinkles are less defined and texture has improved. Love the way this cream feels on my face!</li>
            <li> Great product. Thank-you for making it fragrance free.  It&#x27;s so good that a very small amount goes a long way.  Great price.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I got this for my Mother for Christmas, she LOVED it! So glad I purchased this quality product from a quality company. Top notch customer service too!!!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I started started using this for dark pigmentation areas.  I have seen a huge difference in the dark patches.  I like the fact it can be used both day and night as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, I can feel it tighten after putting it on slightly but it hasn&#x27;t decreased any lines. I cant see a difference really, I was hoping I discovered something Great.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it works better than I thought, makes my skin feel soft and smooth, absorbs nicely and no greasy feeling. It is a perfect consistency, creamy and a little goes a long way. I am 57, have been using it about a week and already feel a difference in my skin.  I have tried so many face creams but I do believe I will stay with this one. I think someone mentioned an odd smell, I don&#x27;t notice anything that bothers me.</li>
            <li> I love the fluffy feel of the product.  It applies with ease and feels light but moisturizes nicely .  My skin feels softer. I have been using it as a night cream.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd order from this company.I love this cream and really works wonder on your face.It has all the ingredients you need for anti aging.</li>
            <li> After purchasing this product with the eye cream I fine that they work very well for a wrinkle softening cream. I was very skeptical about if anything would be noticeable and was very surprised to see a softening of the line around my eyes. Another nice benefit was it didn&#x27;t react to my rosacea and actually calmed down the reddening on my face.  None of these product remove all the lines but soften them. For the $20 it is well worth a try. So many very expensive creams do nothing at all for wrinkles but are great moisturizers or charge a ridiculous amount of money to do the same thing. Over all I will enjoy the effect of the creams and plan to continue using the.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I absolutely love this cream. After just a few days of using this product it&lt;br /&gt;tightened my skin and put a really nice glow on my skin. This product does&lt;br /&gt;exactly what it advertises. I&#x27;ll continue buying this cream and will tell all of&lt;br /&gt;my friends about too.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your help! If there is anything I can do for you, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;We will take good care of you!</li>
            <li> I love this. Smooths my skin.  My skin is very soft.</li>
