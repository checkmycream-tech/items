            <li>Product shipped quickly and was exactly what I ordered A++ seller</li>
            <li>right?).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a broke college student so as much as I like this product, I&#x27;m debating whether it&#x27;s amazing enough to continue buying it at that price.</li>

            <li>I love this thermal protector, it makes my hair feel great, and only requires a small amount.</li>

            <li>Thanks Amazon,  Melody</li>
            <li>More than what I expected.  </li>
            <li>this product is very effective for people that use alot of heat, my hair feels less crispy and fried after blow drying and flat ironing my hair.</li>
            <li>I use Nioxin because so many other hair products make my hair fall out.  </li>
            <li>I am just glad I had no problems with my purchase as I am with some other ones on another site.  </li>
            <li>My mother uses this on her very fine hair, says it makes her perms last twice as long</li>
            <li>With that said, I started off using this as a flat iron spray for my AA natural hair and it was ok for a while until the stickiness started to get to become noticeable and left a film on my hair.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it someone told me that my hair looked fuller, I was mainly just getting this product to help protect it from my blow dryer and flat iron, but it does wonders with body too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for about a year now</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair well conditioned, shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>Gave 3 stars because really couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between a regular leave in and this thermal protector.  </li>
            <li>Most were no good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m african-american and this product works very well without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>This product really has it all: it detangles, it protects hair from heat styling and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li>I naturally have thin looking hair, This product does the job it leave me hair full of body and volume</li>
            <li>I have fine, long hair, so finding a product that conditions my hair without weighing it down is pretty tough.</li>
            <li>It works well, especially for thin or fine hair, as it does not make your hair oily at all.</li>

            <li> Ever wake up with a side of your hair flat or dented?  </li>
            <li> I towel dry and then apply before I comb out...with head over from the back.  </li>
            <li> Especially when applying to dry hair before ironing.</li>
            <li> i used this before i blow dried and flat ironed my naturally 4b/dry/curly hair and let me tell you, it is so shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Although this isn&#x27;t a completely bad product, it didn&#x27;t provide my hair with any kind of moisture and because of that it has been phased out of my hair regimen.</li>
            <li> It detangled my hair and my hair required less strokes than usual to flat iron straight.</li>
            <li> the years I&#x27;ve tried other such products from time&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair was soft but ends a little dry when sprayed on wet hair.</li>
            <li> From there the product  became my blow dry spray.</li>
            <li> Not a better leave in out there as far as I&#x27;m  concerned</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t a bad detangler which is why I was able to continue using it for as long as I did.</li>
            <li> Makes hair less frizzy especially when using blow dryer or humid weather.</li>
            <li> but I like straightening often simply because I&#x27;m not comfortable with my shrinkage and</li>
            <li> weigh it down, and leaves it shiny and soft.&lt;br /&gt;For quite a long time</li>
            <li> other than the bottle being wet like it leaked out, the bottle has no damages.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re on a budget, just be on the lookout for other heat</li>
            <li> I have been using Bliss for years and tried other products.  </li>
            <li> &quot; on the other two.</li>
            <li> and she is definitely going to continue using as long as she can find it, but it is very hard to find.</li>
            <li> Product is hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> Some also&lt;br /&gt;tended to leave a heaviness which weighed down my hair,&lt;br /&gt;leaving</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years, and was unable to purchase locally anymore.  </li>
            <li> I almost always use it to redry my bangs and fluff them up after sleeping, or to fix a spot in back that always curls the wrong way.  </li>
            <li> I have long thin hair, but I have a ton of it</li>
            <li> Usually products like this will do one of these things well and sort of \\&quot;meh\\</li>
            <li> I have yet to find another product to replace this when I am unable to purchase it in the future.</li>
            <li> Thermal Bliss is so hard to find, but I have to have it for my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my beautician can no longer purchase this product.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s sad because I would make it a permanent part of my hair care regime.</li>
            <li> It is one I use often and am unable to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad they discontinued it.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> With my fine, porous 4a hair, I needed a product that is efficient at protecting my fine strands from the heat that I like putting on it. I&#x27;ve been natural for about a year now but I like straightening often simply because I&#x27;m not comfortable with my shrinkage and how short my neck length hair looks since I&#x27;m so used to having longer hair and I find that long hair is much more flattering for my face shape. This product does its job well, it slightly thickens up my hair, it temporarily gives it strength against manipulation and heat, and overall, has been great for my hair regimen. Now I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the price. I&#x27;m a broke college student so as much as I like this product, I&#x27;m debating whether it&#x27;s amazing enough to continue buying it at that price. I may be able to find something else that&#x27;s cheaper that does the job just as well. I&#x27;m more than halfway done with the bottle and it&#x27;s only been 5 months so I would&#x27;ve actually considered buying it again if it lasted a longer time, like a year. If you can well afford it, then definitely buy it! But if you&#x27;re on a budget, just be on the lookout for other heat protectants/ fine strand strengtheners.</li>
            <li> I have not received the prodruct yet.  I am expecting it to arrive in the mail any day now.  The reaon I am trying this product is because I have been hearing a lot of good this about it.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li> this product is very effective for people that use alot of heat, my hair feels less crispy and fried after blow drying and flat ironing my hair. love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I can spray my unruly hair in the morning, quickly blowdry and it looks great. I had used Bliss many years ago but then the store stoppped carrying it. I didn&#x27;t think about getting it on line until I saw it while surfing. I am so glad I have it back. It&#x27;s wonderful &amp; I&#x27;ll never do without it again.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, light weight, leave in conditioner that protects against heat damage when using a dryer. It works well, especially for thin or fine hair, as it does not make your hair oily at all. I love it. I use it every time I use a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> This lightweight spray is perfect against the high heat blowdryer and flat iron that I have to use on my hair. I&#x27;m african-american and this product works very well without weighing my hair down. Pleasent scent as well.</li>
            <li> Thermal Bliss is so hard to find, but I have to have it for my thinning hair. Manages it so well. I used to have sores on my head when I used various products. Not with Nioxin Bliss! Just a wonderful product. Please don&#x27;t stop making and selling this product!  DB</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair and I have used this conditioner and thermal protector for years.  It keeps my hair well conditioned, shiny and soft.  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I need a good detangler that doesn&#x27;t break off my hair,&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, and leaves it shiny and soft.&lt;br /&gt;For quite a long time now I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin Bliss&lt;br /&gt;Thermal Protector.&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I&#x27;ve tried other such products from time&lt;br /&gt;to time, and have liked none of them.  Most were no good&lt;br /&gt;at all as detanglers, causing hair breakage.  Some also&lt;br /&gt;tended to leave a heaviness which weighed down my hair,&lt;br /&gt;leaving it dull.&lt;br /&gt;Until now I&#x27;ve only found it in Beauty Supply Stores, so&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really glad to be able to get it through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Although it&#x27;s a simple couldn&#x27;t-be-easier no-rinse spray,&lt;br /&gt;I can depend on my hair consistently looking its best.</li>
            <li> i used this before i blow dried and flat ironed my naturally 4b/dry/curly hair and let me tell you, it is so shiny and bouncy. very happy.</li>
            <li> Product is hard to find locally. I find it helps protect my colored hair from damaging blow drying and curling iron.(Nioxin Thermal Bliss)It arrived in 4 days after order. Well packaged. I would buy from Deal Seekers again.</li>
            <li> used 4 many years love it detangels any hair long or short great if no time 4 conditioner best nioxen pruduct</li>
            <li> I love this thermal protector, it makes my hair feel great, and only requires a small amount. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> this product has my hair laid!!! when i strecth my relaxer i uuse this it is a detangler and a thermal protecter, and its the bomb. com.  the price i paid for this bottle was great not sure how much it is not but great price when i brought mines. you will love this product it its diff a staple in my book!</li>
            <li> I use Nioxin because so many other hair products make my hair fall out.  This is a leave in conditioner that works great but does not make my hair heavy with product.  I towel dry and then apply before I comb out...with head over from the back.  This way also helps keep my hair around my face.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Ever wake up with a side of your hair flat or dented?  This is the product to fix it.  It&#x27;s fabulous.  Spray on hair to moisten, then redry with your hairdryer and a brush and it looks like you&#x27;ve just done your hair.  Fixes those messed up spots from sleeping.  Can&#x27;t tell you how much time this product has saved me.  I almost always use it to redry my bangs and fluff them up after sleeping, or to fix a spot in back that always curls the wrong way.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! It makes your hair so easy to comb through. I have fine, long hair, so finding a product that conditions my hair without weighing it down is pretty tough. This gives your hair volume, and makes it easier to style. The first day I used it someone told me that my hair looked fuller, I was mainly just getting this product to help protect it from my blow dryer and flat iron, but it does wonders with body too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for years and I&#x27;m just now doing a review ... lol! When I first received this product I did notice that it was somewhat sticky. With that said, I started off using this as a flat iron spray for my AA natural hair and it was ok for a while until the stickiness started to get to become noticeable and left a film on my hair. From there the product  became my blow dry spray. Although this isn&#x27;t a completely bad product, it didn&#x27;t provide my hair with any kind of moisture and because of that it has been phased out of my hair regimen. I can attest that the smell was pretty good and it wasn&#x27;t a bad detangler which is why I was able to continue using it for as long as I did. By the way, when I got it, it was 10.50 so I definitely wouldn&#x27;t repurchase it at the price it is now. If you catch it cheap ... it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> This product smells like fish! Especially when applying to dry hair before ironing. Also, noticed more hair damage after using it...</li>
            <li> Nioxin Bliss Thermal Protector is the greatest product I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 15 years. It works great at detangling your hair and conditioning your hair. My hair is curly and I love the way my hair looks and I don&#x27;t have the frizz anymore. I wish that they did not discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my beautician can no longer purchase this product.  I have been using Bliss for years and tried other products.  Nothing else compared.  Was very excited to see it listed.</li>
            <li> Very happy with timely delivery and enjoy product, Nioxin Bliss Thermal Protector, for hair to be protected from heat sources such as hair dryer and curling irons.  I&#x27;ve used it before so knew it was good - I am just glad I had no problems with my purchase as I am with some other ones on another site.  Thanks Amazon,  Melody</li>
            <li> This product really has it all: it detangles, it protects hair from heat styling and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. Usually products like this will do one of these things well and sort of \\&quot;meh\\&quot; on the other two. I have long thin hair, but I have a ton of it and I like to keep it as healthy-looking as possible (who doesn&#x27;t, right?). I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years now and my hair is better than ever. I never worry about blow drying too much; my ends look great no matter how often I heat style.</li>
            <li> This product is really great. It&#x27;s too bad they discontinued it. I have yet to find another product to replace this when I am unable to purchase it in the future.</li>
            <li> I receivedit in a timely matter, with no problems. other than the bottle being wet like it leaked out, the bottle has no damages.</li>
            <li> Smoothes the cuticle and hair shaft. Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. A leave-in product that adds volume. Great for second and third day touch ups.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love it...was sorry to see it not being produced anymore and very happy to find it on-line.</li>
            <li> Gave 3 stars because really couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between a regular leave in and this thermal protector.  Hair was soft but ends a little dry when sprayed on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Love this thermal protector.  More than what I expected.  My hair loves it, it protects and gives volume to my hair at the same time</li>
            <li> This product works great on fine hair without weighing it down.  I have used this product for several years, and was unable to purchase locally anymore.  So glad you have it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I purchased this product it is the best I&#x27;ve found to use in between relaxers.  I can go a lot longer without relaxing my hair and it last for a week.</li>
            <li> Not a better leave in out there as far as I&#x27;m  concerned</li>
            <li> I naturally have thin looking hair, This product does the job it leave me hair full of body and volume great addition to my hair regimen.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it gives my hair body and shine when blow drying. I love the fact it is a heat protectant volumizer and leave in conditioner all in one. Product shipped quickly and was exactly what I ordered A++ seller</li>
            <li> My mother uses this on her very fine hair, says it makes her perms last twice as long and she is definitely going to continue using as long as she can find it, but it is very hard to find.</li>
            <li> This product works!  It detangled my hair and my hair required less strokes than usual to flat iron straight. I heard this thermal protector is no longer being produced by Nioxin. That&#x27;s sad because I would make it a permanent part of my hair care regime.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to finally find a way to get this product.  It is one I use often and am unable to find in stores.  It came as promised and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Makes hair less frizzy especially when using blow dryer or humid weather. Does have a scent you may or may not like</li>
