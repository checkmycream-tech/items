    <ol>
            <li>It is the perfect replacement for the discotinued [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>And as promised, this product did an EXCELLENT job of conditioning!  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is great for under $2!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loaded with wonderful ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It works great!</li>
            <li>I am still searching for a perfect conditioner...</li>
            <li>( I love a multi tasker!!!)</li>
            <li>Love Suave Conditioners!!!</li>
            <li>it great that now I can, even if the label says &#x27;Suave&#x27;?\\&quot; Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product and the conditioner - very impressive and bound for greatness!</li>
            <li>all being said, it&#x27;s still not an ideal detangler.</li>
            <li>A great find for the price.</li>
            <li>I am SO HAPPY.  </li>
            <li>So I bought this conditioner because it seemed to have all this great stuff in it.</li>
            <li>It is great.</li>
            <li>LOL..</li>
            <li>but I was happy about that.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really happy wit the results.</li>
            <li>The suave shampoo and conditioner do an amazing job!</li>
            <li>This product is excellent and will buy more.  </li>
            <li>It was truly a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, in the end, I would not hesitate to recommend this conditioner, although users should note that it truly does have a strong moisturizing effect and is probably best for those with dry/damaged hair as the product name suggests.</li>
            <li>I like suave humectant so assumed this would be a good choice too.</li>
            <li>On a whim, I picked this up at Target and saw the \\&quot;conditions as good as Aveda\\&quot; claim on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Based on the reviews, I thought this would be a good product.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as hoped.</li>
            <li>Super happy!</li>
            <li>So this product has many uses!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>

            <li>B001JL6BF2 Clairol Herbal Essences Replenishing Conditioner for Colored/Permed/Dry/Damaged Hair, with Rose Hips, Vitamin E, and Jojoba, 12 fl.</li>
            <li>I liked the conditioner, but still think the shampoo is drying or not so moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- nice and thick&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It smells nice, too.</li>
            <li>This one was actually really nice, though.</li>
            <li>the price of wen and also liked</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, I mix w/ their Rosemary Conditioner which is more strengthening!!!</li>
            <li>wife luvs it, great price and as good as the higher priced STUFF, who wud hv thunk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff there will never be another because it smells great and leaves my 3b curly hair and my sons 4b textures soft,moisturized and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>, i can still comb right through it!!!</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this amazing conditioner and continue to use it as a staple.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to get a nice slip to my hair, and condition, but seems to make it feel more like straw.</li>
            <li>Fell in love with my hair all over again :)</li>
            <li>as it stated on the bottle and my hair felt like silk :))))))))) ^_^</li>
            <li>It feels FABULOUS!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I condition my hair a lot more than I wash it</li>
            <li>It also helps to make sure you&#x27;re not using more than you need to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African-American by the way, if that helps put some more perspective on this review.</li>
            <li>I hope this helps :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been generally pleased with the Professionals line.</li>
            <li>Again, most people might not mind.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and does the job of softening my hair very well.  </li>
            <li>I am quite satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>My hair seems to be most fond of the Suave conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite shampoo and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>Enjoying the product.</li>
            <li>My hair looks as though I just permed it but its not, thank you Suave please dont discontinue both. :-)</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>The smell is very intense and not altogether pleasant, and it lingered for about 18 hours.  </li>
            <li>:) Cheap + super effective!</li>
            <li>This conditioner is very hydrating, it smooths and sooths your hair and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li>Fine hair just doesn&#x27;t soak up moisture as well as thicker hair, and most affordable conditioners on the market just don&#x27;t cut it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i could feel my hair becoming smoother, healthier and softer.</li>
            <li>It does have a great scent and leaves your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have to dye my hair all the time because it fades easily</li>
            <li>But I think Creme Of Nature with Argon Oil is better moisterizing, but Suave almond and Shea butter shampoo and conditioner is more economical in it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>And, it has a strong coconut scent that may interfere with any perfume you might wear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed some consumers complain about the scent being too strong.</li>
            <li>This product does have a strong smell so that could be it.</li>
            <li>Not quite salon conditioning but great for general home use.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best conditioner ever.  </li>
            <li>After using this product for awhile, however, I wound up thinking that it was over-moisturizing my fine hair, so I switched to Suave&#x27;s [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Both are fine products</li>
            <li>This conditioner works well for relaxed hair, and in combination with at-home treatment packs and a good moisture lotion, will keep your hair very soft, hydrated and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is thinner than the shampoo, but the same amount did a great job on moisturizing my hair.</li>
            <li>I was extremely happy to find this product--it is for anyone who likes to grow their hair out long which tangles easily.</li>
            <li>It smells great and makes my hair pretty soft.</li>
            <li>My normally course, frizzy, color-treated hair looks and feels amazing.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>Sure enough -- it&#x27;s actually better than Aveda!  </li>
            <li>I read reviews on this conditioner and was so excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>I love the quality of the product and it is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I am looking for something different and more effective for moisture.</li>
            <li>My hair is clean w/o being greasy and my hair feels silky.</li>
            <li>(i mean, how can something this cheap be great?!), but my dad insisted on buying the cheaper shampoos.</li>
            <li>Whether you get it here or elsewhere, TWO BUCKS for 12 ounces is a good value compared to the various upscale brands and salon products AND</li>
            <li>This is not moisturizing according to tha fact that is is full of silicone.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a tip : you can find this product in a pump bottle some places and that is super convenient.</li>
            <li>Received the suave professionals quickly.</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes my hair soft, smooth, and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to all kinky textured girlys:)</li>
            <li>Imagine my surprise when this conditioner stripped my hair better than a normal clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>I switched out all of my previous conditioners to this Suave line, with great results.</li>
            <li>Thanks Suave!!</li>
            <li>Now, it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars from me because it kind of sits on top of my hair a little bit instead of sinking in, BUT since I condition over night, it does eventually soak in.</li>
            <li>This product not only works well but smells amazing.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is worth  its price.</li>
            <li>I have never,ever liked what prior Suave shampoos did to my hair.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo made my hair feel soft without being droopy and it makes my color look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>it is worth the money</li>
            <li>It moisturizes a great deal, makes detangling much easier and does not leave a filmy residue as other conditioners do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It rinses out fairly well and doesn&#x27;t leave that hard-hat sticky residue of some of the other lines</li>
            <li>They got it right this time.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal right here!</li>
            <li>At first i hesitated to buy this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to a friend. :)</li>
            <li>Suave proves that you don&#x27;t have to spend much money on conditioner (and shampoo) to get softer hair.</li>
            <li>If it can make my mop top manageable, it can do the same for others!</li>
            <li>(and this is all after the first use):&lt;br /&gt;- shinier hair</li>
            <li>So my needs for a conditioner vary depending if it&#x27;s frozen snowy out, if it&#x27;s broiling hot out, and the length of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also love that you can purchase a 28 oz bottle of this for only 2.88 at walmart!</li>
            <li>but Wen is really exspensive!</li>
            <li>I would use the shampoo first, then follow up with the conditioner for 5 minutes (after applying the conditioner put on a shower cap).</li>
            <li>i wash it out, my hair is still super soft and moisturized!!</li>
            <li>you have super fine and LONG hair that is parched, no matter what super moisturizing conditioners you use, I&#x27;d HIGHLY suggest this.</li>
            <li>Not that I&#x27;m a hair expert or anything like that, but I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep their hair healthy, especially to anyone with chemically treated hair (I have a texturizer in mine).</li>
            <li>I would almost say it&#x27;s a bit too thick; if it was a mite bit thinner it would work through the hair layers more easily to get to all the underneath</li>
            <li>this is fine for the short to shoulder length stages of my hair.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price, smeells good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This product, with all it&#x27;s oils and silicones work very well to protect my hair, while the sulfate shampoo cleans my scalp.</li>
            <li>what a shock since she is really picky.  </li>
            <li>B003EH20ZO Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Solutions Flat to Volume Conditioner, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li>agree with the many positives listed by the other reviewers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d go to other conditioners that are more robust in their conditioning and detangling abilities.</li>
            <li>After rinsing the conditioner my hair is moisturized and my curls are more visible than any other conditioner I use.</li>
            <li>This is a great conditioner and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>It is by far the ONLY conditioner that leaves my long and fine hair SUPER soft, super silky, frizz free, and totally manageable!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it on the top of your head of course, I use it on the pony-tail part of my hair (down from the nape).</li>
            <li>Ever since, I have been using suave professional, it has made such a big difference, my hair look much better and retain its moisture.     </li>
            <li>Pantene, a second best, moisturizes but leaves a filmy feeling and thats why I only used it for wet set styles like a regular roller set or flat twists etc.</li>
            <li>My curls are super defined and my hair is extra soft.</li>
            <li>on i used everything from olive oil to egg yolks in my hair, just to get my smooth asian hair back.</li>
            <li>&lt;3&lt;br /&gt;- very, very reasonable price (2.97 at my local Walmart)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>African American curly hair, love as deep conditioner!!!</li>
            <li>I also loved the subtle scent, which I found reminiscent of the shea butter ingredient.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is light, slightly fruity, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>which were pretty much the same and that she was usingthe suave the same way as you use Wen or Hair One</li>
            <li>Sometimes i use a little as a body wash because it is so smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Some days I have to use a little dry shampoo if I miss some spots but in general I like it much better than using shampoo!</li>
            <li>AND if it&#x27;s your thing, this product really defines curls, so if you&#x27;re into conditioner only styling and don&#x27;t mind some cones, this may be your product.</li>
            <li>I also wash with a natural shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip my hair.</li>
            <li>If your hair CRAVES hydration and you&#x27;re constantly trying to find a really moisturizing conditioner, you must give this product a try.</li>
            <li>Natural, 3c</li>
            <li>My hair stays so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair, and this conditioner and shampoo works wonders for my kinky hair!!after</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and manageable and-best of all-frizz-free.</li>
            <li>I also cowash in the winter but just not everyday.</li>
            <li>If you have eczema and sensitive skin like me you may need another product.</li>
            <li>In April 2012 I have transitioned to natural hair.</li>
            <li>My thick, 40-something, color treated hair is softer, smoother, shinier, and more manageable than its been in years.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give Suave a try when I got feed up with Pantene constantly changing their formulas; I found that none of their new products that I tried (including [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I first tried this conditioner, I was impressed with the viscosity of the product; other inexpensive conditioners I have used have been thin and runny, but this Suave conditioner was very thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li>The lather is reminiscent of salon sudsing and rinsed cleanly, but with a slight weight from the moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li>During that time the hair is short enough that it doesn&#x27;t really tangle.</li>
            <li>Normally such good products are expensive.</li>
            <li>VO5 moisture milks conditioner, only a dollar most places, and with my thick hair I go through A LOT of conditioner)</li>
            <li>I used it like you would any other conditioner at first</li>
            <li>later\\&quot; flat residue that normally results from inexpensive conditioners.  </li>
            <li>overall impression of this shampoo and product line is &#x27;Wow!</li>
            <li>I have type 4b or 4c dry color treated hair that is flat ironed or hot combed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In general</li>
            <li>Not only did this shampoo ruin my hair, but I haven&#x27;t used it in over a year and my hair is still dry and frizzy because it did so much damage.  </li>
            <li>I have African American natural 4a/4b hair.</li>
            <li>Still, with two faults (Neither likely MAJOR faults.)</li>
            <li>I WILL be making a trip back to Family Dollar General again to pick up the Almond and Shea Butter conditioner again, and I&#x27;m going to suggest to the non-food manager at my store to bring it in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried Aveda&#x27;s haircare line due to the high cost.</li>
            <li>Purchased in combination with [[ASIN:B002VA4FXU Suave Professionals Conditioner, Almond &amp; Shea Butter for Dry, Damaged Hair, 14.5-ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)]], I was pleasantly surprised by this shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ihave fine but thick hair with an oily scalp and dry ends.  </li>
            <li>Although my hair is fine and thin, I chose this Suave conditioner for Dry, Damaged hair because I have always found that with other brands, conditioners described as \\&quot;voluminizing\\&quot; or specifically intended for fine hair failed to adequately condition my hair, leaving it prone to tangling and</li>

            <li> as it stated on the bottle and my hair felt like silk :))))))))) ^_^</li>
            <li> It feels FABULOUS!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I condition my hair a lot more than I wash it</li>
            <li> It also helps to make sure you&#x27;re not using more than you need to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African-American by the way, if that helps put some more perspective on this review.</li>
            <li> I hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been generally pleased with the Professionals line.</li>
            <li> Again, most people might not mind.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and does the job of softening my hair very well.  </li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to be most fond of the Suave conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite shampoo and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Enjoying the product.</li>
            <li> My hair looks as though I just permed it but its not, thank you Suave please dont discontinue both. :-)</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> The smell is very intense and not altogether pleasant, and it lingered for about 18 hours.  </li>
            <li> :) Cheap + super effective!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is very hydrating, it smooths and sooths your hair and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li> Fine hair just doesn&#x27;t soak up moisture as well as thicker hair, and most affordable conditioners on the market just don&#x27;t cut it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i could feel my hair becoming smoother, healthier and softer.</li>
            <li> It does have a great scent and leaves your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I have to dye my hair all the time because it fades easily</li>
            <li> But I think Creme Of Nature with Argon Oil is better moisterizing, but Suave almond and Shea butter shampoo and conditioner is more economical in it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> And, it has a strong coconut scent that may interfere with any perfume you might wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed some consumers complain about the scent being too strong.</li>
            <li> This product does have a strong smell so that could be it.</li>
            <li> Not quite salon conditioning but great for general home use.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best conditioner ever.  </li>
            <li> After using this product for awhile, however, I wound up thinking that it was over-moisturizing my fine hair, so I switched to Suave&#x27;s [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Both are fine products</li>
            <li> This conditioner works well for relaxed hair, and in combination with at-home treatment packs and a good moisture lotion, will keep your hair very soft, hydrated and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is thinner than the shampoo, but the same amount did a great job on moisturizing my hair.</li>
            <li> I was extremely happy to find this product--it is for anyone who likes to grow their hair out long which tangles easily.</li>
            <li> It smells great and makes my hair pretty soft.</li>
            <li> My normally course, frizzy, color-treated hair looks and feels amazing.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> Sure enough -- it&#x27;s actually better than Aveda!  </li>
            <li> I read reviews on this conditioner and was so excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> I love the quality of the product and it is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I am looking for something different and more effective for moisture.</li>
            <li> My hair is clean w/o being greasy and my hair feels silky.</li>
            <li> (i mean, how can something this cheap be great?!), but my dad insisted on buying the cheaper shampoos.</li>
            <li> Whether you get it here or elsewhere, TWO BUCKS for 12 ounces is a good value compared to the various upscale brands and salon products AND</li>
            <li> This is not moisturizing according to tha fact that is is full of silicone.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a tip : you can find this product in a pump bottle some places and that is super convenient.</li>
            <li> Received the suave professionals quickly.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my hair soft, smooth, and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to all kinky textured girlys:)</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise when this conditioner stripped my hair better than a normal clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> I switched out all of my previous conditioners to this Suave line, with great results.</li>
            <li> Thanks Suave!!</li>
            <li> Now, it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars from me because it kind of sits on top of my hair a little bit instead of sinking in, BUT since I condition over night, it does eventually soak in.</li>
            <li> This product not only works well but smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is worth  its price.</li>
            <li> I have never,ever liked what prior Suave shampoos did to my hair.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo made my hair feel soft without being droopy and it makes my color look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> it is worth the money</li>
            <li> It moisturizes a great deal, makes detangling much easier and does not leave a filmy residue as other conditioners do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It rinses out fairly well and doesn&#x27;t leave that hard-hat sticky residue of some of the other lines</li>
            <li> They got it right this time.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal right here!</li>
            <li> At first i hesitated to buy this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to a friend. :)</li>
            <li> Suave proves that you don&#x27;t have to spend much money on conditioner (and shampoo) to get softer hair.</li>
            <li> If it can make my mop top manageable, it can do the same for others!</li>
            <li> (and this is all after the first use):&lt;br /&gt;- shinier hair</li>
            <li> So my needs for a conditioner vary depending if it&#x27;s frozen snowy out, if it&#x27;s broiling hot out, and the length of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also love that you can purchase a 28 oz bottle of this for only 2.88 at walmart!</li>
            <li> but Wen is really exspensive!</li>
            <li> I would use the shampoo first, then follow up with the conditioner for 5 minutes (after applying the conditioner put on a shower cap).</li>
            <li> i wash it out, my hair is still super soft and moisturized!!</li>
            <li> you have super fine and LONG hair that is parched, no matter what super moisturizing conditioners you use, I&#x27;d HIGHLY suggest this.</li>
            <li> Not that I&#x27;m a hair expert or anything like that, but I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep their hair healthy, especially to anyone with chemically treated hair (I have a texturizer in mine).</li>
            <li> I would almost say it&#x27;s a bit too thick; if it was a mite bit thinner it would work through the hair layers more easily to get to all the underneath</li>
            <li> this is fine for the short to shoulder length stages of my hair.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price, smeells good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product, with all it&#x27;s oils and silicones work very well to protect my hair, while the sulfate shampoo cleans my scalp.</li>
            <li> what a shock since she is really picky.  </li>
            <li> B003EH20ZO Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Solutions Flat to Volume Conditioner, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li> agree with the many positives listed by the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go to other conditioners that are more robust in their conditioning and detangling abilities.</li>
            <li> After rinsing the conditioner my hair is moisturized and my curls are more visible than any other conditioner I use.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It is by far the ONLY conditioner that leaves my long and fine hair SUPER soft, super silky, frizz free, and totally manageable!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it on the top of your head of course, I use it on the pony-tail part of my hair (down from the nape).</li>
            <li> Ever since, I have been using suave professional, it has made such a big difference, my hair look much better and retain its moisture.     </li>
            <li> Pantene, a second best, moisturizes but leaves a filmy feeling and thats why I only used it for wet set styles like a regular roller set or flat twists etc.</li>
            <li> My curls are super defined and my hair is extra soft.</li>
            <li> on i used everything from olive oil to egg yolks in my hair, just to get my smooth asian hair back.</li>
            <li> &lt;3&lt;br /&gt;- very, very reasonable price (2.97 at my local Walmart)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> African American curly hair, love as deep conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> I also loved the subtle scent, which I found reminiscent of the shea butter ingredient.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is light, slightly fruity, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> which were pretty much the same and that she was usingthe suave the same way as you use Wen or Hair One</li>
            <li> Sometimes i use a little as a body wash because it is so smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li> Some days I have to use a little dry shampoo if I miss some spots but in general I like it much better than using shampoo!</li>
            <li> AND if it&#x27;s your thing, this product really defines curls, so if you&#x27;re into conditioner only styling and don&#x27;t mind some cones, this may be your product.</li>
            <li> I also wash with a natural shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip my hair.</li>
            <li> If your hair CRAVES hydration and you&#x27;re constantly trying to find a really moisturizing conditioner, you must give this product a try.</li>
            <li> Natural, 3c</li>
            <li> My hair stays so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair, and this conditioner and shampoo works wonders for my kinky hair!!after</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and manageable and-best of all-frizz-free.</li>
            <li> I also cowash in the winter but just not everyday.</li>
            <li> If you have eczema and sensitive skin like me you may need another product.</li>
            <li> In April 2012 I have transitioned to natural hair.</li>
            <li> My thick, 40-something, color treated hair is softer, smoother, shinier, and more manageable than its been in years.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give Suave a try when I got feed up with Pantene constantly changing their formulas; I found that none of their new products that I tried (including [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I first tried this conditioner, I was impressed with the viscosity of the product; other inexpensive conditioners I have used have been thin and runny, but this Suave conditioner was very thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li> The lather is reminiscent of salon sudsing and rinsed cleanly, but with a slight weight from the moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li> During that time the hair is short enough that it doesn&#x27;t really tangle.</li>
            <li> Normally such good products are expensive.</li>
            <li> VO5 moisture milks conditioner, only a dollar most places, and with my thick hair I go through A LOT of conditioner)</li>
            <li> I used it like you would any other conditioner at first</li>
            <li> later\\&quot; flat residue that normally results from inexpensive conditioners.  </li>
            <li> overall impression of this shampoo and product line is &#x27;Wow!</li>
            <li> I have type 4b or 4c dry color treated hair that is flat ironed or hot combed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In general</li>
            <li> Not only did this shampoo ruin my hair, but I haven&#x27;t used it in over a year and my hair is still dry and frizzy because it did so much damage.  </li>
            <li> I have African American natural 4a/4b hair.</li>
            <li> Still, with two faults (Neither likely MAJOR faults.)</li>
            <li> I WILL be making a trip back to Family Dollar General again to pick up the Almond and Shea Butter conditioner again, and I&#x27;m going to suggest to the non-food manager at my store to bring it in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried Aveda&#x27;s haircare line due to the high cost.</li>
            <li> Purchased in combination with [[ASIN:B002VA4FXU Suave Professionals Conditioner, Almond &amp; Shea Butter for Dry, Damaged Hair, 14.5-ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)]], I was pleasantly surprised by this shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ihave fine but thick hair with an oily scalp and dry ends.  </li>
            <li> Although my hair is fine and thin, I chose this Suave conditioner for Dry, Damaged hair because I have always found that with other brands, conditioners described as \\&quot;voluminizing\\&quot; or specifically intended for fine hair failed to adequately condition my hair, leaving it prone to tangling and</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone, especially if you are trying to keep your hair long.</li>
            <li> Especially when my hair is in its long stage this can be quite a chore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but now I use it as a daily moisturizer because my hair can get soooooooo dry</li>
            <li> My mixed heritage S-curl hair is dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> A little (about nickel sized bit) goes a long way to getting a rich lather on my shoulder length, thick, color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li> Once my hair is dry I would use a Remington flat iron along with Profectiv Mega Growth Lotion to straighten.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time Purology user until now.</li>
            <li> So i tried it, let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> It rescues damaged dry hair immediately.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be put off by  \\&quot;Dry, Damaged Hair\\&quot; in the name.</li>
            <li> Plus it smells heavenly!!Even when my hair is dry</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hair and the conditioners and shampoos cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even blow dry my hair, I have to let it air dry with lots of gel.  </li>
            <li> so you know that my hair is dry and damaged.  </li>
            <li> My hair was dry and damaged from another product, but this has help improve my hair 100%.</li>
            <li> After 5 minutes wash the conditioner out and pat hair dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that was the product or if I was just naturally going through a shedding phase.</li>
            <li> This conditioner (along with its sister shampoo) has helped tame my flyaway hair like no other product in its price range has ever done.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry scalp and ends</li>
            <li> It gets very dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had pretty poor luck with the other Suave offerings.</li>
            <li> I have extremely voluminous dry hair and it moisturizes every strand.</li>
            <li> It amazes me that only a few dollars gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to be as careful as I can with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick, dense, course, curly, natural ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> Made my hair stiff and stripped the moisture that my homemade pre-condition mix (before the wash) left!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way because it works so well.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is white, and a tad thinner than other Suave products I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Then apply a little as a leave in and let air dry.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll begin by saying my hair is fairly thick, and it goes from short to waist length over 2-3 years.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have is Wally world sometimes has the 28 ounce size for LESS THAN THREE BUCKS.</li>
            <li> As a gal with a LOT of very long but fine blonde hair, I&#x27;ve had the WORST time finding a conditioner that moisturizes, shines and softens.</li>
            <li> I have a lot less breakage ever since I started using this.</li>
            <li> I had my hair dyed black with a permanent hair color</li>
            <li> I tried hair one which is half  </li>
            <li> As long as you scrub your scalp really hard it doesn&#x27;t get greasy.  </li>
            <li> They carry Suave&#x27;s normal products, but not the Professionals line, which is silly, since their sister stores DO carry</li>
            <li> so it gets a little frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave it heavy, just conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cowash everyday in the summertime.</li>
            <li> Use less!</li>
            <li> It is a very thick n creamy conditioner that has a combination of ingredients that truly moisturize my dry hair.</li>
            <li> They typically are sticky and gel-like, which then attracts dirt to my hair and makes it hard to brush.</li>
            <li> I would choose it above the expensive brands any day.</li>
            <li> Not sure it was all that conditioning, either.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using wen and hair one for the past couple months.</li>
            <li> it just loses a start with me.</li>
            <li> This almond shea butter conditioner is fairly thick, almost like a lotion.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The downside is that the conditioner is very thick (almost pasty) and somewhat hard to rinse out.</li>
            <li> It is very thick, and does not detangle.  </li>
            <li> I had terrible dry hair, due to prolong staying into the sun.</li>
            <li> The store where I work at doesn&#x27;t carry it ( stupidly ), so I had to settle for another conditioner that CLAIMS to moisturize, but does not, and my hair is back to breakable, rat nesty mankiness again.</li>
            <li> I now have to use expensive shampoo to attempt to repair the damage.</li>
            <li> I would keep using this but unfortunately Suave tests on animals</li>
            <li> I have tried some of the expensive brands including smoothing serums with so-so results.</li>
            <li> I have thick, course frizz prone hair that looks horrible</li>
            <li> I was so shocked at how my hair looked and felt after using it.</li>
            <li> I have the worst hair and this is a miracle.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was extremely happy to find this product--it is for anyone who likes to grow their hair out long which tangles easily. Don&#x27;t use it on the top of your head of course, I use it on the pony-tail part of my hair (down from the nape). It is the perfect replacement for the discotinued [[ASIN:B001JL6BF2 Clairol Herbal Essences Replenishing Conditioner for Colored/Permed/Dry/Damaged Hair, with Rose Hips, Vitamin E, and Jojoba, 12 fl. oz (355 ml)]]</li>
            <li> The suave shampoo and conditioner do an amazing job! At first i hesitated to buy this (i mean, how can something this cheap be great?!), but my dad insisted on buying the cheaper shampoos. So i tried it, let my hair air dry and i could feel my hair becoming smoother, healthier and softer. It was truly a pleasant surprise. 4 years ago i permed and dyed my hair, and from then on i used everything from olive oil to egg yolks in my hair, just to get my smooth asian hair back. Nothing worked until i used suave almond and shea butter shampoo and conditioner. Super happy! :) Cheap + super effective! Fell in love with my hair all over again :)</li>
            <li> I decided to give Suave a try when I got feed up with Pantene constantly changing their formulas; I found that none of their new products that I tried (including [[ASIN:B003EH20ZO Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Solutions Flat to Volume Conditioner, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]] and [[ASIN:B001JQLNS2 Pantene Pro-V Nature Fusion Conditioner, Moisture Balance, 25.4-Ounce (Pack of 2)]]) worked well for my hair.  Although my hair is fine and thin, I chose this Suave conditioner for Dry, Damaged hair because I have always found that with other brands, conditioners described as \\&quot;voluminizing\\&quot; or specifically intended for fine hair failed to adequately condition my hair, leaving it prone to tangling and breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried this conditioner, I was impressed with the viscosity of the product; other inexpensive conditioners I have used have been thin and runny, but this Suave conditioner was very thick and creamy.  I also loved the subtle scent, which I found reminiscent of the shea butter ingredient.  And as promised, this product did an EXCELLENT job of conditioning!  After using this product for awhile, however, I wound up thinking that it was over-moisturizing my fine hair, so I switched to Suave&#x27;s [[ASIN:B002VA4FYE Suave Professionals,  Aloe Vera &amp; Ginseng Conditioner, Volumizing for Fine Hair, 14.5-ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)]], and I have been completely happy with that product (please also see that review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in the end, I would not hesitate to recommend this conditioner, although users should note that it truly does have a strong moisturizing effect and is probably best for those with dry/damaged hair as the product name suggests.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works well for relaxed hair, and in combination with at-home treatment packs and a good moisture lotion, will keep your hair very soft, hydrated and smooth.  I switched out all of my previous conditioners to this Suave line, with great results.</li>
            <li> Normally such good products are expensive. This conditioner is worth  its price.I would choose it above the expensive brands any day.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great for under $2!! It smells great and makes my hair pretty soft. Now, it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars from me because it kind of sits on top of my hair a little bit instead of sinking in, BUT since I condition over night, it does eventually soak in. I noticed quite a bit of shedding also when I was using this product. I&#x27;m not sure if that was the product or if I was just naturally going through a shedding phase. Still, with two faults (Neither likely MAJOR faults.) it just loses a start with me. Still 4 stars in this price range is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A different use for this product is as a \\&quot;protectant\\&quot; for my ends from my shampoo. I like to use regular sulfate shampoo, but I want my ends to stay moisturized. This product, with all it&#x27;s oils and silicones work very well to protect my hair, while the sulfate shampoo cleans my scalp. So this product has many uses! ( I love a multi tasker!!!) AND if it&#x27;s your thing, this product really defines curls, so if you&#x27;re into conditioner only styling and don&#x27;t mind some cones, this may be your product. So.. THREE in one! Awesome!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to a friend. :)</li>
            <li> I had terrible dry hair, due to prolong staying into the sun. One day, I was getting self-conscious  and decided to try the above product.  Ever since, I have been using suave professional, it has made such a big difference, my hair look much better and retain its moisture.     give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret...</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair waited 1 - 3 min. as it stated on the bottle and my hair felt like silk :))))))))) ^_^</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price, smeells good and a little goes a long way. Sometimes i use a little as a body wash because it is so smooth and creamy. 2 in 1 conditioner.</li>
            <li> Suave proves that you don&#x27;t have to spend much money on conditioner (and shampoo) to get softer hair. It amazes me that only a few dollars gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best conditioner ever.  It rescues damaged dry hair immediately.  It turns hair into silk.  It&#x27;s loaded with wonderful ingredients.  I will never be without it.</li>
            <li> As a gal with a LOT of very long but fine blonde hair, I&#x27;ve had the WORST time finding a conditioner that moisturizes, shines and softens. Fine hair just doesn&#x27;t soak up moisture as well as thicker hair, and most affordable conditioners on the market just don&#x27;t cut it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave Professionals Almond and Shea Butter conditioner, however, DOES. It is by far the ONLY conditioner that leaves my long and fine hair SUPER soft, super silky, frizz free, and totally manageable! The store where I work at doesn&#x27;t carry it ( stupidly ), so I had to settle for another conditioner that CLAIMS to moisturize, but does not, and my hair is back to breakable, rat nesty mankiness again. I WILL be making a trip back to Family Dollar General again to pick up the Almond and Shea Butter conditioner again, and I&#x27;m going to suggest to the non-food manager at my store to bring it in. They carry Suave&#x27;s normal products, but not the Professionals line, which is silly, since their sister stores DO carry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have super fine and LONG hair that is parched, no matter what super moisturizing conditioners you use, I&#x27;d HIGHLY suggest this. If it can make my mop top manageable, it can do the same for others!</li>
            <li> * I liked the conditioner, but still think the shampoo is drying or not so moisturizing.  * A great find for the price.</li>
            <li> Este producto es increible, te deja el cabello suave y sedoso.&lt;br /&gt;Definitivamente la mejor compra que hecho en mucho tiempo.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because I was short on cash and wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t ruin my hair.  Not only did this shampoo ruin my hair, but I haven&#x27;t used it in over a year and my hair is still dry and frizzy because it did so much damage.  I now have to use expensive shampoo to attempt to repair the damage. I would not recommend this product to anyone, especially if you are trying to keep your hair long.</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim at the store to try. I like suave humectant so assumed this would be a good choice too. Made my hair stiff and stripped the moisture that my homemade pre-condition mix (before the wash) left! I also wash with a natural shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip my hair. Imagine my surprise when this conditioner stripped my hair better than a normal clarifying shampoo. Returned to the store the next day. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be put off by  \\&quot;Dry, Damaged Hair\\&quot; in the name. If your hair CRAVES hydration and you&#x27;re constantly trying to find a really moisturizing conditioner, you must give this product a try. This conditioner is very hydrating, it smooths and sooths your hair and smells pleasant. Whether you get it here or elsewhere, TWO BUCKS for 12 ounces is a good value compared to the various upscale brands and salon products AND IT WORKS WELL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the many positives listed by the other reviewers. The only negative I have is Wally world sometimes has the 28 ounce size for LESS THAN THREE BUCKS. I haven&#x27;t found the Suave BONUS ECONOMY size bottles anywhere locally recently so I had to purchase the regular size here.</li>
            <li> I have never,ever liked what prior Suave shampoos did to my hair.  Always made my hair like STRAW. I have thick, course frizz prone hair that looks horrible no matter what I use. I went on a trip out of town and I forgot my Biolage shampoo and conditioner. My friend loaned me her Suave Rosemary shampoo and conditioner. I was so shocked at how my hair looked and felt after using it. My hair looks \\&quot;normal\\&quot; now  It feels FABULOUS!  I don&#x27;t have to use serums and leave on cremes anymore that just got my hair half way looking decent.  I am SO HAPPY.  My Biolage just sits collecting dust now I use this and the almond shea butter.  Trust me, you will not regret this. I have the worst hair and this is a miracle. I am now a Suave fan and not a Suave hater.</li>
            <li> Hair type: Natural, 3c&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros (and this is all after the first use):&lt;br /&gt;- shinier hair&lt;br /&gt;- easier to detangle&lt;br /&gt;- softer hair&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;- can be used as a leave-in&lt;br /&gt;- nice and thick&lt;br /&gt;- the scent &lt;3&lt;br /&gt;- very, very reasonable price (2.97 at my local Walmart)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, none for the time being!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a price like this, it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> So I bought this conditioner because it seemed to have all this great stuff in it. I LOVE this product. I used it like you would any other conditioner at first but now I use it as a daily moisturizer because my hair can get soooooooo dry it&#x27;s ridiculous. I condition my hair a lot more than I wash it so I use a cheapy conditioner when I shower (VO5 moisture milks conditioner, only a dollar most places, and with my thick hair I go through A LOT of conditioner) and then I just follow up with this afterwards. My hair stays so soft and moisturized. I have a lot less breakage ever since I started using this. Not that I&#x27;m a hair expert or anything like that, but I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep their hair healthy, especially to anyone with chemically treated hair (I have a texturizer in mine). Here&#x27;s a tip : you can find this product in a pump bottle some places and that is super convenient. It also helps to make sure you&#x27;re not using more than you need to. I&#x27;m African-American by the way, if that helps put some more perspective on this review. I hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> I read another&#x27;s review and got the idea to use this as a cleansing conditioner like Wen and decided to give it a shot.  I have a very dry scalp and ends, I tend to get dandruff with a lot of shampoos. It works great! As long as you scrub your scalp really hard it doesn&#x27;t get greasy.  Some days I have to use a little dry shampoo if I miss some spots but in general I like it much better than using shampoo!</li>
            <li> I would keep using this but unfortunately Suave tests on animals and so I&#x27;m switching to Natures Gate instead. They don&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
            <li> My hair is damaged and 30-40 percent gray. I have to dye my hair all the time because it fades easily so it gets a little frizzy. I have tried some of the expensive brands including smoothing serums with so-so results. This shampoo made my hair feel soft without being droopy and it makes my color look shiny and healthy. I love it!</li>
            <li> What a relief to not have to buy pricy conditioner at the salon.  On a whim, I picked this up at Target and saw the \\&quot;conditions as good as Aveda\\&quot; claim on the bottle.  Sure enough -- it&#x27;s actually better than Aveda!  My normally course, frizzy, color-treated hair looks and feels amazing.  And there&#x27;s no \\&quot;three days later\\&quot; flat residue that normally results from inexpensive conditioners.  Haven&#x27;t tried the shampoo yet, but that&#x27;s next!</li>
            <li> Purchased in combination with [[ASIN:B002VA4FXU Suave Professionals Conditioner, Almond &amp; Shea Butter for Dry, Damaged Hair, 14.5-ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)]], I was pleasantly surprised by this shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light, slightly fruity, but not overpowering. The shampoo is white, and a tad thinner than other Suave products I&#x27;ve used in the past.  A little (about nickel sized bit) goes a long way to getting a rich lather on my shoulder length, thick, color-treated hair.  The lather is reminiscent of salon sudsing and rinsed cleanly, but with a slight weight from the moisturizing properties. No greasiness though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I then used the Suave Professionals Almond + Shea Butter conditioner (leaving it on the recommended 1-3 minutes) and rinsed.  The conditioner is thinner than the shampoo, but the same amount did a great job on moisturizing my hair. It didn&#x27;t leave it heavy, just conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall impression of this shampoo and product line is &#x27;Wow! They got it right this time. I hope they never stop making it!&#x27;  My thick, 40-something, color treated hair is softer, smoother, shinier, and more manageable than its been in years.  I&#x27;ve never tried Aveda&#x27;s haircare line due to the high cost. I can&#x27;t help but think to myself: \\&quot;Isn&#x27;t it great that now I can, even if the label says &#x27;Suave&#x27;?\\&quot; Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product and the conditioner - very impressive and bound for greatness!</li>
            <li> I have natural hair, and this conditioner and shampoo works wonders for my kinky hair!!after i wash it out, my hair is still super soft and moisturized!! Plus it smells heavenly!!Even when my hair is dry, i can still comb right through it!!! Thanks Suave!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner (along with its sister shampoo) has helped tame my flyaway hair like no other product in its price range has ever done. It leaves my hair soft and manageable and-best of all-frizz-free. The downside is that the conditioner is very thick (almost pasty) and somewhat hard to rinse out. And, it has a strong coconut scent that may interfere with any perfume you might wear.</li>
            <li> This is not moisturizing according to tha fact that is is full of silicone. I am looking for something different and more effective for moisture.</li>
            <li> African American curly hair, love as deep conditioner!!! Very moisturizing, I mix w/ their Rosemary Conditioner which is more strengthening!!! Love Suave Conditioners!!!</li>
            <li> I have been a long time Purology user until now. This product not only works well but smells amazing. Buy this conditioner!!</li>
            <li> I have thick, dense, course, curly, natural ethnic hair. I cowash everyday in the summertime. This product is my conditioner after I wash with conditioner (I wash with Sauve&#x27;s Coconut conditioner). My curls are super defined and my hair is extra soft. I also cowash in the winter but just not everyday. I haven&#x27;t used shampoo in over a year. This conditioner is the bomb dot com.</li>
            <li> We all have different kinds of hair, and different kinds of styling we do with our hair. So I&#x27;ll begin by saying my hair is fairly thick, and it goes from short to waist length over 2-3 years. I then cut it, sell it for charity, and start growing it again. So my needs for a conditioner vary depending if it&#x27;s frozen snowy out, if it&#x27;s broiling hot out, and the length of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general I&#x27;ve had pretty poor luck with the other Suave offerings. They typically are sticky and gel-like, which then attracts dirt to my hair and makes it hard to brush. Especially when my hair is in its long stage this can be quite a chore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been generally pleased with the Professionals line. This almond shea butter conditioner is fairly thick, almost like a lotion. It stays on the hair well to let it soak in a bit. I would almost say it&#x27;s a bit too thick; if it was a mite bit thinner it would work through the hair layers more easily to get to all the underneath hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It rinses out fairly well and doesn&#x27;t leave that hard-hat sticky residue of some of the other lines Suave offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That all being said, it&#x27;s still not an ideal detangler. So there are still some issues with brushing the hair. Again, most people might not mind. Since I&#x27;m trying to get every hair I can to stay on my head for the 3 years so I can then give it to charity, it does matter to me. I&#x27;m trying to be as careful as I can with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is fine for the short to shoulder length stages of my hair. During that time the hair is short enough that it doesn&#x27;t really tangle. The conditioner is inexpensive and keeps it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, once it gets longer, I wouldn&#x27;t use it. I&#x27;d go to other conditioners that are more robust in their conditioning and detangling abilities.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff there will never be another because it smells great and leaves my 3b curly hair and my sons 4b textures soft,moisturized and easy to manage. I also love that you can purchase a 28 oz bottle of this for only 2.88 at walmart! This is the real deal right here!</li>
            <li> In my area, this conditioner is only 1.88. If I knew suave was bringing products to the table of this magnitude , I would have saved hundreds of dollars not buying aveda, redeken, kera care (even though their humecto formula i still will buy). I am not buying these formulas anymore, because suave does the job. I have extremely dry hair and the conditioners and shampoos cannot be beat. It detangles my hair and moisturizes it thoroughly. I have extremely voluminous dry hair and it moisturizes every strand. Pantene, a second best, moisturizes but leaves a filmy feeling and thats why I only used it for wet set styles like a regular roller set or flat twists etc. Do yourself a favor and pick this product up or order it, you hair simply cannot afford not to.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the more expensive brands.  Not quite salon conditioning but great for general home use. It smells nice, too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for a while now. I have African American natural 4a/4b hair. I fell in love with this amazing conditioner and continue to use it as a staple. It is a very thick n creamy conditioner that has a combination of ingredients that truly moisturize my dry hair. After rinsing the conditioner my hair is moisturized and my curls are more visible than any other conditioner I use. Aside from this I use Tressame Naturals and Herbal Essences LTR. However Suave is my #1. I highly recommend it to all kinky textured girlys:)</li>
            <li> I read reviews on this conditioner and was so excited to try it.  I have very thick, coarse hair.  It gets very dry and frizzy.  I can&#x27;t even blow dry my hair, I have to let it air dry with lots of gel.  For me, this product does not do anything.  It is very thick, and does not detangle.  I was hoping to get a nice slip to my hair, and condition, but seems to make it feel more like straw.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, I thought this would be a good product.  It isn&#x27;t.  The smell is very intense and not altogether pleasant, and it lingered for about 18 hours.  Not sure it was all that conditioning, either.  I can&#x27;t use this, and am giving it to my daughter.</li>
            <li> I have type 4b or 4c dry color treated hair that is flat ironed or hot combed.  I had my hair dyed black with a permanent hair color so you know that my hair is dry and damaged.  I like the lathering ability of the shampoo and the conditioning of the conditioner, But I think Creme Of Nature with Argon Oil is better moisterizing, but Suave almond and Shea butter shampoo and conditioner is more economical in it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and does the job of softening my hair very well.  I am quite satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for about 2 weeks now. It is great. It moisturizes a great deal, makes detangling much easier and does not leave a filmy residue as other conditioners do. I currently use Shea Moisture, Oyin Handmade and Organix products.. My hair seems to be most fond of the Suave conditioner. I&#x27;ve noticed some consumers complain about the scent being too strong. Use less! LOL.. A little goes a long way because it works so well.</li>
            <li> wife luvs it, great price and as good as the higher priced STUFF, who wud hv thunk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She fills up her shower dispencer, and feels no guilt.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite shampoo and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> buy this for my grandaughter in college and she loves it.  what a shock since she is really picky.  going to try it myself</li>
            <li> Received the suave professionals quickly. Didn&#x27;t realize I was getting six bottles but I was happy about that. Enjoying the product.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! My mixed heritage S-curl hair is dry and frizzy. This conditioner makes my hair soft, smooth, and healthy looking. The only problem is something in this conditioner makes my skin irritated, itchy and red. This product does have a strong smell so that could be it. But goodness, I love this in my hair! If you have eczema and sensitive skin like me you may need another product. I am still searching for a perfect conditioner...</li>
            <li> I never like Suave shampoos before. I always felt like they stripped my hair and made it brittle. This one was actually really nice, though. It made my hair feel silky and moisturized. You can&#x27;t beat the price, either.</li>
            <li> Not as good as hoped.</li>
            <li> I bought the 28 ounce bottle from walmart for $2.50. I&#x27;ve been using wen and hair one for the past couple months. Both are fine products but Wen is really exspensive! I tried hair one which is half  the price of wen and also liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reviewers for the hair one product wrote that she compared the ingredients in Hair One to the suave professionals r  which were pretty much the same and that she was usingthe suave the same way as you use Wen or Hair One and it was working well for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So a I decidedto try using this product as a hair cleanser and I&#x27;m really happy wit the results. Ihave fine but thick hair with an oily scalp and dry ends.  I scrub my scalp with this conditioner and then run my fingers through my hair to distribute the conditioner to my ends. I leave it in while I finish my shower and then rinse it out. My hair is clean w/o being greasy and my hair feels silky. Shampoo is really not necessary and the 28 ounce bottle will last 2-3 MONTHS. That&#x27;s about a dollar a month!&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> In April 2012 I have transitioned to natural hair. I dont know what made me get both the shampoo and conditioner out of all those products. I absolutely love them both! My hair was dry and damaged from another product, but this has help improve my hair 100%. I would use the shampoo first, then follow up with the conditioner for 5 minutes (after applying the conditioner put on a shower cap). After 5 minutes wash the conditioner out and pat hair dry. Then apply a little as a leave in and let air dry. Once my hair is dry I would use a Remington flat iron along with Profectiv Mega Growth Lotion to straighten. My hair looks as though I just permed it but its not, thank you Suave please dont discontinue both. :-)</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner and a little goes a long way.  It does have a great scent and leaves your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and will buy more.  I love the quality of the product and it is exactly what I wanted.  Everyone should buy this it is worth the money Love it</li>
