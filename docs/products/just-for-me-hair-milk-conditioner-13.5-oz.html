            <li>The conditioner smells great as does the rest of the line.</li>

            <li>/&gt;It is especially good when used on heavily-damaged hair with a light</li>
            <li>Just For Me Hair Milk Products, this is surprisingly lightweight.  </li>
            <li>I used it and loved it.  </li>

            <li>I was very pleased with the results of how my hair</li>

            <li>I love the smell of this conditioner!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the shampoo of this brand though, and love it!  </li>
            <li>I call it my amazing curl</li>
            <li>The conditioner also went in nicely and didn&#x27;t leave her hair greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Together they made a nice set.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it has a fresh, almost innocent scent to it that goes along with her</li>
            <li>much as I liked the results of how nicely my hair felt, I&#x27;m saddened that I could no longer used the</li>

            <li>Just for Me Hair Milk Conditioner has a pleasant, mild scent.  </li>
            <li>so I made sure to rinse</li>
            <li>My hair now felt as though I needed to shampoo it again but with a better quality shampoo then the Just</li>

            <li>to use dispenser at the top to control amount of conditioner used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels okay when being applied but as soon as it&#x27;s rinsed out your hair feels tangled and unconditioned.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this conditioner and I am sure you will too.</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Most conditioners need just a minute.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>You could put vaseline in your hair and get better results than you&#x27;d get with this</li>
            <li>This conditioner made my hair more manageable and looked OK.  </li>
            <li>just love the scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and reminds me of Love&#x27;s Baby Soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more concerned about whether or not it keeps my hair feeling clean, looking shiny and, most importantly, dandruff free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t feel like my hair was getting any moisture, and didn&#x27;t create a soft feel to my hair, like most good conditioners do</li>
            <li>The conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue, which is wonderful, and it smells of baby powder.</li>
            <li>I think this conditioner compares favorably with Thermasilk Smooth &amp; Silky conditioner or even TRESemme Smooth &amp; Silky</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very nice, it&#x27;s like a Shea butter smell, which I love, but the quality of this conditioner is not what I expected, so I would not be getting this again.</li>
            <li>After a week of usage, I can say that my thinning, fine hair feels clean, has a tremendous amount of body and is not flaking or itching.  </li>
            <li>Both of these come from coconut oil, but caprylic caprice triglycerides are more like silky oil that nonetheless feels not at all greasy whereas fractionated coconut oil has all the fatty acids and gives a lighter feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caprylic caprice triglycerides and glycerin that make up most of this product although not the scent give it more oxidative stability which means it&#x27;s pretty good for sensitive skin and oily hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I got the shampoo and conditioner from Vine, I had set it in the tub to test, something she quickly discovered when she took her bath.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mild shea butter smell.</li>
            <li>As I said earlier, all of the above products have worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>As I said earlier, all of the above products have worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely fine, naturally curly hair that I pull straight most days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Between this, the shampoo, and the detangling spray, her hair is now incredibly smooth and almost completely tangle free.</li>
            <li>and I use nothing but this product for both of them because it leaves their hair soft, tangle free, smelling fantastic, and their curls are so shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li>and, most recently, Clear Men Scalp Therapy Scalp Comfort Anti-Dandruff 2 in 1 Shampoo/Conditioner</li>
            <li>Compared to other products, the price is good.</li>
            <li>I will do a little more research before clicking on items to review with the realization that some may not be appropriate for my needs and am giving this a neutral rating of three stars.</li>
            <li>good hair conditioner enriched with essential natural ingredients, butter, soymilk, and honey to works well to moisturize weather damaged hair for all family members.</li>
            <li>Makes the hair soft and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>The first time it happened</li>
            <li>the Shampoo and Conditioner are now Grandma approved, and she even left some for me when it was my turn in the tub. :-)</li>
            <li>exactly what we needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first used this product&#x27;s counterpart, \\&quot;Just</li>
            <li>This conditioner is helping get it back to a healthy state, but it&#x27;s taking time.</li>
            <li>It would be safe to say that no two people have the same hair type.  </li>
            <li>I have liked the other Just For Me hair Milk products.</li>
            <li>This is a line where the products really do work better if you use all the same brand.</li>
            <li>This conditioner had a nice fragrance with just a slight undertone of conditioner scent.</li>
            <li>and after two weeks, we both found we were having quite a large amount of hair loss.</li>
            <li>In the past, thanks to the Amazon Vine Program, I have used the following products with great success:  </li>
            <li>Gives my daughter nice little curls after washing out.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much or the hair ends up feeling very over conditioned and waxy as if it wasn&#x27;t rinsed out very well.</li>
            <li>Axe 3 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Plus Bodywash Total Fresh ([[ASIN:B00AE07BC6 Axe 3 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Plus Bodywash Total Fresh, 12 Ounce]]) and, most recently, Clear Men Scalp Therapy Scalp Comfort Anti-Dandruff 2 in 1 Shampoo/Conditioner</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really like the smell of it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a constant battle to keep her hair tangle free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to buy it by the case.</li>
            <li>It also made the waves in my hair really pronounced and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>This product really helps to detangle my hair fast.</li>
            <li>tried it both ways, for one minute and for longer, and I didn&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Caucasian with curly hair, and it felt really</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B005FQMDRM Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Solutions Flat to Volume 2 in 1 Shampoo &amp; Conditioner 12.6 Fl Oz</li>
            <li>With the water less hot, more stayed on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have tried many other products to help with the manageability.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it from Rite-Aid for my grandson only who also has curly hair</li>
            <li>My first reaction upon squeezing a good amount into my hands was that it felt thin and watery for a conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Just For Me&#x27;s special Hair Milk formula with Shea Butter, Soy Milk and Honey adds tones of extra moisture and softness to your child&#x27;s hair (and yours hee hee).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We tried using this with another brand of shampoo, but it didn&#x27;t seem to stay as tangle free as well or as long.</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;m surprised that the instructions say to leave on for 2-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>product is more cost effective than my usual conditioner because it seems to have a lot less water in it.</li>
            <li>It worked ok, but it&#x27;s a little too much for my type of hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was so dry when I got this, and I didn&#x27;t realize it was primarily for ethnic hair.  </li>
            <li>Easy to spread over/through wet hair.</li>
            <li>It quickly was tossed into the trash can next to its buddy the</li>
            <li>Probably they wanted to sell to the greatest number of customers possible and that&#x27;s why they were vague.</li>
            <li>My allergist always told me to use a variety of antihistamines/decongestants in order to prevent a resistance to a particular brand.  </li>
            <li>My allergist always told me to use a variety of antihistamines/decongestants in order to prevent a resistance to a particular brand.  </li>
            <li>It worked great for my coarse hair and my daughter&#x27;s Asian hair and a friend&#x27;s black hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter prefers berry or other naturally scented shampoos much more over this.</li>
            <li>It appears to have some detangling qualities as well, since my hair is normally a bit messier after a shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Joseph B. HoyosAxe 3 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Plus Bodywash Total Fresh ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>B00AE07BC6 Axe 3 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Plus Bodywash Total Fresh, 12 Ounce]])</li>
            <li>I am always eager to read and review new hair care products and the idea of a milk conditioner was intriguing so I hurriedly ordered Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner from the Vine Last Harvest program.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo of this brand, on the other hand, is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt a little greasy but not quite as strong as I&#x27;d like, but the smell is nice, and I can just use a bit less next time.</li>
            <li>work?&lt;br /&gt;After one week&#x27;s use (following the instructions carefully by leaving the conditioner on our hair for 2-5 minutes after shampooing), my family&#x27;s hair were noticeably softer, more manageable, and shinier.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Worst of both worlds, by far!  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is thin and runny, more a simple de-tangler than a true conditioner.</li>
            <li>It bears repeating that a heavy application is difficult to rinse easily but this does make it good to apply before a day at the beach.</li>
            <li>Fabulous solution for we mothers of children with wildly curly hair and little patience.</li>
            <li>There is no apparent positive effect on my hair that makes me want to reach for this in the shower.</li>
            <li>She said it made her curls really soft, took away frizz</li>
            <li>If she were to cut it, it would be naturally curly, so it also has the course texture sometimes associated with naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>After a couple months of use, this product and others in the line have done wonders for wild hair.</li>
            <li>When combined with the shampoo, it made my hair that was feeling like straw turn soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>The buildup was just enough to add moisture without gunk or weight for us, but I can see how it would be too much for thinner hair.</li>
            <li>Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner is recommended for all natural hair types.</li>
            <li>but this does the job and leaves it feeling soft and smelling wonder for day</li>
            <li>However, I am fairly sensitive to scents</li>

            <li>My Hispanic dad, who is fast approaching eighty, is visiting me for the 4th of July holiday</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on my experience, I recommend this product for those with sensitive skin and oily hair.</li>
            <li>After a few more washings I just about have the last of it out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It left my sons hair feeling more raw than with the shampoo alone.</li>
            <li>Also, I wear a tremendous amount of black and I can wear it with confidence.  </li>
            <li>touch&amp;mdash;just a dab is sufficient if it is carefully worked into the hair and another dab can always be applied if the first was insufficient.  </li>
            <li>I am a Caucasian male fast approaching fifty and,</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty stressed from bleaching it recently, so it had that dry, hay-like thing going on.</li>

            <li>We were careful not to use too much conditioner so our hair rinsed out</li>
            <li>Especially if, like me, you are sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how a company could make such an awesome shampoo and such a crap</li>
            <li>I had been using all sorts of masks and intense conditioners on it, but it would still revert right back to being dry in a few days.  </li>
            <li>As such, I wasn&#x27;t surprised that this was gunky and weighty in my white children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>For Me brand is targeted  for children of African ancestry and as a Caucasian adult with very thick fine hair</li>
            <li>I noticed if I had the shower on very hot, the product didn&#x27;t stay and there&#x27;s very little left on the hair.  </li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo isn&#x27;t very thick and it lathered into her hair easily.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews I tried just a little on my straight hair.</li>

            <li> exactly what we needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first used this product&#x27;s counterpart, \\&quot;Just</li>
            <li> This conditioner is helping get it back to a healthy state, but it&#x27;s taking time.</li>
            <li> It would be safe to say that no two people have the same hair type.  </li>
            <li> I have liked the other Just For Me hair Milk products.</li>
            <li> This is a line where the products really do work better if you use all the same brand.</li>
            <li> This conditioner had a nice fragrance with just a slight undertone of conditioner scent.</li>
            <li> and after two weeks, we both found we were having quite a large amount of hair loss.</li>
            <li> In the past, thanks to the Amazon Vine Program, I have used the following products with great success:  </li>
            <li> Gives my daughter nice little curls after washing out.</li>

            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a constant battle to keep her hair tangle free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to buy it by the case.</li>
            <li> It also made the waves in my hair really pronounced and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> This product really helps to detangle my hair fast.</li>
            <li> tried it both ways, for one minute and for longer, and I didn&#x27;t see much difference.</li>

            <li> and I have tried many other products to help with the manageability.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased it from Rite-Aid for my grandson only who also has curly hair</li>
            <li> My first reaction upon squeezing a good amount into my hands was that it felt thin and watery for a conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Just For Me&#x27;s special Hair Milk formula with Shea Butter, Soy Milk and Honey adds tones of extra moisture and softness to your child&#x27;s hair (and yours hee hee).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We tried using this with another brand of shampoo, but it didn&#x27;t seem to stay as tangle free as well or as long.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m surprised that the instructions say to leave on for 2-5 minutes.</li>
            <li> product is more cost effective than my usual conditioner because it seems to have a lot less water in it.</li>
            <li> It worked ok, but it&#x27;s a little too much for my type of hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was so dry when I got this, and I didn&#x27;t realize it was primarily for ethnic hair.  </li>
            <li> Easy to spread over/through wet hair.</li>
            <li> It quickly was tossed into the trash can next to its buddy the</li>

            <li> My daughter prefers berry or other naturally scented shampoos much more over this.</li>
            <li> It appears to have some detangling qualities as well, since my hair is normally a bit messier after a shower.</li>

            <li> I am always eager to read and review new hair care products and the idea of a milk conditioner was intriguing so I hurriedly ordered Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner from the Vine Last Harvest program.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The shampoo of this brand, on the other hand, is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt a little greasy but not quite as strong as I&#x27;d like, but the smell is nice, and I can just use a bit less next time.</li>
            <li> work?&lt;br /&gt;After one week&#x27;s use (following the instructions carefully by leaving the conditioner on our hair for 2-5 minutes after shampooing), my family&#x27;s hair were noticeably softer, more manageable, and shinier.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Worst of both worlds, by far!  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is thin and runny, more a simple de-tangler than a true conditioner.</li>
            <li> It bears repeating that a heavy application is difficult to rinse easily but this does make it good to apply before a day at the beach.</li>
            <li> Fabulous solution for we mothers of children with wildly curly hair and little patience.</li>
            <li> There is no apparent positive effect on my hair that makes me want to reach for this in the shower.</li>
            <li> She said it made her curls really soft, took away frizz</li>
            <li> If she were to cut it, it would be naturally curly, so it also has the course texture sometimes associated with naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> After a couple months of use, this product and others in the line have done wonders for wild hair.</li>
            <li> When combined with the shampoo, it made my hair that was feeling like straw turn soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> The buildup was just enough to add moisture without gunk or weight for us, but I can see how it would be too much for thinner hair.</li>
            <li> Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner is recommended for all natural hair types.</li>
            <li> but this does the job and leaves it feeling soft and smelling wonder for day</li>
            <li> However, I am fairly sensitive to scents</li>

            <li> /&gt;Based on my experience, I recommend this product for those with sensitive skin and oily hair.</li>
            <li> After a few more washings I just about have the last of it out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left my sons hair feeling more raw than with the shampoo alone.</li>
            <li> Also, I wear a tremendous amount of black and I can wear it with confidence.  </li>
            <li> touch&amp;mdash;just a dab is sufficient if it is carefully worked into the hair and another dab can always be applied if the first was insufficient.  </li>

            <li> We were careful not to use too much conditioner so our hair rinsed out</li>
            <li> Especially if, like me, you are sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how a company could make such an awesome shampoo and such a crap</li>
            <li> I had been using all sorts of masks and intense conditioners on it, but it would still revert right back to being dry in a few days.  </li>
            <li> As such, I wasn&#x27;t surprised that this was gunky and weighty in my white children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> For Me brand is targeted  for children of African ancestry and as a Caucasian adult with very thick fine hair</li>
            <li> I noticed if I had the shower on very hot, the product didn&#x27;t stay and there&#x27;s very little left on the hair.  </li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo isn&#x27;t very thick and it lathered into her hair easily.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I tried just a little on my straight hair.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, the conditioner started leaving my hair more limp, so I&#x27;ve only been using it about once a week now, unless my ends are looking bad, then use it more</li>

            <li> However if you have coarse or dry hair give this a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Imagine my surprise when my hair was dry and it felt gross and gunky!  </li>
            <li> After comparing notes, we decided to go back to our normal shampoo and conditioner and within a few days, our hair loss became minimal again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> My hair was so dry -</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling weighted down.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair, and my daughter has hair down to her waist, and it had the same affect on both of us.</li>
            <li> conditioner is marketed to younger people with hair typical of those with black sub-Saharan African ancestry but it works well on people of any age with other types of hair, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a heavier conditioner - thick and distributes well, but for me, I only used it on the lower half of my hair and a total coverage for deep conditioning once a week.</li>
            <li> she has a hard time finding a conditioner that will leave her hair soft but not leave it looking greasy.</li>
            <li> How could a shampoo feel so drying when wet</li>
            <li> This conditioner applies easily without superfluous lather, has a low scent and rinses easily without leaving behind nasty residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain which age group</li>
            <li> This is not something I have seen before with other conditioners.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;After shampooing, I used this conditioner, like any other, let it sit in my hair for a couple minutes, and rinsed well.  </li>
            <li> I imagine this bottle will last me longer than usual.</li>
            <li> This is far and away the most awful conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that you only need a very little bit, because if you use too much, it will leave a weird residue on your hair.</li>
            <li> Products like Frizz-ease help, but so much is needed due to the length of her hair that it gets unbelievably expensive.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m dumping the remainder of the bottle down the drain, because this sludge won&#x27;t do anyone&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;You use it like your typical conditioner</li>
            <li> But this conditioner is a mess.</li>
            <li> The smell was a little odd too.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is a little sticky  but it leaves the hair a mess.</li>
            <li> conditioner adds optimal softness and within a few uses you will see less breakage and split-ends.</li>
            <li> well, it probably will just be a little drier than usual.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t unpleasant exactly</li>
            <li> While this conditioner did moisturizer well, I had a lot of trouble getting it to rinse out.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t leave hair feeling soft, and didn&#x27;t seem to help with untangling.  </li>
            <li> It was excessively greasy and would not wash out leaving my hair weighed down and wet/dirty looking.  </li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for the past year.</li>
            <li> &quot; I need thick, heavy duty conditioners to help keep it under control.</li>
            <li> so maybe that&#x27;s the difference between the other reviewers&#x27; poor experiences and my experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite this being a kids product, it has a surprisingly unpleasant smell that doesn&#x27;t appeal to young kids.  </li>

            <li> This conditioner is really thick.</li>
            <li> Seriously, don&#x27;t buy it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fairly heavy conditioner and coats the hair thoroughly and is a bit difficult to rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the conditioner is the weak link in this line.</li>
            <li> While massaging it into my wet hair (while in the shower), it felt awful dry.  </li>
            <li> Next, I applied some of this totally worthless conditioner.</li>
            <li> Also seems to feel like it leaves behind a residue.  </li>

            <li> I had shampooed my hair with the mediocre Just Not For Me shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is promoted for thicker/curlier hair, so this may be some of the cause, but unfortunately did not feel like it worked.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this was just as bad.  </li>

            <li> While this conditioner did moisturizer well, I had a lot of trouble getting it to rinse out.  It left my hair feeling weighted down. This is not something I have seen before with other conditioners.  The first time it happened I thought it was my fault so I made sure to rinse well the next time I used it.  Same thing.  Waited a couple of days, tried again, and same result.  Nothing else in my hair care routine has changed so it must be the conditioner.  Not for me.</li>
            <li> I had shampooed my hair with the mediocre Just Not For Me shampoo. Next, I applied some of this totally worthless conditioner. My hair now felt as though I needed to shampoo it again but with a better quality shampoo then the Just Not For Me brand. I tried to wash out the Just Not For Me conditioner and found this to be a task almost impossible to accomplish. This is the worst and gungiest product that ever came in contact with my hair. It quickly was tossed into the trash can next to its buddy the Just Not For Me shampoo. May they rest in peace.</li>
            <li> I am reviewing the shampoo and conditioner as a set - since it is hard to talk about one without the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My granddaughter just turned seven and is enjoying growing up. She likes to use her Mom&#x27;s and my stuff, and while still a \\&quot;little\\&quot; girl, enjoys the feminine side of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I got the shampoo and conditioner from Vine, I had set it in the tub to test, something she quickly discovered when she took her bath. Looking at the words, she decided that \\&quot;Just for Me,\\&quot; referred to her, and insisted that her mom use it on her hair. I&#x27;m not certain which age group they are after with that title, but I think they hit the market with that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo isn&#x27;t very thick and it lathered into her hair easily. The conditioner also went in nicely and didn&#x27;t leave her hair greasy at all. Together they made a nice set. Best of all, it has a fresh, almost innocent scent to it that goes along with her personality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the Shampoo and Conditioner are now Grandma approved, and she even left some for me when it was my turn in the tub. :-)</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditioner! It&#x27;s a mild shea butter smell. After reading reviews I tried just a little on my straight hair. It worked ok, but it&#x27;s a little too much for my type of hair. I had my son&#x27;s curly haired girlfriend try it and she loved it! She said it made her curls really soft, took away frizz and she loved the smell also.</li>
            <li> My family enjoys the outdoors so our hair tend to dry out and become brittle.  This \\&quot;Just for Me Hair Milk\\&quot; conditioner was exactly what we needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Enriched with nutrients: shea butter, soymilk, and honey to soften and moisturize hair.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Easy to use dispenser at the top to control amount of conditioner used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?&lt;br /&gt;After one week&#x27;s use (following the instructions carefully by leaving the conditioner on our hair for 2-5 minutes after shampooing), my family&#x27;s hair were noticeably softer, more manageable, and shinier.  We were careful not to use too much conditioner so our hair rinsed out cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slight Concerns:&lt;br /&gt;&gt;The conditioner has a nice butter, milk, and honey scent that&#x27;s OK with all of our family members but some folks may find the scent resembling ladies hand lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Be careful not to use too much because this conditioner is a bit harder to rinse out thoroughly due to the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;A good hair conditioner enriched with essential natural ingredients, butter, soymilk, and honey to works well to moisturize weather damaged hair for all family members.</li>
            <li> I first used this product&#x27;s counterpart, \\&quot;Just For Me Shampoo\\&quot; and loved it.  I was very disappointed with this conditioner.  It feels okay when being applied but as soon as it&#x27;s rinsed out your hair feels tangled and unconditioned.  When hair dries it is left with a tacky feel like you need to wash it. Will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> This conditioner applies easily without superfluous lather, has a low scent and rinses easily without leaving behind nasty residue. It appears to have some detangling qualities as well, since my hair is normally a bit messier after a shower.</li>

            <li> I am always eager to read and review new hair care products and the idea of a milk conditioner was intriguing so I hurriedly ordered Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner from the Vine Last Harvest program.  I later discovered the Just For Me brand is targeted  for children of African ancestry and as a Caucasian adult with very thick fine hair I didn&#x27;t think this product would work well for me.  I didn&#x27;t want to write a misleading review as my results might greatly differ from that of the demographic it is intended for so I admit I did not try this conditioner.  I will do a little more research before clicking on items to review with the realization that some may not be appropriate for my needs and am giving this a neutral rating of three stars.</li>
            <li> Just for Me Hair Milk Conditioner has a pleasant, mild scent.

It bears repeating that a heavy application is difficult to rinse easily but this does make it good to apply before a day at the beach.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t that fond of this product. I recently had gastric bypass surgery and one of the side effects is dry, brittle hair. This conditioner just didn&#x27;t cut it. It was thinner than I like a conditioner to be and I didn&#x27;t really like the smell of it. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has worked wonders on my niece&#x27;s waist length hair. If she were to cut it, it would be naturally curly, so it also has the course texture sometimes associated with naturally curly hair.  Because of the length and it&#x27;s tendency to curl and frizz in humidity, it&#x27;s a constant battle to keep her hair tangle free. We usually braid her hair or put it in a pony tail just to try and keep it as manageable as possible. Products like Frizz-ease help, but so much is needed due to the length of her hair that it gets unbelievably expensive. When talking with my hair stylist, she recommended the Just For Me line. Even though it&#x27;s marketed for African-American hair, she said it should work for my niece&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between this, the shampoo, and the detangling spray, her hair is now incredibly smooth and almost completely tangle free. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue, which is wonderful, and it smells of baby powder. The product is on the watery side, and doesn&#x27;t seem like it will work well, but it does. Don&#x27;t use too much or the hair ends up feeling very over conditioned and waxy as if it wasn&#x27;t rinsed out very well. Compared to other products, the price is good. This is a line where the products really do work better if you use all the same brand. We tried using this with another brand of shampoo, but it didn&#x27;t seem to stay as tangle free as well or as long. After a couple months of use, this product and others in the line have done wonders for wild hair.</li>
            <li> Fabulous solution for we mothers of children with wildly curly hair and little patience. I&#x27;m ready to buy it by the case.</li>
            <li> When you mention the word hair conditioner, the one thing that comes to mind is a product that doesn&#x27;t have a very pleasant smell. This conditioner had a nice fragrance with just a slight undertone of conditioner scent. This is a heavier conditioner - thick and distributes well, but for me, I only used it on the lower half of my hair and a total coverage for deep conditioning once a week. I was very pleased with the results of how my hair felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, along with my daughter, were both using this conditioner along with the [[ASIN:B002MO780W Just For Me Hair Milk Shampoo, 13.5-Ounce Bottle]] and the [[ASIN:B002MO3CG6 Just For Me Hair Milk Nourishing Detangler, 10-Ounce Bottle]] and after two weeks, we both found we were having quite a large amount of hair loss. After comparing notes, we decided to go back to our normal shampoo and conditioner and within a few days, our hair loss became minimal again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I liked the results of how nicely my hair felt, I&#x27;m saddened that I could no longer used the Just For Me Hair Milk line.</li>
            <li> Despite the other Just For Me Hair Milk Products, this is surprisingly lightweight.  It goes on fairly watery and rinses out rather easily.  I think the purpose is just to get the wax on the hair - I noticed if I had the shower on very hot, the product didn&#x27;t stay and there&#x27;s very little left on the hair.  With the water less hot, more stayed on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite this being a kids product, it has a surprisingly unpleasant smell that doesn&#x27;t appeal to young kids.  My daughter prefers berry or other naturally scented shampoos much more over this.</li>
            <li> Having used this product over multiple weeks, I always felt it left my hair feeling less soft and manageable when I used the Just For Me conditioner with the Just For Me shampoo instead of when I used the shampoo just by itself. Why bother with the conditioner then? There is no apparent positive effect on my hair that makes me want to reach for this in the shower.</li>
            <li> My sister is mixed and due to that reason she has a hard time finding a conditioner that will leave her hair soft but not leave it looking greasy. After trying the Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner, 13.5-Ounce Bottle I am convinced we have found something that will work great for her! I would suggest this product to others looking for great results.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t leave hair feeling soft, and didn&#x27;t seem to help with untangling.  Also seems to feel like it leaves behind a residue.  It is promoted for thicker/curlier hair, so this may be some of the cause, but unfortunately did not feel like it worked.</li>
            <li> My hair was so dry when I got this, and I didn&#x27;t realize it was primarily for ethnic hair.  I used it and loved it.  When combined with the shampoo, it made my hair that was feeling like straw turn soft and manageable.  My hair was so dry - I had been using all sorts of masks and intense conditioners on it, but it would still revert right back to being dry in a few days.  This product turned my hair around in about 2 weeks of regular use.  It also made the waves in my hair really pronounced and bouncy.  I never knew my very long hair could BE so wavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells of coconut.  It&#x27;s a very pleasant scent for the summer.  After a few weeks, the conditioner started leaving my hair more limp, so I&#x27;ve only been using it about once a week now, unless my ends are looking bad, then use it more but I just put it on the ends.  I&#x27;ll be keeping a bottle on hand.</li>
            <li> In reading some of these reviews, it seems like a lot of folks don&#x27;t realize that Just For Me Hair Milk products are designed with ethnic hair in mind. As such, I wasn&#x27;t surprised that this was gunky and weighty in my white children&#x27;s hair. It worked great for my coarse hair and my daughter&#x27;s Asian hair and a friend&#x27;s black hair. The buildup was just enough to add moisture without gunk or weight for us, but I can see how it would be too much for thinner hair.</li>
            <li> This product really helps to detangle my hair fast. I call it my amazing curl detangle.&lt;br /&gt;Its a must have for girls with ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner is recommended for all natural hair types. However if you have coarse or dry hair give this a try. Just For Me&#x27;s special Hair Milk formula with Shea Butter, Soy Milk and Honey adds tones of extra moisture and softness to your child&#x27;s hair (and yours hee hee).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You use it like your typical conditioner leave it in for 2-5 minutes before rinsing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner adds optimal softness and within a few uses you will see less breakage and split-ends. Plus you will notice your child&#x27;s hair will be easier to comb through. I absolutely love this conditioner and I am sure you will too.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for the past year. I love the shampoo and conditioner. It smells really good and makes my daughters hair nice and silky.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m surprised that the instructions say to leave on for 2-5 minutes. Most conditioners need just a minute. I don&#x27;t understand why this one would be different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it both ways, for one minute and for longer, and I didn&#x27;t see much difference. The product did its job and made my hair manageable for combing after the shower. I have short hair so maybe that&#x27;s the difference between the other reviewers&#x27; poor experiences and my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a link to the matching shampoo: [[ASIN:B002MO780W Just For Me Hair Milk Shampoo, 13.5-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
            <li> This is the fourth and thankfully final product in this line that I tried.  I dreaded using it because the others were so horrible.  Unfortunately this was just as bad.  It was excessively greasy and would not wash out leaving my hair weighed down and wet/dirty looking.  At least I knew to try it on a day I didn&#x27;t have to leave the house.  After a few more washings I just about have the last of it out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this was meant for African American but there&#x27;s nothing in the description to indicate that nor is there included a description of the type of hair that would benefit by this product. In my opinion this company has done a vast disservice by their marketing department. Probably they wanted to sell to the greatest number of customers possible and that&#x27;s why they were vague. All this does is alienate the customers who aren&#x27;t part of the targeted demographic as well as not informing those who COULD potentially benefit from the product that this is for them.</li>
            <li> I am only reviewing the conditioner, because I didn&#x27;t get the shampoo. Me and my daughter both tried this and we both agreed that it is in comparison to the Suave brand. Let me start by saying that you only need a very little bit, because if you use too much, it will leave a weird residue on your hair. I have shoulder length hair, and my daughter has hair down to her waist, and it had the same affect on both of us. The fragrance is very nice, it&#x27;s like a Shea butter smell, which I love, but the quality of this conditioner is not what I expected, so I would not be getting this again.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine, naturally curly hair that I pull straight most days. Since it frizzes at just the mention of the word \\&quot;humidity,\\&quot; I need thick, heavy duty conditioners to help keep it under control. This conditioner is thin and runny, more a simple de-tangler than a true conditioner. For me it&#x27;s unusable. Smells good, though!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter  and grandson both have curly hair and I have tried many other products to help with the manageability. However, nothing worked for them...  their hair was tangled and hard to brush until I tried this product. I originally purchased it from Rite-Aid for my grandson only who also has curly hair and I use nothing but this product for both of them because it leaves their hair soft, tangle free, smelling fantastic, and their curls are so shiny and bouncy. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair thats hard to keep hydrated but this does the job and leaves it feeling soft and smelling wonder for day LOVE LOVE LOVE this!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is far and away the most awful conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried.  And I&#x27;ve tried just about every brand, from drugstore versions to high-end salon versions, and OMG, there isn&#x27;t a worse conditioner out there.  You could put vaseline in your hair and get better results than you&#x27;d get with this gunk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the shampoo of this brand though, and love it!  (I&#x27;ve tried it without the conditioner, and it&#x27;s fantastic!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shampooing, I used this conditioner, like any other, let it sit in my hair for a couple minutes, and rinsed well.  My first reaction upon squeezing a good amount into my hands was that it felt thin and watery for a conditioner.  It didn&#x27;t have a creamy, silky feel to it.  While massaging it into my wet hair (while in the shower), it felt awful dry.  It didn&#x27;t feel like my hair was getting any moisture, and didn&#x27;t create a soft feel to my hair, like most good conditioners do (even when my hair is wet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I rinsed it out thinking, \\&quot;oh well, it probably will just be a little drier than usual.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine my surprise when my hair was dry and it felt gross and gunky!  How could a shampoo feel so drying when wet and still leave a disgusting slime residue in your hair?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst of both worlds, by far!  I couldn&#x27;t stand the way my hair felt all day.  I pulled it back and covered it with a hat.  It was THAT bad.  I couldn&#x27;t WAIT to get home to wash my hair out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a HORRIBLE, AWFUL conditioner!  I would never, ever purchase it.  In fact, I&#x27;m dumping the remainder of the bottle down the drain, because this sludge won&#x27;t do anyone&#x27;s hair any good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t even use this on my dog!  That&#x27;s how bad it is.  Seriously, don&#x27;t buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo of this brand, on the other hand, is fantastic.  I don&#x27;t understand how a company could make such an awesome shampoo and such a crap conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue buying the shampoo, but I won&#x27;t touch the conditioner ever again!ain!</li>
            <li> Easy to spread over/through wet hair. Makes the hair soft and easy to comb through. Gives my daughter nice little curls after washing out.</li>
            <li> This conditioner made my hair more manageable and looked OK.  But it left my hair feeling like it was covered in plastic all day--and I had washed my hair out twice.  The smell was a little odd too.  It wasn&#x27;t unpleasant exactly but it wouldn&#x27;t go away either.  However, I am fairly sensitive to scents so maybe it&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it again just because of the way the conditioner made my hair feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So not recommended.  Especially if, like me, you are sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is really thick. I&#x27;m Caucasian with curly hair, and it felt really nourishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love the scent. It&#x27;s light and reminds me of Love&#x27;s Baby Soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is more cost effective than my usual conditioner because it seems to have a lot less water in it. I imagine this bottle will last me longer than usual.</li>
            <li> Great! Works wonderful! Even detangles.</li>
            <li> No two people have the same fingerprints, retina displays, or voice patterns.  It would be safe to say that no two people have the same hair type.  I am a Caucasian male fast approaching fifty and, initially, I was hesitant about trying the Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner because some people who used it complained and lamented that they couldn&#x27;t rinse it out of their hair.  This was not the case with me.  I have had a wonderful experience using the Just For Me Milk Conditioner.  I requested both the Just For Me Hair Milk Shampoo ([[ASIN:B002MO780W Just For Me Hair Milk Shampoo, 13.5-Ounce Bottle]]) and the Just for Me Hair Milk Conditioner.  Both smell heavenly and have the appearance of a milky cream.  I squirt dabs from each bottle and mix them together in the palm of my hand.  I then vigorously rub the solution into my hair.  I allow it to remain there while I lather my body with soap.  Speaking of lather, the combination of the Just For Me Hair Milk Shampoo and the Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner doesn&#x27;t lather well.  This is not a concern with me.  I&#x27;m more concerned about whether or not it keeps my hair feeling clean, looking shiny and, most importantly, dandruff free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  After a week of usage, I can say that my thinning, fine hair feels clean, has a tremendous amount of body and is not flaking or itching.  I do not have to brush snowy flakes off my shoulders.  Also, I wear a tremendous amount of black and I can wear it with confidence.  I only wish that Just For Me Hair Milk had a 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner.  Why?  Sometimes, I forget to use the conditioner, especially when I am in a hurry.  I work two jobs and don&#x27;t have time for luxuriously long showers.  In the past, thanks to the Amazon Vine Program, I have used the following products with great success:  Pantene Pro-V 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner, Flat to Volume [[[ASIN:B005FQMDRM Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Solutions Flat to Volume 2 in 1 Shampoo &amp; Conditioner 12.6 Fl Oz (Pack of 6)]]]; Axe 3 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Plus Bodywash Total Fresh ([[ASIN:B00AE07BC6 Axe 3 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Plus Bodywash Total Fresh, 12 Ounce]]) and, most recently, Clear Men Scalp Therapy Scalp Comfort Anti-Dandruff 2 in 1 Shampoo/Conditioner ([[ASIN:B00AE07932 Clear Men Scalp Therapy Scalp Comfort Anti-Dandruff 2 in1 Shampoo/Conditioner, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As I said earlier, all of the above products have worked wonderfully.  However, I don&#x27;t like to use a hygiene product for an extended length of time because my body develops a resistance.  It is like taking an antibiotic for too long; soon, the antibiotic won&#x27;t work.  My allergist always told me to use a variety of antihistamines/decongestants in order to prevent a resistance to a particular brand.  I believe this also applies to hygiene products.  When the bottles of Just For Me Hair Milk Shampoo and Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner have been emptied, I will probably cycle through the other products I have mentioned earlier.  In this manner, my hair never becomes resistant to one product.  It is nice to know that I can use the Just For Me Hair Milk product line in order to control my dandruff.  My Hispanic dad, who is fast approaching eighty, is visiting me for the 4th of July holiday and I convinced him to try the Just For Me Hair Milk Shampoo and the Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner.  He is using the two products simultaneously just like me.  Yesterday, he said, \\&quot;Give them a five star rating.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B. HoyosAxe 3 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Plus Bodywash Total Fresh ([[ASIN:B00AE07BC6 Axe 3 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Plus Bodywash Total Fresh, 12 Ounce]]) and, most recently, Clear Men Scalp Therapy Scalp Comfort Anti-Dandruff 2 in 1 Shampoo/Conditioner ([[ASIN:B00AE07932 Clear Men Scalp Therapy Scalp Comfort Anti-Dandruff 2 in1 Shampoo/Conditioner, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As I said earlier, all of the above products have worked wonderfully.

            <li> This conditioner leaves hair feeling silky.  That&#x27;s because of the ingredients.  I think this conditioner compares favorably with Thermasilk Smooth &amp; Silky conditioner or even TRESemme Smooth &amp; Silky conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Just For Me conditioner has caprylic caprice triglycerides instead of fractionated coconut oil.  Both of these come from coconut oil, but caprylic caprice triglycerides are more like silky oil that nonetheless feels not at all greasy whereas fractionated coconut oil has all the fatty acids and gives a lighter feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caprylic caprice triglycerides and glycerin that make up most of this product although not the scent give it more oxidative stability which means it&#x27;s pretty good for sensitive skin and oily hair (me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my experience, I recommend this product for those with sensitive skin and oily hair.</li>
            <li> I have liked the other Just For Me hair Milk products. My sons coarse curls need moisture to keep from breaking and become an unmanageable tumbleweed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the conditioner is the weak link in this line. The conditioner smells great as does the rest of the line. But this conditioner is a mess. It left my sons hair feeling more raw than with the shampoo alone. The conditioner is a little sticky  but it leaves the hair a mess. This is definitely one to miss.</li>
