            <li>It works wonderfully and is very reasonably priced; I recommend this to anyone who owns a synthetic wig.</li>
            <li>but it works Amazing on my cosplay wigs.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice, light conditioning spray for synthetic hair, and it does a great job of detangling and keeping the hair swingy and fresh when it dries.&lt;br</li>
            <li>kind of smells like a cheap weave!</li>
            <li>Maybe it dries faster on a good quality wig, I don&#x27;t know, but don&#x27;t buy for a cheap wig.</li>
            <li>Works great on the wigs, will absolutely buy more and recommend to others to buy.</li>

            <li>It worked great on my wigs, but *cough* way to much perfume</li>
            <li>Works perfectly ordered a 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li>This has a nice fresh scent and worked well to detangle a clip-on ponytail.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had an eyeglass lens cleaning spray bottle that works better than the original packaging.</li>
            <li>Yes it works to detangle, but I had a cheap wig as part of an avengers dress up outfit</li>
            <li>Nice large bottle and came quickly.</li>
            <li>Used this for my 90 cm wig(ohmygosh was it in a mess) and it came out amazingly!!</li>
            <li>I could brush it with ease and now it doesn&#x27;t look like a ratty mess lol</li>
            <li>I definitely will be getting more.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work very well at getting or keeping tangles out.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li>IT MAKES YOUR WIG SOFT AND TO MANAGEABLE.  </li>

            <li> scent is a little too heavy-handed, though -- why so much perfume in this?</li>
            <li> and this product stayed wet on the wig for more than two days and stinks.</li>
            <li> I used it quite a few times throughout the day on one wig and by the end of the day my wig was a VERY snarly mess!</li>
            <li> money down the drain.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a film and doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li> I down rated to 4 because the sprayer broke before I had used half the bottle.</li>
            <li> I had to walk out of my room for a half hour to get the smell out</li>

            <li> and it was an expensive wig too.</li>
            <li> The bottle also leaks like crazy from the pump area of the cap.</li>
            <li> very unhappy.</li>
            <li> Horrible, and won&#x27;t use it again.</li>

            <li> this works so good and smell so good Im happy I found it here every where else is way expensive</li>
            <li> Yes it works to detangle, but I had a cheap wig as part of an avengers dress up outfit and this product stayed wet on the wig for more than two days and stinks. Horrible, and won&#x27;t use it again. Maybe it dries faster on a good quality wig, I don&#x27;t know, but don&#x27;t buy for a cheap wig.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend for her Hatsune Miku wig. It didn&#x27;t work very well at getting or keeping tangles out. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> let me start by saying I threw the stuff in the trash. money down the drain. I used it on one of my wigs and it did not add shine. it did NOT detangle. if anything, it cause my wig to become a tangled mess over time and the more I used it the worse my wig became. I used it quite a few times throughout the day on one wig and by the end of the day my wig was a VERY snarly mess! and the ends became all fuzzy and frayed. and it was an expensive wig too. very unhappy.</li>
            <li> I use this for all of my CosPlay wigs, it is perfect!  It doesn&#x27;t leave a film and doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li> buy this product . i give ten stars . works grate on synthetic wigs . i have fore wigs and they are in grate shape .</li>
            <li> Nice large bottle and came quickly. Works great on the wigs, will absolutely buy more and recommend to others to buy.</li>
            <li> the best wig detangler I have ever used</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had problems with my wigs getting tangled. It works wonderfully and is very reasonably priced; I recommend this to anyone who owns a synthetic wig.</li>
            <li> I love this product, hair is much more easier to maintain using it.will buy again in the near future.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, light conditioning spray for synthetic hair, and it does a great job of detangling and keeping the hair swingy and fresh when it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a little too heavy-handed, though -- why so much perfume in this? Shouldn&#x27;t I get to decide how I want to smell?  The bottle also leaks like crazy from the pump area of the cap. That part is poorly made.</li>
            <li> It worked great on my wigs, but *cough* way to much perfume I had to walk out of my room for a half hour to get the smell out bleh but it works Amazing on my cosplay wigs.</li>
            <li> I refresh wigs and weaves.  This product does the job well without using a lot. I definitely will be getting more.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly ordered a 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> This product is great and smells good too! I down rated to 4 because the sprayer broke before I had used half the bottle. Luckily I had an eyeglass lens cleaning spray bottle that works better than the original packaging. I will buy again despite this defect.</li>
