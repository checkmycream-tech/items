            <li>Great color penetration and my wife</li>
            <li>I am able to get two colorings for my medium-short hair from each box, which makes the price very good as well.</li>

            <li>Good coverage</li>
            <li>The stuff is quite good.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This color is nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even done henna/indigo (nice, but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and it&#x27;s not always easy to find, so I was delighted to see it sold here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Best natural hair dye.</li>
            <li>makes me feel a lot better about dying my hair every two weeks</li>
            <li>I get complements from top hairstylists.  </li>
            <li>leaves my hair feeling and looking healthy.</li>
            <li>But my hair looks a hell of a lot better than it before dying so I am satisfied. :)</li>
            <li>Better staying power than Clairol and better for your hair.</li>
            <li>Herbatint is the best product you&#x27;ll find that is natural and of course sulfate free .</li>
            <li>This is more of a 3.5N on me.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and leaves my hair shiny and in good condition, because of the special conditioner that is included.</li>
            <li>Herbatint is great if you are looking for a natural alternative to chemical hair dyes!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>formulation is easy to apply and contains no peroxide; I have never had an allergic reaction over the 3 years</li>
            <li>am perplexed as to</li>
            <li>The product does not come with a container to mix color and developer; I bought a cheap ketchup like container and use that.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few years now, and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>My new favorite hair color!</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s natural with no nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li>I really struggle with giving this product a 3 star rating, more of a 2.5 for me.</li>
            <li>quick delivery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this cause I am pregnant</li>
            <li>--super perfumy--</li>
            <li>The neutral shades provide good grey coverage.  </li>
            <li>Love the application, looks natural.  </li>
            <li>You may have to experiment to get the right hair color--</li>
            <li>Finally, a product that gives me complete coverage for gray hair, lasts a very long time between colorings, has no terrible chemical smell and makes my hair look beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I find the convenience and low-cost of coloring my own hair worthwhile, but have had a hard time finding a coloring product that I like.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and no ptoblems!</li>
            <li>but I like more red in my hair.</li>
            <li>light chestnut is more like medium to dark brown, and works well on me.</li>
            <li>(Use hot water and soap to rinse it out at end to reuse.)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>As good as ammonia based permanent dyes, covers gray with no strong smell.</li>
            <li>Colors grays very well</li>
            <li>maybe this color is a bit light for Asian.</li>
            <li>and it looks very glossy.</li>
            <li>I have naturally light golden brown hair, but don&#x27;t typically use a 5D because I have so much brass that comes through.</li>
            <li>Herbatint is one of the less toxic hair color products available and works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I always achieve a rich black colour and don&#x27;t get staining on my pillow, although I put my towel on my pillow the first night.</li>
            <li>but I put tons of conditioner and it brings the moisture level right back up.</li>
            <li>There also isn&#x27;t a noticable line with the growing in of hair between the colored and new.  </li>
            <li>Most formulations are harsh on my hair, drying it to the point of brittleness, and I can never seem to find colors that look natural on me.  </li>
            <li>Worked pretty well, although the color wasn&#x27;t entirely even and it burnt my scalp and neck.</li>
            <li>It did leave my hair feeling soft, not like straw which is what the vegetal chestnut hair color did, but it was close to my natural color and didn&#x27;t cover the gray.  </li>
            <li>You may be surprised by what you find.</li>
            <li>I was alarmed, so called customer service, where they only have one woman available to answer questions, and she told me the reason this happens is because the hair follicle is left open after coloring!</li>
            <li>It is not possible to wash my hair unless I use a heavy conditioner now, just to get it somewhat soft and able to run a comb through it.</li>
            <li>Natural and non agresive.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give it too low of a rating, because it does cover really well</li>
            <li>I have used it even though I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Although it is permanent, the dye does gradually lift slightly, so when a month has gone by and the roots start showing, it has usually been a good idea for me to completely dye again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have been coloring my har for many years, with traditional permanent &amp; demi-permanent but \\&quot;natural\\&quot; for the past 7-8 years.</li>
            <li>No other natural hair color that I have used has ever done this, so I had no idea</li>
            <li>I am very upset because I have long hair and it will take years for it to grow out.</li>
            <li>I actually combine two colors, and the color looks very natural</li>
            <li>Apparently, color started getting out.</li>
            <li>You have to match the samples; ignore the name of the color (I consider my hair dark brown though this color is labeled &amp;#34;Light Chestnut&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>I previously used the Herbatint 6C, Dark Ash Blonde, and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I have worn hair color application for an hour and half after applying and that did not sorry to myself.</li>
            <li>This comes out pretty dark at first then lightens a little after a week or so.</li>
            <li>Your hair will feel dried out after you initially wash out the dye, but it will be back to normal the first time after you apply your conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using this hair color, I noticed that my hair would feel very course and straw-like and become extremely tangled each time I washed it.</li>
            <li>Also, with every other brand I&#x27;ve used, I can use one box for 2 colorings, but have to use almost all of the whole box of Herbatint.</li>
            <li>Works well when I cover my grey hair, looks natural - even fooled my barber!</li>
            <li>how other customers have not complained of or noticed this happening to their hair.</li>

            <li> how other customers have not complained of or noticed this happening to their hair.</li>
            <li> For myself, it is safest to stay with the natural (N) rating; I&#x27;ve tried the copper (R) line only to find my dark brown hair took on a red, brassy shade.  </li>
            <li> First of all it was not light chestnut but dark brown.</li>
            <li> I used this to cover my 20% gray hair and mixed it with Herbatint Haircolor Gel, Permanent 6C, Dark Blonde Ash (1/2 &amp; 1/2).</li>
            <li> Covers grey well.</li>
            <li> I have used this product long before purchase to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The package is enough for two applications, I will use this up since I will be putting it on the roots for 40 minutes and the rest of my hair for 10, I don&#x27;t expect it to be that dark this time.</li>
            <li> It does seem to last 2 weeks longer than Naturcolor and Tints of Nature, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s enough of a reason for me to use Herbatint again.</li>
            <li> It did come out very dark with red undertones which I did not want and thought the Dark Blonde Ash would counteract that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent $15 with shipping.</li>
            <li> so I was trying to avoid harsh chemicals and ammonia, but I will switch back to Argan oil hair dye after my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Color comes out darker than I expected</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s about 2 shades darker than I expected.</li>
            <li> It is not strong and given fashion color when I mixed 4R with 5N and 7R at 1:1:1.</li>
            <li> The price is not better than local buying due to freight charge but bit convinience.</li>
            <li> It does dry my hair out a little</li>
            <li> will make you really really dark</li>
            <li> Beware,it colors 2 shades darker, I had to use 4N Chestnut to match dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> hair was naturally black and now is coming in silver.  </li>
            <li> In my experience, the leaving time should be longer than it is recommended by producer if your hair color tends to black.</li>
            <li> The bottle is just enough for my thick, past shoulder hair</li>
            <li> (leave it on a little longer before rinsing).</li>
            <li> Not sure what other color to get.</li>
            <li> fade a little sooner than I would like.</li>
            <li> A little messy with a squirt bottle.</li>
            <li> Also, the conditioner that comes with the color works nicely but smells awful</li>
            <li> My hair has been shedding a lot in the past week.</li>
            <li> The worse thing that after two weeks her pillow case became dark brown.</li>
            <li> so, unfortunately, I toss</li>
            <li> The reddish tint is not so bad, it didn&#x27;t turn orange like I had my hair turn when done in a salon.</li>
            <li> I was shocked by this and had no idea this would happen.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this product for my mother in a nursing home. I&#x27;ve spent $15 with shipping. First of all it was not light chestnut but dark brown. The worse thing that after two weeks her pillow case became dark brown. Apparently, color started getting out.</li>
            <li> I used this to cover my 20% gray hair and mixed it with Herbatint Haircolor Gel, Permanent 6C, Dark Blonde Ash (1/2 &amp; 1/2). It did come out very dark with red undertones which I did not want and thought the Dark Blonde Ash would counteract that.  I did it on Memorial Day, it is now 7 weeks after and I need to reapply. (Should have earlier) My hair did lighten after every wash and I did like it after awhile.  The reddish tint is not so bad, it didn&#x27;t turn orange like I had my hair turn when done in a salon. It did leave my hair feeling soft, not like straw which is what the vegetal chestnut hair color did, but it was close to my natural color and didn&#x27;t cover the gray.  I wanted to try the product out before putting permanent on.  There also isn&#x27;t a noticable line with the growing in of hair between the colored and new.  I called the company and the expert colorist told me to go lighter next time for permanent with a 6N not a 5N.  The package is enough for two applications, I will use this up since I will be putting it on the roots for 40 minutes and the rest of my hair for 10, I don&#x27;t expect it to be that dark this time.</li>
            <li> Good product, I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product excellent price quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was naturally black and now is coming in silver.  It concerns me to use regular hair color and using this haircolor makes me feel a lot better about dying my hair every two weeks</li>
            <li> Love the application, looks natural.  I get complements from top hairstylists.  My #2 choice is Naturtint. You have to match the samples; ignore the name of the color (I consider my hair dark brown though this color is labeled &amp;#34;Light Chestnut&amp;#34;).  Colors grays very well (leave it on a little longer before rinsing).</li>
            <li> works great. leaves my hair feeling and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> Herbatint is great if you are looking for a natural alternative to chemical hair dyes!! Fast delivery and no ptoblems! We have been using this product for years!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want hair colors with PPD in them, I suggest you not to get this. The description says no PPDs, but when I received it, I read the ingredients and it has PPD in it. I will not be buying hair color from here again.</li>
            <li> Covers grey well. I always achieve a rich black colour and don&#x27;t get staining on my pillow, although I put my towel on my pillow the first night. It does dry my hair out a little but I put tons of conditioner and it brings the moisture level right back up. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This color is nice but I like more red in my hair. Not sure what other color to get.</li>
            <li> Go to EWG.org before buying &amp;#34;less toxic&amp;#34; products. You may be surprised by what you find. Use the search engine for this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product long before purchase to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I like this because Organic hair color. The price is not better than local buying due to freight charge but bit convinience.</li>
            <li> I mix colors to get the tone I want in my hair.  It has served me well for over 20 years</li>
            <li> A little messy with a squirt bottle. Next time using brush. Love that it&#x27;s natural with no nasty chemicals. Good coverage</li>
            <li> After using this hair color, I noticed that my hair would feel very course and straw-like and become extremely tangled each time I washed it. I was alarmed, so called customer service, where they only have one woman available to answer questions, and she told me the reason this happens is because the hair follicle is left open after coloring! I was shocked by this and had no idea this would happen. I am very upset because I have long hair and it will take years for it to grow out. It is not possible to wash my hair unless I use a heavy conditioner now, just to get it somewhat soft and able to run a comb through it. Our hair follicles are not supposed to be left open and it causes split ends!&lt;br /&gt;They should put a warning on their box letting people know this will happen. No other natural hair color that I have used has ever done this, so I had no idea this one would.&lt;br /&gt;I am perplexed as to how other customers have not complained of or noticed this happening to their hair.</li>
            <li> The stuff is quite good. It is not strong and given fashion color when I mixed 4R with 5N and 7R at 1:1:1. In my experience, the leaving time should be longer than it is recommended by producer if your hair color tends to black. I have worn hair color application for an hour and half after applying and that did not sorry to myself.</li>
            <li> Finally, a product that gives me complete coverage for gray hair, lasts a very long time between colorings, has no terrible chemical smell and makes my hair look beautiful.  A great buy!</li>
            <li> great hair color tint!</li>
            <li> The neutral shades provide good grey coverage.  This comes out pretty dark at first then lightens a little after a week or so.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well, although the color wasn&#x27;t entirely even and it burnt my scalp and neck. I used this cause I am pregnant so I was trying to avoid harsh chemicals and ammonia, but I will switch back to Argan oil hair dye after my pregnancy. But my hair looks a hell of a lot better than it before dying so I am satisfied. :)</li>
            <li> Works great.  Color comes out darker than I expected</li>
            <li> Love it! Better staying power than Clairol and better for your hair.</li>
            <li> Herbatint is one of the less toxic hair color products available and works pretty well. You may have to experiment to get the right hair color--light chestnut is more like medium to dark brown, and works well on me. The product does not come with a container to mix color and developer; I bought a cheap ketchup like container and use that. (Use hot water and soap to rinse it out at end to reuse.) The bottle is just enough for my thick, past shoulder hair and I use a comb to get the product through all my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp does itch a bit while product is on it. Color is good, though--my hairdresser always comments on it. And, it does a great job of covering grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does fade a little sooner than I would like. Also, the conditioner that comes with the color works nicely but smells awful--super perfumy--so, unfortunately, I toss it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author, HARMONIOUS ENVIRONMENT</li>
            <li> I use this color to cover gray and I need to maintain my medium brown color..anything&lt;br /&gt;darker than this will make you really really dark&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Herbatint is the best product you&#x27;ll find that is natural and of course sulfate free . It covers gray and lasts about two months .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also the best price you will find  anywhere !</li>
            <li> Great product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and it&#x27;s not always easy to find, so I was delighted to see it sold here on Amazon. It&#x27;s easy and long-lasting.</li>
            <li> herbatint is an excellent product for hair painting. Natural and non agresive. Covers well gray hair.</li>
            <li> Best natural hair dye. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> maybe this color is a bit light for Asian.</li>
            <li> I really struggle with giving this product a 3 star rating, more of a 2.5 for me. I can&#x27;t give it too low of a rating, because it does cover really well and it looks very glossy. However, it&#x27;s about 2 shades darker than I expected. I have used 5N &amp; 6C shades, from different companies, for years. This is more of a 3.5N on me. I have naturally light golden brown hair, but don&#x27;t typically use a 5D because I have so much brass that comes through. I previously used the Herbatint 6C, Dark Ash Blonde, and was pleased with the results. I wouldn&#x27;t consider that a blonde, definitely darker, but I expect that from an ash. I did not expect such a drastic difference between the 6C &amp; 5N! I would also note that I don&#x27;t remember getting a rash from the 6C, but the 5N made my skin red everywhere it touched. It went away, but that was a red flag for me. I noticed a ton of hair lost during this last coloring (the 2nd one with Herbatint) and I have been coloring my har for many years, with traditional permanent &amp; demi-permanent but \\&quot;natural\\&quot; for the past 7-8 years. I&#x27;ve even done henna/indigo (nice, but oh so time consuming and I never could get used to the smell). My hair has been shedding a lot in the past week. Maybe the last coloring just coincided with the end of life cyle for a lot of my hair, but it&#x27;s a touch distressing. Also, with every other brand I&#x27;ve used, I can use one box for 2 colorings, but have to use almost all of the whole box of Herbatint. It does seem to last 2 weeks longer than Naturcolor and Tints of Nature, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s enough of a reason for me to use Herbatint again.</li>
            <li> I find the convenience and low-cost of coloring my own hair worthwhile, but have had a hard time finding a coloring product that I like.  Most formulations are harsh on my hair, drying it to the point of brittleness, and I can never seem to find colors that look natural on me.  The Herbatint line has a product that works for me in both respects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This formulation is easy to apply and contains no peroxide; I have never had an allergic reaction over the 3 years I have used it even though I have sensitive skin.  Your hair will feel dried out after you initially wash out the dye, but it will be back to normal the first time after you apply your conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must say that the conditioner in the box is not quite enough to cover my shoulder-length hair, but combining it with my preferred conditioner has never been a problem.  For myself, it is safest to stay with the natural (N) rating; I&#x27;ve tried the copper (R) line only to find my dark brown hair took on a red, brassy shade.  Although it is permanent, the dye does gradually lift slightly, so when a month has gone by and the roots start showing, it has usually been a good idea for me to completely dye again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can spare the 45 minutes the dye needs to set, this is a great alternative to the beautician.</li>
            <li> Works well when I cover my grey hair, looks natural - even fooled my barber!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now, and am very happy with it. I actually combine two colors, and the color looks very natural (my hair dresser always comments on that). It is easy to use, and leaves my hair shiny and in good condition, because of the special conditioner that is included. I am able to get two colorings for my medium-short hair from each box, which makes the price very good as well.</li>
            <li> Great color penetration and my wife no longer experiences itching while the dye is working.</li>
            <li> My new favorite hair color!</li>
            <li> As good as ammonia based permanent dyes, covers gray with no strong smell. Beware,it colors 2 shades darker, I had to use 4N Chestnut to match dark brown hair.</li>
