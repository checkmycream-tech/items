            <li>I wanted to see if this was something I could do on my own.</li>
            <li>It was a nice color but it lasted like 4 days.</li>

            <li>After 2 applications I have a nice \\&quot;Red\\&quot; color.</li>
            <li>they still told me that the issue was my own, and not their product.</li>

            <li>I am very happy that I am not experiencing any bleeding so far at 3 days post application</li>
            <li>So far it looks great!</li>

            <li>I was hopeing it would give me alot more color,but I still like it.</li>
            <li>Most henna&#x27;s say to mix and wait over night before using.</li>
            <li>The color is extremely potent and it looks like you&#x27;re rinsing paint out of your hair.</li>
            <li>absolutley LOVE</li>
            <li>I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>Kind of a light auburn color.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love about this brand, besides the end result color is that it</li>
            <li>I love this color</li>
            <li>I cut off most of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Love this brand, have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite Henna</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re FAMILY OWNED with FANTASTIC customer service!  </li>
            <li>so I know the color will develop more as well.</li>
            <li>(I am a reactor to most chemical fumes</li>
            <li>Will use this product many more times.</li>
            <li>Just working on building up the color - you can use this henna as many times/as often as you want without hurting your hair.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, the brown I also ordered didn&#x27;t budge it when I tried to go over it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Dyes fast and great color.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and brighter red looks good on me.</li>
            <li>I had damaged ends from years of bleaching and coloring with chemical dyes and it has helped a great deal with frizz and has relaxed the natural curl that I get in my hair.</li>
            <li>This gives her a gorgeous shade that&#x27;s very shiny.</li>
            <li>For me it washes right out of clothing, but I wouldn&#x27;t chance it on something nice.  </li>
            <li>But the original color is stunning.</li>
            <li>Easy to mix as the directions said, with tap</li>
            <li>but it rinsed out easily and</li>
            <li>so I chose this product as the closest alternative because it&#x27;s easy to prepare (just add water)</li>
            <li>SO easy; easiest coloring I have ever done</li>
            <li>so this was easy for me to use).</li>
            <li>It is easy to mix and apply.</li>
            <li>I was intrigued by the easy preparation and application of this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first week, after it settled, the color was nice.</li>
            <li>The paste goes on easily and smoothly with easy coverage and conditions</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly, and when I rinsed, I ended up with the most goofy looking orange beard imaginable.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the orange color on myself</li>
            <li>but overall it still looks great.  </li>
            <li>Colors came out fantastic too...</li>
            <li>Burgundy was better and more vibrant.</li>
            <li>fortunately it comes out clean in the wash.</li>
            <li>I turned a friend on to it too since she is pregnant and doesn&#x27;t want to use chemical dyes, I turned her on to it because it was easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten alot of stares with this unique hair color.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>I have used Henna many times to help strengthen my hair and give a nice red color.  </li>
            <li>I brought it up with the company, and although I told them I stayed with the directions, and applied it to clean</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.the only things i added was a cap full of lemon juice and paprika.</li>
            <li>Deep, bright, rich auburn highlights where there once were grays, and a nice reddish cast to the rest of my naturally dark-brown hair.</li>
            <li>If it touches your skin even for a second it will leave a bright orange mark.</li>
            <li>I loved the red that my hair got after using this product.</li>
            <li>(Make sure you use a gentle formula for color-treated hair to avoid stripping out the color.)</li>
            <li>full time student wanted to see if I could find henna at a cheaper price.  </li>
            <li>Luckily it washed out after about 3 shampoos.</li>
            <li>My hair is super shiny and relaxed.</li>
            <li>, I just know not to expect that really impressive deep red color.</li>
            <li>I ended up having to shave off my beard for the first time in over twenty years!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>instructions were easy to follow (it&#x27;s quite like using/applying a box of color dye from the drug store), just mix to the right consistency and apply thoroughly to your hair and let it sit for a certain amount of time.</li>
            <li>Not ironing definitely helped, but switching to henna made an amazing difference.</li>
            <li>The color was fantastic in the beginning, except it faded as much as the dye would drip onto my shoulders,</li>
            <li>It smells like clay when I prefer the grassy fresh scent of henna.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am going to use it as a henna gloss instead to help reduce the wash time and hopefully keep the color fresh.  </li>
            <li>My hair has faded and honestly I don&#x27;t like the color it left.</li>
            <li>Loved the results the first week, but most of the negative results are true-</li>
            <li>I ruined over $300 worth of clothes because this will not stop running out of my hair.</li>
            <li>Had no problem washing it out: my tried and true process for getting henna bits out of your hair is to condition first, then shampoo, then condition again.</li>
            <li>You can mix it and use it right away.</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful deep red color.  </li>
            <li>Get a friend to help you if it&#x27;s your first time with this product, and take precautions to cover yourself and your work station first!</li>
            <li>just make it a little more reddish, or auburn at most.</li>
            <li>fresh henna is supposed to be bright green --</li>
            <li>I found it interesting how strong the color was on my hair, usually with all the other Hennas, the color was not as bright.  </li>
            <li>So... I&#x27;m stuck with this blue undertone in my hair no matter how many times I cover it.  </li>
            <li>It smelled funny and felt like mud in my hair</li>
            <li>First, for those who are looking for 100% Henna with no additives this is not it.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, not with this brand.  </li>
            <li>First, my hair had been chemically colored about a month before I used the henna.</li>
            <li>That was evident during the washout process.</li>
            <li>I mix the powder with hot water and conditioner or vitamin E oil and leave it on anywhere from 30 min to overnight.   </li>
            <li>It was also my first time doing the application all by myself.  </li>
            <li>This was my first experience with Henna.</li>
            <li>Not horrible, and it&#x27;s stopped fading, but it&#x27;s only been 3 weeks or so</li>
            <li>Hopefully after further applications the tint will become more noticeable.</li>
            <li>At first I was put off by the red-brown color of the powder --</li>
            <li>Love the red color.</li>
            <li>Love the look of red hair using Henna.</li>
            <li>After a couple months of washing it with clarifying shampoos, I was able to re-do my hair with a traditional permanent dye.</li>
            <li>I bought it thinking it was going to be a pretty auburn color.</li>
            <li>i would most definitely buy it again but</li>
            <li>I love the color that I got when I mixed the colors.  </li>
            <li>I dried my hair, the color was absolutely GORGEOUS.</li>
            <li>SO if you are looking for a less intense henna color I guess this is good.</li>
            <li>With the regimen I use with other hennas I can get the henna out and have a nice color without orange fingernails.  </li>
            <li>It came out a beautiful dark red, that sparkles in the sunlight.</li>
            <li>My hair is healthy and thick and I love the color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got more of an orange hue to it now, especially the bleached places, and I really didn&#x27;t want orange hair.</li>
            <li>I was prepared for the mess, but a word to the wise with this particular brand:</li>
            <li>On a positive note it smelt like tea.</li>
            <li>originally used the red color, and although it looked good at first, I had trouble with the color bleeding every time I shower.  </li>
            <li>I did exactly what the directions stated and my hair was a crazy bright red at first, but then deepened to a nice deep red, but it has faded a great deal since then.</li>
            <li>For some reason this henna did not take to my hair very well because it turned it very bright and orange/ gold with red undertones, but only because my hair was already red to begin with.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hardly noticeable if at all noticeable, the deep red color works best on light brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While the first ingredient is henna, it also contains indigo and red clay as primary</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used henna off and on for years, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this particular henna.</li>
            <li>I always return to the earthy green henna, which makes my hair always fuller with great red</li>
            <li>Make sure you wear gloves and be careful during the application process to avoid your neck, face and shoulders.</li>
            <li>the color was better than I expected and my hair was silky and manageable.</li>
            <li>I really like this Henna because it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair like chemical dyes have done over the years, in one use</li>
            <li>That didn&#x27;t bother me  much since the additional products are healing to the scalp, and has cleaning properties.  </li>
            <li>This really covers my silver gray hair.</li>
            <li>but then it started fading, and fading fast, it bled every time I washed it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a pain, and costly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It is still obviously red and nice looking about 6 weeks later.</li>
            <li>But honestly, the tint it gave me is very much similar to the tint I received from using the regular henna dye.</li>
            <li>this brand is unique to me in that it has a clay type ingredient added, so when mixed with water it makes a paste that adheres well to the hair.</li>
            <li>This is like many other henna&#x27;s,it does it&#x27;s job of making your hair stronger.</li>
            <li>It felt super dry right after I washed it out.</li>
            <li>The first week, I had this amazing deep red that was the exact same color as the picture on the site.</li>
            <li>It never hurts the hair and it is not a drastic change if you have dark hair, more like a translucent coating over your hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Even on my dark brown hair, this is the most resilient henna I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Having worked with apparently more benign henna pastes, I did not heed this warning, and instantly had red hands.</li>
            <li>This brand of Henna, is the only one that lasts and doesn&#x27;t wash out quickly.</li>
            <li>I tried many different conditioners which would always lose effectiveness after a short period and then I decided to 1) put away the straightening iron and 2)</li>
            <li>Now that my hair has grown out of hte bleach portion, I still use it and it looks like a deep wine red on top of my medium brown hair.  </li>
            <li>my hair is so vibrant with this henna</li>
            <li>I am not very good at doing things with my own hair</li>
            <li>The red was very pretty.</li>
            <li>gave it an extra star because it was a very pretty color in the beginning, but I would not reccomend using this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using L&#x27;Oreall sulfate free shampoo and conditioner that comes in the metallic pink containers.  </li>
            <li>just like it said, it took away my split ends and made my hair silky soft and very shiny.</li>
            <li>you have golden blonde hair</li>
            <li>I made sure and used dark towels and old towels just in case it stained, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Days afterward youll still see color runoff in the shower but after the first shampoonig, you wont see much fading in the actual color of your hair.</li>
            <li>I bought the henna dye because I didn&#x27;t want to keep damaging my hair with th normal hair dyes.</li>
            <li>Also, I mixed with warm tap water and half a lemon&#x27;s juice.</li>
            <li>it lasts a while I did not receive my last package and they sent it to me right away with a signature</li>
            <li>Be careful with it and have fun!</li>
            <li>I have black hair with grays, the gray hair looks a beautiful wine color and my entire hair glows a deep red in the sunlight.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted the intense red promised.</li>
            <li>I love henna and will never go back to chemical dyes, but just be careful with this dye since it seems to not stick well.</li>
            <li>to small sections, piling each coated section on top of my head, and going around my head until all my hair was</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;That is what I love about henna,  I can use it as often as I want and layer different henna colors over each other.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always wanted to dye my hair red, but in order to go any lighter, I&#x27;ve been told that I would probably have to bleach my hair first.</li>
            <li>It will give you a deep red, rich color.</li>
            <li>One thing I like is that I am not losing near the amount of hair I used to!</li>
            <li>my hair came out BRIGHT red and it looked absolutely ridiculous.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of pure henna for hair but since becoming a mother I don&#x27;t have the luxury of complex preparation and spending hours with smelly globs on my hair</li>
            <li>Another cool thing is it&#x27;s in powder form, meaning you can mix as little or as much as you like.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling clean and soft and undoubtedly red.</li>
            <li>and I was left with a head full of BLUE hair.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the process of putting it on was kind of messy and the washout process was LONG</li>
            <li>I can also only use dark towels because every hair-wash more color comes out.  </li>
            <li>so I ended up getting drip stains on my upper back, chest and shoulders which thankfully faded quickly.  </li>
            <li>After a few days and washing with clarifying shampoo and it was fine, but had I known I would&#x27;ve dyed it on a Friday and washed it over the weekend.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, the color quickly fades; which is not the case with the other brands I have used.  </li>
            <li>My natural color is medium brown.</li>
            <li>I decided I would stop using chemicals on my hair and begin using natural products and this turned out beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did bleed for about 2 weeks but so far nothing is ruined.</li>
            <li>I did not do nearly as much research as I should have before actually using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>like the directions said, the color did deepen the next few days and I am in awe of the deep cherry highlights ( on the ahem, gray hairs) which blend beautifully with the deeper cherry of my dark brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>On my white I get a deep red color, nothing like the orangish I use to have with the other kind of henna.</li>
            <li>this will make it a orangey red color and after a few days it will bleed and fade a little becoming a light orange.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was told to try a different color in their \\&quot;natural dye\\&quot; line, and tried the burgundy with the exact same results.  </li>
            <li>After 12+ years of wrecking my hair with chemical dyes of many varieties (chosen by stylists or by me for the shade instead of by brand or other gimmicks) I noticed that my hair was starting to get a \\&quot;fried\\&quot; texture to it and my luscious, naturally thick locks were beginning to get unmanageably coarse and too easily tangled.</li>
            <li>After several months of use, the texture of her hair has become less fine and thicker feeling.</li>
            <li>Over time the color faded from vibrant red to muted copper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>awesomeI have dark brown hair even without the light you could tell my hair has red purplishsh hue and in the Sun</li>
            <li>I found its degree of fading to be identical in amount to that of chemical dyes, and actually thought it faded a little slower for me than most red dyes do,</li>
            <li>Any red dye is hard to keep strong and vibrant.</li>
            <li>It gives your hair a true deep red color depending on how long you keep it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did two sets of these, I have 1b hair and the color does not show unless im under direct light, besides that a WASTE of money unless your looking for auburn instead of RED .</li>
            <li>So, tight fitting gloves and a long sleeve coverup are essential to working with this product.</li>
            <li>I was looking for natural ways to color my hair a vibrant red after all the bleaching my hair went through for platinum blonde.</li>
            <li>Where is the fun in having to ruin all of your white shirts if your hair gets even remotely wet?  </li>
            <li>The application of the henna is a little on the gross side, but it was easy enough, and it smelled like warm chamomile tea as opposed to the caustic chemical + perfume smell of regular dyes.</li>
            <li>I naturally have light blonde hair, and usually henna dyes</li>
            <li>I had washed my hair several times and the water seemed clear</li>
            <li>Being a veteran hair dyer, I will say that its after effects are nearly identical to chemical permanent dyes (sans hair damage).</li>
            <li>I only want to warn you about the indigo in some natural dyes, just beware &amp; do your research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>My natural red hairs elsewhere on my beard were darkened a shade or two.  </li>
            <li>The first time you rinse out the henna hair dye is a little freaky.</li>
            <li>It bled for a few days afterward, but the color remained just as pretty.</li>
            <li>Because the color runs after the first few washings, don&#x27;t use new white towels to dry your hair.</li>
            <li>Also, use an old towel to dry your hair after this step as the henna color from your hair WILL seep into (and stain)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was possible to find a plant-based hair dye that is this dark and has this much coverage, but it does.</li>
            <li>I have never had this problem with pure henna, or any other \\&quot;natural hairdye\\&quot; that includes henna other than when using the Henna Hut products.  </li>
            <li>It also does bleed a little more than usual for Henna I have used in the past, but the color is much deeper, so it is a trade-off.</li>

            <li> Great color depth and accurate color guide.</li>
            <li> you know the kind that is sold in stores that looks like leaves off the forest ground.</li>
            <li> I wanted to see if this was something I could do on my own.</li>
            <li> It was a nice color but it lasted like 4 days.</li>
            <li> and honestly it doesn&#x27;t look anything like I had hoped.</li>
            <li> After 2 applications I have a nice \\&quot;Red\\&quot; color.</li>
            <li> they still told me that the issue was my own, and not their product.</li>
            <li> Color is Nice</li>

            <li> I am very happy that I am not experiencing any bleeding so far at 3 days post application</li>
            <li> So far it looks great!</li>
            <li> Harvest Moon is pure and organic and great on my hair.</li>
            <li> I was hopeing it would give me alot more color,but I still like it.</li>
            <li> Most henna&#x27;s say to mix and wait over night before using.</li>
            <li> The color is extremely potent and it looks like you&#x27;re rinsing paint out of your hair.</li>
            <li> absolutley LOVE</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.</li>
            <li> Kind of a light auburn color.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love about this brand, besides the end result color is that it</li>
            <li> I love this color</li>
            <li> I cut off most of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Love this brand, have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite Henna</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> LOVE it.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re FAMILY OWNED with FANTASTIC customer service!  </li>
            <li> so I know the color will develop more as well.</li>
            <li> (I am a reactor to most chemical fumes</li>
            <li> Will use this product many more times.</li>
            <li> Just working on building up the color - you can use this henna as many times/as often as you want without hurting your hair.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, the brown I also ordered didn&#x27;t budge it when I tried to go over it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Dyes fast and great color.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and brighter red looks good on me.</li>
            <li> I had damaged ends from years of bleaching and coloring with chemical dyes and it has helped a great deal with frizz and has relaxed the natural curl that I get in my hair.</li>
            <li> This gives her a gorgeous shade that&#x27;s very shiny.</li>
            <li> For me it washes right out of clothing, but I wouldn&#x27;t chance it on something nice.  </li>
            <li> But the original color is stunning.</li>
            <li> Easy to mix as the directions said, with tap</li>
            <li> but it rinsed out easily and</li>
            <li> so I chose this product as the closest alternative because it&#x27;s easy to prepare (just add water)</li>
            <li> SO easy; easiest coloring I have ever done</li>
            <li> so this was easy for me to use).</li>
            <li> It is easy to mix and apply.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by the easy preparation and application of this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first week, after it settled, the color was nice.</li>
            <li> The paste goes on easily and smoothly with easy coverage and conditions</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly, and when I rinsed, I ended up with the most goofy looking orange beard imaginable.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the orange color on myself</li>
            <li> but overall it still looks great.  </li>
            <li> Colors came out fantastic too...</li>
            <li> Burgundy was better and more vibrant.</li>
            <li> fortunately it comes out clean in the wash.</li>
            <li> I turned a friend on to it too since she is pregnant and doesn&#x27;t want to use chemical dyes, I turned her on to it because it was easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten alot of stares with this unique hair color.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I have used Henna many times to help strengthen my hair and give a nice red color.  </li>
            <li> I brought it up with the company, and although I told them I stayed with the directions, and applied it to clean</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.the only things i added was a cap full of lemon juice and paprika.</li>
            <li> Deep, bright, rich auburn highlights where there once were grays, and a nice reddish cast to the rest of my naturally dark-brown hair.</li>
            <li> If it touches your skin even for a second it will leave a bright orange mark.</li>
            <li> I loved the red that my hair got after using this product.</li>
            <li> (Make sure you use a gentle formula for color-treated hair to avoid stripping out the color.)</li>
            <li> full time student wanted to see if I could find henna at a cheaper price.  </li>
            <li> Luckily it washed out after about 3 shampoos.</li>
            <li> My hair is super shiny and relaxed.</li>
            <li> , I just know not to expect that really impressive deep red color.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to shave off my beard for the first time in over twenty years!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> instructions were easy to follow (it&#x27;s quite like using/applying a box of color dye from the drug store), just mix to the right consistency and apply thoroughly to your hair and let it sit for a certain amount of time.</li>
            <li> Not ironing definitely helped, but switching to henna made an amazing difference.</li>
            <li> The color was fantastic in the beginning, except it faded as much as the dye would drip onto my shoulders,</li>
            <li> It smells like clay when I prefer the grassy fresh scent of henna.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am going to use it as a henna gloss instead to help reduce the wash time and hopefully keep the color fresh.  </li>
            <li> My hair has faded and honestly I don&#x27;t like the color it left.</li>
            <li> Loved the results the first week, but most of the negative results are true-</li>
            <li> I ruined over $300 worth of clothes because this will not stop running out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Had no problem washing it out: my tried and true process for getting henna bits out of your hair is to condition first, then shampoo, then condition again.</li>
            <li> You can mix it and use it right away.</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful deep red color.  </li>
            <li> Get a friend to help you if it&#x27;s your first time with this product, and take precautions to cover yourself and your work station first!</li>
            <li> just make it a little more reddish, or auburn at most.</li>
            <li> fresh henna is supposed to be bright green --</li>
            <li> I found it interesting how strong the color was on my hair, usually with all the other Hennas, the color was not as bright.  </li>
            <li> So... I&#x27;m stuck with this blue undertone in my hair no matter how many times I cover it.  </li>
            <li> It smelled funny and felt like mud in my hair</li>
            <li> First, for those who are looking for 100% Henna with no additives this is not it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, not with this brand.  </li>
            <li> First, my hair had been chemically colored about a month before I used the henna.</li>
            <li> That was evident during the washout process.</li>
            <li> I mix the powder with hot water and conditioner or vitamin E oil and leave it on anywhere from 30 min to overnight.   </li>
            <li> It was also my first time doing the application all by myself.  </li>
            <li> This was my first experience with Henna.</li>
            <li> Not horrible, and it&#x27;s stopped fading, but it&#x27;s only been 3 weeks or so</li>
            <li> Hopefully after further applications the tint will become more noticeable.</li>
            <li> At first I was put off by the red-brown color of the powder --</li>
            <li> Love the red color.</li>
            <li> Love the look of red hair using Henna.</li>
            <li> After a couple months of washing it with clarifying shampoos, I was able to re-do my hair with a traditional permanent dye.</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking it was going to be a pretty auburn color.</li>
            <li> i would most definitely buy it again but</li>
            <li> I love the color that I got when I mixed the colors.  </li>
            <li> I dried my hair, the color was absolutely GORGEOUS.</li>
            <li> SO if you are looking for a less intense henna color I guess this is good.</li>
            <li> With the regimen I use with other hennas I can get the henna out and have a nice color without orange fingernails.  </li>
            <li> It came out a beautiful dark red, that sparkles in the sunlight.</li>
            <li> My hair is healthy and thick and I love the color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got more of an orange hue to it now, especially the bleached places, and I really didn&#x27;t want orange hair.</li>
            <li> I was prepared for the mess, but a word to the wise with this particular brand:</li>
            <li> On a positive note it smelt like tea.</li>
            <li> originally used the red color, and although it looked good at first, I had trouble with the color bleeding every time I shower.  </li>
            <li> I did exactly what the directions stated and my hair was a crazy bright red at first, but then deepened to a nice deep red, but it has faded a great deal since then.</li>
            <li> For some reason this henna did not take to my hair very well because it turned it very bright and orange/ gold with red undertones, but only because my hair was already red to begin with.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hardly noticeable if at all noticeable, the deep red color works best on light brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While the first ingredient is henna, it also contains indigo and red clay as primary</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used henna off and on for years, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this particular henna.</li>
            <li> I always return to the earthy green henna, which makes my hair always fuller with great red</li>
            <li> Make sure you wear gloves and be careful during the application process to avoid your neck, face and shoulders.</li>
            <li> the color was better than I expected and my hair was silky and manageable.</li>
            <li> I really like this Henna because it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair like chemical dyes have done over the years, in one use</li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t bother me  much since the additional products are healing to the scalp, and has cleaning properties.  </li>
            <li> This really covers my silver gray hair.</li>
            <li> but then it started fading, and fading fast, it bled every time I washed it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a pain, and costly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It is still obviously red and nice looking about 6 weeks later.</li>
            <li> But honestly, the tint it gave me is very much similar to the tint I received from using the regular henna dye.</li>
            <li> this brand is unique to me in that it has a clay type ingredient added, so when mixed with water it makes a paste that adheres well to the hair.</li>
            <li> This is like many other henna&#x27;s,it does it&#x27;s job of making your hair stronger.</li>
            <li> It felt super dry right after I washed it out.</li>
            <li> The first week, I had this amazing deep red that was the exact same color as the picture on the site.</li>
            <li> It never hurts the hair and it is not a drastic change if you have dark hair, more like a translucent coating over your hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Even on my dark brown hair, this is the most resilient henna I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Having worked with apparently more benign henna pastes, I did not heed this warning, and instantly had red hands.</li>
            <li> This brand of Henna, is the only one that lasts and doesn&#x27;t wash out quickly.</li>
            <li> I tried many different conditioners which would always lose effectiveness after a short period and then I decided to 1) put away the straightening iron and 2)</li>
            <li> Now that my hair has grown out of hte bleach portion, I still use it and it looks like a deep wine red on top of my medium brown hair.  </li>
            <li> my hair is so vibrant with this henna</li>
            <li> I am not very good at doing things with my own hair</li>
            <li> The red was very pretty.</li>
            <li> gave it an extra star because it was a very pretty color in the beginning, but I would not reccomend using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreall sulfate free shampoo and conditioner that comes in the metallic pink containers.  </li>
            <li> just like it said, it took away my split ends and made my hair silky soft and very shiny.</li>
            <li> you have golden blonde hair</li>
            <li> I made sure and used dark towels and old towels just in case it stained, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Days afterward youll still see color runoff in the shower but after the first shampoonig, you wont see much fading in the actual color of your hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the henna dye because I didn&#x27;t want to keep damaging my hair with th normal hair dyes.</li>
            <li> Also, I mixed with warm tap water and half a lemon&#x27;s juice.</li>
            <li> it lasts a while I did not receive my last package and they sent it to me right away with a signature</li>
            <li> Be careful with it and have fun!</li>
            <li> I have black hair with grays, the gray hair looks a beautiful wine color and my entire hair glows a deep red in the sunlight.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted the intense red promised.</li>
            <li> I love henna and will never go back to chemical dyes, but just be careful with this dye since it seems to not stick well.</li>
            <li> to small sections, piling each coated section on top of my head, and going around my head until all my hair was</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;That is what I love about henna,  I can use it as often as I want and layer different henna colors over each other.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always wanted to dye my hair red, but in order to go any lighter, I&#x27;ve been told that I would probably have to bleach my hair first.</li>
            <li> It will give you a deep red, rich color.</li>
            <li> One thing I like is that I am not losing near the amount of hair I used to!</li>
            <li> my hair came out BRIGHT red and it looked absolutely ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of pure henna for hair but since becoming a mother I don&#x27;t have the luxury of complex preparation and spending hours with smelly globs on my hair</li>
            <li> Another cool thing is it&#x27;s in powder form, meaning you can mix as little or as much as you like.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling clean and soft and undoubtedly red.</li>
            <li> and I was left with a head full of BLUE hair.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the process of putting it on was kind of messy and the washout process was LONG</li>
            <li> I can also only use dark towels because every hair-wash more color comes out.  </li>
            <li> so I ended up getting drip stains on my upper back, chest and shoulders which thankfully faded quickly.  </li>
            <li> After a few days and washing with clarifying shampoo and it was fine, but had I known I would&#x27;ve dyed it on a Friday and washed it over the weekend.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the color quickly fades; which is not the case with the other brands I have used.  </li>
            <li> My natural color is medium brown.</li>
            <li> I decided I would stop using chemicals on my hair and begin using natural products and this turned out beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did bleed for about 2 weeks but so far nothing is ruined.</li>
            <li> I did not do nearly as much research as I should have before actually using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like the directions said, the color did deepen the next few days and I am in awe of the deep cherry highlights ( on the ahem, gray hairs) which blend beautifully with the deeper cherry of my dark brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> On my white I get a deep red color, nothing like the orangish I use to have with the other kind of henna.</li>
            <li> this will make it a orangey red color and after a few days it will bleed and fade a little becoming a light orange.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was told to try a different color in their \\&quot;natural dye\\&quot; line, and tried the burgundy with the exact same results.  </li>
            <li> After 12+ years of wrecking my hair with chemical dyes of many varieties (chosen by stylists or by me for the shade instead of by brand or other gimmicks) I noticed that my hair was starting to get a \\&quot;fried\\&quot; texture to it and my luscious, naturally thick locks were beginning to get unmanageably coarse and too easily tangled.</li>
            <li> After several months of use, the texture of her hair has become less fine and thicker feeling.</li>
            <li> Over time the color faded from vibrant red to muted copper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> awesomeI have dark brown hair even without the light you could tell my hair has red purplishsh hue and in the Sun</li>
            <li> I found its degree of fading to be identical in amount to that of chemical dyes, and actually thought it faded a little slower for me than most red dyes do,</li>
            <li> Any red dye is hard to keep strong and vibrant.</li>
            <li> It gives your hair a true deep red color depending on how long you keep it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did two sets of these, I have 1b hair and the color does not show unless im under direct light, besides that a WASTE of money unless your looking for auburn instead of RED .</li>
            <li> So, tight fitting gloves and a long sleeve coverup are essential to working with this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for natural ways to color my hair a vibrant red after all the bleaching my hair went through for platinum blonde.</li>
            <li> Where is the fun in having to ruin all of your white shirts if your hair gets even remotely wet?  </li>
            <li> The application of the henna is a little on the gross side, but it was easy enough, and it smelled like warm chamomile tea as opposed to the caustic chemical + perfume smell of regular dyes.</li>
            <li> I naturally have light blonde hair, and usually henna dyes</li>
            <li> I had washed my hair several times and the water seemed clear</li>
            <li> Being a veteran hair dyer, I will say that its after effects are nearly identical to chemical permanent dyes (sans hair damage).</li>
            <li> I only want to warn you about the indigo in some natural dyes, just beware &amp; do your research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> My natural red hairs elsewhere on my beard were darkened a shade or two.  </li>
            <li> The first time you rinse out the henna hair dye is a little freaky.</li>
            <li> It bled for a few days afterward, but the color remained just as pretty.</li>
            <li> Because the color runs after the first few washings, don&#x27;t use new white towels to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> Also, use an old towel to dry your hair after this step as the henna color from your hair WILL seep into (and stain)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was possible to find a plant-based hair dye that is this dark and has this much coverage, but it does.</li>
            <li> I have never had this problem with pure henna, or any other \\&quot;natural hairdye\\&quot; that includes henna other than when using the Henna Hut products.  </li>
            <li> It also does bleed a little more than usual for Henna I have used in the past, but the color is much deeper, so it is a trade-off.</li>
            <li> This Henna red seemed to last longer than regular red chemical dyes, despite the dry and chemically processed condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The obvious purpose of a beard dye is to hide grey or white hairs.</li>
            <li> The reviews were mixed with positive and negative, but I thought I&#x27;d try it for myself.</li>
            <li> If you leave it on long enough it will but will also wash off after a couple of shampooing.</li>
            <li> For a long while friends who also dye their hair red suggested henna.</li>
            <li> I will be going back to the more expensive henna at the other website.  </li>
            <li> But when I dried my hair and looked in the mirror I actually said WOW.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Red dye for a while, so when I put on the Dark Red, my hair was already red.</li>
            <li> I ordered deep red and upon application, the paste indeed dried a deep red.</li>
            <li> But the color is beautiful and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> However, you can try going to the link and it did not direct you to anything</li>
            <li> I even took note of, and was a bit apprehensive about, the warning that white hair may turn red, green or blue.  </li>
            <li> in all a complete waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Works well and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be prepared for it to stain your pillows for a couple of weeks,  especially if you go to sleep with wet hair.</li>
            <li> it is very messy but my hair is so soft and shiny!!</li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s natural color is just plain brown.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I had was that my hair never rinsed completely clean for at least two months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hair dye for 10 years and it&#x27;s taken a tole on my hair and made it extremely dry</li>
            <li> I recommend using a lot of conditioner at this stage because henna is astringent and will make your hair feel dry, though it doesn&#x27;t do the damage that chemicals will.</li>
            <li> The color would run out of my hair EVERY SINGLE TIME that my hair got</li>
            <li> This time, I wanted to try the dark red.</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying high prices to fry my hair only to have the color fade away.</li>
            <li> hair ended up nearly black with none of the promised red undertones.</li>
            <li> I truly believe the seller uses personal and fake accounts to create positive reviews, add pictures, and argue with customers who tell the truth about their product.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the henna settled ultimately at a similarly lighter, less chromatic shade as with other dyes.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does bleed for a week or two when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> but I bought this because I wanted red hair thus i&#x27;ll need to reapply it again in a few weeks to achieve my desired color.</li>
            <li> carefully followed directions and applied accordingly.  </li>
            <li> And every time your hair gets wet it WILL leak.</li>
            <li> this henna bleeds every time the hair gets remotely wet.  </li>
            <li> wet-</li>
            <li> The product was what to be expected from henna.</li>
            <li> It does bleed when wet..</li>
            <li> I loved the results after 2 applications, but HATED that the color ran.  </li>
            <li> The smell is earthy, which I prefer over the strong chemical dyes which usually make me feel ill</li>
            <li> I have used another popular henna brand in the past and it did not bleed nor fade as bad as this brand.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give this product a 4 star is because of the fading, but I am not sure if it was the leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Had used chemical dyes for the past 2+ years and my hair was starting to show the effects of chemical dyes.</li>
            <li> (I have ruined clothing due to this).</li>
            <li> I HAVE to use a conditioner AND a leave-in conditioner due to the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> I had no problem using conditioners with the other brand.</li>
            <li> I am a little skeptical that there is something that isn&#x27;t Henna in this mix, because they color was so rich, but it wasn&#x27;t harsh or chemically.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was some bleeding for a few days in the the next few showers but nothing problematic.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I was unprepared because it was an orangey color when mixed, not the usual dark green of other hennas.  </li>
            <li> But i seen deeper red in brown henna so that doesnt mean anything.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed because I like the easy application.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also got uneven color as a result due to user error as I couldn&#x27;t tell if I was applying it well</li>
            <li> But this band will not give you color like whats on the box,if you have black hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff half expecting for this to be a disaster.</li>
            <li> Also, on black hair</li>
            <li> I have naturally black hair</li>
            <li> NO boiling water, NO p.i.t.a. mess like the typical henna or coloring.</li>
            <li> I had to use conditioner b/c of the mess it gave me.</li>
            <li> Makes a Mess.</li>
            <li> but if you have thick long hair I would say use 2 packs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I did a little research and found that this is a typical side effect for henna dyes.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every 2-3 days and have thick hair past my shoulders, this was enough for it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although it may have a little, you need to keep in mind the cons of using it....</li>
            <li> I saw the little barks.  </li>
            <li> I have never used henna before and was a little nervous.</li>
            <li> My roots were lighter than the rest of my hair, so my roots came out a little orange.</li>
            <li> The process is messy like with any dye job.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fade unevenly, like reds do.</li>
            <li> But thankfully it is not strong and does fade.</li>
            <li> Usually, it fades a little but not as drastic as this brand (henna hut).  </li>
            <li> I only left the clay on for about an hour or so, so for me it wasn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> I havechin length thick hair and half a package</li>
            <li> I was looking for something a little edgy.</li>
            <li> Normally my hair would have been all over that tub, but I was shocked at how little there was after I rinsed the henna out.</li>
            <li> regular hair dye doesn&#x27;t have to stay in as long as this product....very thick as well so very difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it bleeds excessively.  </li>
            <li> and I have hard water.</li>
            <li> The seller was also rude and insisted that I was a liar</li>
            <li> The company asks you to contact them before leaving negative feedback, but the phone number doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would expect the color to match or at least be complementary.</li>
            <li> At least it wasn&#x27;t damaging to my hair</li>
            <li> Anyhow, yes, this henna bleeds orange in the shower, like all henna does for at least a week.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick</li>
            <li> But, I had just as ridiculous an orange.</li>
            <li> I maybe could have dealt with that, but unfortunately within a few weeks the color started to wash out in patches and was GREEN!!</li>
            <li> white hairs on my chin are now orange - the orange like that crazy killer in Colorado!  </li>
            <li> I was Disappointed  my hair did not come out red as d product claim</li>
            <li> Wearing gloves , I applied like frosting a cake ( thick!)</li>
            <li> and Is so much healthier for your hair than putting those nasty chemicals in there.</li>
            <li> A trade off for the caustic chemicals.</li>
            <li> have no reason to write a bad review review about them other than my terrible experience, I have no other products to recommend.</li>
            <li> I was sorry about</li>
            <li> It turned my hair orange....very difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about trying henna, I had heard some horror stories about it turning your hair the wrong color and that it can&#x27;t be bleached out</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time washing this product out.  </li>
            <li> I also realized why the henna is so difficult to wash out...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, since I ran out of the henna</li>
            <li> Stayed longer than the amount of time it said, approximately 8 weeks!</li>
            <li> Sorry.. not a recommended product.  </li>
            <li> I recommend anyone considering them or even any random henna questions contact them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> but when I went to style my hair, it was dripping orange; since, I had been washing my hair until the water was cold, I decided to just fill the sink with water and dunk my hair in it.  </li>
            <li> A lot of the darker dyes contain \\&quot;indigo\\&quot; which is nearly impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> or I get sick of their colors.</li>
            <li> I am just disappointed with the fading and the color.</li>
            <li> I hate having orange fingernails and use gloves when washing the henna out.  </li>
            <li> Either way, I am going to finish the powder because I hate wasting money.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product and do not believe it should not be advertised as a beard dye.</li>
            <li> I do not let her use any nasty chemicals on her head.</li>
            <li> I have used those competitors&#x27; products and have gotten horrible results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells and feels awful when you go to apply it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am an experienced Henna Head, having used so many kinds of henna for over 25 years ( interspersed with dye episodes) . I always return to the earthy green henna, which makes my hair always fuller with great red highlights.&lt;br /&gt;So this brand is unique to me in that it has a clay type ingredient added, so when mixed with water it makes a paste that adheres well to the hair. Easy to mix as the directions said, with tap water.&lt;br /&gt; I was unprepared because it was an orangey color when mixed, not the usual dark green of other hennas.  Wearing gloves , I applied like frosting a cake ( thick!) to small sections, piling each coated section on top of my head, and going around my head until all my hair was covered.&lt;br /&gt; I left it on an hour and rinsed with tons of conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;There was some bleeding for a few days in the the next few showers but nothing problematic.&lt;br /&gt;Just like the directions said, the color did deepen the next few days and I am in awe of the deep cherry highlights ( on the ahem, gray hairs) which blend beautifully with the deeper cherry of my dark brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;One pack did my mid back length curly hair. but if you have thick long hair I would say use 2 packs.&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered the Mahogany because I want darker now.&lt;br /&gt;That is what I love about henna,  I can use it as often as I want and layer different henna colors over each other. It never hurts the hair and it is not a drastic change if you have dark hair, more like a translucent coating over your hair.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I was sorry about is the scent. It smells like clay when I prefer the grassy fresh scent of henna. This product does not smell like henna at all. But thankfully it is not strong and does fade.</li>
            <li> This is like many other henna&#x27;s,it does it&#x27;s job of making your hair stronger.But this band will not give you color like whats on the box,if you have black hair.It will color your skin red.I was hopeing it would give me alot more color,but I still like it.You can mix it and use it right away. Most henna&#x27;s say to mix and wait over night before using. But not with this brand,so if you&#x27;re in a hurry to get started,its the one to use.(use gloves)</li>
            <li> It came on time and as decribed. But i seen deeper red in brown henna so that doesnt mean anything. thought it would come out deeper since i have had henna for two years ..but it didnt. Burgundy was better and more vibrant.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my teenage daughter. I do not let her use any nasty chemicals on her head. This gives her a gorgeous shade that&#x27;s very shiny. After several months of use, the texture of her hair has become less fine and thicker feeling.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was possible to find a plant-based hair dye that is this dark and has this much coverage, but it does. I naturally have light blonde hair, and usually henna dyes just make it a little more reddish, or auburn at most. \\&quot;Deep Red\\&quot; Harvest Moon turns it a blood-red color. While the first ingredient is henna, it also contains indigo and red clay as primary ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is all plant based, and there is no chemical smell. The paste goes on easily and smoothly with easy coverage and conditions the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they say the paste will dye your hands, they are not kidding. Having worked with apparently more benign henna pastes, I did not heed this warning, and instantly had red hands. Make sure you wear gloves and be careful during the application process to avoid your neck, face and shoulders.</li>
            <li> I work with poop and that was what I thought I was putting in my hair. It turned my hair orange....very difficult to work with. regular hair dye doesn&#x27;t have to stay in as long as this product....very thick as well so very difficult to apply. made my hair almost into dred locks while trying to massage the product into my hair and scalp. And had to wait for 18-24 hours to wash it.....I had to use conditioner b/c of the mess it gave me. On a positive note it smelt like tea. you know the kind that is sold in stores that looks like leaves off the forest ground.</li>
            <li> I have medium-to-dark brown hair and I&#x27;ve always wanted to dye my hair red, but in order to go any lighter, I&#x27;ve been told that I would probably have to bleach my hair first. That is NOT happening. So I tried this henna hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions were easy to follow (it&#x27;s quite like using/applying a box of color dye from the drug store), just mix to the right consistency and apply thoroughly to your hair and let it sit for a certain amount of time. The first time you rinse out the henna hair dye is a little freaky. The color is extremely potent and it looks like you&#x27;re rinsing paint out of your hair. I rinsed out my hair in the shower and it took a good 20 minutes before the water began to run clear(ish) again. Also, use an old towel to dry your hair after this step as the henna color from your hair WILL seep into (and stain) fabric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I dried my hair, the color was absolutely GORGEOUS. I never thought I could attain a color so bright and rich and beautiful! And it didn&#x27;t damage the texture of my hair. It actually improved it! It lasted much longer than I thought it would (a few months). The only complaint I had was that my hair never rinsed completely clean for at least two months. I haven&#x27;t read of anyone else having this problem, so it might just be me. But the color is beautiful and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff half expecting for this to be a disaster.I was pleasantly surprised.the only things i added was a cap full of lemon juice and paprika.After i applied the mixture i sat in the sun for 30 minutes.i absolutley LOVE the color.the only complaint i had was its messy.this is well worth the money and Is so much healthier for your hair than putting those nasty chemicals in there.</li>
            <li> I have been using Red henna for years. This time, I wanted to try the dark red. It came out a beautiful dark red, that sparkles in the sunlight. I was worried my hair would turn out burgundy, but it did not. My natural color is medium brown. I had been using the Red dye for a while, so when I put on the Dark Red, my hair was already red. This brand of Henna, is the only one that lasts and doesn&#x27;t wash out quickly. Well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a darker red color, leave it on for 2 to 3 hours. It will give you a deep red, rich color.</li>
            <li> For some reason this henna did not take to my hair very well because it turned it very bright and orange/ gold with red undertones, but only because my hair was already red to begin with. Luckily it washed out after about 3 shampoos.</li>
            <li> After 12+ years of wrecking my hair with chemical dyes of many varieties (chosen by stylists or by me for the shade instead of by brand or other gimmicks) I noticed that my hair was starting to get a \\&quot;fried\\&quot; texture to it and my luscious, naturally thick locks were beginning to get unmanageably coarse and too easily tangled. I tried many different conditioners which would always lose effectiveness after a short period and then I decided to 1) put away the straightening iron and 2) stop using chemical dyes. Not ironing definitely helped, but switching to henna made an amazing difference. The application of the henna is a little on the gross side, but it was easy enough, and it smelled like warm chamomile tea as opposed to the caustic chemical + perfume smell of regular dyes. Being a veteran hair dyer, I will say that its after effects are nearly identical to chemical permanent dyes (sans hair damage). Yes, it does bleed for a week or two when it&#x27;s wet. Any red permanent dye will do this. Yes, its color does fade over time. I found its degree of fading to be identical in amount to that of chemical dyes, and actually thought it faded a little slower for me than most red dyes do, although (as I said) the henna settled ultimately at a similarly lighter, less chromatic shade as with other dyes. It is still obviously red and nice looking about 6 weeks later. I love love love this product. I will never use anything else unless this company goes out of business or I get sick of their colors.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. I mixed red/orange with the deep red henna and left it on one hour. Covers gray beautifully and lasts and lasts and lasts. Received many compliments on the great color.  Can&#x27;t wait to try the burgundy.</li>
            <li> I loved this product, it was easy to use and i could use it while pregnant and turned out great. I cant wait to use it again.</li>
            <li> **SEE COMMENTS &amp; PHOTO I POSTED**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this with the impression it would improve the luster of my hair. Although it may have a little, you need to keep in mind the cons of using it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair ended up nearly black with none of the promised red undertones. I maybe could have dealt with that, but unfortunately within a few weeks the color started to wash out in patches and was GREEN!! So in my attempt to lift some of the color, I bleached it and I was left with a head full of BLUE hair. I had never heard of anyone having blue hair after bleaching. I was baffled. I did a little research and found that this is a typical side effect for henna dyes. A lot of the darker dyes contain \\&quot;indigo\\&quot; which is nearly impossible to remove. So... I&#x27;m stuck with this blue undertone in my hair no matter how many times I cover it.  They should definitely explain that somewhere or place a warning! The seller was also rude and insisted that I was a liar &amp; she had a video of herself going blonde. However, you can try going to the link and it did not direct you to anything&lt;br /&gt;It only redirects you to the homepage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Also, beware...I truly believe the seller uses personal and fake accounts to create positive reviews, add pictures, and argue with customers who tell the truth about their product.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no reason to write a bad review review about them other than my terrible experience, I have no other products to recommend. I will gain nothing from this review but the ability to vent. I only want to warn you about the indigo in some natural dyes, just beware &amp; do your research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself the embarrassment.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about trying henna, I had heard some horror stories about it turning your hair the wrong color and that it can&#x27;t be bleached out but I bit the bullet and tried it anyway. It smelled funny and felt like mud in my hair but it rinsed out easily and the color was better than I expected and my hair was silky and manageable. The color lasted and despite my hairdresser&#x27;s warning  against henna dye, the next time I got color in my hair at the salon it turned out just as I wanted.</li>
            <li> I really like this Henna because it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair like chemical dyes have done over the years, in one use I could tell my hair looked and felt healthier. I&#x27;ve been using hair dye for 10 years and it&#x27;s taken a tole on my hair and made it extremely dry but this product is amazing. I decided I would stop using chemicals on my hair and begin using natural products and this turned out beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have golden blonde hair this will make it a orangey red color and after a few days it will bleed and fade a little becoming a light orange. I enjoy the orange color on myself it looks great and brings out my brown eyes but I bought this because I wanted red hair thus i&#x27;ll need to reapply it again in a few weeks to achieve my desired color. Also, on black hair it&#x27;s hardly noticeable if at all noticeable, the deep red color works best on light brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am very glad I decided to buy this. I&#x27;ll never use chemical dyes again. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have used Henna many times to help strengthen my hair and give a nice red color.  I have used the jamila brand and the brand from Mehandi.  I decided to check out this brand since it is cheaper than Mehandi.  First, for those who are looking for 100% Henna with no additives this is not it.  That didn&#x27;t bother me  much since the additional products are healing to the scalp, and has cleaning properties.  I found it interesting how strong the color was on my hair, usually with all the other Hennas, the color was not as bright.  However, the color quickly fades; which is not the case with the other brands I have used.  Usually, it fades a little but not as drastic as this brand (henna hut).  Additionally, it bleeds excessively.  I had a difficult time washing this product out.  I hate having orange fingernails and use gloves when washing the henna out.  With the regimen I use with other hennas I can get the henna out and have a nice color without orange fingernails.  Unfortunately, not with this brand.  Since I have to take the gloves off to style my hair out of the tub, the orange fingernails cannot be avoided.  I also realized why the henna is so difficult to wash out...that is because the powder needs to be sifted.  I had washed my hair several times and the water seemed clear but when I went to style my hair, it was dripping orange; since, I had been washing my hair until the water was cold, I decided to just fill the sink with water and dunk my hair in it.  Too my amazement I saw the little barks.  Either way, I am going to finish the powder because I hate wasting money.  I am going to use it as a henna gloss instead to help reduce the wash time and hopefully keep the color fresh.  After I finish this product I am going to try another Henna offered by Henna sooq.  If that doesn&#x27;t work then I am going back to Mehandi.  Jamila is also good but I just do not remember where I bought it.</li>
            <li> I might have to upload a video review later on because I actually videoed the process of using this product on my hair. I was tired of paying high prices to fry my hair only to have the color fade away. Also, my convenient next door neighbor stylist is moving so I wanted to see if this was something I could do on my own. First, my hair had been chemically colored about a month before I used the henna. I purchased the Deep Red color. I was looking for something a little edgy. My hair&#x27;s natural color is just plain brown. But I had colored it a reddish burgundy color the month before. So at the time of the henna process, it was a faded red... Kind of a light auburn color. Also, I had some lighter streaks where we had done red highlights and she had to bleach the streaks to get the red to take.  The first week, I had this amazing deep red that was the exact same color as the picture on the site. It did bleed for about 2 weeks but so far nothing is ruined. I made sure and used dark towels and old towels just in case it stained, but it didn&#x27;t. Even the shirt I wore when I did the henna isn&#x27;t stained.  Anyway, the process of putting it on was kind of messy and the washout process was LONG but I have loved the results. I have to say that the color was great until about 3 days ago. My hair is thick and course so I had started using a leave in conditioner and noticed my color fading away. I read today that using leave ins can do that. So I won&#x27;t be doing that again! One thing I like is that I am not losing near the amount of hair I used to! That was evident during the washout process. Normally my hair would have been all over that tub, but I was shocked at how little there was after I rinsed the henna out. My hair is healthy and thick and I love the color. I especially love that it was all natural and not harmful to my hair! I now want to see if I can order the regular red color and mix the rest of the deep red in with that and see if I can get it redder and brighter.  I havechin length thick hair and half a package was perfect. Also, I mixed with warm tap water and half a lemon&#x27;s juice. I have been using L&#x27;Oreall sulfate free shampoo and conditioner that comes in the metallic pink containers.  The only reason I give this product a 4 star is because of the fading, but I am not sure if it was the leave in conditioner.  It&#x27;s got more of an orange hue to it now, especially the bleached places, and I really didn&#x27;t want orange hair. But the original color is stunning. I think I am going to try and do the color again in a couple of weeks. And the best thing is, you can do it over and over and it won&#x27;t harm your hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten alot of stares with this unique hair color. I was looking for natural ways to color my hair a vibrant red after all the bleaching my hair went through for platinum blonde. This was perfect.  It left my hair feeling clean and soft and undoubtedly red. Now that my hair has grown out of hte bleach portion, I still use it and it looks like a deep wine red on top of my medium brown hair.  The process is messy like with any dye job. Wear gloves or it will stain your hands orange instantly. Do not worry about it staining your scalp though. If you leave it on long enough it will but will also wash off after a couple of shampooing. Days afterward youll still see color runoff in the shower but after the first shampoonig, you wont see much fading in the actual color of your hair. Because the color runs after the first few washings, don&#x27;t use new white towels to dry your hair. For me it washes right out of clothing, but I wouldn&#x27;t chance it on something nice.  Another cool thing is it&#x27;s in powder form, meaning you can mix as little or as much as you like. 1 pouch lasts me months but I have short hair. I mix the powder with hot water and conditioner or vitamin E oil and leave it on anywhere from 30 min to overnight.   I love this product.</li>
            <li> This really covers my silver gray hair.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product and do not believe it should not be advertised as a beard dye. Tried calling the company&#x27;s customer service line but got a nonsensical recording about the number being out of service. The company asks you to contact them before leaving negative feedback, but the phone number doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The obvious purpose of a beard dye is to hide grey or white hairs. On a redhead, these hairs are predominantly white.&lt;br /&gt;I carefully followed directions and applied accordingly.  I even took note of, and was a bit apprehensive about, the warning that white hair may turn red, green or blue.  Following the application, I obviously had reason to be concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The white hairs on my chin are now orange - the orange like that crazy killer in Colorado!  My natural red hairs elsewhere on my beard were darkened a shade or two.  I would expect the color to match or at least be complementary. I note on the company&#x27;s website that they don&#x27;t show before and after pictures of their product being used on red or white hair.  Seems if you&#x27;re  going to advertise it as a beard dye that would only make sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT IF YOU ARE A REDHEAD OR USING AS BEARD DYE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a complete waste of money and time. I guess No Shave November isn&#x27;t going to lead into Don&#x27;t Shave December.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s., I welcome a response from the company here since your phone number isn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> It was a nice color but it lasted like 4 days. And every time your hair gets wet it WILL leak. My hair has faded and honestly I don&#x27;t like the color it left. At least it wasn&#x27;t damaging to my hair</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and I always come back to it. It gives your hair a true deep red color depending on how long you keep it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others complain that it bleeds. OF COURSE IT DOES! It&#x27;s hair dye!!! I&#x27;d like to see one hair dye that doesn&#x27;t (and I have used MANY).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this brand, besides the end result color is that it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a feeling that the reviews that are not from &amp;#34;amazon verified&amp;#34; purchasers are competitors. I have used those competitors&#x27; products and have gotten horrible results.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of pure henna for hair but since becoming a mother I don&#x27;t have the luxury of complex preparation and spending hours with smelly globs on my hair so I chose this product as the closest alternative because it&#x27;s easy to prepare (just add water) and it only takes 1 hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally used the red color, and although it looked good at first, I had trouble with the color bleeding every time I shower.  I stained several hotel towels from washing my hair 2 weeks after applying the product back then.  Over time the color faded from vibrant red to muted copper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I decided to try the deep red color.  It was also my first time doing the application all by myself.  I am not very good at doing things with my own hair so I ended up getting drip stains on my upper back, chest and shoulders which thankfully faded quickly.  I also got uneven color as a result due to user error as I couldn&#x27;t tell if I was applying it well but overall it still looks great.  I have black hair with grays, the gray hair looks a beautiful wine color and my entire hair glows a deep red in the sunlight.  I am very happy that I am not experiencing any bleeding so far at 3 days post application and I hope that it remains that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product, I just wish I could just bring it to a salon and have them apply it for even coverage.</li>
            <li> I love this color it is very messy but my hair is so soft and shiny!! I will never use chemical dyes again!</li>
            <li> Loved the results the first week, but most of the negative results are true- this henna bleeds every time the hair gets remotely wet.  Unfortunately, since I ran out of the henna and I lost my patience I cut off most of my hair.  The color was fantastic in the beginning, except it faded as much as the dye would drip onto my shoulders, my pillow case, etc. after a shower.  Be careful with it and have fun!</li>
            <li> Love this brand, have been using it for years. Works well and lasts a long time. My hair is super shiny and relaxed. Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Stayed longer than the amount of time it said, approximately 8 weeks! Even on my dark brown hair, this is the most resilient henna I&#x27;ve used. I wash my hair every 2-3 days and have thick hair past my shoulders, this was enough for it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared for it to stain your pillows for a couple of weeks,  especially if you go to sleep with wet hair. fortunately it comes out clean in the wash.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and will NOT use anything else ever again this dye is perfect for my hair whitch hates color and I have hard water.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite Henna I keep it at about 4 or 5 hours and I absolutely love it my hair is so vibrant with this henna it lasts a while I did not receive my last package and they sent it to me right away with a signature requirednot that I minded the customer service was awesomeI have dark brown hair even without the light you could tell my hair has red purplishsh hue and in the Sun the Sunit is that deep red I love it I get a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair 10 days ago. I loved the red that my hair got after using this product. So far it looks great! No itches, no dryness.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with Henna. I thought it was great that it wasn&#x27;t as labor intensive as some of the henna I researched ( and I researched a lot). I loved the color for about 3 days but then it started fading, and fading fast, it bled every time I washed it. It felt super dry right after I washed it out. It never achieved that \\&quot;deep red\\&quot; that it says I should get. It&#x27;s now kinda a faded coppery reddish brown. Not horrible, and it&#x27;s stopped fading, but it&#x27;s only been 3 weeks or so and honestly it doesn&#x27;t look anything like I had hoped. I will say that it dyed it evenly. I had damaged ends from years of bleaching and coloring with chemical dyes and it has helped a great deal with frizz and has relaxed the natural curl that I get in my hair. I am just disappointed with the fading and the color. SO if you are looking for a less intense henna color I guess this is good. I turned a friend on to it too since she is pregnant and doesn&#x27;t want to use chemical dyes, I turned her on to it because it was easy. She loves it, but she got the deep brown or something and she is still really happy with the color, it got rid of her grays and made her hair feel great. So it&#x27;s a hit or miss. I really wanted the intense red promised. I am fair skinned and brighter red looks good on me. I still won&#x27;t ever go back to chemical dyes. I would use this again if I couldn&#x27;t get anything else, I just know not to expect that really impressive deep red color.</li>
            <li> you MUST check out henna hut.. SO easy; easiest coloring I have ever done and it smells, feels divine. And, \\&quot;you know\\&quot; - it&#x27;s Henna! Here a one step process too. NO waiting, NO boiling water, NO p.i.t.a. mess like the typical henna or coloring. LOVE it. and they&#x27;re FAMILY OWNED with FANTASTIC customer service!  Colors came out fantastic too... See my pic - used Deep Red/Natural Henna mix.</li>
            <li> After 2 applications I have a nice \\&quot;Red\\&quot; color. I loved the results after 2 applications, but HATED that the color ran.  The color would run out of my hair EVERY SINGLE TIME that my hair got wet- whether it was from sweating after a run, taking a shower, or going to the lake.. EVery time, for over 6 months (Going on seven now, and it still runs)- my hair BLED the henna dye color.  I have never had this problem with pure henna, or any other \\&quot;natural hairdye\\&quot; that includes henna other than when using the Henna Hut products.  I brought it up with the company, and although I told them I stayed with the directions, and applied it to clean hair-  they still told me that the issue was my own, and not their product. I do not condition my hair, even though they kept telling me this was the issue. Not a company I would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told to try a different color in their \\&quot;natural dye\\&quot; line, and tried the burgundy with the exact same results.  I just don&#x27;t like this product line. Where is the fun in having to ruin all of your white shirts if your hair gets even remotely wet?  Sorry.. not a recommended product.  I ruined over $300 worth of clothes because this will not stop running out of my hair. I can&#x27;t wait for it to grow out, so I can chop it off.. It&#x27;s really a pain, and costly.</li>
            <li> I was Disappointed  my hair did not come out red as d product claim</li>
            <li> I am a little skeptical that there is something that isn&#x27;t Henna in this mix, because they color was so rich, but it wasn&#x27;t harsh or chemically. It also does bleed a little more than usual for Henna I have used in the past, but the color is much deeper, so it is a trade-off.</li>
            <li> The product was what to be expected from henna. I have naturally black hair so I didn&#x27;t expect a change in my hair color but rather a tint in the sun. But honestly, the tint it gave me is very much similar to the tint I received from using the regular henna dye. Hopefully after further applications the tint will become more noticeable. All in all its a great product and the customer service that henna hut has is beyond amazing! I recommend anyone considering them or even any random henna questions contact them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used henna off and on for years, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this particular henna. At first I was put off by the red-brown color of the powder -- fresh henna is supposed to be bright green -- but I gave it a shot. Since I am used to henna I was prepared for the mess, but a word to the wise with this particular brand: IT STAINS INSTANTLY. If it touches your skin even for a second it will leave a bright orange mark. So, tight fitting gloves and a long sleeve coverup are essential to working with this product. I left it on for over 2 hours under a plastic cap, since henna loves heat, and will stain darker the longer you leave it on. Had no problem washing it out: my tried and true process for getting henna bits out of your hair is to condition first, then shampoo, then condition again. (Make sure you use a gentle formula for color-treated hair to avoid stripping out the color.) I recommend using a lot of conditioner at this stage because henna is astringent and will make your hair feel dry, though it doesn&#x27;t do the damage that chemicals will. Anyhow, yes, this henna bleeds orange in the shower, like all henna does for at least a week. But when I dried my hair and looked in the mirror I actually said WOW. Deep, bright, rich auburn highlights where there once were grays, and a nice reddish cast to the rest of my naturally dark-brown hair. It hasn&#x27;t even been 24 hours yet so I know the color will develop more as well. Anyway, this product seems to deliver as promised but is definitely NOT for the henna newbie. Get a friend to help you if it&#x27;s your first time with this product, and take precautions to cover yourself and your work station first!</li>
            <li> I have never used henna before and was a little nervous. The reviews were mixed with positive and negative, but I thought I&#x27;d try it for myself. Overall I would use again and again. The smell is earthy, which I prefer over the strong chemical dyes which usually make me feel ill (I am a reactor to most chemical fumes so this was easy for me to use). The color I used is beautiful! It bled for a few days afterward, but the color remained just as pretty. I would use in on virgin hair to get the best results.</li>
            <li> Brand and product lived up to it&#x27;s expectations. Read a lot of reviews about different brands of Henna. Henna Hut seems to be legit and their product was cheaper through Amazon. Harvest Moon is pure and organic and great on my hair. Great color depth and accurate color guide. Will use this product many more times. Love the red color. You have to use Henna several times for it to last longer in the hair and saturate and bind with the proteins in the hair. Any red dye is hard to keep strong and vibrant. Had used chemical dyes for the past 2+ years and my hair was starting to show the effects of chemical dyes. This Henna red seemed to last longer than regular red chemical dyes, despite the dry and chemically processed condition of my hair. Just working on building up the color - you can use this henna as many times/as often as you want without hurting your hair. Love the look of red hair using Henna. Response from a co-worker when I walked outside in the sunlight: &amp;#34;Holy sh**!! It looks like your hair is on fire!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dyed my hair red a number of times for a number of years, now. For a long while friends who also dye their hair red suggested henna. I did not do nearly as much research as I should have before actually using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells and feels awful when you go to apply it. It was gross. A trade off for the caustic chemicals. My roots were lighter than the rest of my hair, so my roots came out a little orange. After a few days and washing with clarifying shampoo and it was fine, but had I known I would&#x27;ve dyed it on a Friday and washed it over the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first week, after it settled, the color was nice. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. The red was very pretty. It didn&#x27;t fade unevenly, like reds do. But know that its unlikely you&#x27;ll be able to do anything else with your hair after using Henna. Its a stain. And it stays. So prepared. I only left the clay on for about an hour or so, so for me it wasn&#x27;t as bad. After a couple months of washing it with clarifying shampoos, I was able to re-do my hair with a traditional permanent dye. Which I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henna is not for everyone. I get why some people use it. I tried it, and thankfully it wasn&#x27;t an irreversible choice, but I wont be doing it again.</li>
            <li> I ordered deep red and upon application, the paste indeed dried a deep red. I followed the directions exactly, and when I rinsed, I ended up with the most goofy looking orange beard imaginable. I waited till the next day, again patiently following the directions. But, I had just as ridiculous an orange. What&#x27;s more, the brown I also ordered didn&#x27;t budge it when I tried to go over it. I ended up having to shave off my beard for the first time in over twenty years!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Dyes fast and great color. I used burgundy! Exactly what I wanted! It does bleed when wet..nothing I can&#x27;t handle😉</li>
            <li> I love this henna! It is easy to mix and apply. I have brown/black hair with 30% of white/grey. I add a tsp of salt and a tbs of apple cider and my grey/white are gone. On my white I get a deep red color, nothing like the orangish I use to have with the other kind of henna. Next time I want to try brown. Love this brand!</li>
            <li> I did two sets of these, I have 1b hair and the color does not show unless im under direct light, besides that a WASTE of money unless your looking for auburn instead of RED .</li>
            <li> I bought the henna dye because I didn&#x27;t want to keep damaging my hair with th normal hair dyes. I bought it thinking it was going to be a pretty auburn color. nope. my hair came out BRIGHT red and it looked absolutely ridiculous. I would not buy this color again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but it was very good to my hair. just like it said, it took away my split ends and made my hair silky soft and very shiny. i would most definitely buy it again but it a different color.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by the easy preparation and application of this product. I did exactly what the directions stated and my hair was a crazy bright red at first, but then deepened to a nice deep red, but it has faded a great deal since then. It has been a couple of months and it hasn&#x27;t stopped bleeding when I wash my hair (I have ruined clothing due to this). They say this is my fault because I should not condition nor use a leave-in conditioner and I should wash my hair daily. I cannot wash my hair everyday because it is very curly and would turn to straw if I did. I HAVE to use a conditioner AND a leave-in conditioner due to the texture of my hair. I have used another popular henna brand in the past and it did not bleed nor fade as bad as this brand. I had no problem using conditioners with the other brand. I bought 3 packages of Henna Hut brand and only had to use one and now I don&#x27;t want to use it again. I am going to sell mine and go with another brand. I am so disappointed because I like the easy application.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it an extra star because it was a very pretty color in the beginning, but I would not reccomend using this product.</li>
            <li> Best and easiest to use Henna I&#x27;ve used. Everyone comments on the color and wonders how I did it.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Makes a Mess.Color is Nice But it faded and washed out to orange in just a week</li>
            <li> I have been using Henna on my hair for 10+ years.  I had always bought from Tap Dancing Lizard from their personal website.  Being a now full time student wanted to see if I could find henna at a cheaper price.  I bought both the burgundy and deep red.  I love the color that I got when I mixed the colors.  It is a beautiful deep red color.  The only problem that I have is that my scalp itched after using this henna for a solid 2 weeks.  Also the color is still running.  If it gets warm at night and I sweat at all the color is on my pillows the next morning. I can also only use dark towels because every hair-wash more color comes out.  I have never encountered this in my 10+ years. I will be going back to the more expensive henna at the other website.  I love henna and will never go back to chemical dyes, but just be careful with this dye since it seems to not stick well.</li>
