            <li> This has improved the condition of my scalp as far as dryness goes.  I can see a reduction in the amount of dandruff I have and my scalp doesn&#x27;t feel so dry.  It took a little while using the product to get this result, but now that I have been using it a while, it works nicely.  I would recommend to anyone who has dry scalp, this does help.</li>
            <li> This is what i wanted.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to shampoo for a dry, itchy scalp. I don&#x27;t have dandruff, but my scalp gets very dry, especially in winter.  This stuff leaves my hair soft and moisturized. I only use it once or twice a week, though, or it will start making your hair greasy at the roots.</li>
            <li> thank god. hydrating. my hair was falling out with the skin.  Now, with this shampoo, less-so. happy happy happy happy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with Head &amp; Shoulders products before, but this one did not work for me.  First time, I thought I must not have rinsed my hair enough.  Washed again that evening and made sure to rinse, rinse, rinse.  Blew it dry; it was worse the second time.  Not at ends, just at crown.  Scalp feels fine, ends feel fine, but my hair looked greasy on top, apparently due to some kind of residue.  Fingers had slicky feel after rubbing the affected strands.  Unhappy to wash my hair and see it looking dirtier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what the problem was.  Sounds like it may work well for others.  Not a good match for me.  I don&#x27;t usually use combined shampoo/conditioner products, so maybe this 2-in-1 doesn&#x27;t compete well against my regular shampoo-only selections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy again. (This was purchased locally)</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and it helps with my dry scalp as well as not drying out my hair.  It also has a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I have over 30 shampoos in a box. This is the one that&#x27;s on my shelf in shower, on my 3rd bottle. Hope they never change the formula.</li>
            <li> yes. Excellent for dry, itchy scalp.  recommend it.</li>
            <li> Every winter I seem to get dandruff. I tried the 2 in 1 with almond oil. I noticed right off the bat that it did not give a nice lather. I left it on my hair for 5 minutes and rinsed. As I was blow drying my hair I noticed the hair on my crown had a waxy sticky feeling to it. It didn&#x27;t have the clean &amp;#34;bounce&amp;#34; my other shampoo gave me. I noticed the label said to &amp;#34;shake&amp;#34; so I washed my hair again thinking I need to shake the bottle to mix the shampoo. Again, as I was blow drying my hair it still had the waxy sticky residue. I will never use this shampoo again. I would rather live with a few flakes than look like my hair was unwashed even though it is. Not a happy consumer.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used many varieties of head and shoulders and this one is the best by far. to me, the key ingredient is the almond oil. my hair feels clean, but not stripped bare like other varieties. really fixes my dry scalp issues, too.</li>
            <li> My hair usually stays very very dry and i would hav to wash it or oil it multiple times a week.  i started using this and for the first time in since i can remember it keeps my scalp moisturized for over a week without any itching or flakes.</li>
            <li> Ordered it for my bf and it works wonders. One time he ran out and the drandruff came back instantly, its the best thing that keeps that drandruff away...</li>
            <li> HUGE bottle. Family sized with a great pump! Good addition to our busy bathroom.</li>
            <li> We used Head &amp; Shoulders Shampoo each time and like to see big volume for so nice price there... it&#x27;s slightly cheaper than in usual bricks and mortar store.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. It&#x27;s working better than Shiseido Moist for me. I had dry scalp which always made me scratch my scalp. After using this product, I appearently not scratch my scalp that much.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li> This worked really well to remove dandruff.  It took about 16 days and 9 washes before it was completely gone but it has worked very well and I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.  The bottle has a awesome pump that gives you a good handful to lather your hair with.</li>
            <li> My hair always itch real bad and I switch to head and shoulders and it help with my dry scalp and the itching has went away I&#x27;m so happy for head and shoulders</li>
            <li> It works well and doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as some others. I couldn&#x27;t find this size with a pump localy.</li>
            <li> I keep this in stock! My man uses this stuff like he uses toilet paper, he lives by it, he loves it! Keeps his scalp feeling great and hydrated! He will not use other product!!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the worst I have ever purchased.  It has left my hair with a residue that I&#x27;ve tried washing out for two days in a row with another product.  My hair looked better with a few flakes.  Now it looks like it hasn&#x27;t been washed in a week for the third day in a row.  This is the worst hair product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because he has a little issue with dandruff. It works great for his dandruff and has a really good smell.</li>
            <li> I have had a dry scalp for as long as I can remember. Thanks to an Aunt who is a hair dresser I had access to salon quality shampoo at a reasonable price. Unfortunately they stopped making that specific product and I was forced to find an alternative. I tried the regular Head &amp; Shoulders and it worked great to my surprise. My wife prefers the smell of this specific shampoo so I gave it a try and I have no complaints. It does what it says and its a reasonable price. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have a pool and very long curly hair. I hate taking forever washing my hair. I&#x27;m not high maintenance, but this shampoo makes me look like I might be.</li>
