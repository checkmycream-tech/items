            <li> I have average size and it fits exactly right, any bigger</li>
            <li> Took several months to be delivered, I had actually forgot about it it was so long.</li>
            <li> It does run a bit small so if you have large wrists beware.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just see how long it last.</li>
            <li> This item arrived much later than I would have expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waiting game, seeing it comes from China via usps, but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.......</li>
            <li> turns your arm green..</li>
            <li> Turned my wrist green.</li>
            <li> Too small</li>
            <li> and I have fairly small wrists.</li>
            <li> and it would be too small.</li>
            <li> Very small, my wrist is not huge and this item is very tight.</li>
            <li> two Konov bracelets bought and two DUDS received ... there is no quality to be had here, NO MORE for me!</li>
            <li> Not happy!!</li>
            <li> The item  came with a very terrible hook design and kept falling of my wrist, I&#x27;m not sure that design was tested before selling</li>

            <li> Looks resl good, only issue is it is hard to clasp with one hand.</li>
            <li> Too small and I have fairly small wrists. Made for kids.</li>

            <li> Very small, my wrist is not huge and this item is very tight.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.......</li>
            <li> Product is quite deceiving. It looks far better in photo than the actual bracelet. It is cheap in appearance and poorly made. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Took several months to be delivered, I had actually forgot about it it was so long. The quality is very cheap. Not happy!!</li>
            <li> The best part of this bracelet is the photo. After that it was all downhill in my case. It literally FELL APART on the first day. Inferior glue job. I have learned my lesson ... two Konov bracelets bought and two DUDS received ... there is no quality to be had here, NO MORE for me!</li>
            <li> turns your arm green..</li>
            <li> Not the Cross I Saw in the picture. Did not receive what I Thought I was Getting. I Like to get what I order !</li>
            <li> The item  came with a very terrible hook design and kept falling of my wrist, I&#x27;m not sure that design was tested before selling, i guess that&#x27;s why the hook was not displayed in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;What can be done?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a long time to wait, but it&#x27;s worth it. Good quality product. I like it</li>
            <li> run small.cheap quality.mine came broke.i will not buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This item arrived much later than I would have expected. Frankly, I had forgotten I had ordered it! It is absolutely beautiful! Fits perfectly. I love the way it hooks. Much better quality than I expected.</li>
            <li> Impressive....for now. Let&#x27;s just see how long it last.</li>
            <li> best gift ever, my son loved it...</li>
            <li> hopefully this will arrive by tomorrow. fingers crossed!</li>

            <li> Daughter love it thanks</li>
            <li> Finally got it after one month</li>
            <li> Turned my wrist green. Pass!</li>
            <li> Great 4 the price. Looks much more expensive.</li>
            <li> price was excellent, but the cross was the iron cross, not the one on the picture, however satisfied.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. This is one of my favorite bracelets but it is chrome covered copper, so it&#x27;ll easily corrode away leaving you with green streaks</li>
