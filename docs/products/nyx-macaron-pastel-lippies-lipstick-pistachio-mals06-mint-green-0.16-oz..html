            <li>this is the best lipstick that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>These lipsticks can vary a great deal in opacity and consistency depending on the color.</li>
            <li>What a great and inexpensive way to experiment with the trend.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend this lipstick to anyone looking for a great product</li>
            <li>Great color and smooth lipstick!</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this lipstick!</li>
            <li>I purchased it for a makeup contest I am entering, and the color was perfect and exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping! !!!!</li>
            <li>It applies very smoothly and has a gorgeous and creamy texture.</li>
            <li>In love with the color so bright</li>
            <li>Also makes a nice ombré effect when you mix with a contrasting shade</li>
            <li>Gorgeous color but need a primer to help it stay on better</li>
            <li>The makeup came fast and in perfect condition and was of exceptional quality (smooth, good color, buildable, etc.)</li>
            <li>It also has that sweet vanilla smell, like most good lipsticks, which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li>Works well with eye shadow put on top of it as well.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this color..</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>but I love it</li>
            <li>I do love this color, although I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s my favorite,</li>
            <li>This is such a good buy!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really call this shade pistachio, it is more of a seafoamy/minty kind of blue/green.</li>
            <li>They are well made and easy to use and reasonably priced!!!</li>
            <li>Though, I do recommend this to anyone who wants a pair of bold, bright lips.</li>
            <li>so it is not sheer, but it&#x27;s a great brand out there to get non-natural colored lipsticks.</li>
            <li>I also had to add a layer or two of it (for that smooth, crease free look) on when I tested it.</li>
            <li>This particular color \\&quot;Pistachio\\&quot; is amazing.</li>
            <li>Applies easy and came quickly.</li>
            <li>The colors are just as described, they stand out, unique, &amp; stays on.</li>
            <li>The lipstick is really creamy, which is good for your lips not drying out, but to the point that it might smear easily, so I would recommend matching lip liner to go with it, or just a clear one.</li>
            <li>Definitely has a bright color.</li>
            <li>Had to reapply every hour, got better as the day went on, didn&#x27;t have to do it as much.</li>
            <li>It provides full opaque color coverage.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty color.</li>
            <li>and is so much fun to wear.</li>
            <li>goes on so so so smoothly and the color is extremely vivid!</li>
            <li>It is very creamy and true to color, even without a primer.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast (earlier than the stated date and time), and I couldn&#x27;t have been more excited.</li>
            <li>Its this lovely blue free color, you could call it mint, light teal, robin egg blue.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s review: Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This color was the one that I was dying to try since these first came out.</li>
            <li>I hope that NYX comes out with more colors in the future!</li>
            <li>But with this one, I don&#x27;t have to reapply as much for some reason!</li>
            <li>but this is very high quality lipstick</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I finally got my little paws on this.</li>
            <li>I really wanted teal lipstick.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very oily and you have to apply a lot</li>
            <li>The color was a bit more teal than expected</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really go on your lips like the picture</li>
            <li>I have several shades of the macaron lippies and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Such a unique color</li>
            <li>This color is bold, yet cooled off at the same time.</li>
            <li>A little more teal than mint colored.</li>
            <li>I paired it with a green eyeliner which I used as a lipliner and it came up much more like the color in the picture.</li>
            <li>Super creamy so it doesn&#x27;t dry or crack either.</li>
            <li>(Maybelline makes a clear one I am going to try.)</li>
            <li>Note that you will have to reapply frequently with all NYX colors, they&#x27;re under $10</li>
            <li>it looks more blue than green on my lips</li>
            <li>Definitely has a slightly blue undertone and is not quite as green as pictured BUT with that being said it is still a beautiful lipstick and the color is very long lasting.</li>
            <li>I like it, but it is not at all mint green, it is light blue.</li>

            <li> I was shocked at how wearable this color actually is.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend for all my fellow weird lippie lovers out there!</li>
            <li> this disappointed me..</li>

            <li> Too green on me but I mix it with other colors to tone it down. Also makes a nice ombré effect when you mix with a contrasting shade</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s review: Exactly what I wanted. The colors are just as described, they stand out, unique, &amp; stays on.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick! Great price and is so much fun to wear. Such a unique color</li>

            <li> goes on so so so smoothly and the color is extremely vivid!</li>
            <li> My daughter  did not have this specific color  and this product is not  tested on ANIMALS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 4 stars only because it&#x27;s not really mint green. It&#x27;s still badass though.</li>
            <li> In love with the color so bright</li>
            <li> Very pretty color. A little more teal than mint colored. Works well with eye shadow put on top of it as well.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it is not at all mint green, it is light blue.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this color..as with the other matte nyx lippie i bought this disappointed me..the color looks like dried toothpaste on my lips and i had to reapply three times in a half hour..</li>

            <li> Beautiful color!! Its this lovely blue free color, you could call it mint, light teal, robin egg blue. It&#x27;s hard to describe but I love it. Applies easy and came quickly. The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is that you have to reapply often because you can see the creases in your lips after a while. Had to reapply every hour, got better as the day went on, didn&#x27;t have to do it as much. Not a big deal to me but it might be for others.</li>
            <li> Great!!! I like NYX products!!! They are well made and easy to use and reasonably priced!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely has a slightly blue undertone and is not quite as green as pictured BUT with that being said it is still a beautiful lipstick and the color is very long lasting. Super creamy so it doesn&#x27;t dry or crack either. I paired it with a green eyeliner which I used as a lipliner and it came up much more like the color in the picture.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. Definitely has a bright color. Doesn&#x27;t stay as long as I hoped it would though.</li>
            <li> This is such a good buy! Decided to buy on Amazon since it would be cheaper to buy on here rather than the site because of shipping fees. The makeup came fast and in perfect condition and was of exceptional quality (smooth, good color, buildable, etc.)</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I finally got my little paws on this. They had been sold out everywhere for awhile. This color was the one that I was dying to try since these first came out. These lipsticks can vary a great deal in opacity and consistency depending on the color. This particular color \\&quot;Pistachio\\&quot; is amazing. It applies very smoothly and has a gorgeous and creamy texture. It provides full opaque color coverage.  I was shocked at how wearable this color actually is.  I wouldn&#x27;t really call this shade pistachio, it is more of a seafoamy/minty kind of blue/green. I tried it on without a lipliner but I definitely think it would benefit from one (Maybelline makes a clear one I am going to try.) I have several shades of the macaron lippies and this one is by far my favorite. The retail price for these is about $6 which is far less expensive than other lipsticks of this type. What a great and inexpensive way to experiment with the trend. I hope that NYX comes out with more colors in the future!</li>
            <li> The color was a bit more teal than expected</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really go on your lips like the picture</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color but need a primer to help it stay on better but I love it</li>
            <li> Great color and smooth lipstick!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! !!!! Thank you. Excellent product!!!!</li>
            <li> The fourth addition to my NYX collection, and they never disappoint me! This color is bold, yet cooled off at the same time. Creamy application. Note that you will have to reapply frequently with all NYX colors, they&#x27;re under $10 so what did you expect? But with this one, I don&#x27;t have to reapply as much for some reason! I do love this color, although I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s my favorite, I don&#x27;t at all regret buying it! Would recommend for all my fellow weird lippie lovers out there!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this lipstick! The shipping was fast (earlier than the stated date and time), and I couldn&#x27;t have been more excited. It also has that sweet vanilla smell, like most good lipsticks, which is a plus for me. There are a few setbacks though.

I also had to add a layer or two of it (for that smooth, crease free look) on when I tested it. Though, I do recommend this to anyone who wants a pair of bold, bright lips.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t your everyday color lipstick. I purchased it for a makeup contest I am entering, and the color was perfect and exactly as shown. The product itself is well packaged. It is very creamy and true to color, even without a primer. This is definitely a lipstick every girl needs in her arsenal.</li>
            <li> this is the best lipstick that I have ever owned. it looks more blue than green on my lips but this is very high quality lipstick and I would recommend this lipstick to anyone looking for a great product</li>
