            <li>This is a great learning tool and taste is pretty good.</li>
            <li>However, it is nice to have some safe tooth paste to go along with it.</li>
            <li>so I will take it :)</li>
            <li>My girls love this</li>
            <li>what more can i say.</li>
            <li>She hasn&#x27;t mastered spitting yet, so I&#x27;m glad to have a toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t contain fluoride.</li>
            <li>Kids love the toothpaste; no need to rinse.  </li>
            <li>but you know...kids :))</li>
            <li>I love that this toothpaste has no artifical colors or preservatives.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints :)</li>
            <li>My grandchidren love it.</li>
            <li>so much better.</li>
            <li>Just make sure</li>
            <li>well so I am glad about that.</li>
            <li>but really, let&#x27;s be honest</li>
            <li>Wonderful toothpaste, even for an older toddler who simply likes this flavor!</li>
            <li>Our daughter likes the taste and it is exactly what it says it is:baby toothpaste, safe to swallow.</li>
            <li>She seemed put off by it at first, but after about a week she is excited to brush her teeth!</li>
            <li>Sure makes training for brushing their teeth so much easier.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>so he won&#x27;t use half the tube in one brushing lol.  </li>
            <li>Kids seem to be more excited to get their teeth brushed when there is a familiar character on their toothpaste tube.  </li>
            <li>Products love to market it as naturally derived and it is</li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t seem to do the work to keep their breath fresh, I would brush their teeth n tongue and it still got a bit of smell, so I switch to Dora Colgate..</li>
            <li>she is more excited about eating the paste then trying to learn to properly spit it out.</li>
            <li>This works great for an infant and those first few teeth.  </li>
            <li>I brought these for my twin boys, but they didn&#x27;t like it very much.  </li>
            <li>Tastes good to the little guy</li>
            <li>now I make sure to get it deep in the bristles to make sure it is on there during the actual brushing.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found this because you are not allowed to use actual toothpaste until they know how to spit -</li>
            <li>First, I like that</li>
            <li>My kids have been using this for 2 years and are still ok with the same flavor.</li>
            <li>I used it for my first son, and now I ordered more for my second.  </li>
            <li>Not sure how good it tastes, but my toddler likes this and allows me to brush her teeth when we use &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s toothpaste without flouride - handy for those little ones who still haven&#x27;t quite grasped the concept of &#x27;not swallowing&#x27; and &#x27;spitting&#x27;.</li>
            <li>so it makes my job much easier.</li>
            <li>so it means that 3 tubes will suffice for the whole training.</li>
            <li>She is very picky about tastes , smells etc.</li>
            <li>Thanks to aquafresh, my son loves to brush his teeth twice a day.</li>
            <li>My toddler really likes this..........</li>
            <li>My baby loves the tooth brush so much.</li>
            <li>you know how much 3 is</li>
            <li>I always appreciate when other reviewers point out where to get products for a better price...</li>
            <li>I have given them other pricier strawberry flavors etc, but this is their favorite toothpaste and it has a better price than any of the other ones they like.</li>
            <li>My one year old son loves this toothpaste and opens his mouth willingly when I try to brush his teeth during bath time.</li>
            <li>Little one even enjoys brushing his teeth more.</li>
            <li>but then he got used and every time he eats a rice or any other sweet or savory, he wants to brush his teeth, so I have to thank you because I thought he would not like it, but today he loves brush your teeth ..</li>
            <li>the only negative is that the toothpaste does accumulate in the bristles of the brush over time so a good rinsing off of the brush will do.</li>
            <li>My 2 year old loves this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>I personally think it tastes funny, but he loves it.</li>
            <li>not sure how effective this is at actually CLEANING teeth, because my kid just eats it.  </li>
            <li>toddler toothpaste is the only thing mild enough that he will let me use it without hassle.)</li>
            <li>Of course I had to taste it before I gave it to my kid (18 month old)</li>
            <li>My 27month old uses it because she still swallows toothpaste..</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re always asking to brush their teeth, which really amounts to them biting on the toothbrushes until we &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; them with the actual brushing.  </li>
            <li>I use this because my son is too young to know how and when to spit out a fluoride touthpaste.</li>
            <li>My 18 month old loves it when i say \\&quot;let&#x27;s go brush your teeth!\\&quot; now.</li>
            <li>My kids do not like the Colgate flouride free toothpaste (they get mad and spit it out if I use it by mistake) and they love this one.  </li>
            <li>Its not super sweet</li>
            <li>I actually have to store the toothpaste up high</li>
            <li>I was looking for a toothpaste that would help transition my toddlers into flouride toothpaste (which can&#x27;t be swallowed), and I really like this one because it&#x27;s less sweet than a lot of the other options on the market.  </li>
            <li>My 2 year old loves this tooth paste and is constantly asking to brush her teeth.  </li>
            <li>It seems like they like it, but they also don&#x27;t like to swallow it as much as some of the other training toothpastes.</li>
            <li>My son got into the unopened toothpaste in storage and it would have made a mess but thanks to the seal, I was saved!</li>
            <li>Because this does not contain fluoride, it is not a long term solution for a child&#x27;s dental care.</li>
            <li>my son really likes the taste of this tooth paste and he lets me brush his teeth a little.</li>

            <li> My son lives this new toothpaste I bought him (prior brand had \\&quot;little</li>
            <li> I mean she like eating the past more then cleaning the teeth</li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;m not sure if this really has to do with the taste quality or just that a train isn&#x27;t on the tube.</li>
            <li> which seems like it could be such a long time.</li>
            <li> My 20 month old twins refuse to use any other toothpaste!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trainer toothpaste for a few weeks now on my one year old son.</li>
            <li> because after we got it we realized how long it&#x27;s going to take to use up.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is less expensive than some other toothpastes, such as the Thomas the Train toothpaste, but it is probably worth it to spend the extra money to buy the character toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> My 1 yr old loves the taste of this, which is damn important if you know what I mean!!!!  </li>
            <li> I guess this better than him refusing to brush because it tastes so bad</li>
            <li> but it does let me get the toothbrush in her mouth long enough to scrub all the surfaces, so at least there&#x27;s that.  </li>
            <li> I guess I can put the toothbrushes away as spares for when other kids stay with my son but the toothpaste was for my dog for his Christmas stocking.</li>
            <li> at first thought my baby kinda weird</li>
            <li> We stocked up on this for my son, as he&#x27;s just sprouting teeth, and used it previously on my daughter.  </li>
            <li> Not overwhelmingly sweet and</li>
            <li> I was unable to find a fluoride-less toothpaste on my local stores and for the price, speed and then receive 3 tubes was a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;Reading the instrucctions, you only have to put a small amount (less than the size of a rice bean)</li>
            <li> no complaints from the little one.</li>
            <li> Makes it easier for us when it comes to brushing her teeth everyday.</li>
            <li> No more pea sized paste in the brush-</li>
            <li> if it werent for this toothpaste, i&#x27;d have a hard time getting her to let me brush her teeth 2x a day.  </li>
            <li> It says 3-24months, which is sorta weird.</li>
            <li> Also, some kids aren&#x27;t as crazy about the taste of this toothpaste rather than the Thomas toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> (He has VERY bad teeth</li>

            <li> My toddler loves this toothpaste.  He is always asking to brush his teeth because of it so it makes my job much easier.</li>
            <li> I always appreciate when other reviewers point out where to get products for a better price... Just got 1 tube of this at Target for $2.19, for those of you who want it a bit cheaper and also don&#x27;t want to buy 3 tubes at once.</li>
            <li> My son lives this new toothpaste I bought him (prior brand had \\&quot;little bear\\&quot; on it). He is always trying to eat the paste before brushing. No more pea sized paste in the brush- now I make sure to get it deep in the bristles to make sure it is on there during the actual brushing. Kids! I guess this better than him refusing to brush because it tastes so bad so I will take it :)</li>
            <li> Item not as described. I was expecting 3 of the boxes pictured that have the tube inside. Instead I received 3 of the hanging style blister packs with a tube of toothpaste and a child&#x27;s toothbrush. I guess I can put the toothbrushes away as spares for when other kids stay with my son but the toothpaste was for my dog for his Christmas stocking. (He has VERY bad teeth and I can&#x27;t afford the vet bill to pull them and toddler toothpaste is the only thing mild enough that he will let me use it without hassle.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trainer toothpaste for a few weeks now on my one year old son. He likes the tastes and puts up no fuss when it&#x27;s time for brushing (although we are still working on getting him to stop biting the brush). I am so glad to have found this because you are not allowed to use actual toothpaste until they know how to spit - which seems like it could be such a long time. I feel like his teeth are not as grimy as they were prior to purchasing.</li>
            <li> My girls love this and I don&#x27;t have to worry about them swallowing it.  they like the flavor and it does the job.</li>
            <li> Purchased from Beauty_Products2day and the package came with 3 toothbrushes and 3 tubes of toothpaste. No complaints from my toddler.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste. My son loves the taste of it and has no problems at all while im brushing his teeth. He gets excited whenever he sees the toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> It took our daughter a couple of times to get used to the flavor.  She seemed put off by it at first, but after about a week she is excited to brush her teeth!</li>
            <li> They taste great, they clean well and my toddler loves eating it.. what more can i say.</li>
            <li> MY TODDLER LOVES TO BRUSH HER TEETH BC OF THE FLAVOR , SO I&#x27;M HAPPY, GOOD PRICING TO. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IF YOU HAVE TODDLERS</li>
            <li> my son really likes the taste of this tooth paste and he lets me brush his teeth a little. i use a tiny tooth brush but once the paste is sucked off he just plays with it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a toothpaste that would help transition my toddlers into flouride toothpaste (which can&#x27;t be swallowed), and I really like this one because it&#x27;s less sweet than a lot of the other options on the market.  It seems like they like it, but they also don&#x27;t like to swallow it as much as some of the other training toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Great choice. I was unable to find a fluoride-less toothpaste on my local stores and for the price, speed and then receive 3 tubes was a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;Reading the instrucctions, you only have to put a small amount (less than the size of a rice bean) so it means that 3 tubes will suffice for the whole training.</li>
            <li> Not sure how good it tastes, but my toddler likes this and allows me to brush her teeth when we use &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old loves this tooth paste and is constantly asking to brush her teeth.  She hasn&#x27;t mastered spitting yet, so I&#x27;m glad to have a toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t contain fluoride.</li>
            <li> Kids love the toothpaste; no need to rinse.  Perfect for toddlers.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old loves this toothpaste!  I like ordering it in bulk so I don&#x27;t always have to remember to get it at the store. I actually have to store the toothpaste up high so he won&#x27;t use half the tube in one brushing lol.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son so he could practice with toothpaste and learn not to swallow. This is a great learning tool and taste is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Even though my child never had any problem coming with me to  &amp;#34;teeth cleaning operation&amp;#34;. She is very picky about tastes , smells etc. It she liked it. I mean she like eating the past more then cleaning the teeth but you know...kids :))</li>
            <li> Thanks to aquafresh, my son loves to brush his teeth twice a day. It&#x27;s a good amount of paste inside the tube.  Besides I cannot find this brand in stores anywhere.</li>
            <li> Wonderful toothpaste, even for an older toddler who simply likes this flavor!</li>
            <li> My toddler really likes this..........I personally think it tastes funny, but he loves it. Good training toothpaste for toddlers. I wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> I like the toothpaste because the cap stays on the tube, as it is a flip cap rather than a screw on cap.  First, I like that I don&#x27;t lose the caps and second, I like that the cap doesn&#x27;t become a choking hazard.  This toothpaste is less expensive than some other toothpastes, such as the Thomas the Train toothpaste, but it is probably worth it to spend the extra money to buy the character toothpastes.  Kids seem to be more excited to get their teeth brushed when there is a familiar character on their toothpaste tube.  Also, some kids aren&#x27;t as crazy about the taste of this toothpaste rather than the Thomas toothpaste.  Again, I&#x27;m not sure if this really has to do with the taste quality or just that a train isn&#x27;t on the tube.</li>
            <li> My kids like it so it&#x27;s great. I like the flip cap. I also like that it comes sealed. My son got into the unopened toothpaste in storage and it would have made a mess but thanks to the seal, I was saved! I just wished it came in a bigger size than 1.5 oz.</li>
            <li> I love that this toothpaste has no artifical colors or preservatives. My kids have been using this for 2 years and are still ok with the same flavor. the only negative is that the toothpaste does accumulate in the bristles of the brush over time so a good rinsing off of the brush will do.</li>
            <li> at first thought my baby kinda weird but then he got used and every time he eats a rice or any other sweet or savory, he wants to brush his teeth, so I have to thank you because I thought he would not like it, but today he loves brush your teeth ..</li>
            <li> My kids do not like the Colgate flouride free toothpaste (they get mad and spit it out if I use it by mistake) and they love this one.  I have given them other pricier strawberry flavors etc, but this is their favorite toothpaste and it has a better price than any of the other ones they like.</li>
            <li> This works great for an infant and those first few teeth.  I used it for my first son, and now I ordered more for my second.  They both seem to like the taste and don&#x27;t mind brushing their teeth.</li>
            <li> Of course I had to taste it before I gave it to my kid (18 month old) and it&#x27;s not bad. Not overwhelmingly sweet and no complaints from the little one. Little one even enjoys brushing his teeth more.</li>
            <li> My son has been using this toothpaste as well as the Aquafresh Brush. He loves the taste of this toothpaste, and has no complaints. He loves to have his teeth brush. We started using this when he was 3 months and he is almost two.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints :) it&#x27;s toothpaste without flouride - handy for those little ones who still haven&#x27;t quite grasped the concept of &#x27;not swallowing&#x27; and &#x27;spitting&#x27;. It says 3-24months, which is sorta weird. My 27month old uses it because she still swallows toothpaste..</li>
            <li> My baby loves the tooth brush so much. However, it is nice to have some safe tooth paste to go along with it.</li>
            <li> Tastes good to the little guy</li>
            <li> My daughter likes this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Nice toothpaste - my daughter likes it. Its not super sweet and so I like it ! I like the fact it comes in a 3 pack.</li>
            <li> My grandchidren love it.</li>
            <li> If you read the ingredients youll see it has carageenan. Products love to market it as naturally derived and it is but it is converted into a toxin when digested. So no I will not give this to my daughter who cant spit it out yet</li>
            <li> We stocked up on this for my son, as he&#x27;s just sprouting teeth, and used it previously on my daughter.  Both kids love it, and I think it smells deliciously yummy too.  Sure makes training for brushing their teeth so much easier.  Great stuff - great buy.</li>
            <li> Our daughters love this!  They&#x27;re always asking to brush their teeth, which really amounts to them biting on the toothbrushes until we &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; them with the actual brushing.  Knowing that the product is safe to swallow and that teeth brushing time isn&#x27;t a battle we need to worry about, puts our mind at ease!  We give this our 8 thumbs up award!</li>
            <li> I brought these for my twin boys, but they didn&#x27;t like it very much.  Also it doesn&#x27;t seem to do the work to keep their breath fresh, I would brush their teeth n tongue and it still got a bit of smell, so I switch to Dora Colgate..so much better.</li>
            <li> My one year old son loves this toothpaste and opens his mouth willingly when I try to brush his teeth during bath time. No complaints! Great item for training your child to brush.</li>
            <li> Our daughter likes the taste and it is exactly what it says it is:baby toothpaste, safe to swallow. Just make sure you know how much 3 is because after we got it we realized how long it&#x27;s going to take to use up.</li>
            <li> I use this because my son is too young to know how and when to spit out a fluoride touthpaste. Because this does not contain fluoride, it is not a long term solution for a child&#x27;s dental care.</li>
            <li> My 20 month old twins refuse to use any other toothpaste!  They love this stuff!</li>
            <li> this is good for adults because floride is a poison</li>
            <li> Good value. I like that each pack comes with a tooth brush. That way I always have extra brushes on hand. My baby seems to like brushing because of the taste of the paste.</li>
            <li> My child loves this toothpaste flavor.  Makes it easier for us when it comes to brushing her teeth everyday. I would recommend this to everyone &amp; great price!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste expires in June 2015.  I&#x27;ve got 3 months to go through 3 tubes of toothpaste.  Seems like a rip off.</li>
            <li> My daughter like it .</li>
            <li> not sure how effective this is at actually CLEANING teeth, because my kid just eats it.  but it does let me get the toothbrush in her mouth long enough to scrub all the surfaces, so at least there&#x27;s that.  if it werent for this toothpaste, i&#x27;d have a hard time getting her to let me brush her teeth 2x a day.  but really, let&#x27;s be honest, she just likes to eat it.</li>
            <li> My 18 month old loves it when i say \\&quot;let&#x27;s go brush your teeth!\\&quot; now. Though I will say, once the toothbrush is in her mouth she is more excited about eating the paste then trying to learn to properly spit it out. She does let me brush her teeth well so I am glad about that.</li>
            <li> My 1 yr old loves the taste of this, which is damn important if you know what I mean!!!!  Will buy again.</li>
