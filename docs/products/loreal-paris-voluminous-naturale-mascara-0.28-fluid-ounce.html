            <li>I love it because it is a voluminous mascara</li>
            <li>and I love makeup.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara and can not find in stores</li>
            <li>It should slide in and out easily.  </li>
            <li>It comes off easily with soap and water and/or eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not giving the product 5 stars because it dries out quickly, so its great but doesn&#x27;t last too long, you&#x27;ll have a great mascara for about a month</li>

            <li>I am the person that buys mascara weekly trying to find the right one.</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>The wand bent when I tried to replace it into the tube after its first removal.</li>
            <li>I hope the other 3 tubes in this order are better!</li>
            <li>I returned my first purchase because the wand broke after about 3 uses.  </li>
            <li>The wand and brush are very flimsy.  </li>
            <li>When i first opened it I was surprised to find the applicator was just a stick</li>
            <li>This particular mascara produces the dreaded CLUMPS.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it was old because normally this is my favorite mascara to use.</li>
            <li>I exchanged it for another and was extremely careful with the wand, being very gentle when I removed it from the tube and when I replaced it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the product was old or what the issue is, but when you pull out the wand, you can&#x27;t get it back in the tube because the brush is so flimsy that it bends and wiggles like something out of a joke shop.</li>
            <li>I took the top off this morning and it had broken off again.  </li>
            <li>sorry this product was discontinue but thrilled you could find it for me</li>
            <li>But the product I received in this order must be old as the product was very dry.  </li>

            <li> I can no longer find it in local stores, so maybe this order product has been lying around for a long time.</li>
            <li> so that could be part of the reason and it may last longer for you in a different weather but other brands last longer in the same weather.</li>
            <li> The mascara was dry and flaky and the wand broke after the second time I tried to use it</li>
            <li> i ordered Mascara ten days ago,and just yesterday got brocken and dried old One.</li>
            <li> The mascara was all dry and gummy that I couldn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> The mascara was dry and unusable.</li>
            <li> Not sure how old or if used before.</li>
            <li> However, the ones I received lately seem rather old.  </li>
            <li> mascara was all dried up when I received it in the mail....</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> The mascara is flaking off; it seems to be dried out.</li>
            <li> liquid seems almost dried up.</li>
            <li> Tassel of mascara is broken and stucked inside the tube,home i will get reimberse of my money</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Loreal makeup, and I am very disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used L&#x27;Oreal mascaras, but this one was absolutely horrible.</li>

            <li> I am the person that buys mascara weekly trying to find the right one. I think I finally did when it comes to volume. Love the brush and the way it applies.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  Don;t know why it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> The mascara was all dry and gummy that I couldn&#x27;t use it.  Not sure if it was old because normally this is my favorite mascara to use.</li>
            <li> The mascara was dry and flaky and the wand broke after the second time I tried to use it</li>
            <li> When i first opened it I was surprised to find the applicator was just a stick and I couldn&#x27;t even use it.&lt;br /&gt;My mascara was all dried up when I received it in the mail....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the trash.</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for many, many years &amp; love it.  But the product I received in this order must be old as the product was very dry.  I can no longer find it in local stores, so maybe this order product has been lying around for a long time. The wand bent when I tried to replace it into the tube after its first removal.

            <li> I&#x27;ve always used L&#x27;Oreal mascaras, but this one was absolutely horrible. I don&#x27;t know if the product was old or what the issue is, but when you pull out the wand, you can&#x27;t get it back in the tube because the brush is so flimsy that it bends and wiggles like something out of a joke shop. I bought two from the same seller and had to throw both of them out because the wand wouldn&#x27;t go back into the tube. I have never seen this happen with any mascara in my life. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  I returned my first purchase because the wand broke after about 3 uses.  I exchanged it for another and was extremely careful with the wand, being very gentle when I removed it from the tube and when I replaced it.  This one broke after the first use!  I took the top off this morning and it had broken off again.  The wand and brush are very flimsy.  I use a lot of Loreal makeup, and I am very disappointed with this product.  The quality of the mascara doesn&#x27;t matter if you can&#x27;t apply it!</li>
            <li> When I received the packages,both appeared to have been opened and the wand broke off when I tried to use it.  Not sure how old or if used before.</li>
            <li> sorry this product was discontinue but thrilled you could find it for me it is the best mascara for me</li>
            <li> The mascara was dry and unusable. I will not be buying from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This particular mascara produces the dreaded CLUMPS.  And, since it seems to be &amp;#34;water proof&amp;#34; there is the possibility, even likelihood of pulling out the lashes trying to get the darn stuff off!  ME NO LIKE!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara and wear it every day.  It comes off easily with soap and water and/or eye makeup remover.  However, the ones I received lately seem rather old.  The mascara is flaking off; it seems to be dried out.</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t look as good as expected&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trouble fitting in the end of the mascara because it&#x27;s too soft and liquid seems almost dried up.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent Voluminous Naturale Mascara. I love it because it is a voluminous mascara and I love makeup.</li>

            <li> This mascara makes your lashes look great, no smudges and each lash is perfectly defined. I&#x27;m not giving the product 5 stars because it dries out quickly, so its great but doesn&#x27;t last too long, you&#x27;ll have a great mascara for about a month and then you need to throw it away. In all fairness the weather were I&#x27;m right now is very hot and humid so that could be part of the reason and it may last longer for you in a different weather but other brands last longer in the same weather.</li>
            <li> it is very good quality. Wife bought gifts for her friends. They are delighted with the quality. thank you very much</li>
            <li> Love this mascara and can not find in stores</li>
            <li> its a great product for a super nice price, I would recommend it to everyone that likes good stuff, Try it</li>
