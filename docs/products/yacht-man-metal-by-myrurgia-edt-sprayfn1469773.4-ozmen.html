            <li>This is a nice fragrance and for a reasonable price.</li>

            <li>okay when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>I ordered this  and was so excited about getting it.</li>
            <li>not bad smelling cologne,dont usually wear cologne but for the price took a chance on it.it smells pretty good and leaves a lingering smell in my room after I applied it, which makes my room smell pretty good too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy on the nose, but it does have a nice clean, sweet smell to it.</li>
            <li>Good scent for male.</li>

            <li>A very good buy will buy it again in the near future.</li>
            <li>Nice light woodsy note with an underpinning of metal and much less floral, which results in a cologne that can be worn to work or to your favorite restaurant with confidence.  </li>
            <li>Well ....it is what it is, is mild ...</li>
            <li>I like how quickly I can find almost everything.</li>
            <li>ALL OF YACHT MAN COLOGNES SCENT DIES  OFF QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and undamaged.</li>
            <li>seems a bit mild.</li>
            <li>way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The casing is so sophisticated and elegant, it will have you second</li>
            <li>Then it fades away quickly.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to everyone that desires a mild and complimenting fragrance for the work pla email and after work.</li>
            <li>He likes it very much!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very earthy and strong scent.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, low price, quick service.</li>
            <li>Perfect as a gift or a starter scent as in my case not knowing what my boyfriend liked, only thing next is to see how long the scent lasts.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and in a cute little bottle.  </li>
            <li>I got it for my boyfriend of 3 years and he loved it and thought I spent a lot of money on it.</li>
            <li>i love the product so much that this is the second one have bought, and i have recommened this product to so many friends.</li>
            <li>well worth it</li>
            <li>Only reason it has two stars is because my boyfriend liked it 😒</li>
            <li>(smile)</li>
            <li>even the smell is cheap,this is a mistake i made and will not make it again,i was hoping it would be a fresh smell bu</li>
            <li>Easily worth the $10 I paid for it - if you are looking for an inexpensive cologne but want something that smells like</li>
            <li>IT IS WORTH PURCHASING, I GIVE THIS PRODUCT 5 STARS ...</li>
            <li>It may not be a big brand name but nice to have in the arsenal of man scents.</li>
            <li>becous his smile</li>
            <li>i will say the red version is nice</li>
            <li>Well worth your money.</li>
            <li>True it doesnt necessarily wear a lonnnnnng time but I like it ok.</li>
            <li>Not too strong and smells very classy</li>
            <li>i use this product for last 2 year and first time i got a cheap price i love it thanks</li>
            <li>Perfect for the everyday wearing and just enough of that pop to wear out on the town in the evenings.</li>
            <li>It is very crisp, clean and is along the \\&quot;sporty\\&quot; side as far as smells.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing, but the price was cheap, but the lasting scent is not long at all, almost like water.</li>
            <li>I. He took a whiff and if I recall correctly his exact reaction/</li>
            <li>Overall, I was pretty satisfied w/ the purchase.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;d most likely break</li>
            <li>But over all a for a short amount of time it was ok.</li>
            <li>Not expensive perfume to give to a friend as a gift.</li>
            <li>WILL BY MORE IN FUTURE</li>
            <li>(at least with my skin chemistry it smells great).</li>
            <li>But for the buck, you can&#x27;t really beat it!</li>
            <li>When I opened the box it was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>good for kids, but understandable for such a low price.</li>
            <li>cool looking container also gives it a classy look on my dresser.i like it.</li>
            <li>Sweet, manly and masculine</li>
            <li>once can use it but really very mild, it doesn&#x27;t last a lot of time.</li>
            <li>but you can put it back on easily.</li>
            <li>But that is what I prefer, as I don&#x27;t want to continue to smell as strong as it did when I just put it on 8 hours earlier.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a pure water.</li>
            <li>Soft long lasting scent, great price</li>
            <li>The scent was clean and stood out in a subtle kind of</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know what to expect since this was my first time ordering this particular brand.</li>
            <li>People will ask what perfume are you wearing since they like it that much.</li>
            <li>it didnt cost much.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>price thanks</li>
            <li>thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>and i wasnt expecting too much because of the price i got it,</li>
            <li>It has a very god frag.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t buy this again if someone wants it I will give it to them</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get cheated by the picture, all parts were very loosly attached and falling apart when I opened.</li>
            <li>guessing how much you paid.  </li>
            <li>Yacht Man Metal EDT spray has a very manly scent.</li>
            <li>I bought this cologne for the sole reason that it was $10, and that I needed a cheap fragrance.</li>
            <li>My nephew really likes Yacht Metal alot!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not a problem considering how much you get for the price and</li>
            <li>It smell good but don&#x27;t last long but look st the price!!!!</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing a lot more of this and other fragrances from this line.</li>
            <li>if i do i&#x27;ll pay for an original one next time</li>
            <li>For the price, who can beat this decent cologne?</li>
            <li>I have smelled this in a store prior and liked it - it&#x27;s going to be a Christmas-gift like the other colognes.</li>
            <li>I do need to apply a little more than other colognes because it is not as strong, yet the scent will linger (for what I found)</li>
            <li>Ok, just don&#x27;t last long at all</li>
            <li>I have purchased this before and the price is unbelievable for a very fine fragrance.</li>
            <li>Reviews stated this was long lasting and great smell, guess what it was not long lasting and also the smell is nice but not great.</li>
            <li>its not so hot like the red.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more a little later.</li>
            <li>this product help for complete anything.</li>
            <li>I like the cologne... not overbearing and definitely masculine.  </li>
            <li>not sure if its the original fragrance .. but decent for the price ..</li>
            <li>so mainly I just press lightly on it as I grab the round part to open it.</li>
            <li>I bought this version along with the Blue, I like the Blue&#x27;s refreshing scent, although it is weak and wears off quickly.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is a decent size although you&#x27;ll have to use a lot of this and reapply it for the scent to actually project.</li>
            <li>Shipped quick and is a larger container than expected.</li>
            <li>theirs no other way to put it.</li>
            <li>The scent is less cloying than Red, more complex than Black, and slightly more manly than Blue.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t last long at all, must not be the real thing.</li>
            <li>&amp; WANTS THE EMPTY BOTTLE FOR HER COFFEE TABLE!(LASTS 1 TO 2 HRS)..</li>
            <li>Also the bottle looks nautical themed so its a nice touch to make it look expensive.</li>
            <li>Smell does not last long enough compared to some other cheap fragrance</li>
            <li>I think which its was sent to me its no original, i put it on my skin and don&#x27;t left more than half hour</li>
            <li>It does linger, but does not stayand \\&quot;bold\\&quot; smelling for as long as I would like, nut definitely not a waste of money and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>What I mean is that you are going to need to use A LOT of it if you want the smell to be noticeable to other people for more than two hours.</li>
            <li>I am not putting the cologne down, I am putting whoever acted like this is the real thing can go and act like the color red</li>
            <li>I got it yesterday, Smells good but the bottling is really bad.</li>

            <li> not bad smelling cologne,dont usually wear cologne but for the price took a chance on it.it smells pretty good and leaves a lingering smell in my room after I applied it, which makes my room smell pretty good too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy on the nose, but it does have a nice clean, sweet smell to it.</li>

            <li> A very good buy will buy it again in the near future.</li>
            <li> Nice light woodsy note with an underpinning of metal and much less floral, which results in a cologne that can be worn to work or to your favorite restaurant with confidence.  </li>
            <li> Well ....it is what it is, is mild ...</li>
            <li> I like how quickly I can find almost everything.</li>

            <li> Then it fades away quickly.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to everyone that desires a mild and complimenting fragrance for the work pla email and after work.</li>
            <li> He likes it very much!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very earthy and strong scent.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, low price, quick service.</li>
            <li> Perfect as a gift or a starter scent as in my case not knowing what my boyfriend liked, only thing next is to see how long the scent lasts.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and in a cute little bottle.  </li>
            <li> I got it for my boyfriend of 3 years and he loved it and thought I spent a lot of money on it.</li>
            <li> i love the product so much that this is the second one have bought, and i have recommened this product to so many friends.</li>
            <li> well worth it</li>
            <li> Only reason it has two stars is because my boyfriend liked it 😒</li>
            <li> (smile)</li>
            <li> even the smell is cheap,this is a mistake i made and will not make it again,i was hoping it would be a fresh smell bu</li>
            <li> Easily worth the $10 I paid for it - if you are looking for an inexpensive cologne but want something that smells like</li>
            <li> IT IS WORTH PURCHASING, I GIVE THIS PRODUCT 5 STARS ...</li>
            <li> It may not be a big brand name but nice to have in the arsenal of man scents.</li>
            <li> becous his smile</li>
            <li> i will say the red version is nice</li>
            <li> Well worth your money.</li>
            <li> True it doesnt necessarily wear a lonnnnnng time but I like it ok.</li>
            <li> Not too strong and smells very classy</li>
            <li> i use this product for last 2 year and first time i got a cheap price i love it thanks</li>
            <li> Perfect for the everyday wearing and just enough of that pop to wear out on the town in the evenings.</li>
            <li> It is very crisp, clean and is along the \\&quot;sporty\\&quot; side as far as smells.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing, but the price was cheap, but the lasting scent is not long at all, almost like water.</li>
            <li> I. He took a whiff and if I recall correctly his exact reaction/</li>
            <li> Overall, I was pretty satisfied w/ the purchase.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;d most likely break</li>
            <li> But over all a for a short amount of time it was ok.</li>
            <li> Not expensive perfume to give to a friend as a gift.</li>
            <li> WILL BY MORE IN FUTURE</li>
            <li> (at least with my skin chemistry it smells great).</li>
            <li> But for the buck, you can&#x27;t really beat it!</li>
            <li> When I opened the box it was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> good for kids, but understandable for such a low price.</li>
            <li> cool looking container also gives it a classy look on my dresser.i like it.</li>
            <li> Sweet, manly and masculine</li>
            <li> once can use it but really very mild, it doesn&#x27;t last a lot of time.</li>
            <li> but you can put it back on easily.</li>
            <li> But that is what I prefer, as I don&#x27;t want to continue to smell as strong as it did when I just put it on 8 hours earlier.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a pure water.</li>
            <li> Soft long lasting scent, great price</li>
            <li> The scent was clean and stood out in a subtle kind of</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect since this was my first time ordering this particular brand.</li>
            <li> People will ask what perfume are you wearing since they like it that much.</li>
            <li> it didnt cost much.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> price thanks</li>
            <li> thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> and i wasnt expecting too much because of the price i got it,</li>
            <li> It has a very god frag.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy this again if someone wants it I will give it to them</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get cheated by the picture, all parts were very loosly attached and falling apart when I opened.</li>
            <li> guessing how much you paid.  </li>
            <li> Yacht Man Metal EDT spray has a very manly scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for the sole reason that it was $10, and that I needed a cheap fragrance.</li>
            <li> My nephew really likes Yacht Metal alot!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not a problem considering how much you get for the price and</li>
            <li> It smell good but don&#x27;t last long but look st the price!!!!</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing a lot more of this and other fragrances from this line.</li>
            <li> if i do i&#x27;ll pay for an original one next time</li>
            <li> For the price, who can beat this decent cologne?</li>
            <li> I have smelled this in a store prior and liked it - it&#x27;s going to be a Christmas-gift like the other colognes.</li>
            <li> I do need to apply a little more than other colognes because it is not as strong, yet the scent will linger (for what I found)</li>
            <li> Ok, just don&#x27;t last long at all</li>
            <li> I have purchased this before and the price is unbelievable for a very fine fragrance.</li>
            <li> Reviews stated this was long lasting and great smell, guess what it was not long lasting and also the smell is nice but not great.</li>
            <li> its not so hot like the red.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more a little later.</li>
            <li> this product help for complete anything.</li>
            <li> I like the cologne... not overbearing and definitely masculine.  </li>
            <li> not sure if its the original fragrance .. but decent for the price ..</li>
            <li> so mainly I just press lightly on it as I grab the round part to open it.</li>
            <li> I bought this version along with the Blue, I like the Blue&#x27;s refreshing scent, although it is weak and wears off quickly.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is a decent size although you&#x27;ll have to use a lot of this and reapply it for the scent to actually project.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick and is a larger container than expected.</li>
            <li> theirs no other way to put it.</li>
            <li> The scent is less cloying than Red, more complex than Black, and slightly more manly than Blue.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t last long at all, must not be the real thing.</li>
            <li> &amp; WANTS THE EMPTY BOTTLE FOR HER COFFEE TABLE!(LASTS 1 TO 2 HRS)..</li>
            <li> Also the bottle looks nautical themed so its a nice touch to make it look expensive.</li>
            <li> Smell does not last long enough compared to some other cheap fragrance</li>
            <li> I think which its was sent to me its no original, i put it on my skin and don&#x27;t left more than half hour</li>
            <li> It does linger, but does not stayand \\&quot;bold\\&quot; smelling for as long as I would like, nut definitely not a waste of money and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> What I mean is that you are going to need to use A LOT of it if you want the smell to be noticeable to other people for more than two hours.</li>
            <li> I am not putting the cologne down, I am putting whoever acted like this is the real thing can go and act like the color red</li>
            <li> I got it yesterday, Smells good but the bottling is really bad.</li>
            <li> While it does not last a particularly long time, the residual scent is subtle and the cologne itself probably has the most solid foundation of the four I tried - Metal, Blue, Red, and Black.  </li>
            <li> But my problem is that it doesn&#x27;t last long on me.</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> and i am going to continue buying this item as long as possible,</li>
            <li> and i am going to continue buying this item as long as possible,</li>
            <li> but it does not last long</li>
            <li> but not for a long time i put</li>
            <li> The scent does last longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> It seems like imitation, because it smell does not last long</li>
            <li> the only other problem was the cap fell off</li>
            <li> Lasts a very long time and doesn&#x27;t stain cloth.</li>
            <li> Not as expected ....</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> The expected.</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected for this product.</li>
            <li> Due to the duration that this cologne lasts, I do not use it when going out but rather as an everyday use such as school or work.  </li>
            <li> For everyday casual use, it&#x27;s no bad at all.  </li>
            <li> WILL TRY SOME OF THE OTHER FRAGRANCES</li>
            <li> Ladies,it will make other&#x27;s jealous including other men.</li>
            <li> just wish it would last a lot longer than it did, must be reapplied at least twice</li>
            <li> I believe the average Joe would like it</li>
            <li> Put water in anything and you will get watered down whatever...</li>
            <li> for less then $5 this was a steal.</li>
            <li> I like the way this cologne smells, but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as other expensive colognes.</li>
            <li> It is not good as Yatch Man Blue.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of Joop a little.</li>
            <li> Is green.......</li>
            <li> So bad I couldn&#x27;t really nail down why it did.</li>
            <li> My husband and I will be going out of the country and as our common practice, we like to take few small gifts or tokens to our friends and people we meet during our trip.  </li>
            <li> It also came w/ a small vile sample of another cologne.</li>
            <li> really is the worst perfume that I bought, acquired with the idea of ​​giving it away and do not dare because I embarrassed a fragrance that does not last anything or 5 min.</li>
            <li> i wouldnt use it even for my dog!&lt;br /&gt;really strong but disgusting smell!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy cologne or perfume online due to the fact I am unable to smell them before purchases.</li>
            <li> It reminded me of the cold steel of the big city, but having a heart based in refinement.</li>
            <li> In the late afternoon, I can still smell it.</li>
            <li> Beneath the flashy exterior of the bottle, you will find that it is not a very strong scent.</li>
            <li> and I seriously think they pulled that out of their @</li>
            <li> I hate this, it&#x27;s an imitation and not original</li>
            <li> As expected i was not surprised it does smell awful.</li>
            <li> not really impressive.</li>
            <li> you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this for the price.</li>
            <li> then nothing sorry to say thes pu.....</li>
            <li> This cologne was awful  after market, setting in the heat to long  lost</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell either</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;ma bit shocked</li>
            <li> WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED.  </li>
            <li> Hate this smell .</li>
            <li> would not give this to my worst enemy</li>
            <li> Smells just terrible to me.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I received my package but it spilled most of it is gone</li>
            <li> Well ....it is what it is, is mild ...its a version of  many brands....middle of the road,...for $5.00 what do you expect...but for someone in a work environment ...will do....as a gift for someone that is not fond of putting anything on it will do.....don&#x27;t give this to a individual that has a set taste.......it wont work...but it is pleasant .....good deal for the money.....I bought it as a gift...3 of them...its the economy.......</li>
            <li> its not so hot like the red.  CAN YOU TRY AND CREATE ANOTHER SCENT PLEASE MAYBE IT WILL COME OUT MUCH BETTER. TRY COMBINING THE THE TWO</li>
            <li> My husband and I will be going out of the country and as our common practice, we like to take few small gifts or tokens to our friends and people we meet during our trip.  This is one of the best economical gifts to give away:  smells good, not pricey and cosmetically attractive.  We bought two.  For everyday casual use, it&#x27;s no bad at all.  For the price, who can beat this decent cologne?</li>
            <li> This is a nice fragrance and for a reasonable price. Reminds me of Joop a little. Scent lingers all day.</li>

            <li> I bought 3 of this cologne it smell so good everyone that i go by ask me what kind of cologne is that i,m wearing Yacht Man......................................</li>
            <li> Buyers please beware this is not a perfume. It has no smell. Total waste of money. It&#x27;s not a perfume but it&#x27;s a pure water.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great for the price. I got it for my boyfriend of 3 years and he loved it and thought I spent a lot of money on it. It smells very crisp and clean.</li>
            <li> Very Cheap, but a delightful fragrance!</li>
            <li> In my personal opinion Yacht Man Metal would be an excellent fragrance for in the evening hours. Friends and coworkers had given good comments about it. I will be ordering more a little later.</li>
            <li> Not my type I did a mistake buying a cheap Col&amp;oacute;n</li>
            <li> A very nice scent. People will ask what perfume are you wearing since they like it that much. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a good and cheap cologne to help you get by. Doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell either, it&#x27;s OK!</li>
            <li> The expected. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I love this purchase. But my problem is that it doesn&#x27;t last long on me. But it has a nice scent .</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect since this was my first time ordering this particular brand. Being a man that loves to smell good this is by far one of my best choices for fragrances. I will be purchasing a lot more of this and other fragrances from this line. Then also got it at a great price. you guys are on the ball with this one.</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last long.  It does smell good.</li>
            <li> Was so very nervous when this came, opened it up took a whiff and OMG!!!!! Amazing, even my kids said that it fit him so perfectly. The fragrance I purchased for my mate for his birthday from the kids and I. He took a whiff and if I recall correctly his exact reaction/words were &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I did not like the perfume is a good perfume and I did not I recommend to friends and  family and friends</li>
            <li> True it doesnt necessarily wear a lonnnnnng time but I like it ok. It has a fair fragrance, nothing too strong, it doesnt make me sneeze and I am an allergy sufferer but then again I dont try inhaling it. It is a light and pleasant fragrance to me. Overall, I was pretty satisfied w/ the purchase. It also came w/ a small vile sample of another cologne. The flip-open lid is really more of an appearance feature than a truly functional component. If I tried pressing on the *lever* it&#x27;d most likely break so mainly I just press lightly on it as I grab the round part to open it. The spray pump itself is good.</li>
            <li> A very good buy will buy it again in the near future.</li>
            <li> i love the product so much that this is the second one have bought, and i have recommened this product to so many friends. good for the price too</li>
            <li> well worth it and i am going to continue buying this item as long as possible, yeah just buy and you will love it</li>
            <li> really is the worst perfume that I bought, acquired with the idea of ​​giving it away and do not dare because I embarrassed a fragrance that does not last anything or 5 min. I lost my money and not recommended</li>
            <li> it is real nice price&amp; good smell . I like it. good service.  on time . I love it. I do</li>
            <li> This smelled ok but i cant complain being it didnt cost much. I just use this when i&#x27;m going to workout or just do yard work. Maybe i will use it as a bathroom spray or something.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the everyday wearing and just enough of that pop to wear out on the town in the evenings.</li>
            <li> this one smells great and it last all day and then some so if you are looking for a great smell and last all day this one is great and will do that.</li>
            <li> This cologne was awful  after market, setting in the heat to long  lost it&#x27;s smell.&lt;br /&gt;I would not give this to my worst enemy</li>
            <li> The scent is to light for me. But over all a for a short amount of time it was ok.</li>
            <li> cheap, good, and prompt delivery. Does the job.</li>
            <li> not bad smelling cologne,dont usually wear cologne but for the price took a chance on it.it smells pretty good and leaves a lingering smell in my room after I applied it, which makes my room smell pretty good too! cool looking container also gives it a classy look on my dresser.i like it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service. Thanks.</li>

            <li> Excellent, thank you for doing business with Amazon.com . It has been great , all items of great quality delivered at my door.</li>
            <li> What a gentleman&#x27;s perfume.!!!! Heads turn!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cologne!!! My fiancé wears it all the time! I don&#x27;t want him wearing anything else! This is one of the cleanest smelling colognes I have ever come across!!!!!</li>
            <li> Reviews stated this was long lasting and great smell, guess what it was not long lasting and also the smell is nice but not great. It was cheap so there was no loss there but i kinda wear it when I&#x27;m in the house.</li>
            <li> I WAS NOT AT ALL PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT.  IT HAS NO FRAGRANCE.  SMELLS LIKE ALCOHOL.  WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED.  WILL NOT BUY THIS AGAIN.</li>
            <li> smell disappear after 3 minutes. good for kids, but understandable for such a low price. make sure you know what you want. Quality or quantity</li>

            <li> Very nice scent does smell like a nice summer breeze. Lasts a very long time and doesn&#x27;t stain cloth. Nice.</li>
            <li> Yacht man metal is the perfect cologne for parties and design is eye catching.</li>
            <li> Good scent for male. Not expensive perfume to give to a friend as a gift. Can&#x27;t beat the price too.</li>
            <li> I think which its was sent to me its no original, i put it on my skin and don&#x27;t left more than half hour try not buy from  FragranceNet&lt;br /&gt;the package i see it gray on advertise and box arrive its blue i dont understand</li>

            <li> Ok, just don&#x27;t last long at all</li>
            <li> I have purchased this before and the price is unbelievable for a very fine fragrance. My guy loves this and I also purchase Yacht Man Blue for him here on Amazon too. I can&#x27;t decide which one I like better on him, so we always replace both when he runs out. As always...Amazon is our &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; place.</li>
            <li> No Fragrance at all. Only water</li>
            <li> smelled good  fast shipping</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy cologne or perfume online due to the fact I am unable to smell them before purchases. I was very pleased with this scent it is very nice and reminds me of higher end sprays.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good buy for the money. The It a sent is diffrent and last all day. Thats a bonus for me.You dont have to spray alot on. Its a strong sent. I wouldnt wear it in the summer.I dont think It would mix well with sweat. (smile) thanks Amazon</li>

            <li> I MUST SAY I&#x27;VE TRIED A LOT OF DIFFERENT COLOGNES OVER THE YEARS AND TO ME ALL OF YACHT MAN COLOGNES SCENT DIES  OFF QUICKLY. I LOVE COLOGNES THAT CAN KEEP ME SMELLING GOOD FOR 8HRS.ON THE JOB. AND ALL OF YACHT MAN&#x27;S COLOGNES JUST DON&#x27;T HOLD UP TO ME.</li>
            <li> it is a very nice cologne.</li>
            <li> i bought this and i wasnt expecting too much because of the price i got it, but when i recieved i realize the quality of this ! i wouldnt use it even for my dog!&lt;br /&gt;really strong but disgusting smell!</li>
            <li> cheap colon tho en great smile, it one of my best</li>
            <li> This is the VERY first comment !!!!!!!!!OH MY GOD SEXUAL reminds me of my boyfriend that died</li>
            <li> I hope they will like it! It is for one of my son&#x27;s. Good buy! Thank you for helping me get this deal.</li>
            <li> even the smell is cheap,this is a mistake i made and will not make it again,i was hoping it would be a fresh smell bu it just smells chemical like,the only way to discribe this is ... smells like a polyester suit.</li>
            <li> I hate this, it&#x27;s an imitation and not original</li>
            <li> My favorite of the Yacht Man colognes is Yacht Man Metal!  While it does not last a particularly long time, the residual scent is subtle and the cologne itself probably has the most solid foundation of the four I tried - Metal, Blue, Red, and Black.  Easily worth the $10 I paid for it - if you are looking for an inexpensive cologne but want something that smells like a man is wearing it, this is a great choice!  The scent is less cloying than Red, more complex than Black, and slightly more manly than Blue.  Nice light woodsy note with an underpinning of metal and much less floral, which results in a cologne that can be worn to work or to your favorite restaurant with confidence.  Put more on - 5-6 spritzes - if you like people to notice your scent from more than a foot or two away.  Great price and, in my opinion, Yacht Man&#x27;s best fragrance thus far!</li>
            <li> Smell delicious and last all day</li>
            <li> relatively okay cologne. not really impressive. delivery time was great though.</li>
            <li> This colone smells good for a great price.  I would recommend it for everuday use because it&#x27;s not to strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greg</li>
            <li> Cologne smells great but fragrance fades completely 10 mins after spraying.</li>
            <li> Soft long lasting scent, great price</li>
            <li> Extremely Nice Fragrance! Great all around soft smelling cologne that works during the day or evening in my opinion. Arrived quickly and undamaged.</li>
            <li> WHAT A TRULY AWESOME SMELL, IT IS SURE TO GET COMPLIMENTS. IT IS WORTH PURCHASING, I GIVE THIS PRODUCT 5 STARS ...</li>
            <li> Smell.good but not for a long time i put a.looooooooot fragance on me and.smeel.so.good but in.like 3 hrs smell nothing the service more.en.less i make.my order in december 18 and.i.recived in. january 5 espere mucho.tiempo.creo</li>
            <li> Its light really light, but refreshing just wish it would last a lot longer than it did, must be reapplied at least twice</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know! It&#x27;s a gift for someone.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not my favorite or hubby&#x27;s either, but it&#x27;s not bad and it lasts all day. you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this for the price. it&#x27;s a very earthy and strong scent.</li>
            <li> This cologne was a fresh refreshing aroma of citrus and the ocean mist. It reminded me of the cold steel of the big city, but having a heart based in refinement. I&#x27;m instantly a big fan.</li>
            <li> i cant believe your prices,you have the best frangrances money can buy and I am glad that I found your ad.</li>
            <li> wont buy again... if i do i&#x27;ll pay for an original one next time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its like rubbing alcohol with a hint of something... i have since found it elsewhere and am happy. ..</li>
            <li> I have smelled this in a store prior and liked it - it&#x27;s going to be a Christmas-gift like the other colognes.</li>
            <li> it smells so good i recemend x3&lt;br /&gt;so cheap and affordable and i know anyone would like this and ijust love it</li>
            <li> I brought this for my husband and he loved it</li>
            <li> It has a very god frag. and will it attract the BABES !  ! Ladies,it will make other&#x27;s jealous including other men.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and got this so I can add another cologne to my collection. I have the Red which I like also. The price was a real good value. The scent does last longer than I expected. In the late afternoon, I can still smell it. People around me like it. It may not be a big brand name but nice to have in the arsenal of man scents.</li>
            <li> I use this on body. It is not good as Yatch Man Blue. It depends on one&#x27;s choice to use this product.</li>
            <li> well worht it and i am going to continue buying this item as long as possible, yeah just buy and you will love it</li>
            <li> After I spray some on my body it may last 3 min. Won&#x27;t buy this again if someone wants it I will give it to them</li>
            <li> Smell does not last long enough compared to some other cheap fragrance</li>
            <li> Nunca recibí el pedido. realicé reclamo y me devolvieron el pago. Tengo que esperar cuando aparecerá el reembolso en estado de cuenta tarjeta de crédito.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a very nice and good for the price.I  recommend to all buyers to buy this  nice cologne.</li>
            <li> The overall scent is great! (at least with my skin chemistry it smells great). The bottle is a decent size although you&#x27;ll have to use a lot of this and reapply it for the scent to actually project.</li>
            <li> this product is interesting and good product. good factory. this product help for complete anything. is important have this product</li>

            <li> The fragrance it ok for the price I paid. once can use it but really very mild, it doesn&#x27;t last a lot of time.</li>
            <li> love it, was bought for my boyfriend and he enjoyed the attention. i will def. continue to buy this for him</li>

            <li> Yes i had to see for my self what a bottle of 6$ Cologne smelled like.  As expected i was not surprised it does smell awful. I would not recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> I got it yesterday, Smells good but the bottling is really bad. Don&#x27;t get cheated by the picture, all parts were very loosly attached and falling apart when I opened. I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best one that I got, the price is just great and size and smell great</li>
            <li> Sweet, manly and masculine</li>
            <li> Good product, good quality, good price, good wine packaging, on the due date and in the indicated direction.</li>
            <li> Smells just terrible to me. So bad I couldn&#x27;t really nail down why it did.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price.  This is the second time I buy this product and am very, very pleased with it!  It smells wonderful and people all around like it!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful cologne and it&#x27;s really nice and light. It&#x27;s not heavy on the nose, but it does have a nice clean, sweet smell to it. I bought four bottles, and I hope they keep making this men&#x27;s cologne. Amazon did a great job with packaging and delivery.</li>
            <li> Yacht man metal for men...... its lovely. perfect scent and great moral it brings. nice for all weather type. coool</li>
            <li> for less then $5 this was a steal. theirs no other way to put it. this may not be the best smell in your collection but for sure you can put it on everyday</li>
            <li> I am not putting the cologne down, I am putting whoever acted like this is the real thing can go and act like the color red Is green....... Sarcasm is a factor..... Put water in anything and you will get watered down whatever...</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing I love it I will be buying lots of this for my husband this is his favorite</li>
            <li> I wanted something nice, but inexpensive. Buying for my boyfriend for the first time, didn&#x27;t want anything too overbearing, but something that would make him feel comfortable and would smell good to me lol.  This worked, I even purchased one for my father as a father&#x27;s day gift.  The scent was clean and stood out in a subtle kind of way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The casing is so sophisticated and elegant, it will have you second guessing how much you paid.  Perfect as a gift or a starter scent as in my case not knowing what my boyfriend liked, only thing next is to see how long the scent lasts. But for the buck, you can&#x27;t really beat it!</li>
            <li> I am happy with this item. It is very useful and practical. Good quality. I recommend it. Great job. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This has a light nice smell. Won&#x27;t run anyone off. It does however have very short silage. But that is what I prefer, as I don&#x27;t want to continue to smell as strong as it did when I just put it on 8 hours earlier. Still like it though.</li>
            <li> thank you very much i love this product i recommended a 100% to everyone need a fragance for daily use</li>
            <li> great for price . love the smell but it does not last long i would recommened it to every one</li>
            <li> Yacht Man Metal EDT spray has a very manly scent. I would reccomend this as a gift for any holidaY.</li>
            <li> i hadnt smelt this before ordering but i bought based on reviews. it said a leathery cigar smell but it didnt smell like that to me. the person i bought it for liked it or so he said. i will say the red version is nice and i bought it in a store for my husband. it has a spicy midly sweet scent to it.</li>
            <li> My Husband &amp; I love it. Smell soooooo good</li>
            <li> I am enjoying my cologne very much. Not too strong and smells very classy... things that makes me go hmmm.</li>
            <li> I like the cologne... not overbearing and definitely masculine.  I would recommend it.  I believe the average Joe would like it</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for the sole reason that it was $10, and that I needed a cheap fragrance. I was thrilled to find out it had a nice, masculine scent to it. However, all that glitters is not gold. Beneath the flashy exterior of the bottle, you will find that it is not a very strong scent. What I mean is that you are going to need to use A LOT of it if you want the smell to be noticeable to other people for more than two hours. Other than that, a great cologne for the cheapest among those who wish to smell nice.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a very nice addition to any collection. This cologne smelled similar to Allure Sport by Chanel. It is very crisp, clean and is along the \\&quot;sporty\\&quot; side as far as smells. It does linger, but does not stayand \\&quot;bold\\&quot; smelling for as long as I would like, nut definitely not a waste of money and gets the job done. Innis light and airy and notnover bearing at all. I will definotelrbe purchasing more of the line. Iris a great price and the bottle is very high end. Great buy. Great deal. Great cologne.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells okay when you first put it on. Then it fades away quickly. I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is excellent.  I recommend it to everyone that desires a mild and complimenting fragrance for the work pla email and after work.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t last long at all, must not be the real thing.</li>
            <li> My nephew really likes Yacht Metal alot!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed giving it as a b&#x27;day gift.</li>
            <li> delivered on time great deal what more Can I say</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t write any review &#x27;cause i have not recd. this item.&lt;br /&gt;Will wait for. &amp; I will review it.</li>
            <li> meh, ive had better smelling cologne, you get what you pay for....it was cheap.</li>
            <li> It smell good but don&#x27;t last long but look st the price!!!!</li>
            <li> I presented it to my husband. The smell is very clean! He likes it very much!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying this is an amazing smell, I too seen the reviews of people saying it smells like rubbing alcohol and I seriously think they pulled that out of their @**. This is a fragrance and its an amazing manly one. You do have to spray 3-5 times to get it to stay longer but that&#x27;s not a problem considering how much you get for the price and the only other problem was the cap fell off but you can put it back on easily. Also the bottle looks nautical themed so its a nice touch to make it look expensive.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very cheap but when you buy item i m expecting it to be delivered properly but i found my perfume open without box so i&#x27;ma bit shocked</li>
            <li> Great smell for the ladies</li>
            <li> I bought this version along with the Blue, I like the Blue&#x27;s refreshing scent, although it is weak and wears off quickly.  I like the price point I bought this cologne at along with the quantity (3.4 oz), and I like the design of the bottle, it looks almost flask like.  The Metal has a distinct scent that to me, is appealing.  I do need to apply a little more than other colognes because it is not as strong, yet the scent will linger (for what I found) maybe 30 minutes?.  Due to the duration that this cologne lasts, I do not use it when going out but rather as an everyday use such as school or work.  I use this after a shower and feel refreshed.  The scent is amazing, but the price was cheap, but the lasting scent is not long at all, almost like water.</li>
            <li> Best buy for the price. I was very pleased with this purchase. Shipped quick and is a larger container than expected. Well worth your money.</li>
            <li> This was my first perfume I bought on Amazon loved it ever since,  I&#x27;ll be purchasing another bottle soon just love the way it stays on me.</li>
            <li> Ok...good for work not a date...</li>
            <li> I ordered this  and was so excited about getting it. When I opened the box it was exactly what I wanted</li>
