            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>This one has a nice scent too.</li>
            <li>It smells heavenly, however, if you use acids, get chemical peels done and use this to calm the skin you will be just as shock as I was: it burns!!!</li>
            <li>love it, pleasant smell, refreshing and soothing for skin.</li>
            <li>so glad I found it on amazon.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I have used many products from this skin care line.</li>
            <li>My eyes feel better when the skin around them is moisturized.</li>
            <li>This product was just ok for me.</li>
            <li>but you get more product</li>
            <li>Love this...use it every day and am already a repeat purchaser.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Lovely product.</li>
            <li>I use the entire hydrating line and it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>I have gotten burned so many times in my life</li>
            <li>I just bought more</li>
            <li>but it could use a boost of more of the ingredients that do the job of healthwise treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you spray your face make sure to cover your hair because it&#x27;ll make your hair greasy but for skin</li>
            <li>Love this product and brand.</li>
            <li>Maybe a better bottle with better delivery?</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love Derma e</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on my skin</li>
            <li>So glad it is available on Amazon!</li>
            <li>very rich yet light....</li>
            <li>Spritz comes in 2oz bottle that can be easily placed in the purse.  </li>
            <li>Smelled good, great hydration, but the spray came out strangely heavy and not &amp;#34;misty&amp;#34; like I would have preferred.</li>
            <li>Works fine</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned, blond, and very sensitive to both heat and sun.  </li>
            <li>I have a huge problem with flaking even after exfoliating and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I keep this in the fridge, its great for misting my face after I apply makeup or after coming in from outside.</li>
            <li>All I do is spritz it on after my makeup, but it keeps my skin comfortable all day.</li>
            <li>Much more economical than the Caudalie mist I was using.  </li>
            <li>Considering that it is summer time and that is so easy for skin to be dehydrated, I figured, this is a quick solution to add moisure during the day.  </li>
            <li>(I put it on before moisturizing), and a bonus is the fresh scent!</li>
            <li>this entire line of beauty products is pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li>Good to use on dry legs also.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday as a midday picker-upper and it works great.</li>
            <li>It feels nice going on and it definitely moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of Hyaluronic Acid in it,  to do the good that Hyaluronic Acid does for the human</li>
            <li>this product is amazing, it is all natural and a MUST for my skin care routine, although it is listed for anti aging and for dry skin, I have combo oily with occasional breakouts and my skin is super sensitive , i use it before applying my moisturizer or zit cream, i will be ordering again soon, the seller is awesome, i got exactly what i ordered</li>
            <li>It is pricey and the first bottle lasted about six weeks.</li>
            <li>It actually makes my skin more oily.  </li>
            <li>I have used it daily for years and recommend it for those that like a super light hydrator.</li>
            <li>I works really good for me if I have gotten a little too much sun on my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>I bought this at Whole Foods a few months ago and really loved the way  my skin felt after using it.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use if you have super sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>The flower smell is strong and obviously FAKE--not the botanical essence of Plumeria.  </li>
            <li>I could see a very visible difference within seconds after applying.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice it really doing anything for my skin whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t reallymlisture as much as I want.</li>
            <li>You can use it on just your face or whole body.</li>
            <li>But then no one wants to give us consumers that product.</li>
            <li>It really takes the heat out.</li>
            <li>first took an extended, cool water shower to stop/slow the burning, then immediately sprayed this product all over my face, neck, and chest area  (and used another gel product for my arms, legs, and upper back/neck area).  </li>
            <li>I would Highly recommended it for just that.</li>
            <li>Very worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and a spray of this over my makeup makes everything lock in and give it a smooth natural look.</li>
            <li>and I am constantly getting compliments on my make-up and face looking so fresh and natural.</li>
            <li>I use this with the addition of HA capsule powder in liquid from Pure Encapsulations for extra moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>This can&#x27;t be used on sensitive skin or skin that has been treated with retin a, glycolyc acid or chemical peels.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I thought it was natural, but it is NOT.  </li>
            <li>I live in sunny Arizona, and decided to replant a desert garden in the middle of the day...</li>
            <li>It is overpriced for the tiny bottle and the fragrance in it is not agreeing with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather give it 3-and-a-half or 3-and-a-quarter stars because I have decently sensitive skin (especially from aging).</li>
            <li>My skin is quite dry these days thanks to low thyroid and celiac disease.</li>
            <li>Fragrances are protected by a trade secret law and many fragrances actually contain toxic chemicals called neurotoxins that poison your brain and nervous system and cause cancer, etc.  </li>
            <li>I live in a ski resort area with a very dry climate.</li>
            <li>Derma-E completely handled my acne &amp; dry skin.</li>
            <li>I remembered that I had sprayed some of this Derma E spray on my husband recently when he complained of a mild sunburn and it was gone within hours after using the spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>provides some &#x27;plumping&#x27; in the thin skinned areas of the face and reduces fine lines almost immediately.  </li>

            <li> I also have dry eyes.</li>
            <li> Gives a dewy finish and any dry feeling</li>
            <li> Your face neve feels dry or drawn after washing.  </li>
            <li> applied it in a circular motion up to eye bone only (keep away from eyes, can be damaging) on both sides of face and down along and around neck line.  </li>
            <li> The scent is *slightly* migraine-triggering for me, but I just hold my breath until it dries and only get one headache a week (or so).</li>
            <li> (I have very dry skin)</li>
            <li> My skin, especially around my eyes and mouth, was so dried out</li>
            <li> I keep it in my office and spray it on my face when I am feeling dry or need a little pick me up.</li>
            <li> No dramatic improvements, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I think it is a bit expensive for 2 ounces of product, but I really like it and will probably continue using it.</li>
            <li> While the next day, I was still slightly pink, it would have been soooo much worse if I hadn&#x27;t used this product.  </li>
            <li> It is also loaded with antioxidenats: vitamin C and green tea.  </li>
            <li> (and I did end up spraying it on my arms and upper back) was noticeably cooler and a lot less painful.  </li>
            <li> without any sunscreen and hardly any shade, but knew immediately I was in for a very painful sunburn as the heat radiating off my skin would not abate even after an hour with a cool wet wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> Way expensive there though,</li>
            <li> So that was disappointing.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this at Whole Foods a few months ago and really loved the way  my skin felt after using it.  Way expensive there though, so glad I found it on amazon.</li>
            <li> It smells heavenly, however, if you use acids, get chemical peels done and use this to calm the skin you will be just as shock as I was: it burns!!! This can&#x27;t be used on sensitive skin or skin that has been treated with retin a, glycolyc acid or chemical peels.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes my normal/ oily skin without a greasy feel. The only daily moisturizer I will ever use!</li>
            <li> This is a very amazing product. I live in a ski resort area with a very dry climate. This actually plumped my skin instantly. I could see a very visible difference within seconds after applying. It was also shipped immediately and arrived ahead of schedule. I am very very happy with it</li>
            <li> Works fine but you need to exfoliate your skin weekly to have good results</li>
            <li> PERFECT TO SPRITZ ON YOUR FACE AFTER YOU HAVE PUT IT ON ( MAKE UP) OR JUST THE SMELL IS GREAT. I USE IT AT NIGHT WITH MY CREAMS. THIS IS THE LAST LAYER AND IF I FEEL MY SKIN IS DRY I USE THIS. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> My skin is quite dry these days thanks to low thyroid and celiac disease. I have used many products from this skin care line. I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this mist. I sometimes use it instead of a toner to set makeup or whenever I&#x27;m feeling dry. I also have dry eyes. My eyes feel better when the skin around them is moisturized. It is pricey and the first bottle lasted about six weeks. It is worth it to feel less tight and dry.</li>
            <li> Florida weather doesn&#x27;t rock, but this spray does! The scent is *slightly* migraine-triggering for me, but I just hold my breath until it dries and only get one headache a week (or so). But since I get headaches at the drop of a hat, I wouldn&#x27;t stop using this product JUST for that reason.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel dewy and gives it a hydrating glow! As an added bonus, it smells great. I wear it alone, or over makeup, to set it.</li>
            <li> I got this about 5 days ago.  After mixing in proportional amounts as my recipe calls for, I  happily found the beginning change in the hyperpigmentation from sun and age.  It has now been 5 days or so and my skin discoloration has almost disappeared.  I put on a plastic glove and&lt;br /&gt;gently applied it in a circular motion up to eye bone only (keep away from eyes, can be damaging) on both sides of face and down along and around neck line.  Today I discovered that the rings around my neck have almost disappeared. Yippeee!! NOTE:  Do not attempt  if you have no mixing knowledge.  I only tell you this lauding this product, but believe me it&#x27;s mixed with different products.</li>
            <li> This product was just ok for me. It is overpriced for the tiny bottle and the fragrance in it is not agreeing with my sensitive skin. I didn&#x27;t notice it really doing anything for my skin whatsoever. I will stick with MAC fix +. It is a little more expensive but you get more product and it actually provides moisture to my skin. Will definitely not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Love this...use it every day and am already a repeat purchaser.  Gives a dewy finish and any dry feeling you have disappears.</li>
            <li> Great for a skin pick me up. I use after I apply my moisturizer or serums or just throughout day as a refresher. My only con is does not come in bigger size</li>
            <li> very rich yet light.... this entire line of beauty products is pretty good stuff. Would def buy again for a good price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand greasy lotions, and this in my opinion is the best moisturizer that I have ever tried!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  No dramatic improvements, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> It feels nice going on and it definitely moisturizes.  I thought that a mist would keep my skin from getting oily though, and it doesn&#x27;t.  It actually makes my skin more oily.  So that was disappointing.  On the bright side even though it makes my skin oily, it doesn&#x27;t break me out so I will keep this for the evening and use it at night only.  Then it won&#x27;t matter if my face gets oily because I can just shower it off in the morning.</li>
            <li> It not only refreshes me after using it..it brightens my skin and makes it look perfect!  Love the smell of it too!  :)</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. Got this to re-set my makeup and moisturize my face mid-day.  Doesn&#x27;t reallymlisture as much as I want.</li>
            <li> I recently saw ad for Dermae products in Yoga magazine.  I placed an order and decided to try this mist.  Considering that it is summer time and that is so easy for skin to be dehydrated, I figured, this is a quick solution to add moisure during the day.  Spritz comes in 2oz bottle that can be easily placed in the purse.  It has wonderful fragrance of exotic plumeria flowers.  It is also loaded with antioxidenats: vitamin C and green tea.  Lovely product.</li>
            <li> This mist is so nice! I keep it in my office and spray it on my face when I am feeling dry or need a little pick me up. Better than coffee!</li>
            <li> I keep this in the fridge, its great for misting my face after I apply makeup or after coming in from outside. Also good to throw into your cooler to take to the beach as a refreshing mist.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing, it is all natural and a MUST for my skin care routine, although it is listed for anti aging and for dry skin, I have combo oily with occasional breakouts and my skin is super sensitive , i use it before applying my moisturizer or zit cream, i will be ordering again soon, the seller is awesome, i got exactly what i ordered</li>
            <li> No problems. . , would get it again.</li>
            <li> This toner is amazing! My esthetician recommended it and I&#x27;m so happy I got it. Derma-E completely handled my acne &amp; dry skin. I use the entire hydrating line and it&#x27;s awesome. So amazing to know I&#x27;m using products that are good for me and also handle my skin issues. Best of both words! I also spray this on after my foundation &amp; powder to soften it a bit.</li>
            <li> I live in sunny Arizona, and decided to replant a desert garden in the middle of the day...on the spur of the moment.  I am fair skinned, blond, and very sensitive to both heat and sun.  I was only outside for about 30 - 45 minutes...without any sunscreen and hardly any shade, but knew immediately I was in for a very painful sunburn as the heat radiating off my skin would not abate even after an hour with a cool wet wash cloth.  I remembered that I had sprayed some of this Derma E spray on my husband recently when he complained of a mild sunburn and it was gone within hours after using the spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first took an extended, cool water shower to stop/slow the burning, then immediately sprayed this product all over my face, neck, and chest area  (and used another gel product for my arms, legs, and upper back/neck area).  I have gotten burned so many times in my life that I KNOW when I am doomed!  I reapplied an hour later, and within 2 hours of the initial spray, my skin was not beet red anymore and only my nose was still a deep pink.  Everywhere else on my face and chest area (and I did end up spraying it on my arms and upper back) was noticeably cooler and a lot less painful.  While the next day, I was still slightly pink, it would have been soooo much worse if I hadn&#x27;t used this product.  Thank you to the makers of this Hydrating Mist from Derma E!  I just bought more so I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li> The Hydrating mist is wonderful after morning shower. You can use it on just your face or whole body. Good to refresh face during the day and wonderful after removing makeup at night. Your face neve feels dry or drawn after washing.  I will definitely continue using this product as a facial tonic and refresher!</li>
            <li> Gave me bumps. Had to discard.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of Hyaluronic Acid in it,  to do the good that Hyaluronic Acid does for the human body.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good spray,  but it could use a boost of more of the ingredients that do the job of healthwise treatments.&lt;br /&gt;100% Hyaluronic Acid would be an excellent product.  But then no one wants to give us consumers that product.</li>
            <li> So moist and smells heavenly. The best!</li>
            <li> Perfect travel size for purse. I use this with the addition of HA capsule powder in liquid from Pure Encapsulations for extra moisturizing.  Receive many compliments on my complexion and feel this product contributes to the smooth, youthful, flawless makeup appearance.</li>
            <li> provides some &#x27;plumping&#x27; in the thin skinned areas of the face and reduces fine lines almost immediately.  not greasy/shiny.  good product.</li>
            <li> If you spray your face make sure to cover your hair because it&#x27;ll make your hair greasy but for skin it&#x27;s great! Very worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> This is my holy grail product. I have dry skin and a spray of this over my makeup makes everything lock in and give it a smooth natural look. I will even use it by itself. Love this product and brand.</li>
            <li> Smelled good, great hydration, but the spray came out strangely heavy and not &amp;#34;misty&amp;#34; like I would have preferred. Maybe a better bottle with better delivery?</li>
            <li> No allergy on me, hydrated my skin~smell is nice</li>
            <li> Great for a pick me up during the day, after hot yoga and will be wonderful at the beach( under my hat of course because there is no SPF</li>
            <li> Smells great leaves skin supple and moist. I am 44 and use it every morning before moisturiz see r and after makeup.</li>
            <li> The flower smell is strong and obviously FAKE--not the botanical essence of Plumeria.  I wish I would have heeded the warnings on the smell.  I bought this product because I thought it was natural, but it is NOT.  Fragrances are protected by a trade secret law and many fragrances actually contain toxic chemicals called neurotoxins that poison your brain and nervous system and cause cancer, etc.  So, if you care about your health, only use products that are scented with botanical essences/essential oils.</li>
            <li> I have a huge problem with flaking even after exfoliating and moisturizing. I had a make-up expert show me a trick so I immediately ordered this product. I spray a make-up brush with the hydrating mist and then use the misted brush to put primer on my face. I have had no issues with flaking since I started this regiment and I am constantly getting compliments on my make-up and face looking so fresh and natural. Note: I only use mineral make-up so results may vary depending on the type of make-up you use.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I works really good for me if I have gotten a little too much sun on my shoulders.  It really takes the heat out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather give it 3-and-a-half or 3-and-a-quarter stars because I have decently sensitive skin (especially from aging). It stings just the tiniest bit for me and I don&#x27;t like how the smell/chemicals just linger and I can&#x27;t breathe after spraying. It definitely feels like I&#x27;m being hydrated but after a while (I have very dry skin) my cracks and dryness seem to appear even more! I stopped using it for a while--but it really is a great product if you&#x27;re on-the-go and you need your skin to be quenched. Don&#x27;t use if you have super sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday as a midday picker-upper and it works great. I would Highly recommended it for just that.</li>
            <li> I love Derma e this is the best spray I&#x27;ve used it for years and would never switch to another product. Works beautifully over makeup, gives a nice glow!</li>
            <li> love it, pleasant smell, refreshing and soothing for skin.</li>
            <li> I thought this was good stuff.  I like how hand it is to use</li>
            <li> Refreshing with a nice fragrance! I&#x27;ve used it alone and after applying makeup. Good to use on dry legs also.</li>
            <li> Nice product. I have used it daily for years and recommend it for those that like a super light hydrator.</li>
            <li> I bought this spray because of the  good reputation of derma-e products, and because of the ingredients. I love the way it feels on my skin (I put it on before moisturizing), and a bonus is the fresh scent! I think it is a bit expensive for 2 ounces of product, but I really like it and will probably continue using it. So glad it is available on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful! I ran out recently, and waited about a week to reorder. My skin, especially around my eyes and mouth, was so dried out and, well, old-looking for that entire week. All I do is spritz it on after my makeup, but it keeps my skin comfortable all day.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Much more economical than the Caudalie mist I was using.  This one has a nice scent too.</li>
