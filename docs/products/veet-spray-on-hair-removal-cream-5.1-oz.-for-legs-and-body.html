            <li>This was a great option for me.</li>
            <li>But it works great for the bikini area.</li>
            <li>So...for the bikini area, this stuff is GREAT.</li>
            <li>It works great every time.  </li>
            <li>Good morning:&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>not having to get it on my hands was a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>Worked perfect &amp; fast.</li>
            <li>I liked this product because it was effective at removing hair</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m going to throw it away mostly un-used because it clogs up</li>
            <li>love veet</li>
            <li>its just ok</li>
            <li>indignation that caused me to buy something and send you another, more careful.&lt;br /&gt;regards</li>
            <li>It removed most of the hair on my legs</li>
            <li>(notice I said MOST).  </li>
            <li>i love the way  </li>
            <li>During receovery you can&#x27;t bend more than 90 degrees.</li>
            <li>It does spray on fairly easily--but that is the only good thing I can say about it.  </li>
            <li>My legs have never felt so soft before and it does a great job in removing hair.</li>
            <li>I am surprised at some of the reviews because I think this product is amazing!</li>
            <li>This leaves it silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth....</li>
            <li>finished you have smooth and silkiness.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Veet.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several of Veet&#x27;s products and this one is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>Also, one can was only good for one application for me, so I&#x27;ll have to buy one for every time I use it.</li>
            <li>(well most) and did not irritate my skin and of course naturally caused no nicks.</li>
            <li>I was not too pleased with how much I had to use though just to get the job done - this is much more expensive than shaving for sure!!</li>
            <li>and it was less successful around the ankles</li>
            <li>But that means I am never disappointed with a patch that isn&#x27;t ready.</li>
            <li>I liked how it did not cause my skin to feel irritated, dry, or get bumpy.</li>
            <li>You just have to make sure that you spray it where you want the hair removed because if you don&#x27;t, obviously, hair will still be there.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;You do not have to use a lot to get the whole area covered.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>It took the whole can to do both of my legs.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to shave my legs but couldn&#x27;t if I used a razor.</li>
            <li>I was very satified with the results.</li>
            <li>It is very maddening to know you paid for the product, but can&#x27;t get it out of the container because the sprayer won&#x27;t expel the product.</li>
            <li>This product is not for someone with dark hair that is more course in texture.</li>
            <li>I am always in a rush as I have a toddler son and I seem to nick myself and make more of a mess out of my skin than anything else.</li>
            <li>i had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The bottle is over half full and the sprayer quit working, just like the first bottle.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did not read the reviews before buying this, because I usually do.</li>
            <li>This product completely removed those issues.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried; waxing (got bumps) shaving (got bumps) epilady (ouch!) and a \\&quot;bikini trimmer\\&quot; which made my boyfreind stay far away from my bikini area</li>

            <li> I am thinking in the winter i will stick to shaving as less people see my body and nicks are not as big of a deal but in the summer I think I will splurge and get this!</li>
            <li> Definitely buy Nair or stick to shaving, because this is just a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> It smells, bad (but so does most other depilatory creams).  </li>
            <li> no fun for either of us.</li>

            <li> I leave it on slightly longer than it says to.</li>
            <li> I like the little plastic hair remover that comes with it.</li>
            <li> unfortunately the product has been diluted so much to make it sprayable that it is not effective on dark heavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I had a few spots that I had to get with a razor afterward, but they were few.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Veet for awhile now and never had any trouble.</li>

            <li> and once it clogs up, usually after you do one leg, that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it freezes or what</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY messy; gets EVERYWHERE (it even got on my face!)  </li>
            <li> Wait for 6 minutes at least.</li>
            <li> When I used nair, it gave me a rash for a bout a day, and at the same time made my skin numb.  </li>

            <li> It removed some hair, leaving a random hairy mess.</li>
            <li> My hair is blond and thin, but thicker around the ankles</li>
            <li> I am a man and use this to remove my back hair, which I hate.  </li>
            <li> yet it was SO uncomfortable to leave it on for the specified amount of time.  </li>

            <li> This was a great option for me. I rarely used veet (or other hair removal creams) because putting it on was too time consuming and too messy. This product completely removed those issues. I had a few spots that I had to get with a razor afterward, but they were few. My hair is blond and thin, but thicker around the ankles and it was less successful around the ankles so it might not be the product for those with coarser hair. Also, one can was only good for one application for me, so I&#x27;ll have to buy one for every time I use it. Given the choice between that or returning to shaving, which leaves my legs unbearably itchy, then I&#x27;ll shell out the dough.</li>
            <li> i had high hopes for this product.  not having to get it on my hands was a nice feature.  unfortunately the product has been diluted so much to make it sprayable that it is not effective on dark heavy hair.  it removed less than 10% of the area i sprayed (both of my legs) i will have to back to foam or the tube.</li>
            <li> I bought this on sale about 6 months ago. I&#x27;ve used Veet for awhile now and never had any trouble. Well, I&#x27;m going to throw it away mostly un-used because it clogs up and once it clogs up, usually after you do one leg, that&#x27;s it. Not sure if it freezes or what but I will go back to the pump bottle or the Sally Hansen brand.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at some of the reviews because I think this product is amazing! My legs have never felt so soft before and it does a great job in removing hair. You just have to make sure that you spray it where you want the hair removed because if you don&#x27;t, obviously, hair will still be there. Wait for 6 minutes at least. I am so glad I did not read the reviews before buying this, because I usually do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several of Veet&#x27;s products and this one is the best by far.  No mess on your hands.  The instructions say to hold it 2\\&quot; from your leg when spraying, which is key.  (Otherwise, it just gets everywhere else.)  Doesn&#x27;t last long (two uses on my legs), but makes my legs smoother than shaving and I don&#x27;t get itchy, dry skin like I do when I shave.</li>
            <li> “I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member.” By the time you put it on your legs and wait, you could have just shaved with regular shaving cream. But it works great for the bikini area.</li>
            <li> So...for the bikini area, this stuff is GREAT. Works for me. I like the little plastic hair remover that comes with it. I&#x27;ve tried; waxing (got bumps) shaving (got bumps) epilady (ouch!) and a \\&quot;bikini trimmer\\&quot; which made my boyfreind stay far away from my bikini area cuz it was always \\&quot;prickly\\&quot;....no fun for either of us. This leaves it silky smooth. Worked perfect &amp; fast. I&#x27;m buying a case of this stuff!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used lots of hair removal creams before from a variety of brands, and I have to say this is the WORST one I have ever used.  It does spray on fairly easily--but that is the only good thing I can say about it.  I do not have sensitive skin yet it was SO uncomfortable to leave it on for the specified amount of time.  It didn&#x27;t necessarily burn, but it was really itch and irritating.  I left it on for ten minutes, which is the maximum amount of time permitted in the directions.  I did a spot test at about 6-7 minutes and NOTHING came off.  So when it hit ten minutes I started to scrape and noticed MAYBE ten or twelve hairs come off of each leg.  That&#x27;s it.  My legs are still prickly and the hair is visible, so I know the product does not work.  In addition, when I had scraped off all of the cream and proceeded to rinse my legs with lukewarm water, it was painful, almost like I was putting warm water on sunburned skin.  Overall I wouldn&#x27;t even give this product one star (but I had to so that I could leave the review.)  Definitely buy Nair or stick to shaving, because this is just a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> love veet but this is messy and not as thorough in getting all the hair its just ok</li>
            <li> I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member. I bought this product because I HATE shaving. I am always in a rush as I have a toddler son and I seem to nick myself and make more of a mess out of my skin than anything else. I liked this product because it was effective at removing hair (well most) and did not irritate my skin and of course naturally caused no nicks. I liked how it did not cause my skin to feel irritated, dry, or get bumpy. I was not too pleased with how much I had to use though just to get the job done - this is much more expensive than shaving for sure!! I am thinking in the winter i will stick to shaving as less people see my body and nicks are not as big of a deal but in the summer I think I will splurge and get this!</li>
            <li> I am a man and use this to remove my back hair, which I hate.  It works great every time.  I spray it on, wait 7-8 minutes, and wipe it off with a towel in the shower.  Every hair comes off.  The only problem is about half the cans fail to spray. I have tried everything to get them to go with no luck.  Sadly I have been throwing them away.  From now on, I am taking them back for a refund.  When I used nair, it gave me a rash for a bout a day, and at the same time made my skin numb.  Veet has no side effects which I can detect.  I have been using if for about 4 year.</li>
            <li> Good morning:&lt;br /&gt;This product loves my husband, in this order did not sent this product I had bought, I sent one woman. indignation that caused me to buy something and send you another, more careful.&lt;br /&gt;regards</li>
            <li> I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap and may receive perks and rewards as a member.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product. Finally a cream that sprays on , There is no messiness. Goes on smooth....&lt;br /&gt;You do not have to use a lot to get the whole area covered.&lt;br /&gt;Does not burn or irtate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Fast action.&lt;br /&gt;You do not have to wait for a long time for the product to start working.&lt;br /&gt;Once finished you have smooth and silkiness.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Veet.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this after Nair did nothing whatsoever.  Pros:  It removed most of the hair on my legs (notice I said MOST).  The cons:  It smells, bad (but so does most other depilatory creams).  It took the whole can to do both of my legs.  Left a few small patches of hair on my legs.  EXTREMELY messy; gets EVERYWHERE (it even got on my face!)  Left my skin irritated and bubbly (I have extremely sensitive skin).  Of course, this was just my experience with the product. I have very thick hair, so of course it would be a bit more difficult for me than for someone with thin, fine hair. It is a tad easier than shaving, but for me, it&#x27;s not worth it. The nasty chemical smell stayed on my skin until I took a shower to get rid of it. Also, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s enough product for the price. I think I&#x27;ll just stick to shaving.</li>
            <li> I leave it on slightly longer than it says to. But that means I am never disappointed with a patch that isn&#x27;t ready.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but after ten minutes I realized I had wasted money. This product is not for someone with dark hair that is more course in texture. It removed some hair, leaving a random hairy mess. I would not recommend this product, it did not even come close to what it advertises.</li>
            <li> “I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member. i love the way  Veet  feels on my skin i would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I absolutely hate shaving. You take the time to shave, just to have prickly hairs in the morning. So I decided to try Veet because my mom used it from time to time when I was a kid. Overall, I am happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It left my legs incredibly soft, 99% of the hair came off in 6 minutes, no itchiness or bumps, and the spray was excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Smelled awful (which is to be expected), and you really gotta scrape to get the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this again! It might be my regular go-to for hair removal. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I recently had a total hip replacement. During receovery you can&#x27;t bend more than 90 degrees. I really wanted to shave my legs but couldn&#x27;t if I used a razor. I ordered this and it worked! I was very satified with the results.</li>

            <li> The sprayer will not work.  This is my second bottle of Veet Spray On Hair Removal Cream.  The first bottle was half gone and suddenly the sprayer quite working. Now the same thing is happening with my second bottle. The bottle is over half full and the sprayer quit working, just like the first bottle. It is very maddening to know you paid for the product, but can&#x27;t get it out of the container because the sprayer won&#x27;t expel the product. I won&#x27;t be taken again. The product worked well but it&#x27;s too much of a coincidence that the same thing happened to both bottles. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
