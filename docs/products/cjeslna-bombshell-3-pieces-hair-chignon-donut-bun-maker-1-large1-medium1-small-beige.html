    <ol>
            <li>Excellent color, price and delivery was speedy!</li>
            <li>These are great!</li>
            <li>Works great for putting the girls hair up in a bun!</li>
            <li>but the idea is great.</li>
            <li>they make a great bun</li>
            <li>However, the products themselves are great.</li>
            <li>Happy to find these.</li>
            <li>But for the price and for what I got, I&#x27;d say it was a good deal...</li>
            <li>Good price for a 3 pack</li>
            <li>They are comparable (or better!)</li>
            <li>The color is nice and they seem durable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a dancer, and I use theese kind of bun pieces in my hair all the time.</li>
            <li>This will be good for anyone with light colored hair.</li>
            <li>So easy even a dad can do it!</li>
            <li>Really easy to use, a lot of my friends have bought these based on my hair do&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>Great price, exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Very cheaply made and not working well at all in my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made...</li>
            <li>Make easy and tidy buns in a snap with these.  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Can do many things with them.</li>
            <li>I  love them</li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>We have been using these for a couple of months now and have been pleased.</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much, came quick and love it!</li>
            <li>I needed a light colored chignon</li>
            <li>They stay in, and are unnoticable on my light hair.</li>
            <li>Having different sizes is great for different looks, but also I was able to loan one out to a friend who has shorter hair for a nice up-do for a formal party.</li>
            <li>Super comfortable</li>
            <li>As described and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>so I looked for a new one online and bought theese, good deal, three for less than what I bought 1 for, and just as durable.</li>
            <li>Not quite what I was expecting, but I am not sure exactly WHAT I was expecting to be honest.  </li>
            <li>I love the size variety and actually use the smallest size on my 3 year old.  </li>
            <li>Not as easy to use for very fine thin hair</li>
            <li>service arrived early!</li>
            <li>They actually do a decent job (I have only used the biggest one thus far) and you can&#x27;t beat the price since you get all three sizes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already used the smallest one and think it&#x27;s as big as I would go for a high bun.</li>
            <li>apparently they ship from China and take about 4 weeks to make the trek.</li>
            <li>Luckily the other donuts will not go to waste as my cats have taken a liking to them, and they have disappeared...</li>

            <li> Very useful to get 3 sizes of chignon base and also in a light color for blondes.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time getting these to create a decent hairdo.</li>
            <li> in all seriousness, they arrived exactly as expected and will get a lot of use.</li>
            <li> I have short/medium length hair which is VERY thin, so I was worried that these would look silly.</li>
            <li> Impossible to find just searching in stores at hair accessories.</li>

            <li> Excellent color, price and delivery was speedy! I recommend this product and seller!</li>
            <li> These are great! I&#x27;ve already used the smallest one and think it&#x27;s as big as I would go for a high bun. Luckily the other donuts will not go to waste as my cats have taken a liking to them, and they have disappeared...&lt;br /&gt;But in all seriousness, they arrived exactly as expected and will get a lot of use.</li>
            <li> Make easy and tidy buns in a snap with these.  Having different sizes is great for different looks, but also I was able to loan one out to a friend who has shorter hair for a nice up-do for a formal party.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and not working well at all in my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> Love them. Not as easy to use for very fine thin hair but the idea is great. Can do many things with them.</li>
            <li> Works great for putting the girls hair up in a bun! So easy even a dad can do it!</li>
            <li> My hair is blonde I needed a light colored chignon I could not find this color in any store at all I looked everywhere. Amazon to the rescue. This will be good for anyone with light colored hair.I  love them they make a great bun</li>
            <li> Great price, exactly as described.  This comes with three donuts ranging in size.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll like it once I figure out how to use it?</li>
            <li> Not quite what I was expecting, but I am not sure exactly WHAT I was expecting to be honest.  I had to go to youtube to watch a video on how to use these things and it looks more complicated than what I was hoping for.  There are also no bobby pins or elastic hair ties with this product, which you will need in order to put your hair in a bun.  But for the price and for what I got, I&#x27;d say it was a good deal...but again, not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Fabulous! I would buy again in a minute !&lt;br /&gt;Great service arrived early!</li>
            <li> I had a hard time getting these to create a decent hairdo.</li>
            <li> These things took forever to arrive-- apparently they ship from China and take about 4 weeks to make the trek. However, the products themselves are great. They are comparable (or better!) than the name brand item I had purchased in my local store. I love the size variety and actually use the smallest size on my 3 year old.  The color is nice and they seem durable. We have been using these for a couple of months now and have been pleased.</li>
            <li> As described and arrived quickly. Good price for a 3 pack</li>

            <li> Very cheaply made...do not work at all</li>
            <li> Very useful to get 3 sizes of chignon base and also in a light color for blondes.  Impossible to find just searching in stores at hair accessories. Happy to find these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dancer, and I use theese kind of bun pieces in my hair all the time. I recently lost mine, that I had bought for 5 dollars so I looked for a new one online and bought theese, good deal, three for less than what I bought 1 for, and just as durable. They stay in, and are unnoticable on my light hair. Super comfortable and I like that there are three sizes to choose from... definately would recommend!</li>
            <li> I think it was sent to me used.  It had hair up in it.</li>
