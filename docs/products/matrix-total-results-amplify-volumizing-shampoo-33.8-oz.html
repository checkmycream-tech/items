    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The root lifter is great!</li>
            <li>Great deal!</li>
            <li>Very happy with all aspects of my purchase - everything was just as posted - will order again</li>
            <li>Great product!!</li>
            <li>Wonderful product!</li>
            <li>Great shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My hair does what I tell it to, and looks great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had great results for years with Nexxus Diametress Volumizing shampoo, but it looks like they&#x27;ve reformulated it.  </li>
            <li>but I used this at my cousins house and loved it...</li>
            <li>If they did, I&#x27;d be very upset, because Matrix Amplify and XL share a wonderful clean scent that makes hair smell good and clean for days.  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>we love this atiff</li>
            <li>I have used this for awhile and love it...but have they changed the formula?</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo and wish the company would continue to make this product.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair softer which does not help in making the hair look like it has more volume.</li>
            <li>so I bought it here and still love it.  </li>
            <li>I love my Amplify.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years and have always enjoyed its quality, fragrance and the way it makes my hair look and feel.  </li>
            <li>I love this product line for my hair.</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, very nice product.</li>
            <li>Product came just as pictured in nice, safe clean packaging, and Prime Shipping is always a plus.</li>
            <li>So it was worth the price for me!  :-)</li>
            <li>If your hair needs a little strength and thickness, this is an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;The accompanying conditioner works well with it.  </li>
            <li>, this seems like a good substitute for the old Amplify.  </li>
            <li>I would have reordered the original, but I couldn&#x27;t find the 44 oz.</li>
            <li>I have very fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>As it seems most shampoos that are formulated for color-treated hair don&#x27;t like to clean the hair very well.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report that the scent is exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>when my hair was color-treated, I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the AmplifyXL (which was also discontinued, and though I wasn&#x27;t a fan relative to the regular version, I still liked it better than most shampoos out there)</li>
            <li>And with my type of hair - it&#x27;s RARE to find a shampoo where I don&#x27;t need conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li>But now I have to wash my hair every day because it doesn&#x27;t actually clean it very well, even though I lather twice.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean and soft, and scalp clean.</li>
            <li>And also that this Total Results is superior to the XL version, meaning, I only have to shampoo once or twice max to feel like my hair is clean, and I don&#x27;t have to use globs and globs of shampoo either to accomplish that task,</li>
            <li>I was satisfied enough with it to&lt;br /&gt;buy</li>
            <li>I had to go to Amazon to get it, until eventually the prices got higher and higher, as the stock became lower and lower.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>First, did they change the scent?  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>and I have dry frizzy curly hair - and this makes my hair very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Very concentrated.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this line of products if you need a volumizer!  </li>
            <li>with the XL too, it got to a point where it was no longer reasonably priced anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Well, it lathers really well.  </li>
            <li>Just not having much luck with shampoos this year.  </li>
            <li>The reason I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the XL was because I felt like it didn&#x27;t get my hair as clean the regular Amplify.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a good shampoo that smells great, get&#x27;s your hair clean (without stripping the life out of it, and without leaving dirty residue behind), and gives lift, bounce, volume, and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>a very minimal amount of shampoo is all that&#x27;s required, which is something I loved about the regular *old* Amplify.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li>This is the product I love but at the salons it is more expensive than what I paid including the shipping.</li>
            <li>They do have a new version</li>
            <li>but I could still get that on Amazon for a reasonable price once I could no longer get the regular Amplify for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t any better than the natural product I tried a few months ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will definitely restock with this seller again, thanks!</li>
            <li>, I decided to try this new Total results, the *new* replacement for the old Amplify line.  </li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t mistake me saying that because this gets your really clean that it&#x27;s something like a harsh clarifying Sunday shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty sad when I discovered that my favorite HG shampoo, Matrix Amplify, had been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I have developed a rash on my back and wonder if it&#x27;s not something in the shampoo?</li>
            <li>My second concern, was this new formula is for color-treated hair and non-treated alike, so is this actually going to get</li>

            <li> Love this shampoo.  Very concentrated.  It leaves my hair clean and soft, and scalp clean.</li>
            <li> 3rd reorder- we love this atiff</li>
            <li> Great shampoo.  It&#x27;s even used in beauty salons.</li>
            <li> My fav these past few months!</li>
            <li> It truly volumizes!  I highly recommend using this line of products if you need a volumizer!  The root lifter is great!</li>
            <li> I have used this for awhile and love it...but have they changed the formula? I have developed a rash on my back and wonder if it&#x27;s not something in the shampoo?</li>

First, did they change the scent?  If they did, I&#x27;d be very upset, because Matrix Amplify and XL share a wonderful clean scent that makes hair smell good and clean for days.  My second concern, was this new formula is for color-treated hair and non-treated alike, so is this actually going to get my hair clean?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report that the scent is exactly the same.

If you were a fan of the XL, you might not like this.  I know some people do like having that bit of residue or weigh down due to their hair not being cleaned thoroughly so their hair doesn&#x27;tlook too fluffy or whatever, and if that&#x27;s you, this shampoo probably isn&#x27;t for you.  But don&#x27;t mistake me saying that because this gets your really clean that it&#x27;s something like a harsh clarifying Sunday shampoo.  It&#x27;s definitely not anything like that.  It&#x27;s just a good shampoo that smells great, get&#x27;s your hair clean (without stripping the life out of it, and without leaving dirty residue behind), and gives lift, bounce, volume, and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the seller packaged item well and it was delivered in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I love my Amplify.  I am no longer a skinny-haired nobody.  My hair does what I tell it to, and looks great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years and have always enjoyed its quality, fragrance and the way it makes my hair look and feel.  The Amazon cost is the cheapest I have found and with Prime shipping it&#x27;s easier than going to the store.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Great deal!</li>
            <li> Very happy with all aspects of my purchase - everything was just as posted - will order again</li>
            <li> This is the product I love but at the salons it is more expensive than what I paid including the shipping.</li>

            <li> Have used this product for years.  Use all of Matrix&#x27;s hair solution lines, from shampoo, conditioner, etc.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Fast shipping! Volumizes you hair and gives shine. Highly recommend for anyone with fine hair. My favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have very fine straight hair. The shampoo helps give it volume.</li>
            <li> Well, it lathers really well.  But now I have to wash my hair every day because it doesn&#x27;t actually clean it very well, even though I lather twice.  It also doesn&#x27;t amplify my hair at all.  I wondered why my Got2Be Glued wasn&#x27;t working--that&#x27;s a little odd since I&#x27;ve been using that for years.  Just not having much luck with shampoos this year.  I&#x27;ve been using this for three weeks and it isn&#x27;t any better than the natural product I tried a few months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had great results for years with Nexxus Diametress Volumizing shampoo, but it looks like they&#x27;ve reformulated it.  I would have reordered the original, but I couldn&#x27;t find the 44 oz. bottles.  So I guess the search continues for a shampoo that will actually amply/bodify/volumize like the companies claim.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, very nice product.</li>
