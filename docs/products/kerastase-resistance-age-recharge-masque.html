            <li>It also can get pretty frizzy and end up limp/dull.</li>

            <li>This product keep my hair moisturized, my natural curls defined</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and manageabale using this product.</li>
            <li>For a pro, it does leave my hair soft, but not that oh so touchable, can&#x27;t help but run my fingers through it soft.</li>
            <li>Since I have been using this conditioner with the shampoo, I&#x27;ve had several people compliment my new hair style (but I haven&#x27;t changed my style!).</li>

            <li> I love Kerastase Resistance Age Recharge Masque--makes my hair soft and manageable again.  Very expensive but worth it. Will continue to use until I can&#x27;t find it any longer</li>
            <li> I chemically treat my frizzy hair and of course each treatment that I do with Kerastase it helps to bring it back the shine and life of my hair. It makes easy to comb as well and it gives me the feel that I just came out of a salon it worked for me.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my hair</li>
            <li> Outstanding product!!!</li>
            <li> My hair texture changed to baby-fine during chemotherapy. I have tried many different&lt;br /&gt;products but my hair was lifeless and /or dry after using them. Today I used Kerastase Age Recharge for the first time and thought I might have to use it a few times to see and feel results. However, after blowing my hair dry, I was elated.

            <li> I read the reviews, and thought this would be awesome! It wasn&#x27;t. I have very fine, chemically treated hair that&#x27;s mostly straight with a little bit of a wave to it. It also can get pretty frizzy and end up limp/dull. I live in Texas so we have hard water, as well, which could be a factor in this. As it is, this product really has done nothing for my hair so far.

            <li> This product helped with my hair loss...I deployed to Afghanistan and lost a lot of hair during my deployment.  I had a lot of stress and this conditioner with the shampoo is a must if you are going into an austere environment.  I wish I had it before I deployed.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a number of Years but my local Salon says it is out of production. Glad to have found it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> My hair feels softer and has less breakage since using.</li>

            <li> I am so glad that I found this product on Amazon.  I began using this product while living in Germany and loved it.  I began losing hair and this definitely helps.</li>
            <li> I really love this one. I actually use it on damp hair and leave it on. I have tried so many different products and this is the perfect one makes smooth my hair</li>
            <li> Excellent deep conditioner, if left in the hair for 20 mins., then rinse thoroughly.  Also has a delicious, fresh scent.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Kerastase product lines for color-treated, moisturizing (thermique), and mature hair (age recharge), and all have been wonderful for my hair. My hair is color-treated, middle-aged, mid-length, and average thickness. Since I have been using this conditioner with the shampoo, I&#x27;ve had several people compliment my new hair style (but I haven&#x27;t changed my style!). I think my hair looks different because it seems fuller, shinier, and healthier.  Even my stylist, who does not know I use Kerastase, commented on how healthy my hair is these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way with this conditioner. I put a small amount (quarter size) on and comb through in the shower. Wait 3 minutes and rinse. I highly recommend it.</li>
