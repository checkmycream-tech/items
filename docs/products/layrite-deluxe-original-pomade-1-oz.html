    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great hold!</li>
            <li>This container is the perfect size for my to go bag.  </li>
            <li>A LOT TO GET A GOOD HOLD !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>Has good texture and great smell.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a good job at taming flyaways either.</li>
            <li>Good hair product.</li>
            <li>Works as advertised and smells good, too.</li>
            <li>good:  </li>
            <li>Great smell and hold much better than some of the others that I tried.</li>
            <li>one star for the price, This stuff cost more than my haircut!  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good product, but your hair isn&#x27;t going to look any better.</li>
            <li>Layrite is a perfect balance of hold and it also makes the hair soft.</li>
            <li>for sure, met my expectations, it says just what it&#x27;s meant to do, &amp;#34;hold like wax, wash out like gel&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>will for sure be buying this pomade againüëçüèª</li>
            <li>I love Layrite</li>
            <li>It arrived fast and in great condition.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again based on the price, and I don&#x27;t think it performs better than Suavecito.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>The ONLY redeeming quality about this pomade is the scent, which is delightful.</li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t like either, it&#x27;s still a better investment.</li>
            <li>Unless you have a mop on top...</li>
            <li>One of the better pomades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love layrite product.</li>
            <li>What you&#x27;re paying for isn&#x27;t he convenience of being able to wash it out each night.</li>
            <li>Layrite pomade, this product is pretty good</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it DOES wash out easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming, it holds well, and the 1 Oz jars are a neat little size perfect for travel and permissible in your carry on.</li>
            <li>This pomade is awesome - it holds but doesn&#x27;t weigh down his hair</li>
            <li>Not to greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Works well for fine hair.</li>
            <li>360 Style wave control pomeade are fantastic options.</li>
            <li>Great for keeping mustache in place but not solid.</li>
            <li>I bought the 1oz package because I wanted to try, but I should have sprung for the 4oz because it is more economical.</li>
            <li>I found another brand that was fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Goes in smooth, washes out clean, holds all day.</li>
            <li>This product is primarily a water/glycerin based pomade, but the super hold version contains some beeswax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both the original and super hold versions with sucess.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff, I thought it was a bigger tub</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product</li>
            <li>The smell is mild.  </li>
            <li>I have to use more of this than I do other products and it still doesn&#x27;t compare to the hold I get elsewhere, and since I wind up using more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best of both worlds, nice hold of petro base pomades, with the rinsibility of waterbase gels, Has this unique vanilla-ish smell, and spreads pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;minus</li>
            <li>Good, but I should of gotten the super hold because of my thick hair.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really been able to settle on a styling cream for keeping the front of my mane in place but Crew was definitely not it.  </li>
            <li>I alternate this with extra hold one from layrite(one in brown case) and it makes my hair look good.</li>
            <li>it certainly did hold in place.</li>
            <li>but it is certainly easier to manage than Crew.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s actually cheaper than most of these new up and coming pomade brands that are $20 and some for 4-6oz tin,&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>I have been using Pluko black and white for so long now that it&#x27;s really the best pomade for me.</li>
            <li>Layrite most certainly is not that product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like gel, but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair as stiff.</li>
            <li>I decided to sample Layrite to see if it was any good before throwing down $15 on the big can.  </li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t put it in if your hair is still kind of wet after a shower, it doesn&#x27;t really stay in the same because it&#x27;s water soluble.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s more like a slightly heavier version of The Body Shop coconut oil hair shine, which I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Layrite gives a high shine and somewhat holds, but not for my thicker hair specifically.  </li>
            <li>Too little,  quality is ok, overpriced</li>
            <li>my stylist recommended this due to my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair and need something strong to hold it down.</li>
            <li>and it is roughly twice the price of other products that do a much better job.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it has a very strong vanilla smell much like Carmex lip balm.  </li>
            <li>There are three main types of pomade: traditional  petrolatum/oil based, glycerin/water based, and beeswax/synthetic wax based.</li>
            <li>He prefers the popular &amp;#34;subtle pompador&amp;#34; haircut but his hair type makes it difficult to achieve.</li>
            <li>I have a giant mop of fine hair, slightly curly, mid 40s and wanted this to keep my hair back and down, but it really doesn&#x27;t have the hold for</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the new container was barely over halfway full.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good, but I should of gotten the super hold because of my thick hair.</li>
            <li> This pomade.....for sure, met my expectations, it says just what it&#x27;s meant to do, &amp;#34;hold like wax, wash out like gel&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I will for sure be buying this pomade againüëçüèª</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff, I thought it was a bigger tub this will last a week...</li>
            <li> I love Layrite but you can&#x27;t take the 4oz container on the airplane (3 oz max). So I went ahead and purchased the 1 oz size. It arrived fast and in great condition. No problems there. Unfortunately, the new container was barely over halfway full. This is the manufacturer&#x27;s fault and not the seller but it was still disappointing. There&#x27;s was about enough Pomade in the jar for 2 MAYBE 3 pomps.</li>
            <li> Layrite pomade, this product is pretty good it holds and not greasy and it hold like wax like it said.</li>
            <li> What is in this stuff that makes it so expensive?  Keep in mind, this product contains ONE OUNCE.  There is a competing product by Suavecito that gives you FOUR ounces for a similar price.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again based on the price, and I don&#x27;t think it performs better than Suavecito.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I know a lot of young guys like to use this for their slick back or madmen style haircut, it&#x27;s just not for me. I have been using Pluko black and white for so long now that it&#x27;s really the best pomade for me. It&#x27;s a great product i think if you prefer stuff that&#x27;s not greasy, but there was something about it i just don&#x27;t like. It&#x27;s kind of like gel, but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair as stiff. Maybe there&#x27;s different kinds from Layrite. Who knows maybe in the future i&#x27;ll change my mind, but until then I just give it three stars.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy the 1oz, buy the biggest container they sell on Amazon. Goes in smooth, washes out clean, holds all day. I prefer it to Suavacito.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying this product simply is not worth the money. It does not hold well and it is roughly twice the price of other products that do a much better job. I have to use more of this than I do other products and it still doesn&#x27;t compare to the hold I get elsewhere, and since I wind up using more it looks greasier. Speaking of grease, when I try to touch it up throughout the day it does leave a residue on my hands. It doesn&#x27;t do a good job at taming flyaways either. The ONLY redeeming quality about this pomade is the scent, which is delightful. I find it very unfortunate that this is by far the best smelling product I&#x27;ve tried recently, yet easily the worst in terms of performance. Save your money, try out Suavecito or Tres Flores. You can probably get both of those combined for the price of a 4oz. container of this and if you don&#x27;t like either, it&#x27;s still a better investment.</li>
            <li> Great hold! Not to greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Works well for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have a giant mop of fine hair, slightly curly, mid 40s and wanted this to keep my hair back and down, but it really doesn&#x27;t have the hold for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more like a slightly heavier version of The Body Shop coconut oil hair shine, which I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the hold scale I would give:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body Shop hair shine &#x3D; 1&lt;br /&gt;Layrite Pomade &#x3D; 2&lt;br /&gt;Old Spice Spiffy &#x3D; 8&lt;br /&gt;FX Molding Wax &#x3D; 9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t found a 10 yet.</li>
            <li> Layrite has been the worst pomeade I have used thus far. I have wavy hair and need something strong to hold it down. Layrite most certainly is not that product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something stronger, Suavacito or S-curl 360 Style wave control pomeade are fantastic options.</li>
            <li> So I have tried a bunch of different pomades to see which one works for me and my hair.  Layrite gives a high shine and somewhat holds, but not for my thicker hair specifically.  It&#x27;s a thin pomade, probably the thinnest I&#x27;ve come across which doesn&#x27;t satisfy my hair.  You really can&#x27;t put it in if your hair is still kind of wet after a shower, it doesn&#x27;t really stay in the same because it&#x27;s water soluble.  It&#x27;s not a bad product but I would suggest this specific one to people with thin/less hair.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy, not too stiff.  Only need a small amount to do the job.  Unless you have a mop on top...</li>
            <li> Great for keeping mustache in place but not solid.</li>
            <li> I had never been a pomade person. my stylist recommended this due to my fine hair. I like that it isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> DO NOT LIKE THE HOLD ON THIS YOU HAVE TO PUT A LOT I MEAN A LOT TO GET A GOOD HOLD !</li>
            <li> One of the better pomades I&#x27;ve used. I bought the 1oz package because I wanted to try, but I should have sprung for the 4oz because it is more economical. I was using Suavecito but found that even the classic made my hair too hard and dry. I also alternate between water based and petroleum based (Murray&#x27;s) but hate that it is impossible to wash out. Layrite is a perfect balance of hold and it also makes the hair soft.</li>
            <li> I found the Layrite Pomade a bit hard to work with once I got it worked into my hair it certainly did hold in place. Unfortunately it has a very strong vanilla smell much like Carmex lip balm.  Although I do like vanilla, I found it the fragrance pretty annoying by day two of use.  I found another brand that was fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crew Grooming Cream for about six months now.  I haven&#x27;t really been able to settle on a styling cream for keeping the front of my mane in place but Crew was definitely not it.  I decided to sample Layrite to see if it was any good before throwing down $15 on the big can.  Glad I did. This container is the perfect size for my to go bag.  The smell is mild.  A little bit of coco butter, not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing it does help with is the constant flaking that pomades or creams like this cause.  I need to wash my hair out every 1-2 days to keep up with the flakes caused by styling products and with really long hair, this can be kind of annoying.  It is not without flakes but it is certainly easier to manage than Crew.  I&#x27;ll stick with it for at least another can.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best of both worlds, nice hold of petro base pomades, with the rinsibility of waterbase gels, Has this unique vanilla-ish smell, and spreads pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;minus one star for the price, This stuff cost more than my haircut!  But it&#x27;s actually cheaper than most of these new up and coming pomade brands that are $20 and some for 4-6oz tin,&lt;br /&gt;Try it and see for youtself.</li>
            <li> Good hair product. I like it lot. I love layrite product. Has good texture and great smell. I alternate this with extra hold one from layrite(one in brown case) and it makes my hair look good.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and smells good, too. Price wasn&#x27;t that competitive based on the costs I&#x27;ve seen for the same product in retail outlets.</li>
            <li> Too little,  quality is ok, overpriced</li>
            <li> Boyfriend has thin (not thinning, just fine and thin), wavy hair. He prefers the popular &amp;#34;subtle pompador&amp;#34; haircut but his hair type makes it difficult to achieve. This pomade is awesome - it holds but doesn&#x27;t weigh down his hair and there&#x27;s no greasy or sticky mess.</li>
            <li> Great smell and hold much better than some of the others that I tried.</li>
            <li> There are three main types of pomade: traditional  petrolatum/oil based, glycerin/water based, and beeswax/synthetic wax based. This product is primarily a water/glycerin based pomade, but the super hold version contains some beeswax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:  I like layrite. I&#x27;ve used both the original and super hold versions with sucess. the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming, it holds well, and the 1 Oz jars are a neat little size perfect for travel and permissible in your carry on. Most importantly, it DOES wash out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: it&#x27;s freaking expensive. Like, an order of magnitude more expensive than petroleum or animal wax based products. For the price of 1 ounce of layrite you can get 6 to 10 Oz of those products. Of course, they don&#x27;t wash out the same, but they do smell just as nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;conclusion: make no mistake, it&#x27;s a good product, but your hair isn&#x27;t going to look any better. What you&#x27;re paying for isn&#x27;t he convenience of being able to wash it out each night.</li>
