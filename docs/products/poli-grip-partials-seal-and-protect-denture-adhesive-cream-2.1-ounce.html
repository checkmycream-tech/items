            <li> Apparently I got the last one ...</li>
            <li> It takes a few days until you figure out that you have to apply the cream to the wet partial, and know how much cream you have to use</li>
            <li> I did not realize I was getting just a regular size tube that I have bought previously at the drug store for a 3rd of the price.</li>
            <li> My dentist offered me a sample of Poligrip for Partials when I was having difficulty keeping my partial anchored.  </li>
            <li> very hard to find at decent price</li>
            <li> This particular one has apparently been discontinued, so, yes I was desperate.  </li>
            <li> holds tight</li>
            <li> Only problem is that it&#x27;s WAY too expensive.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my dad because it was sooo hard to find in stock in the stores...</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff I done why they stop getting it where I live.</li>
            <li> I use it daily on my partials.</li>
            <li> The item was so dramatically overpriced that it should have been 14 karat gold, not denture cream.  This particular one has apparently been discontinued, so, yes I was desperate.  But, still, shame on Amazon for even presenting it.</li>
            <li> works as advertised. holds tight</li>
            <li> I used it to repair my crown and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> My dentist offered me a sample of Poligrip for Partials when I was having difficulty keeping my partial anchored.  This product works wonderfully for me and holds all day.  I also like that it is white and has no offending taste.  I can&#x27;t find it in the stores here, so am grateful that Amazon stocks it.....and it was delivered in two days!!!</li>
            <li> It takes a few days until you figure out that you have to apply the cream to the wet partial, and know how much cream you have to use&lt;br /&gt;so it will be holding well all day.&lt;br /&gt;When you figured it out, it works well!</li>
            <li> Excellent for partials. Just the right amount of adhesiveness. Only problem is that it&#x27;s WAY too expensive.</li>
            <li> I really used this until my partials were fixed.  Now I don&#x27;t need it but it is great when You need it</li>
            <li> overpriced product and shipping charges.</li>
            <li> It is the only product that I have used that works.  I am 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my dad because it was sooo hard to find in stock in the stores... He loved it!</li>
            <li> very hard to find at decent price</li>
            <li> Received open Poli-Grip  box as if had been used.  Not happy. Product itself is 5 star.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Apparently I got the last one ...hope you are able to get more of this size.</li>
            <li> Of all the denture adhesives this works best for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but a rip off on the price. I bought the 2.1 oz tube, but somehow because of the price . I thought I was getting more.  I did not realize I was getting just a regular size tube that I have bought previously at the drug store for a 3rd of the price. Live and learn.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well and holds, seemingly, longer than Poligrip&#x27;s regular denture cream.</li>
            <li> Great purchase thanks</li>
