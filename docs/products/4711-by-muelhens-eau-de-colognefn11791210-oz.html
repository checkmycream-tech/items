            <li>The wash is refreshing and yet does not linger to overwhelm those around you.</li>
            <li>Amazon says I need 17 more words --  </li>
            <li>I have since read that it was also John F. Kennedy&#x27;s favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>It is an elegant scent you can wear all day.</li>

            <li>My mother grew up in Europe, where she was very familiar with this fragrance.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and refreshing, a gem.</li>
            <li>The price was good and it came much faster than they told me</li>
            <li>Still a favorite, and still an original.</li>
            <li>easy on the nose.....</li>
            <li>this price is a good value from what I normally pay.</li>
            <li>For more than 200 years, the light, clean scent of 4711 has been a summertime favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light, citrusy scent that feels refreshing on the skin and quickly vanishes.</li>
            <li>Another issue was weeding through the huge number of choices for this product.</li>
            <li>perfectly light...</li>
            <li>This is the original cologne from the source; Koln, Germany.</li>
            <li>One of the original colognes imported into the USA.  </li>
            <li>I discovered that I had a sensitivity to all deodorants and antiperspirants as they caused significant rashes under my arms.  </li>
            <li>fresh lemons in summer!</li>
            <li>I can only say, it is a very &#x27;old&#x27; product, but still has a wonderful clean smell.</li>
            <li>even the last bottle of 4711 I bought (at one of those discount storefronts in the mall) was huge, inexpensive, and didn&#x27;t ever really smell as great as I recalled.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s light, unisex and have that fresh</li>
            <li>so it is tried and true.</li>
            <li>A bottle lasts a very long time so a good purchase.</li>
            <li>It is for men and women, very crisp, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Product always exceeds expectations and I always receive comments on its fresh pleasing fragrance.</li>
            <li>Not overbearing at all, just fresh.</li>
            <li>A light truly masculine cologne with a light fresh</li>
            <li>❤️ Recommend for all who like citrus and fresh</li>
            <li>Farina became a successful perfumier and sold his unique distillation process to a major German perfume house.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Women of the day loved Eau de Cologne, finding it a cool, refreshing alternative to heavy the heavy floral perfumes that were popular at the time.</li>
            <li>perfectly right for summer</li>
            <li>Classic clean scent.......</li>
            <li>First bought this on a trip to Germany years ago</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have been using 4711 eau de cologne for years, and this is the first time I ordered it online.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely herbal, light as a breeze, and a matchless way to keep cool and collected when the those around you are melting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When nights are so hot they leave you breathless,</li>
            <li>So many fruity vanilla blends are being churned out under the names of various celebrities, do we now think perfume is supposed to smell like candy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My German grandmother always wears this and it brings back such wonderful memories.  </li>
            <li>Someone told me about this unisex cologne, maybe when this had first came out</li>
            <li>Love the smell and it&#x27;s definitely manly</li>
            <li>I am a 71 year old woman originally from Switzerland.  </li>
            <li>I threw away my last bottle of Old Spice because it started smelling kind of &#x27;off&#x27; after a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;4711 is still an essential summer fragrance for stylish European women -- as important a style statement as their sunglasses.</li>
            <li>love the classic smell, wish it was longer lasting.</li>
            <li>When he arrived in his new land, he revealed a new distillation process that resulted in a lighter, more delicate kind of perfume, naming both the process and the product after his new town.</li>
            <li>but it is much too light.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I remember this cologne very well visiting Germany as a child.  </li>
            <li>for the price, can&#x27;t complain too much.  </li>
            <li>but the scent dissipates way too fast.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still made in Germany...and most importantly, it still gives me that subtle, intangible pleasure when I smell it.</li>
            <li>The one and only original cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Echt</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sadly, this historic and unique fragrance has lost its cachet in the U.S.</li>
            <li>It was the original Eau de Cologne, created by a Spanish gentleman named Farina who emigrated to Germany.</li>
            <li>There is a long history about this cologne and its origins including why it is called &amp;#34;4711&amp;#34; but this is a very pleasing masculine scent with strong notes of orange citrus and vetiver.</li>
            <li>Although the scent has an interesting history dating back centuries, the scent does not last for more than a few minutes on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I know this classic aroma from my early childhood, when it was on me!</li>
            <li>closest thing I could find to my favorite Gerlaine&#x27;s Extra Dry, which is no longer made.</li>
            <li>There is no trace of the lemon but only a clear smell of rubbing alcohol, and that&#x27;s a pretty hefty price to pay!  </li>
            <li>live abroad and had someone bring me the package.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a refreshing smell, is not overwhelming but also does not stay with you all day.</li>
            <li>The label is named after the street address in Cologne and was the first place that had such a numbered address.</li>
            <li>So, I was glad to find it again on Amazon after checking in local stores with no success.  </li>
            <li>and I just naturally have used it since being very young.  </li>
            <li>Gray Flannel, Paco Rabanne, and even Old Spice.</li>
            <li>Delivery was early.</li>
            <li>Smells quite natural, no synthetic qualities.</li>
            <li>not too old fasioned ......</li>
            <li>even though it is an old scent that has been around</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy, long-lasting perfume, like something you might put on to go out for the evening.</li>
            <li>One day I found and old bottle of 4711 and used it.  </li>
            <li>I find the splash scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I finally decided to buy the 10 oz classic Eau de Cologne, and it came today.</li>
            <li>When I opened the cap to take in that refreshing, uplifting lemony smell that I love about 4711, I was greatly disappointed and upset.</li>
            <li>I always go back to buying it especially when the weather turns hot.  </li>
            <li>A re-visit to a different cultural norm.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to stop using them and tried other kinds of fragrances such as perfumes, lotion, oils, and nothing really worked.  </li>
            <li>carry a small bottle in my purse to use as hand sanitizer and a few drops on a hotel pillow makes me sleep better.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if it&#x27;s any good, but it&#x27;s less expensive on amazon than retail stores.</li>

            <li> When I opened the cap to take in that refreshing, uplifting lemony smell that I love about 4711, I was greatly disappointed and upset.</li>

            <li> I had to stop using them and tried other kinds of fragrances such as perfumes, lotion, oils, and nothing really worked.  </li>
            <li> carry a small bottle in my purse to use as hand sanitizer and a few drops on a hotel pillow makes me sleep better.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if it&#x27;s any good, but it&#x27;s less expensive on amazon than retail stores.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh citrusy, neroli smell with a light woody base.</li>
            <li> Nothing is as fresh yet as non irritating to others as 47-11.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really last very long, but this is an eau de cologne, so that&#x27;s to be expected.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll be using this for a wonderfully long time!</li>
            <li> the scent does not linger very long</li>
            <li> For such a historical scent, this smells modern and casual.</li>
            <li> But there came a day when I finally broke down and bought some.  </li>
            <li> the next morning, it had dried up.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> an icy spritz on bed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got lots of other colognes on my &#x27;favorites&#x27; list:</li>

            <li> Unfortunately, it became harder and harder for her to find.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I will not buy it again and do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> but there is no pleasant lingering aroma !!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve lost the money, and 4711 has lost a long-standing customer.</li>
            <li> My Mom used to wear this cologne, having immigrated from Europe, so this is a nostalgic memory of her.  </li>
            <li> Sadly.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in my purchase , the 4711 aroma for my aftershave cologne had no aroma whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but all I can say is this cologne smell awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn 4711 on and off for over 40 years. I&#x27;ve got lots of other colognes on my &#x27;favorites&#x27; list: Gray Flannel, Paco Rabanne, and even Old Spice. What I&#x27;ve found recently is that they don&#x27;t seem to hold up so well...even the last bottle of 4711 I bought (at one of those discount storefronts in the mall) was huge, inexpensive, and didn&#x27;t ever really smell as great as I recalled. I threw away my last bottle of Old Spice because it started smelling kind of &#x27;off&#x27; after a couple of weeks.  When I read some of the reviews for 4711 here on Amazon, I was concerned, because they were saying it&#x27;s no longer made in Europe, the ingredients have changed, etc. Another issue was weeding through the huge number of choices for this product. I finally decided to buy the 10 oz classic Eau de Cologne, and it came today. I opened it and splashed a bit on with some trepidation, but am very happy to report it came in the original box with the company insert...it&#x27;s still made in Germany...and most importantly, it still gives me that subtle, intangible pleasure when I smell it. Still a favorite, and still an original.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend loves it as aftershave. Classic clean scent.......</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll be using this for a wonderfully long time!</li>
            <li> I remembered this fragrance from years ago and all the girls wore it. So, I was glad to find it again on Amazon after checking in local stores with no success.  Unfortunately, I will not buy it again and do not recommend it. Although the scent has an interesting history dating back centuries, the scent does not last for more than a few minutes on my skin.  Perhaps, it&#x27;s my skin type.  I thought the 4711 would be similar to Jean Nate but it is much too light.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a refreshing splash on after showering but there is no pleasant lingering aroma !!  So, think twice about it and know your skin type and how you carry scents.</li>
            <li> I remember this cologne very well visiting Germany as a child.  I had to buy it, it&#x27;s a very light and refreshing scent.  Not too flowery and the scent does not linger very long but I love the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li> I am a 71 year old woman originally from Switzerland.  My mother (German) used this product all her life and I just naturally have used it since being very young.  It is still the product I splash on daily.  It is not overpowering and I don&#x27;t worry about bothering others.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I do splash this generously after my shower. It&#x27;s a refreshing smell, is not overwhelming but also does not stay with you all day. First bought this on a trip to Germany years ago and it&#x27;s as nice as I remember. So happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My german grandmother always wears 4711 (xmas present!)and this price is a good value from what I normally pay. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Quality product with class and consistency for years. Delivery was early. Product always exceeds expectations and I always receive comments on its fresh pleasing fragrance.</li>
            <li> 4711 is one of the oldest fragrance i know of that&#x27;s light, unisex and have that fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent cologne! There is a long history about this cologne and its origins including why it is called &amp;#34;4711&amp;#34; but this is a very pleasing masculine scent with strong notes of orange citrus and vetiver. Very similar to Guerlain&#x27;s Imperiale for men.</li>
            <li> This is the original cologne from the source; Koln, Germany. The label is named after the street address in Cologne and was the first place that had such a numbered address. The wash is refreshing and yet does not linger to overwhelm those around you. It wakes you up and starts you on your way.</li>
            <li> Good clean smelling cologne. Not offensive.</li>
            <li> The one and only original cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Echt Kolnisch Wasser</li>
            <li> I have always liked this cologne but this time I had given it as a Christmas gift.  I am sure the recipient loved it or else I would have heard about it.</li>
            <li> A very good after shave, not to strong. A bottle lasts a very long time so a good purchase. A plus product</li>
            <li> A re-visit to a different cultural norm.&lt;br /&gt;Subtle elegance for anyone not minding fleeting fragrance....</li>
            <li> I have always liked this clean, refreshing fragrance for warm weather.</li>
            <li> This is great! It has a fresh citrusy, neroli smell with a light woody base. Smells quite natural, no synthetic qualities. And it feels very refreshing when I splash it on. Gorgeous bottle too! It doesn&#x27;t really last very long, but this is an eau de cologne, so that&#x27;s to be expected.  For such a historical scent, this smells modern and casual. And the price point can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> great product;not over-powering;pleasant scent....easy on the nose.....kudos.....not too old fasioned ......even though it is an old scent that has been around</li>
            <li> It brings back childhood memories for me. When I had a headache, my mother put a moist washcloth with a little 4711 on my forehead. It still relaxes me, when I use it for a tension headache.&lt;br /&gt;Also later as a teenager I put some of it on a pesky bump on my face and the next morning, it had dried up.&lt;br /&gt;I carry a small bottle in my purse to use as hand sanitizer and a few drops on a hotel pillow makes me sleep better.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  My wife uses it and we give it as a gift also.</li>
            <li> Great clean smell!  Amazon says I need 17 more words --  I can only say, it is a very &#x27;old&#x27; product, but still has a wonderful clean smell.</li>
            <li> I know this classic aroma from my early childhood, when it was on me! I still use it to this day.</li>
            <li> I have been using 4711 eau de cologne for years, and this is the first time I ordered it online.  When I opened the cap to take in that refreshing, uplifting lemony smell that I love about 4711, I was greatly disappointed and upset. There is no trace of the lemon but only a clear smell of rubbing alcohol, and that&#x27;s a pretty hefty price to pay!  Has 4711 moved to another neighborhood?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live abroad and had someone bring me the package.  I decided it was too much trouble to have him return it.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve lost the money, and 4711 has lost a long-standing customer.</li>
            <li> In order to appreciate 4711, you have to understand what it is. It&#x27;s not a heavy, long-lasting perfume, like something you might put on to go out for the evening. It&#x27;s a light, citrusy scent that feels refreshing on the skin and quickly vanishes. The aroma reemerges when you rub the area (or someone else does) or you perspire. For this reason, the fragrance is something of a private virtue. It was introduced to me by a well-known conductor who liked the way it disappeared but then reasserted itself once he took up the baton. I have since read that it was also John F. Kennedy&#x27;s favorite cologne. It is an elegant scent you can wear all day.</li>
            <li> I have used this product on and off for many years.  I always go back to buying it especially when the weather turns hot.  It simply refreshing!</li>
            <li> My Mom used to wear this cologne, having immigrated from Europe, so this is a nostalgic memory of her.  It&#x27;s truly unisex with sandalwood and citrus notes.  Not overbearing at all, just fresh.</li>
            <li> For more than 200 years, the light, clean scent of 4711 has been a summertime favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is described as lavendar, citrus, mint -- I don&#x27;t think anyone has ever pinned it down. It&#x27;s definitely herbal, light as a breeze, and a matchless way to keep cool and collected when the those around you are melting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always keep my 4711 in the refrigerator. On a sultry summer day, a little splash chills the body and refreshes the soul.  When nights are so hot they leave you breathless, an icy spritz on bed linens cools them down and makes them as inviting as a drift of snow...and as you sleep, now and then a trace of that herbal aroma will float past you, soothing an overheated mind and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, this historic and unique fragrance has lost its cachet in the U.S. Several reviewers are dismayed by the aromatic herbal scent. So many fruity vanilla blends are being churned out under the names of various celebrities, do we now think perfume is supposed to smell like candy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4711 is still an essential summer fragrance for stylish European women -- as important a style statement as their sunglasses. And it&#x27;s been that way for more than 200 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4711 has a fascinating history.  It was the original Eau de Cologne, created by a Spanish gentleman named Farina who emigrated to Germany. When he arrived in his new land, he revealed a new distillation process that resulted in a lighter, more delicate kind of perfume, naming both the process and the product after his new town. Think about it...had he chosen another city, we&#x27;d be splashing ourselves with with Eau de Dusseldorf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women of the day loved Eau de Cologne, finding it a cool, refreshing alternative to heavy the heavy floral perfumes that were popular at the time. Farina became a successful perfumier and sold his unique distillation process to a major German perfume house. To this day, all scents distilled in this manner are known as eau de cologne.  To avoid confusion (and probably lawsuits) Farina renamed his signature scent, calling it 4711...the address on his front door. So there you have it: 4711 Eau de Cologne, a historic fragrance -- and a mailing address, all in one.avoid confusion (and probably lawsuits) Farina renamed his signature scent, calling it 4711...the address on his front door.

            <li> Nothing is as fresh yet as non irritating to others as 47-11. My husband has worn nothing else since finding this in 1968. It is timelessly fabulous!!!</li>
            <li> One of the original colognes imported into the USA.  A light truly masculine cologne with a light fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002V0ALLK/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> I found this some years ago and it has been my anytime favorite ever sense. My Grand Daughters Love it Also. I recommend it to anyone. This has been around several hundred years so it is tried and true.</li>
            <li> I have used and loved this cologne since I was a child. Up until my mid to late 30s, I had no objectionable odor and did not wear deodorants.  But there came a day when I finally broke down and bought some.  I discovered that I had a sensitivity to all deodorants and antiperspirants as they caused significant rashes under my arms.  I had to stop using them and tried other kinds of fragrances such as perfumes, lotion, oils, and nothing really worked.  One day I found and old bottle of 4711 and used it.  It works wonderfully well, maybe because of the high alcohol content, and is not overpowering.  I think it works better than deodorants, etc. and is not objectionable at all.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> closest thing I could find to my favorite Gerlaine&#x27;s Extra Dry, which is no longer made. Sadly. It was one of my summer favorites.</li>
            <li> Original formula cologne at a great price point.</li>
            <li> Always a favorite for its refreshing fragrance.</li>
            <li> My German grandmother always wears this and it brings back such wonderful memories.  The scent is light and refreshing, a gem.</li>
            <li> Someone told me about this unisex cologne, maybe when this had first came out it was a good product. I don&#x27;t know, but all I can say is this cologne smell awful. The scent does not even last for an hour.</li>
            <li> fresh lemons in summer!</li>
            <li> Mt wife likes this stuff. I have no idea if it&#x27;s any good, but it&#x27;s less expensive on amazon than retail stores. If it makes the wife happy....</li>
            <li> love the classic smell, wish it was longer lasting. for the price, can&#x27;t complain too much.  did i mention i wish it was longer lasting?</li>
            <li> My mother grew up in Europe, where she was very familiar with this fragrance. She wore it all the time when I was growing up. Unfortunately, it became harder and harder for her to find. She was thrilled when I presented her with this bottle for her birthday. The price was good and it came much faster than they told me it would, which pleased me to no end.</li>
            <li> Same as it ever was....perfectly light...perfectly right for summer and ...IT&#x27;s unisex! PERFECT❤️❤️❤️ Recommend for all who like citrus and fresh</li>
            <li> Recipient adored this.</li>
            <li> It is for men and women, very crisp, fresh scent. But Ive only known women to wear it in Germany.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it&#x27;s definitely manly but the scent dissipates way too fast.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in my purchase , the 4711 aroma for my aftershave cologne had no aroma whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I love 4711 but I don&#x27;t think the splash version is the best product for me.  Next time I will try the spray cologne.  I find the splash scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last more than a few minutes.  Perfect though for after shower or a quick pick me up.</li>
