            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Over all I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>Really beautiful colors that work nice</li>
            <li>so I could write a good review,</li>
            <li>I used this the day it arrived and loved it.</li>
            <li>it IS acrylic powder I am very pleased</li>
            <li>Does the job with 3D art and has nice pigmentation</li>
            <li>Nice color, but</li>
            <li>They loved it :)</li>
            <li>On top of that, it took over two months to be delivered.</li>
            <li>it is not what I order it more like the fuzzy stuff for nail art</li>
            <li>The mixture of the powders should be slightly more acrylic powder than color.  </li>
            <li>Put in a jar with the color set on top to show.  </li>
            <li>Shipped to me very quickly.</li>
            <li>i bought acryilic color powder , what i got was not so it had fine hairs</li>
            <li>Overall great for nail art.</li>
            <li>after i cleaned them up, i was excited about all of the colors.</li>
            <li>The product came quickly too.</li>
            <li>my husband and I share the same amazon account, lol) and this is something that often confuses people who don&#x27;t know that most of these colored acrylic powders will need actual acrylic powder added.  </li>
            <li>Just wish colors were the right colors.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and beautiful and are strong and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Its exactly what the description says..</li>
            <li>exactly what i needed</li>
            <li>First of all the power is not powder is NOT ACRYLIC</li>
            <li>I did not check the reviews first, and wish I had...</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTE WAISTE !</li>
            <li>But if needing a certain color that would have to be purchased separately.</li>
            <li>Very opaque and vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>I have like a refund or send back the order with full barrel</li>
            <li>The plastic box it came in was COMPLETELY COVERED in acrylic powder!!</li>
            <li>when i first used them i chose the bright pink, and every bead was either too wet or too dry.</li>
            <li>This is better in my opinion because these go so much further than the pre-mixed ones that are the same price and same size.&lt;br</li>
            <li>its okay wish the texture was a little different..</li>
            <li>I would like to state and make it clear that this is an acrylic pigment ADDITIVE.  </li>
            <li>I opened them and the ones i got ARE acrylic and not fluffy..</li>
            <li>same thing happened with every color i have tried so far.</li>
            <li>I have 4 different greens, an orange color, brown color, Magenta (which looks very pretty), Black, White, purple, Neon orange, and yellowish color...</li>
            <li>Acrylic pigment needs to be mixed with white, clear (my personal recommendation), or pink acrylic powder so that it will attach to your nails.  </li>

            <li> i was excited about the price and the size of these, but unfortunately this is a get what you pay for type off situation.</li>
            <li> But did Not get the dark blue.</li>
            <li> containers were not well sealed, so I had powder loose in the packaging...</li>
            <li> not much like i see on the pic</li>
            <li> is  not  really color</li>
            <li> acrylic powder is some other stuff I didn&#x27;t want I bought it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the product ,some of the colors were half empty and some didn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> It was small containers.the shipping package was well protected but there was loose acrylic powder everywhere.</li>
            <li> Acrylic is technically a term referring to ALL nail enhancements but in the field is typically only used for the fake tips with acrylic powder used, hence the confusion here.</li>
            <li> Half and half works or you can make it go farther with 3parts acrylic and 1part color.</li>
            <li> when received in the mail, some were opened and it was a mess.</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed to see all the color acrylic was only a quarter filled,  a waist of hard earn money!</li>
            <li> Was not powder, just some fluffy stuff, i havent even tried to use it and probably will not use it.</li>
            <li> These are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> So not only was it packaged poorly and one of the jars was cracked and got dust everywhere</li>
            <li> After I saw what everyone was saying I was worried I had wasted my money</li>
            <li> This makes the colors go much further, and unfortunately there is not a set mixing ratio so you need to do a trial and error.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure where it was from.</li>
            <li> Other than that i was NOT HAPPY!!!</li>
            <li> i recieved a fluffy substance please save your money and do not buy this at all a waiste of money !!</li>
            <li> I was not happy with my item.</li>
            <li> Product poorly packaged...basically put in an envelope to be sent from China?</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s false advertisement  for people that want to get acrylic</li>
            <li> and I wish the supplier would stop with the false advertising and describe it for what it is.</li>
            <li> fluffy weird embossing powder!</li>
            <li> Oh and there was a little powder in the box but nothing to bad.</li>
            <li> The little jars were covered in acrylic powder as well!!!!</li>
            <li> If i would&#x27;ve at least recieved all of the colors shown in the picture, i wouldn&#x27;t be as mad as i am.</li>
            <li> by the time I get this returned and try to get something else here, I will have forgotten I ordered it...very disappointing.</li>
            <li> :-(&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> so disappointed.</li>
            <li> i couldnt shape anything to save my life and the finished look was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The packaging was terrible, the product was a lent like dust substance.</li>

            <li> Does the job with 3D art and has nice pigmentation</li>
            <li> Its exactly what the description says.. The product came quickly too.</li>
            <li> This is not acrylic glitter powder, this is glitter powder. Not what I wanted😟</li>
            <li> This product is not acrylic it&#x27;s flocking powder and the description said its acrylic it&#x27;s false advertisement  for people that want to get acrylic</li>
            <li> Do not buy!!!!! Was disapointed when i received this product. Was not powder, just some fluffy stuff, i havent even tried to use it and probably will not use it. Wont buy this again!</li>
            <li> Nice color, but not much like i see on the pic</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the product ,some of the colors were half empty and some didn&#x27;t have. I have like a refund or send back the order with full barrel so I could write a good review,</li>
            <li> Shipped to me very quickly. I did NOT get the colors shown in pictures.. I have 4 different greens, an orange color, brown color, Magenta (which looks very pretty), Black, White, purple, Neon orange, and yellowish color... I mainly ordered this for black and BLUE.. But did Not get the dark blue. :-(&lt;br /&gt;But Some reviews where saying this was not acrylic.. I opened them and the ones i got ARE acrylic and not fluffy.. Over all I am happy with it. Just wish colors were the right colors. Oh and there was a little powder in the box but nothing to bad. Over all I would probably purchase it again. But if needing a certain color that would have to be purchased separately.</li>
            <li> exactly what i needed</li>
            <li> I ordered this for the specific color and size (jumbo), but it wasn&#x27;t either. On top of that, it took over two months to be delivered.</li>
            <li> First of all the power is not powder is NOT ACRYLIC, IT IS NOT ACRYLICCCCC THIS IS A STEALLLL . I will never purchase it again buuuuuuu</li>
            <li> These are a waste of money. It fuzz in a jar. You cant make a bead with it. I wanted to throw away but I decided you can use it to create the fuzzy nail art. Use brush on glue and dip your nail into this product..it&#x27;s definitely NOT 3d powder acrylic and I wish the supplier would stop with the false advertising and describe it for what it is.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with my item. it is not what I order it more like the fuzzy stuff for nail art and I order the color acrylic. So I have to wait to see how I will like the product once I receive it.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for somoene. They loved it :)</li>
            <li> Hi I like the colors but are Brock battles</li>
            <li> its okay wish the texture was a little different..</li>
            <li> i bought acryilic color powder , what i got was not so it had fine hairs and you could not form like acryilic at all DO NOT BUY THIS SAVE YOUR MONEY i wish i would have</li>
            <li> I would like to state and make it clear that this is an acrylic pigment ADDITIVE.  Those commenting about how it doesn&#x27;t work do not know the difference.  Acrylic pigment needs to be mixed with white, clear (my personal recommendation), or pink acrylic powder so that it will attach to your nails.  You use a mixture of 50% acetone and 50% acrylic liquid to apply it.  The mixture of the powders should be slightly more acrylic powder than color.  This makes the colors go much further, and unfortunately there is not a set mixing ratio so you need to do a trial and error.  This is better in my opinion because these go so much further than the pre-mixed ones that are the same price and same size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a nail tech student (my husband and I share the same amazon account, lol) and this is something that often confuses people who don&#x27;t know that most of these colored acrylic powders will need actual acrylic powder added.  Acrylic is technically a term referring to ALL nail enhancements but in the field is typically only used for the fake tips with acrylic powder used, hence the confusion here.</li>
            <li> i was excited about the price and the size of these, but unfortunately this is a get what you pay for type off situation. when received in the mail, some were opened and it was a mess. after i cleaned them up, i was excited about all of the colors. when i first used them i chose the bright pink, and every bead was either too wet or too dry. i couldnt shape anything to save my life and the finished look was very disappointing. same thing happened with every color i have tried so far. wont buy them again</li>
            <li> So not only was it packaged poorly and one of the jars was cracked and got dust everywhere but its not even acrylic!! its embossing powder!! fluffy weird embossing powder! what the heck?!? def returning!</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed to see all the color acrylic was only a quarter filled,  a waist of hard earn money! never again!</li>
            <li> This product is just a color pigment, so I mixed with my acrylic. Half and half works or you can make it go farther with 3parts acrylic and 1part color. Put in a jar with the color set on top to show.  Really beautiful colors that work nice once you do the mixing!</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail yesterday and it is NOT acrylic powder. It has the texture of dryer lint. I think if you are going to sell something on Amazon it should be the actual product.</li>
            <li> This garbage they sent is not even acrylic nail material.  It literally looks like colored wood pulp or dryer lint or even fiberglass or asbestos.  I no way is this a beauty medium.  They refunded my cost, but I wanted the acrylic powder.  The supplier for this seller should be ashamed for scamming. so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Product poorly packaged...basically put in an envelope to be sent from China? I did not check the reviews first, and wish I had...containers were not well sealed, so I had powder loose in the packaging...the colors for this package were not as advertised, and it took over a month to get it...by the time I get this returned and try to get something else here, I will have forgotten I ordered it...very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I gave this product one star because the product came in BEFORE the time it was estimated to arrive at. Other than that i was NOT HAPPY!!! I did not recieve all of the colors shown in the picture!! I did not even recieve a blue color!!! The plastic box it came in was COMPLETELY COVERED in acrylic powder!! The little jars were covered in acrylic powder as well!!!! If i would&#x27;ve at least recieved all of the colors shown in the picture, i wouldn&#x27;t be as mad as i am. Hopefully they improve on their customer service!!!!</li>
            <li> I used this the day it arrived and loved it. The colors are vibrant and beautiful and are strong and long lasting.</li>
            <li> There was different colors but it was not jumbo. It was small containers.the shipping package was well protected but there was loose acrylic powder everywhere. It wasn&#x27;t from the containers so I&#x27;m not sure where it was from. Overall great for nail art.</li>
            <li> I order this without reading the reviews. After I saw what everyone was saying I was worried I had wasted my money but I got my order on time and it IS acrylic powder I am very pleased</li>
            <li> the product was not as promised i didnt even recieve acrylic i recieved a fluffy substance please save your money and do not buy this at all a waiste of money !! ABSOLUTE WAISTE !</li>
            <li> is  not  really color acrylic powder is some other stuff I didn&#x27;t want I bought it cause It said it was color acrylic powder</li>
            <li> This is not acrylic I repeat THIS IS NOT ACRYLIC. The packaging was terrible, the product was a lent like dust substance. I was upset to know I waisted my money but hopefully I can save someone else from wasting theirs</li>
            <li> Great product! Very opaque and vibrant colors. Would buy again!</li>
