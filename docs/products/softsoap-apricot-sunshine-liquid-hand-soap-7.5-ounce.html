            <li>purchased because my soap holder was dying :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I love stocking up on Softsoap online</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Cleans your hands pretty good and very cheap.</li>
            <li>This soap not only works great, but it smells AMAZING too.</li>
            <li>I can stock up the easy way.</li>
            <li>Was easily cleaned up though.</li>
            <li>I also recommend checking out the crisp cucumber &amp; melon and coconut &amp; warm ginger hand soaps by Softsoap.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell very good, but exactly what you would expect as far as soap goes.</li>
            <li>VERY WELL, LOVE THE ITEM, RECOMMEND IT !</li>
            <li>so I could get free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I love the quality of the product and it is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>As someone who doesn&#x27;t like using antibacterial soaps too much, this is a great, soft alternative.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>it is worth the money</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable and I recommend this soap to others.  </li>
            <li>I guess they want more words, so i can confirm it is yellow.</li>
            <li>Not much to say about soap, It had a nice fragrance and lasted a while.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Actually, I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother me, plus I use it to clean my makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>It is just a regular hand wash but cost much more than the one I got from Walwart, and it is the only reason I do not want to give it a five star.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last long, so I suppose that&#x27;s a good thing overall.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Smells fruity and easily washes off, unlike other soaps.</li>
            <li>this actually smells pretty nice, but softsoap is usually cheaper in store.</li>
            <li>And if Softsoap is reading this, please make a complete line with this fragrance with lotion and body wash, and also try to sell the scent to Fabreze so they can make an air spray.  </li>
            <li>It was inexpensive and I like the subtle scent of this much better than an &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; brand.</li>
            <li>Pump is good, smell isnt bad, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I personally think it&#x27;s ok, but my S\O claims that it too soft, so that when you wash your hands, it&#x27;s hard to tell when the soap is actually off.</li>
            <li>From the first  squish of the pump to the final rinse &amp; dry this is the BOSS.</li>

            <li> This is undoubtedly the absolutely best apricot liquid hand soap i have ever had the pleasure to experience in my entire life. From the first  squish of the pump to the final rinse &amp; dry this is the BOSS. If you can afford it this is a small luxury you will never forget.</li>
            <li> I personally think it&#x27;s ok, but my S\O claims that it too soft, so that when you wash your hands, it&#x27;s hard to tell when the soap is actually off.</li>
            <li> This soap not only works great, but it smells AMAZING too. I find myself making excuses to wash my hands just so that I can use it and take in the wonderful fragrance. I haven&#x27;t seen this in stores up until recently but I love it.</li>
            <li> I used to like this product and have already ordered it before. I mechanically ordered it again and the price jumped from $1.99 to $7.95. This is the most expensive &amp;#34;ordinary&amp;#34; soap. Other flagrance of the same product cost less than $2.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and nice dispenser. Smells fruity and easily washes off, unlike other soaps. I would recommend this product to people,</li>
            <li> Soap, nice color, cleans well, and smells good. It doesn&#x27;t last long, so I suppose that&#x27;s a good thing overall.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell very good, but exactly what you would expect as far as soap goes. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Hand soap. The best thing about this is that I get it through Prime, no shipping, subscribe and save and …..best of all….I don&#x27;t have to go to the store. I can stock up the easy way.</li>
            <li> Not much you can review on soap but i always post one. Had a few dollars left on a gift card and was running out so i got this. Pump is good, smell isnt bad, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Good Soap , works just like they said it does , and it smells goos also. Ok so they said I do not have enought words.............</li>
            <li> Got it as an add-on item so I could use the &amp;#34;free shipping for purchase over $35&amp;#34;.  It is just a regular hand wash but cost much more than the one I got from Walwart, and it is the only reason I do not want to give it a five star.</li>
            <li> Good handsoap, good smell. not much more i can say. I guess they want more words, so i can confirm it is yellow.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soap. it acts like soap. yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother me, plus I use it to clean my makeup brushes. Win! smells great</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever write reviews, but the smell of this handsoap is so amazing!  I saw the bottle in the store and thought the color is really pretty and it smell great.  Then I had to wash my hands later on that day and \\&quot;Man\\&quot;, I was impressed.  I look forward to washing my hands.  Let me also say that when I read other people&#x27;s reviews, I think to myself that they are staged.  Please believe me when i tell you, I am a just a reg customer that has fallin in love with a product and just wanted to share.  And if Softsoap is reading this, please make a complete line with this fragrance with lotion and body wash, and also try to sell the scent to Fabreze so they can make an air spray.  I tried going to your website, but there is no place for customer reviews. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> purchased because my soap holder was dying :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so served the need. not sure if i adore scented soap..im basic scents kinda girl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT lol the holder is in great shape :)</li>
            <li> This was an add on item so I could get free shipping.  It was inexpensive and I like the subtle scent of this much better than an &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; brand.</li>
            <li> As another in what appears to me a near-endless variety of liquid hand soaps, Apricot Sunshine brings a super-intense fruit shine scent, \\&quot;just right\\&quot; suds, excellent results; container looks good on the counter, too!</li>
            <li> ITEM OF EXCEPTIONALLY EXCELLENT QUALITY, GREAT ITEM, GOOD PRICE PRODUCT, DETAILED, WORKS VERY WELL, LOVE THE ITEM, RECOMMEND IT ! A++++++++</li>
            <li> Not much to say about soap, It had a nice fragrance and lasted a while. Was pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Where&#x27;s the scent of apricot? I must have a prolonged cold or else the product is odorless, because I smell no apricot......</li>
            <li> This hand soap is great.  it makes me want to wash my hands more often because the scent is just that good.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent! I love stocking up on Softsoap online so I don&#x27;t have to pick it up at the store, and this is the best way to do it.</li>
            <li> This item was purchased from Amazon.com.  My rating is based on product use and the aesthtics of the product.  We used the product daily for approximately 5 weeks. The soap cleans and smells great!  The price was very reasonable and I recommend this soap to others.  Thank You!</li>
            <li> It is indeed Apricot and smells great. Cleans your hands pretty good and very cheap. Got two of them and happy I did</li>
            <li> Although using this Colgate-Palmolive product does not make me feel like I am escaping to a relaxing weekend retreat, the soap cleans my hands and makes them smell real nice. If you are a manly man and have concerns with an apricot extract scented soap, you need not to worry because the scent is not overpowering by any means. I also recommend checking out the crisp cucumber &amp; melon and coconut &amp; warm ginger hand soaps by Softsoap. They be makin&#x27; your hands smell real nice too.</li>

            <li> I really like the smell of this product. I was just looking for something to put by the kitchen sink &amp; this is a nice pump shape &amp; size. I will say, it wasn&#x27;t packaged well. It was thrown in a plastic bag that wasn&#x27;t sealed all the way &amp; leaked in the box onto my other items. Was easily cleaned up though. Wish they had it in the refill size.</li>
