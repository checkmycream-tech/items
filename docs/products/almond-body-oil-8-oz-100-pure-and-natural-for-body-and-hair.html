            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>I tried this for the 1st time b/c of the size &amp; handy pump.</li>
            <li>Loving it, I have been using it every day since I&#x27;ve received it.</li>
            <li>The label and printing looks kind of sketchy, but I guess I&#x27;ll give it a try since I paid for it already.</li>
            <li>I have tried many oils, I have severe dry skin, this was a wonderful oil, didnt clog pores, smelled great, tried sesame oil</li>
            <li>I received the package tape very secure</li>

            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>but this definately was better for my skin</li>
            <li>and it made my hair healthy and grow longer</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I have some that os thicker and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and like it so much more.</li>
            <li>and it arrived so so fast!!!!</li>
            <li>Great body oil, makes skin very soft and smooth, especially on hot summer days, when skin needs more nutrition and care.</li>
            <li>The pump makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a bit cheaper, but we must remember extracting oil is not an easy process.</li>
            <li>It has a strong toxic vinegar smell to the point it will intoxicate you.</li>
            <li>great oil for daily use.</li>
            <li>so.... smells nice and really moisturizes.</li>
            <li>Great product for a carrier when I use my essential oils</li>
            <li>great to blend essential oils with it.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied customer, who will get more in future for friends and family.</li>
            <li>Received it Super Fast!!!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great in the winter months when my skin is needing anti dry and anti itch remedies !</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my kama-sutra sweet almond oil, but this one has almost no scent at all.</li>
            <li>So far loving how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>Bottle design incorporating easy to use push-down applicator is the first sign that something unique&lt;br /&gt;will ooze forth.</li>
            <li>It works great in combination with other oils to improve the smell of the shea butter.  </li>
            <li>absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t look for quick absorbtion</li>
            <li>I love the pump on this bottle since it makes it easy to use without the mess.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of skeptical about this bottle, not quite sure if it&#x27;s really original and pure.  </li>
            <li>I do not like anything that says 100% pure and come in a non sealed bottle.</li>
            <li>I will not recommend this to anyone, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is 100% pure almond oil.</li>
            <li>it was very lightweight</li>
            <li>the oil did very well in my hair</li>
            <li>It really helps condition my hair and my sister has noticed that my hair has been a lot healthier since I started using this almond oil.  </li>
            <li>This product was delivered before the expected date :)</li>
            <li>I also use it as a night time face lotion since it is very light and absorbs in my skin, mixing it with my other face products.</li>
            <li>Hard to give a true review just yet :-)</li>
            <li>I love almond oil in general for skin &amp; facial moisturizing-</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My son has dry hair like me, so I bought this for him since it&#x27;s in the easy to use and mess free pump.</li>
            <li>I think we can get the 100% pure almond oil at whole foods for the same price.</li>
            <li>So far, I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in his hair, but then again, he hasn&#x27;t exactly been using it regularly.</li>
            <li>For winter and summer because I live in Arizona.</li>
            <li>I freaking live this oil</li>
            <li>WONDERS my stretch marks have lightened tremendously and it has also tightened my loose pregnancy skin.</li>
            <li>I take my regular body lotion and a pump full of Almond Oil and mix to get extra moisture in my skin.</li>
            <li>I bought it to combine with my shea butter to use in my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>Use it on my hair a a hot oil treatment and a little before bedtime.</li>
            <li>Not worth the money go to the whole food store its watery and</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Loved this product!! it was very lightweight so i could use it in my hair and on my skin. Plus,it smelled GREAT! This was a major selling point as my fiance does not really like the smell of the coconut oil I was using.  I will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> I was not especially pleased with the results of this product. It made my hair feel heavy.</li>
            <li> Really great for the hair.  Love the smell.</li>
            <li> This item i bought for my niece. Very satisfied! Excellent.</li>
            <li> the oil did very well in my hair</li>
            <li> Great quality product.  Love it</li>
            <li> Great in my daughter&#x27;s hair!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Received the oil on a Sunday which was a treat and it arrived so so fast!!!! I love almond oil for my skin and works great for your hair as well</li>
            <li> Great for hair and body. Nice scent.</li>
            <li> Great body oil, makes skin very soft and smooth, especially on hot summer days, when skin needs more nutrition and care.</li>
            <li> the scent is not strong.  The oil is not greasy.  My skin is radiant as well as my hair.  I will purchase more</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my kama-sutra sweet almond oil, but this one has almost no scent at all. Might as well be peanut oil.</li>
            <li> I love almond oil in general for skin &amp; facial moisturizing-you can&#x27;t beat it! I tried this for the 1st time b/c of the size &amp; handy pump. I like the texture and subtle scent. Would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love this.  I bought it to combine with my shea butter to use in my natural hair.  It works great in combination with other oils to improve the smell of the shea butter.  It was packaged well to prevent leakage.  It took an extra day to arrive, 3 instead of 2 days.</li>
            <li> Bottle design incorporating easy to use push-down applicator is the first sign that something unique&lt;br /&gt;will ooze forth. And to be sure, this premium almond oil does not disappoint!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> I received the package tape very secure so it didn&#x27;t drip. So far loving how it feels on my skin. Will order again.</li>

            <li> EXCELLENT. JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR</li>
            <li> Loving it, I have been using it every day since I&#x27;ve received it. This product was delivered before the expected date :)I use it on my hair before I sleep and tie it up in a bun or two braids and I wake up with my ends feeling and looking very healthy. I also use it as a night time face lotion since it is very light and absorbs in my skin, mixing it with my other face products. Anddddd I use it for my body to when I feel like having a different smell from my other lotions.</li>
            <li> great oil for daily use. absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> No smell, which is great since us women already have many smells going on in every product we use. I used it on my hair and skin and it made them very smooth indeed.</li>

            <li> oily but it&#x27;s Almond oil so.... smells nice and really moisturizes. Don&#x27;t look for quick absorbtion but it&#x27;s great in the winter months when my skin is needing anti dry and anti itch remedies !</li>
            <li> Great product for a carrier when I use my essential oils</li>
            <li> I take my regular body lotion and a pump full of Almond Oil and mix to get extra moisture in my skin. For winter and summer because I live in Arizona.</li>
            <li> This product did not come in a sealed package, it was shipped in a ziplock bag. I do not like anything that says 100% pure and come in a non sealed bottle. I will not recommend this to anyone, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is 100% pure almond oil. I think we can get the 100% pure almond oil at whole foods for the same price. I will never buy this product again.</li>

            <li> great to blend essential oils with it.  great price and great quality.</li>
            <li> The almond oil is not organic. It is extremely oily. It has a strong toxic vinegar smell to the point it will intoxicate you. It is not approved by Organic USDA. I do not recommend this product</li>
            <li> Love this product. I wish it was a bit cheaper, but we must remember extracting oil is not an easy process. I love the smell very light you will hardly notice it.</li>
