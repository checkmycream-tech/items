            <li>Product was received in fine condition and smells very good.</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s very entertaining to read.</li>
            <li>-not as robust and fresh and lime peel scented as once, but still the best available&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A very refreshing aftershave.</li>
            <li>A very refreshing fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This all purpose lotion has a really nice smell, and is good as aftershave or cologne (hence all purpose).  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell!  </li>
            <li>Need to get more!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for better than that!</li>
            <li>, I would probably try another brand or perhaps try the company&#x27;s sampler set which provides the buyer with more options!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found any scent I like better!</li>
            <li>I love lime!</li>

            <li>He was thrilled that I was able to find it and give it to him for his 82nd birthday!</li>
            <li>the saying power is amazing......</li>
            <li>That is really kind of duplicitous.  </li>
            <li>There is plenty of precedence for that kind of thing.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find this aftershave for my father.</li>
            <li>Some of us Kentucky \\&quot;hill boys\\&quot; ventured out to try the \\&quot;import\\&quot; and was delighted as to how it made the heat and humidity more bearable...</li>
            <li>I found out, after moving to Alaska, that the mosquitoes liked it as well.</li>
            <li>suited for warm summer evenings.</li>
            <li>I have used (and liked)</li>
            <li>he had made a mistake and now I needed to ship him a bottle at my own expense and they would consider weather to provide a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The absolute best lime scent you will ever find.  </li>
            <li>I liked it on facebook.  </li>
            <li>Just a great clean smell</li>
            <li>Excellent Aftershave, I have been searching for a gentle refreshing nice Lime scent for years, this is it.  </li>
            <li>The packing is minimal (excellent) and the bottles look great.</li>
            <li>Most refreshing aftershave I have found since finding it in Bermuda 40 years ago!</li>
            <li>Glad to finally be able to order it in the USA!</li>
            <li>so we decided to purchase it again - just as we remembered it, very clean and refreshing!</li>
            <li>I have liked RL for many years...</li>
            <li>I have been using Royal Lyme for many years and have been so happy with it; it is so light and refreshing.  </li>

            <li>These are 2 great products if you like a crisp scent of lime.</li>
            <li>This aftershave has a light, but very refreshing and energizing scent that is not overpowering or offensive at all.</li>
            <li>Setting aside the aroma which to my taste was not at all appealing, the bottle was fantastic and the clever sealed paper packaging was great!  </li>
            <li>Very nice light and clean scent.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to many of the ones that my husband wears but this one I can tolerate...</li>
            <li>I have used the product many times over the years, but will not order it again.  </li>
            <li>glad I found this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several others but this is the best buy for your $$$</li>
            <li>A truly outstanding after shave cologne.  </li>
            <li>always refreshing and aromatic.</li>

            <li>I love this stuff-- been using it as aftershave for years.  </li>
            <li>I have used Royall Lyme off and on for many a year.  </li>

            <li>Love the freshness and fragrance .</li>
            <li>One of my favorite colognes.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband because I love the smell of it.  </li>
            <li>It also was more inexpensive then gift shops.</li>
            <li>My favorite April - OCT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve become re-acquainted with Royall Lyme after a many years sabbatical</li>
            <li>Maybe it is best left for men to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cooling, refreshing, invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using Royal Lyme for Many years.</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a lime-aholic and this is my favorite aftershave/cologne.</li>
            <li>Mostly smells like alcohol.</li>
            <li>my favorite</li>
            <li>it was better 20 years ago</li>
            <li>I better be wearing a citrus based EDT so it does limit you there.</li>
            <li>It appears that since it has been manufactured in the states, rather that bermuda, that the scent has change somewhat, however it is my favorite after shave.</li>
            <li>Not too overwhelming, lasts an hour or two.</li>
            <li>I wish I could find more lime after shave products.</li>
            <li>The entire &amp;#34;Royall&amp;#34; line is wonderful.</li>
            <li>It was at a better price too.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Smells really nice and it is a huge bottle.</li>
            <li>I received so many compliments over the years</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product as an after shave lotion for more than 40 years and nothing compares to it.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t really an  &amp;#34;eau du cologne&amp;#34; but a &amp;#34;body cologne&amp;#34;...either way, it is a great smell</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I discovered it.</li>
            <li>a refreshing, lovely scent.</li>
            <li>As an Aftershave and Cologne &#x27;Royal Lyme&#x27; is comparable to many of our US Domestically produced products.</li>
            <li>he gets many compliments when he wears it.  </li>
            <li>and it has remained a favorite fragrance ever since.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have been using Royall Lyme for many years.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both love the scent of it.</li>
            <li>used to be an invigorating &amp; refreshing cologne has now been reduced to the fragrance of isopropyl alcohol and lime juice.  </li>
            <li>You will be pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>And I frankly think the St. John stuff, in its famous wicker bottle, is marginally better -- as is their bay rum, IMO -- but you have to order it from their website, and it costs more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my Dad&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
            <li>However, when it was made in Bermuda, it was even better</li>
            <li>I have been buying this for my husband for years and have not been able to find it in stores anymore.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it and at the price point.  </li>
            <li>I use to pay a lot more for it at a department store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it, and better yet, my wife likes it.</li>
            <li>Love this cologne.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad that I am.</li>
            <li>Of course it&#x27;s not as potent as it was in 1959.</li>
            <li>Bought for my husband - one of his favorite scents</li>
            <li>Now it brings back some wonderful memories every time I wear it.  </li>
            <li>My all time favorite is Royal Lime.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Royall Lyme is very clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It is not overpowering, but a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is perfect for summer and is very lite with a clean fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>It smells very sweet, but maintains a manliness.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used it, but am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Amazon always offers a great price.</li>
            <li>that great lime scent that would linger softly and sutbtley.  </li>
            <li>Cooling and very refreshing, it even directs you to keep it in the fridge during hot weather to increase its effect.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing to the skin and has a unique scent of lime.  </li>
            <li>and it is meant to be refreshing and imply a clean feel with intoxicating smell up close.  </li>
            <li>It is not always easy to get.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is great and good for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>He was extremely happy with the delivery and packaging and will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as strong as it was.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for such a delightful product!</li>
            <li>Good luck with your new Kindles.</li>
            <li>It is so light, it has never at all been offensive to those around.  </li>
            <li>Really enjoy his cologne.</li>
            <li>It was the finest aftershave available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years and hope it will be available for years to come.</li>
            <li>I love its fresh lime scent.</li>
            <li>I have been using this as an after shave for many years and it leaves my face fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li>Really enjoy this scent on my hubby.</li>
            <li>I ordered this item as a gift, checked the &amp;#34;GIFT&amp;#34; option, and included a free greeting card.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Light smell.</li>
            <li>However, the bay rum and other Royall fragrances are very good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never smelled the original, but wow, this stuff smells really good.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh, clean lovely scent.</li>
            <li>and I love the fresh clean lime fragrance, my wife l loves it on me.  </li>
            <li>I found this AS/cologne to be amazing in the sense that it smells exactly like a freshly squeezed lime.</li>
            <li>Very fresh, clean aroma.  </li>
            <li>After checking multiple sights this was the best price I could find-- especially with the free shipping!</li>
            <li>Fresh lime scent and soothing!</li>
            <li>The frangraces seem diluted and  litte off regarding the recipe for repliicating the original formula.</li>
            <li>However, it is noticeably of a lower quality than the Original Bermuda produced product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite the original</li>
            <li>The original Jamaican Lyme puts this product to shame.</li>
            <li>I love that clean crisp feeling.</li>
            <li>it reminds me of years gone by, and is a clean scent with no residual stickiness.</li>
            <li>truly a great after shave to calm skin-after the initial flinch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Purchased this as a gift for my father, and once again-as it has for many years-it serves up exactly the fragrance he wants without any risk of skin irritation (an effect many colognes have on him).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Royall Lyme is a cool clean scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I work in a hospital and many times patient are allergic to certain colognes, never a problem with Royal Lyme.  </li>
            <li>But the Royall Lyme cologne is so special I made an exception.</li>
            <li>the price was right!</li>
            <li>Excellent price on a hard to find item</li>
            <li>Sometimes it is hard to find; Amazons price is the best.</li>
            <li>Fresh, tangy, and light.  </li>
            <li>good enough to kiss him!</li>
            <li>My favorite aftershave I really like the sent of the lime.</li>
            <li>In my yesterday years Royall Lyme was appreciated by the girls and today my children and grand children even remark about how they like the smell.</li>
            <li>Smells true to its name</li>
            <li>The sweet citrus fragrance may not please all</li>
            <li>Pungent, not too  sweet and long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>For\\&quot; holds true with the US Licensed Product.</li>
            <li>It is refreshing and light and always brings back the memories of the exotic tropics.</li>
            <li>It is NOT an overpowering sweet cologne.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good enough for Terence Stamp, it&#x27;s good enough for you.</li>
            <li>it light, fresh and invigorating.</li>
            <li>Usual good quality - a nice scent.</li>
            <li>It just a nice clean aroma, not heavy or over powering, just the fresh fragrance of Limes.</li>
            <li>i particularly love its subtlety; i like to be well groomed, but i do not like longer lasting fragrance, no matter how wonderful, as they seem to overwhelm me, others in the room, and things like food, wine, or even getting a &#x27;second wind&#x27; of heavier fragrances when you exercise-when what you really want is untainted air, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Almost candy-like, but in a fresh, clean way.</li>
            <li>Buy it - I want to keep it available, and I can use only so much on my own.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>My husband had been searching for a cologne that smelled like his one-time favorite called, Caribe, which he used to only be able to buy in the Bahamas.</li>
            <li>Bold lime from Bermuda and has the island feel.  </li>
            <li>This has been around for a long time but it is as good now as it always has been.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s different, but it has a nice clean smell.  </li>
            <li>My best attempt would be think gin and tonic with lots of fresh lime-its similar, generally, to that smell, but no juniper, so actually tonic and lime is more accurate.</li>
            <li>(maybe live apart until nausea ceased :))&lt;</li>
            <li>They took a quality product and made it inferior, and they are getting sales from people who either do not know better, or people who have been using their products for years and are getting duped with the new stuff.</li>
            <li>The one who wears it is the true judge; all the others just sanction the fact that it is the right choice.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff, have been using it for a very long time.  </li>
            <li>Given the overwhelmingly postive reviews for this product, I was very surprised when I opened the bottle and smelled the scent.  </li>
            <li>Amazon / drop this product like a hot rock!</li>
            <li>THANKS!!  </li>
            <li>Crisp, clean scent just as I remember it.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the unusual fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It smells like really fresh lime.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Royall Lyme longer than most people have been alive.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews of products I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Really worth the rather steep price tag.</li>
            <li>The review some lady posted included here somewhere conjured up memories of her honeymoon in Bermuda and made me smile, reinforcing my choice.</li>
            <li>The package is also fun that it comes in.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Fresh limes, gin and tonic, summer evening.</li>
            <li>We both really like the clean, fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell good, but the inside and outside of the wrapper is over the top funny, complete with suggestions to sprinkle it everywhere many times a day, consume it rapidly, and come back to buy more.</li>
            <li>And the pure lime smell it has really cannot be described accurately in words,you have to experience it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon.com had the best price on this item, less than half the retail price, with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I frequently get compliments from my female coworkers on how good I smell.  </li>
            <li>Goes on strong then lingers softly.</li>
            <li>My husband has used this product for years, and likes the feel of it on his face after a shave, as well as the very mild masculine scent that leaves him refreshed for hours.  </li>
            <li>A terrific, refreshing scent of fresh squeezed limes.</li>
            <li>Timeless classic packaging makes a great gift for the mature man or even the younger crowd interested in standing out from the smell du jour groups.  </li>
            <li>best for me is that this fragrance is subtle and natural, you never smell foppish nor fill a room or make passers-by wonder where &#x27;that smell&#x27; is originating, and, once on, after a minute or so, only someone very close indeed may be able to smell it, and it is a clean fragrance for the well groomed and understated.</li>
            <li>An excellent lime fragrance that is not strong or overpowering but does last quite awhile.</li>
            <li>Just enough to add a very light aroma to his clothes.  </li>
            <li>Now it is somewhat better and the price is well worth the less limey smell than the original.</li>
            <li>Not expensive.  </li>
            <li>First smelled this in Bermuda 7 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I see that I&#x27;m not the first to notice something&#x27;s amiss at Royall Lyme.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I opened it was, \\&quot;Made under license in the USA\\&quot; on the label.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it was my charm, or maybe it was the Royall Lyme, but who cares we&#x27;re still married.</li>
            <li>so I could apply as generously as the label recommends...  ;-)</li>
            <li>I just wish it would last more than twenty minutes</li>
            <li>Just ordered my first bottle and im hooked.</li>
            <li>so I am basing my review on this product as a first time zero expectations user.</li>
            <li>Just like I remember it from the first time I bought it in Hawaii.  </li>
            <li>i first discovered this product in bermuda forty years ago amid ocean, oleander and cuban cigars.</li>
            <li>I first purchased Royall Lyme over 40 years ago while vacationing in Jamaica</li>
            <li>So much for the gift!</li>
            <li>Sampled it for the first time at Merz&#x27;s Apothecary at Lincoln Square in Chicago and the price scared me away.</li>
            <li>like it because it is light and fresh rather than the heavy, musky scents of so many colognes.</li>
            <li>A fresh and invigorating product that starts the day off on a high note!</li>
            <li>I want to say the first one lasted my husband about 2 years, using 5/7 days during the week after shaving.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty close.</li>
            <li>Very soothing, yet exciting and  enticing.  </li>
            <li>I was aware of this product for years, but kept delaying the purchase.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the first order from Royall Lyme.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few other bay rums (my wife is pushing me to get a scent) and all have been pretty pleasant but this particular product did not come close, unless the bottle is more important to you than the scent inside</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last long, but while it does it&#x27;s wonderful, especially after a</li>
            <li>TO be honest , nothing I can WRITE here, is going to tell you anything other than what I like.  </li>
            <li>Please go back to the original formula!</li>
            <li>But the scent does not linger very long and for the price I can buy many satisfying cologns that are in the same category.  </li>
            <li>In about an hour, pretty much no projection.</li>
            <li>It is a very refreshing product leaving a hint of Lime after it has dried.</li>
            <li>- they are so busy trying to put in the lastest fragrances they forget about the tried and true - what a shame - so I have had to go to the Internet - Amazon - to purchase.  </li>
            <li>Although it says it&#x27;s for men, I a feminine female use it on hot sticky days to refresh my skin and add a light lime fragrance to me.  </li>
            <li>This may be appealing to a particular taste but it is very different from contemporary  descent aftershaves.</li>
            <li>The packaging is gorgeous, but you would be better off buying something like Pinaud Clubman (with a similar scent) for much less money at your local drugstore.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, but not overpowering even when he&#x27;s a little to generous in application.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>Fast service from Amazon</li>
            <li>for these items are the very lowest I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li>Between my husband high standards (it has to burn!)</li>
            <li>Feel refreshed and ready to greet the world</li>
            <li>I guess my sense of smell has changed because it didn&#x27;t appeal to me as much as it did years ago.  </li>
            <li>Yes its real mens aftershave and will burn like its supposed to.</li>
            <li>The whole presentation with the vintage packaging feels like you really splurged on yourself.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, it&#x27;s very close.  </li>
            <li>A real bummer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am Jeffrey Levenberg, my daughter is Alex, but Amazon can&#x27;t seem to even get that straight today.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my husband - he has used it for years and absolutely loves the fragrance - me too.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t put too much of it on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It might have appeal to those unfamiliar with the real product.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this - uses it up so fast that I buy 2 at a time.</li>
            <li>so I make my own lime cologne with Florida Water($3.95) and Key Lime Essential oil($3.95).</li>
            <li>The second was a distinct lack of heady, fresh aroma from either bottle.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;this product falls into the area of hazardous waste</li>
            <li>Bring the original quality formulas back.</li>
            <li>Well, after many other adventures, it&#x27;s a pleasure to have this \\&quot;lotion\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I had never encountered such a unique, citrus fragrance, so I determined to place an order through Amazon once I got home.  </li>
            <li>It met my expectations and was exactly the same as every order of the same product I have been using for many years</li>
            <li>is nice but doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>I commend it highly: fresh, crisp, subtle, sophisticated.</li>
            <li>and they are pretty old.</li>
            <li>Glad to find it on Amazon at about half the price.</li>
            <li>I have been extremely fond of this crisp, fresh scent ever since I discovered it whilst honeymooning on Bermuda in 1963!</li>
            <li>Classic.</li>
            <li>I tend to agree that this may not be quite the same formula as the stuff my mom brought me back from Bermuda many years ago.  </li>
            <li>a classic.</li>
            <li>It is not sweet or feminine but really a refreshing fragrance for a man.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>It was, well... not very pleasant might be a nice way of saying it.  </li>
            <li>But be warned,it has a significant alcohol content and stings a little if you use it right after shaving.</li>
            <li>If you are a fan of this product, you will be pleasantly surprised by the large size of this bottle.</li>
            <li>And I would add, having checked again just the other day, the scent lingers pretty much throughout the day, and is still fresh and invigorating.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s classic and unlike any modern scent, but doesn&#x27;t smell old or dated.</li>
            <li>Citrusy and sexy -- there is no more classic mens&#x27; fragrance on the market, today!</li>
            <li>I wonder if some of the negative reviews come from a time when there were production problems at the US facility (God knows where the stuff was actually being made, since it&#x27;s only \\&quot;licensed\\&quot; for US production), but the bottle that I got has been very good.  </li>
            <li>It is very fruity when first applied but has a slightly sweet scent after a few hours.</li>
            <li>I had to find my husband a different after shave after I became pregnant and developed severe morning sickness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing Royall Lyme and Royall Spyce for DECADES, but when the last of my annual supply was running out, I quickly ordered one 8oz bottle each of Royall Lyme and Royall Spyce DIRECTLY FROM ROYALL LYME, so I know I wasn&#x27;t getting a counterfeit.  </li>
            <li>This product barely has the aroma and the appealing lime intensity and seems diluted with some other chemicals.</li>
            <li>The new formulation is horrific.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>I will be looking for a new Lime fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I will need to find a new after shave.</li>
            <li>If the formula back then (according to some other reviews) smelled even better than this, than man, I wish I had some of the older stuff too.</li>
            <li>The points on the \\&quot;crown\\&quot; may hurt if your hands are very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I mean, its more like the old Old Spice Lime after shave, the star of the local drug store after shaves than the original quality Royall Lyme.  </li>
            <li>The fact that Royall Lyme actually came from Bermuda added more dimension to it, both psychologically and emotionally.</li>
            <li>Whoever it is, they should be sacked, the foreign license agreements cancelled and the original formula, MADE IN BERMUDA, reinstated.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still married to the same woman.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly the same as the product we purchased 50 years ago on our honeymoon in Bermuda..</li>
            <li>Product quality same as the first purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the fragrance is exactly the same.</li>
            <li>In the future I will pay the $60.00 vs $32.00 and get the real thing!</li>
            <li>I recommend this cologne highly and I am a very picky cologne/perfume consumer that usually only finds a scent</li>
            <li>My current favourite is Royall Rugby, however, having said that, there&#x27;s something fantastic about a splash of Royall Lyme after a long shower on a summers day.</li>
            <li>The new USA-made lotion is thinner in scent, watery and less , oh, zesty than the Bermuda-made original.  </li>
            <li>The slight lime .fragrance is lovely especially in the summer.</li>
            <li>This product is my husband&#x27;s favorite after shave lotion and it is somewhat hard to come by.  </li>
            <li>Not balanced with a medicinal lime / in-you-face / fragrance which is being generous.&lt;br /&gt;The original formulation was balanced and crystal clear and clean with / subtle Key Lime notes.</li>
            <li>The scent is so soft and mellow.</li>
            <li>I am 52 - Management Professional.  </li>
            <li>Rather a soft fragrence that does not announce your presence to the world with a drum, but a violin.</li>
            <li>I can remember when I was a child my father always had the aroma of Old Spice around him, and today I have the aroma of Royall Lyme.</li>
            <li>This stuff is a far cry from the quality of the origiganl Burmuda made product.  </li>
            <li>My One Star rating is an early Christmas gift in June.</li>
            <li>long ago, my first bottles were the larger taller 10 ounce versions with real lead caps, and made in Bermuda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as how well it works ....</li>
            <li>Too much alcohol not enough lime!!!!</li>
            <li>The old addage \\&quot;You Get What You Pay</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy</li>
            <li>My old bottle that I bought in Bermuda has a stronger scent.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years and always purchased through Amazon with complete satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Really like this, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been mentioned repeatedly that the old formula has been changed.</li>
            <li>The white cap is not securely glued to the metal crown top and will come out after about 10 uses.  </li>
            <li>around the same time from some other vendor (though through Amazon), and that product is fine.</li>
            <li>-as is the mandarin too, subtle and refreshing</li>
            <li>All that aside, Royall Lyme is a pleasantly refreshing and yet subtle after shave.</li>
            <li>Ownership of this fragrance has changed over the years and it is no longer made in Bermuda, but it still smells the same as when I first starting using it 45 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I first starting using this fragance back in 1966 while in Africa.</li>
            <li>The bottle is large and goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This scent simply won me over, a highly subjective matter.</li>
            <li>Not to worry though, a little super glue fixes the problem.  </li>
            <li>With this new formulation, the scent will last 20-30 minutes tops.</li>
            <li>Royall Lyme is, as far as I know, the last lime scented aftershave that is a clear liquid rather than a slimy goop.</li>
            <li>I have used Royall Lyme for many years, and my most recent bottle left me with deep disappointment.  </li>
            <li>Royall Lyme has been a durable classic - all around use without fluffy foo-foo aura, and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the other reviewers who confirmed my worst fear that this once great formula has been compromised and cheapened.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care all that much if Royall Lyme is made in Bermuda or the USA so long as its quality is intact, but don&#x27;t try to lead people into fooling themselves to believe that this product is truly the same in every respect as it had been.  </li>
            <li>I have some left in old bottle,</li>
            <li>Perhaps not the scent for a young stud in a singles bar, but for a gentleman who will last the evening.</li>
            <li>I can barely detect the lyme fragrance</li>
            <li>Have worn the \\&quot;real\\&quot; islands&#x27; lime for 25 years, securing same on frequent trips to the Caribbean.</li>
            <li>For the money and the history nostalgia behind this product you will not regret the purchase if you love lime scent as I do.</li>
            <li>The large size will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>I presumed it had been on the shelf far to long.  </li>
            <li>The frangrance doesn&#x27;t have much staying power and there is virtually no  dry down scent after ten or fifteen minutes.</li>
            <li>They are saying that the new formulation is only slightly changed from the old.</li>
            <li>they confirmed that it was not a pleasant smell at all...</li>
            <li>However as other reviews have mentioned this is no longer a Bermuda based company but is run out of New York City.</li>

            <li> A very refreshing aftershave.</li>
            <li> A very refreshing fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This all purpose lotion has a really nice smell, and is good as aftershave or cologne (hence all purpose).  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell!  </li>
            <li> Need to get more!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for better than that!</li>
            <li> , I would probably try another brand or perhaps try the company&#x27;s sampler set which provides the buyer with more options!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any scent I like better!</li>
            <li> I love lime!</li>

            <li> He was thrilled that I was able to find it and give it to him for his 82nd birthday!</li>
            <li> the saying power is amazing......</li>
            <li> That is really kind of duplicitous.  </li>
            <li> There is plenty of precedence for that kind of thing.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find this aftershave for my father.</li>
            <li> Some of us Kentucky \\&quot;hill boys\\&quot; ventured out to try the \\&quot;import\\&quot; and was delighted as to how it made the heat and humidity more bearable...</li>
            <li> I found out, after moving to Alaska, that the mosquitoes liked it as well.</li>
            <li> suited for warm summer evenings.</li>
            <li> I have used (and liked)</li>
            <li> he had made a mistake and now I needed to ship him a bottle at my own expense and they would consider weather to provide a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The absolute best lime scent you will ever find.  </li>
            <li> I liked it on facebook.  </li>

            <li> Most refreshing aftershave I have found since finding it in Bermuda 40 years ago!</li>
            <li> Glad to finally be able to order it in the USA!</li>
            <li> so we decided to purchase it again - just as we remembered it, very clean and refreshing!</li>
            <li> I have liked RL for many years...</li>

            <li> This aftershave has a light, but very refreshing and energizing scent that is not overpowering or offensive at all.</li>
            <li> Setting aside the aroma which to my taste was not at all appealing, the bottle was fantastic and the clever sealed paper packaging was great!  </li>
            <li> Very nice light and clean scent.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, not overpowering.  </li>

            <li> I am allergic to many of the ones that my husband wears but this one I can tolerate...</li>
            <li> I have used the product many times over the years, but will not order it again.  </li>
            <li> glad I found this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several others but this is the best buy for your $$$</li>
            <li> A truly outstanding after shave cologne.  </li>
            <li> always refreshing and aromatic.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff-- been using it as aftershave for years.  </li>

            <li> One of my favorite colognes.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because I love the smell of it.  </li>
            <li> It also was more inexpensive then gift shops.</li>
            <li> My favorite April - OCT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become re-acquainted with Royall Lyme after a many years sabbatical</li>
            <li> Maybe it is best left for men to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cooling, refreshing, invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using Royal Lyme for Many years.</li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lime-aholic and this is my favorite aftershave/cologne.</li>
            <li> Mostly smells like alcohol.</li>
            <li> my favorite</li>
            <li> it was better 20 years ago</li>
            <li> I better be wearing a citrus based EDT so it does limit you there.</li>
            <li> It appears that since it has been manufactured in the states, rather that bermuda, that the scent has change somewhat, however it is my favorite after shave.</li>
            <li> Not too overwhelming, lasts an hour or two.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find more lime after shave products.</li>
            <li> The entire &amp;#34;Royall&amp;#34; line is wonderful.</li>
            <li> It was at a better price too.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells really nice and it is a huge bottle.</li>
            <li> I received so many compliments over the years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product as an after shave lotion for more than 40 years and nothing compares to it.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t really an  &amp;#34;eau du cologne&amp;#34; but a &amp;#34;body cologne&amp;#34;...either way, it is a great smell</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I discovered it.</li>
            <li> a refreshing, lovely scent.</li>
            <li> As an Aftershave and Cologne &#x27;Royal Lyme&#x27; is comparable to many of our US Domestically produced products.</li>
            <li> he gets many compliments when he wears it.  </li>
            <li> and it has remained a favorite fragrance ever since.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using Royall Lyme for many years.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love the scent of it.</li>
            <li> used to be an invigorating &amp; refreshing cologne has now been reduced to the fragrance of isopropyl alcohol and lime juice.  </li>
            <li> You will be pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> And I frankly think the St. John stuff, in its famous wicker bottle, is marginally better -- as is their bay rum, IMO -- but you have to order it from their website, and it costs more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my Dad&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
            <li> However, when it was made in Bermuda, it was even better</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for my husband for years and have not been able to find it in stores anymore.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I found it and at the price point.  </li>
            <li> I use to pay a lot more for it at a department store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it, and better yet, my wife likes it.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad that I am.</li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s not as potent as it was in 1959.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband - one of his favorite scents</li>
            <li> Now it brings back some wonderful memories every time I wear it.  </li>
            <li> My all time favorite is Royal Lime.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Royall Lyme is very clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> It is not overpowering, but a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is perfect for summer and is very lite with a clean fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> It smells very sweet, but maintains a manliness.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used it, but am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Amazon always offers a great price.</li>
            <li> that great lime scent that would linger softly and sutbtley.  </li>
            <li> Cooling and very refreshing, it even directs you to keep it in the fridge during hot weather to increase its effect.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing to the skin and has a unique scent of lime.  </li>
            <li> and it is meant to be refreshing and imply a clean feel with intoxicating smell up close.  </li>
            <li> It is not always easy to get.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is great and good for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> He was extremely happy with the delivery and packaging and will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as strong as it was.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for such a delightful product!</li>
            <li> Good luck with your new Kindles.</li>
            <li> It is so light, it has never at all been offensive to those around.  </li>
            <li> Really enjoy his cologne.</li>
            <li> It was the finest aftershave available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and hope it will be available for years to come.</li>
            <li> I love its fresh lime scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as an after shave for many years and it leaves my face fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li> Really enjoy this scent on my hubby.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item as a gift, checked the &amp;#34;GIFT&amp;#34; option, and included a free greeting card.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Light smell.</li>
            <li> However, the bay rum and other Royall fragrances are very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never smelled the original, but wow, this stuff smells really good.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh, clean lovely scent.</li>
            <li> and I love the fresh clean lime fragrance, my wife l loves it on me.  </li>
            <li> I found this AS/cologne to be amazing in the sense that it smells exactly like a freshly squeezed lime.</li>
            <li> Very fresh, clean aroma.  </li>
            <li> After checking multiple sights this was the best price I could find-- especially with the free shipping!</li>
            <li> Fresh lime scent and soothing!</li>
            <li> The frangraces seem diluted and  litte off regarding the recipe for repliicating the original formula.</li>
            <li> However, it is noticeably of a lower quality than the Original Bermuda produced product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite the original</li>
            <li> The original Jamaican Lyme puts this product to shame.</li>
            <li> I love that clean crisp feeling.</li>
            <li> it reminds me of years gone by, and is a clean scent with no residual stickiness.</li>
            <li> truly a great after shave to calm skin-after the initial flinch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my father, and once again-as it has for many years-it serves up exactly the fragrance he wants without any risk of skin irritation (an effect many colognes have on him).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Royall Lyme is a cool clean scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I work in a hospital and many times patient are allergic to certain colognes, never a problem with Royal Lyme.  </li>
            <li> But the Royall Lyme cologne is so special I made an exception.</li>
            <li> the price was right!</li>
            <li> Excellent price on a hard to find item</li>
            <li> Sometimes it is hard to find; Amazons price is the best.</li>
            <li> Fresh, tangy, and light.  </li>
            <li> good enough to kiss him!</li>
            <li> My favorite aftershave I really like the sent of the lime.</li>
            <li> In my yesterday years Royall Lyme was appreciated by the girls and today my children and grand children even remark about how they like the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells true to its name</li>
            <li> The sweet citrus fragrance may not please all</li>
            <li> Pungent, not too  sweet and long-lasting.  </li>
            <li> For\\&quot; holds true with the US Licensed Product.</li>
            <li> It is refreshing and light and always brings back the memories of the exotic tropics.</li>
            <li> It is NOT an overpowering sweet cologne.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good enough for Terence Stamp, it&#x27;s good enough for you.</li>
            <li> it light, fresh and invigorating.</li>
            <li> Usual good quality - a nice scent.</li>
            <li> It just a nice clean aroma, not heavy or over powering, just the fresh fragrance of Limes.</li>
            <li> i particularly love its subtlety; i like to be well groomed, but i do not like longer lasting fragrance, no matter how wonderful, as they seem to overwhelm me, others in the room, and things like food, wine, or even getting a &#x27;second wind&#x27; of heavier fragrances when you exercise-when what you really want is untainted air, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Almost candy-like, but in a fresh, clean way.</li>
            <li> Buy it - I want to keep it available, and I can use only so much on my own.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> My husband had been searching for a cologne that smelled like his one-time favorite called, Caribe, which he used to only be able to buy in the Bahamas.</li>
            <li> Bold lime from Bermuda and has the island feel.  </li>
            <li> This has been around for a long time but it is as good now as it always has been.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different, but it has a nice clean smell.  </li>
            <li> My best attempt would be think gin and tonic with lots of fresh lime-its similar, generally, to that smell, but no juniper, so actually tonic and lime is more accurate.</li>
            <li> (maybe live apart until nausea ceased :))&lt;</li>
            <li> They took a quality product and made it inferior, and they are getting sales from people who either do not know better, or people who have been using their products for years and are getting duped with the new stuff.</li>
            <li> The one who wears it is the true judge; all the others just sanction the fact that it is the right choice.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff, have been using it for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Given the overwhelmingly postive reviews for this product, I was very surprised when I opened the bottle and smelled the scent.  </li>
            <li> Amazon / drop this product like a hot rock!</li>
            <li> THANKS!!  </li>
            <li> Crisp, clean scent just as I remember it.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the unusual fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It smells like really fresh lime.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Royall Lyme longer than most people have been alive.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews of products I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Really worth the rather steep price tag.</li>
            <li> The review some lady posted included here somewhere conjured up memories of her honeymoon in Bermuda and made me smile, reinforcing my choice.</li>
            <li> The package is also fun that it comes in.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Fresh limes, gin and tonic, summer evening.</li>
            <li> We both really like the clean, fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell good, but the inside and outside of the wrapper is over the top funny, complete with suggestions to sprinkle it everywhere many times a day, consume it rapidly, and come back to buy more.</li>
            <li> And the pure lime smell it has really cannot be described accurately in words,you have to experience it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon.com had the best price on this item, less than half the retail price, with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I frequently get compliments from my female coworkers on how good I smell.  </li>
            <li> Goes on strong then lingers softly.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this product for years, and likes the feel of it on his face after a shave, as well as the very mild masculine scent that leaves him refreshed for hours.  </li>
            <li> A terrific, refreshing scent of fresh squeezed limes.</li>
            <li> Timeless classic packaging makes a great gift for the mature man or even the younger crowd interested in standing out from the smell du jour groups.  </li>
            <li> best for me is that this fragrance is subtle and natural, you never smell foppish nor fill a room or make passers-by wonder where &#x27;that smell&#x27; is originating, and, once on, after a minute or so, only someone very close indeed may be able to smell it, and it is a clean fragrance for the well groomed and understated.</li>
            <li> An excellent lime fragrance that is not strong or overpowering but does last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> Just enough to add a very light aroma to his clothes.  </li>
            <li> Now it is somewhat better and the price is well worth the less limey smell than the original.</li>
            <li> Not expensive.  </li>
            <li> First smelled this in Bermuda 7 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I see that I&#x27;m not the first to notice something&#x27;s amiss at Royall Lyme.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I opened it was, \\&quot;Made under license in the USA\\&quot; on the label.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it was my charm, or maybe it was the Royall Lyme, but who cares we&#x27;re still married.</li>
            <li> so I could apply as generously as the label recommends...  ;-)</li>
            <li> I just wish it would last more than twenty minutes</li>
            <li> Just ordered my first bottle and im hooked.</li>
            <li> so I am basing my review on this product as a first time zero expectations user.</li>
            <li> Just like I remember it from the first time I bought it in Hawaii.  </li>
            <li> i first discovered this product in bermuda forty years ago amid ocean, oleander and cuban cigars.</li>
            <li> I first purchased Royall Lyme over 40 years ago while vacationing in Jamaica</li>
            <li> So much for the gift!</li>
            <li> Sampled it for the first time at Merz&#x27;s Apothecary at Lincoln Square in Chicago and the price scared me away.</li>
            <li> like it because it is light and fresh rather than the heavy, musky scents of so many colognes.</li>
            <li> A fresh and invigorating product that starts the day off on a high note!</li>
            <li> I want to say the first one lasted my husband about 2 years, using 5/7 days during the week after shaving.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty close.</li>
            <li> Very soothing, yet exciting and  enticing.  </li>
            <li> I was aware of this product for years, but kept delaying the purchase.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the first order from Royall Lyme.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other bay rums (my wife is pushing me to get a scent) and all have been pretty pleasant but this particular product did not come close, unless the bottle is more important to you than the scent inside</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long, but while it does it&#x27;s wonderful, especially after a</li>
            <li> TO be honest , nothing I can WRITE here, is going to tell you anything other than what I like.  </li>
            <li> Please go back to the original formula!</li>
            <li> But the scent does not linger very long and for the price I can buy many satisfying cologns that are in the same category.  </li>
            <li> In about an hour, pretty much no projection.</li>
            <li> It is a very refreshing product leaving a hint of Lime after it has dried.</li>
            <li> - they are so busy trying to put in the lastest fragrances they forget about the tried and true - what a shame - so I have had to go to the Internet - Amazon - to purchase.  </li>
            <li> Although it says it&#x27;s for men, I a feminine female use it on hot sticky days to refresh my skin and add a light lime fragrance to me.  </li>
            <li> This may be appealing to a particular taste but it is very different from contemporary  descent aftershaves.</li>
            <li> The packaging is gorgeous, but you would be better off buying something like Pinaud Clubman (with a similar scent) for much less money at your local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, but not overpowering even when he&#x27;s a little to generous in application.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> Fast service from Amazon</li>
            <li> for these items are the very lowest I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li> Between my husband high standards (it has to burn!)</li>
            <li> Feel refreshed and ready to greet the world</li>
            <li> I guess my sense of smell has changed because it didn&#x27;t appeal to me as much as it did years ago.  </li>
            <li> Yes its real mens aftershave and will burn like its supposed to.</li>
            <li> The whole presentation with the vintage packaging feels like you really splurged on yourself.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, it&#x27;s very close.  </li>
            <li> A real bummer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am Jeffrey Levenberg, my daughter is Alex, but Amazon can&#x27;t seem to even get that straight today.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband - he has used it for years and absolutely loves the fragrance - me too.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t put too much of it on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It might have appeal to those unfamiliar with the real product.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this - uses it up so fast that I buy 2 at a time.</li>
            <li> so I make my own lime cologne with Florida Water($3.95) and Key Lime Essential oil($3.95).</li>
            <li> The second was a distinct lack of heady, fresh aroma from either bottle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this product falls into the area of hazardous waste</li>
            <li> Bring the original quality formulas back.</li>
            <li> Well, after many other adventures, it&#x27;s a pleasure to have this \\&quot;lotion\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I had never encountered such a unique, citrus fragrance, so I determined to place an order through Amazon once I got home.  </li>
            <li> It met my expectations and was exactly the same as every order of the same product I have been using for many years</li>
            <li> is nice but doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> I commend it highly: fresh, crisp, subtle, sophisticated.</li>
            <li> and they are pretty old.</li>
            <li> Glad to find it on Amazon at about half the price.</li>
            <li> I have been extremely fond of this crisp, fresh scent ever since I discovered it whilst honeymooning on Bermuda in 1963!</li>
            <li> Classic.</li>
            <li> I tend to agree that this may not be quite the same formula as the stuff my mom brought me back from Bermuda many years ago.  </li>
            <li> a classic.</li>
            <li> It is not sweet or feminine but really a refreshing fragrance for a man.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> It was, well... not very pleasant might be a nice way of saying it.  </li>
            <li> But be warned,it has a significant alcohol content and stings a little if you use it right after shaving.</li>
            <li> If you are a fan of this product, you will be pleasantly surprised by the large size of this bottle.</li>
            <li> And I would add, having checked again just the other day, the scent lingers pretty much throughout the day, and is still fresh and invigorating.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s classic and unlike any modern scent, but doesn&#x27;t smell old or dated.</li>
            <li> Citrusy and sexy -- there is no more classic mens&#x27; fragrance on the market, today!</li>
            <li> I wonder if some of the negative reviews come from a time when there were production problems at the US facility (God knows where the stuff was actually being made, since it&#x27;s only \\&quot;licensed\\&quot; for US production), but the bottle that I got has been very good.  </li>
            <li> It is very fruity when first applied but has a slightly sweet scent after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I had to find my husband a different after shave after I became pregnant and developed severe morning sickness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Royall Lyme and Royall Spyce for DECADES, but when the last of my annual supply was running out, I quickly ordered one 8oz bottle each of Royall Lyme and Royall Spyce DIRECTLY FROM ROYALL LYME, so I know I wasn&#x27;t getting a counterfeit.  </li>
            <li> This product barely has the aroma and the appealing lime intensity and seems diluted with some other chemicals.</li>
            <li> The new formulation is horrific.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> I will be looking for a new Lime fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I will need to find a new after shave.</li>
            <li> If the formula back then (according to some other reviews) smelled even better than this, than man, I wish I had some of the older stuff too.</li>
            <li> The points on the \\&quot;crown\\&quot; may hurt if your hands are very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I mean, its more like the old Old Spice Lime after shave, the star of the local drug store after shaves than the original quality Royall Lyme.  </li>
            <li> The fact that Royall Lyme actually came from Bermuda added more dimension to it, both psychologically and emotionally.</li>
            <li> Whoever it is, they should be sacked, the foreign license agreements cancelled and the original formula, MADE IN BERMUDA, reinstated.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still married to the same woman.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly the same as the product we purchased 50 years ago on our honeymoon in Bermuda..</li>
            <li> Product quality same as the first purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the fragrance is exactly the same.</li>
            <li> In the future I will pay the $60.00 vs $32.00 and get the real thing!</li>
            <li> I recommend this cologne highly and I am a very picky cologne/perfume consumer that usually only finds a scent</li>
            <li> My current favourite is Royall Rugby, however, having said that, there&#x27;s something fantastic about a splash of Royall Lyme after a long shower on a summers day.</li>
            <li> The new USA-made lotion is thinner in scent, watery and less , oh, zesty than the Bermuda-made original.  </li>
            <li> The slight lime .fragrance is lovely especially in the summer.</li>
            <li> This product is my husband&#x27;s favorite after shave lotion and it is somewhat hard to come by.  </li>
            <li> Not balanced with a medicinal lime / in-you-face / fragrance which is being generous.&lt;br /&gt;The original formulation was balanced and crystal clear and clean with / subtle Key Lime notes.</li>
            <li> The scent is so soft and mellow.</li>
            <li> I am 52 - Management Professional.  </li>
            <li> Rather a soft fragrence that does not announce your presence to the world with a drum, but a violin.</li>
            <li> I can remember when I was a child my father always had the aroma of Old Spice around him, and today I have the aroma of Royall Lyme.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a far cry from the quality of the origiganl Burmuda made product.  </li>
            <li> My One Star rating is an early Christmas gift in June.</li>
            <li> long ago, my first bottles were the larger taller 10 ounce versions with real lead caps, and made in Bermuda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as how well it works ....</li>
            <li> Too much alcohol not enough lime!!!!</li>
            <li> The old addage \\&quot;You Get What You Pay</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy</li>
            <li> My old bottle that I bought in Bermuda has a stronger scent.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and always purchased through Amazon with complete satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Really like this, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been mentioned repeatedly that the old formula has been changed.</li>
            <li> The white cap is not securely glued to the metal crown top and will come out after about 10 uses.  </li>
            <li> around the same time from some other vendor (though through Amazon), and that product is fine.</li>
            <li> -as is the mandarin too, subtle and refreshing</li>
            <li> All that aside, Royall Lyme is a pleasantly refreshing and yet subtle after shave.</li>
            <li> Ownership of this fragrance has changed over the years and it is no longer made in Bermuda, but it still smells the same as when I first starting using it 45 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I first starting using this fragance back in 1966 while in Africa.</li>
            <li> The bottle is large and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This scent simply won me over, a highly subjective matter.</li>
            <li> Not to worry though, a little super glue fixes the problem.  </li>
            <li> With this new formulation, the scent will last 20-30 minutes tops.</li>
            <li> Royall Lyme is, as far as I know, the last lime scented aftershave that is a clear liquid rather than a slimy goop.</li>
            <li> I have used Royall Lyme for many years, and my most recent bottle left me with deep disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Royall Lyme has been a durable classic - all around use without fluffy foo-foo aura, and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the other reviewers who confirmed my worst fear that this once great formula has been compromised and cheapened.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care all that much if Royall Lyme is made in Bermuda or the USA so long as its quality is intact, but don&#x27;t try to lead people into fooling themselves to believe that this product is truly the same in every respect as it had been.  </li>
            <li> I have some left in old bottle,</li>
            <li> Perhaps not the scent for a young stud in a singles bar, but for a gentleman who will last the evening.</li>
            <li> I can barely detect the lyme fragrance</li>
            <li> Have worn the \\&quot;real\\&quot; islands&#x27; lime for 25 years, securing same on frequent trips to the Caribbean.</li>
            <li> For the money and the history nostalgia behind this product you will not regret the purchase if you love lime scent as I do.</li>
            <li> The large size will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I presumed it had been on the shelf far to long.  </li>
            <li> The frangrance doesn&#x27;t have much staying power and there is virtually no  dry down scent after ten or fifteen minutes.</li>
            <li> They are saying that the new formulation is only slightly changed from the old.</li>
            <li> they confirmed that it was not a pleasant smell at all...</li>
            <li> However as other reviews have mentioned this is no longer a Bermuda based company but is run out of New York City.</li>
            <li> The scent just doesn&#x27;t last long enough to justify the price.  </li>
            <li> These two bottles looked the same as usual in the packaging, but once removed, the bottles were not a deep green, the pungent lime smell was nonexistent, and the product seems like slightly colored alcohol, nothing more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time fan of Royall Lime as every other company that made a lime scent aftershave (i.e. Old Spice) no longer does</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a big fan of Royall Fragrances for a long time....</li>
            <li> Long lasting and not overpowering scents of Bay leaves, limes, and spice.  </li>
            <li> I have wanted this for a long time, and finally gave in and bought it.  </li>
            <li> But it is the little things like this that make a complete quality product raise the level to perfection.  </li>
            <li> Back in a day long past, Royall Lyme was the upstart taking on Old Spice.  </li>
            <li> Neither of us like heavy scents, and this one is masculine without having to be &#x27;macho.&#x27;</li>
            <li> With this minor flaw, I give it a 99 out of a 100.  </li>
            <li> I say aroma they say smell, but who cares as long as they like it.</li>
            <li> If I had purchased this product at a local men&#x27;s store, it would have been the same price for half the quantity.  </li>
            <li> I would enter \\&quot;lime aftershave\\&quot; in the search box above and check out other Amazon offerings.</li>
            <li> I sampled the other lime products when I went back to blade shaving.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering again and am now going to try a couple of the other Royall products.</li>
            <li> I conclude either the manufacturer has grossly diluted the formula, or it is a counterfeit, or there has been some other defect in the manufacturing.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years, and found it both easier and less expensive to find it and purchase it online via Amazon.com, than via conventional retail shopping.  </li>
            <li> only wish were a bit less costly</li>
            <li> no more no less and</li>
            <li> Product was delivered in less time than I anticipated and was it&#x27;s usual high quality.  </li>
            <li> No musk, no wood, no flowers, nothing but crisp lime that you smell when you scratch the thin green layer of lime skin from an actual lime.</li>
            <li> Old habits are hard to break.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll repurchase when this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> Thank you it was just what we expected.</li>
            <li> real green glass -its painted over with clear green&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find in the US.  </li>
            <li> The product was just as I had expected.  </li>
            <li> It is not strong, it is just enough -</li>
            <li> Only one minor complaint -</li>
            <li> My nausea is due to other things but the husband.</li>
            <li> like it as much as other designer</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s uniqueness from other lotions/colognes</li>
            <li> Here is where I may disagree with some other reviews that say the formula changed or</li>
            <li> I may try the other fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Almost all the other after-shave products on the market today are overwhelming--shake hands with a guy and you carry around his fragrance for hours.  </li>
            <li> I cannot use colognes or aftershaves with a perfume fragrance due to my severe allergies to all perfumes.</li>
            <li> How does it stack up with other lime scents?</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have suggested a formula change and/or a change in the manufacturing facility.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a dollar store product masquerading in legacy luxury, move on to other products.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other reviews here, I find  Royall Lyme stays with me all day.</li>
            <li> Not bad - I&#x27;ll continue to use it - but a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time to revoke the license - it&#x27;s only damaging the reputation that Royall Lyme had worked so hard to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will pour it down the drain.</li>
            <li> It has been cheapened, watered down lacks</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used Royall Lyme in a long time and, after reading some negative  reviews, decided to try two other lime colognes.  </li>
            <li> I bought mine and the Lyme soap bars at Joseph Barber &amp; Co. and a few other things.  </li>
            <li> Still, this does seem to have a round, plummy tang to it that the other two don&#x27;t have --</li>
            <li> There is a chemical aroma that wasn&#x27;t there previously.</li>
            <li> Nothing serious to report here, everyone is different in their preference.</li>
            <li> Not sweet, not cloying not leathery or spicy.  </li>
            <li> That is simply not true.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle enough not to offend those who don&#x27;t like or can&#x27;t take heavy fragrances.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little cheaper on amazon, but they don&#x27;t specialize in exclusive shaving accessories.</li>
            <li> What a let down!</li>
            <li> When the product came it was a few days until I opened the package.  </li>
            <li> and I have even noticed a few looks of \\&quot;nice\\&quot; from co-workers after they have gotten close during meetings and or discussions.  </li>
            <li> There is all this writing on the heavy paper that wraps the cologne box</li>
            <li> Now it is made here (USA) under a license and a few years ago</li>
            <li> by&amp;#34; of scents to wear on an everyday occasion.</li>
            <li> Either these are counterfeit bottles or they were misplaced in the Sahara for thirty years, before being discovered and shipped to me.</li>
            <li> And a mere watered down shadow of there former selves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing Royall Lyme, Bay Rhum, and Spyce for over 20 years but over the past few years I noticed that quality was ... lacking.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this product in the past.</li>
            <li> Merz let me try about five or six and sent me away with some small glass tubes with samples of a scent made in London.</li>
            <li> Caswell Massey Lime is drier and longer lasting, but is getting difficult to find -- discontinued, maybe?</li>
            <li> Well, unless your idea of limes is a dubious mixture of a a child&#x27;s neon green \\&quot;lime\\&quot; sucker and a urinal cake.</li>
            <li> At least I now know that I haven&#x27;t lost my mind nor sense of smell.  </li>
            <li> When I told them \\&quot;Amazon,\\&quot; they replied that they had no reliable sellers on Amazon or EBay and that knock-offs were common on the internet.  </li>
            <li> If you want a subtle cologne, use Royall Lyme or, for a change, Royall Spice. &lt;</li>
            <li> you want it to be understated and subtle.</li>
            <li> heavy / over-the-top fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is not like me to write a rather negative review, but I was a bit disappointed with  my recent purchase of Royall Lyme, a product that I have been using for over 40 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Royall fragrances since my early days in Bermuda and hate to be without it.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy and complements when I am casual but dressed up.</li>
            <li> It suits me to a tee as I am tired of the flowery stuff.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed is not the same formula that I bought in Bermuda .  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> One would have to stick his nose on the skin to smell the faint shadow of lime that was prevalent when sprayed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never grown tired of the fragrance!</li>
            <li> So sad.  </li>
            <li> Did I purchase the wrong product?</li>
            <li> Sadly I&#x27;ll be returning this.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Royall has licensed the production to a U.S. company and the quality has suffered.</li>
            <li> It is with sad regret that I must post this \\&quot;I don&#x27;t like it\\&quot; review of Royall Lyme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> unfortunately for the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> As a cologne it&#x27;s virtually useless unless you carry the bottle around with you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;added is so un-natural that it looks like an artificial snow cone colorant.</li>
            <li> it was almost as if the product had gone bad, if indeed aftershave can go bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never have a bad word to say about Royall Lyme, and this price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if Royall Lyme Bermuda wasn&#x27;t trying to deceive.  </li>
            <li> this change is very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that bad!</li>
            <li> If you have sissy girl skin or nasty shave bump face, you might want to stay away and stick to something from Nivea or baby lotion.</li>
            <li> This qualifies as one of the worst products</li>

            <li> I got a bottle as a gift years ago and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  ~ Bud</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT IN EVERY RESPECT!  SELLER A+++</li>
            <li> I have liked RL for many years...but...my bottle I opened this week, was not even close to the last bottle I bought. I have some left in old bottle, side by side they are like two diffrent colognes. My wife said ..get it out of the house.. The good news is, Amazon made good on the order. Going with Taylor No.74</li>
            <li> Love the scent, not overpowering.  Work for both me and my wife.  Not expensive.  Try it on your dog. Really?</li>
            <li> Royall Lyme has been a durable classic - all around use without fluffy foo-foo aura, and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> First smelled this in Bermuda 7 years ago.  Have purchased ever since.  Should I have the need to add a cologne (not the same brand or fragrance) for a night out, it does not conflict.</li>
            <li> Great for spring and summer</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and would recommend it to anyone. It smells very sweet, but maintains a manliness. I recommend this for spring and summer. Maybe go with Royall Spyce for the fall.</li>
            <li> Scent was as I remember from my youth.</li>
            <li> It smells like key lime and nothing else. No musk, no wood, no flowers, nothing but crisp lime that you smell when you scratch the thin green layer of lime skin from an actual lime. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I LOVE the smell!  However..... scent will last only about 30 minutes. In about an hour, pretty much no projection. One would have to stick his nose on the skin to smell the faint shadow of lime that was prevalent when sprayed.  Feels like I am being cheated by accountants at Royall Lyme of Bermuda so I make my own lime cologne with Florida Water($3.95) and Key Lime Essential oil($3.95). 7 oz of lime cologne for around $9.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this for over 30 years, and it&#x27;s great.  Fresh, tangy, and light.  Not sweet, not cloying not leathery or spicy.  Just enough to add a very light aroma to his clothes.  Neither of us like heavy scents, and this one is masculine without having to be &#x27;macho.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Been wearing Royal Lyme for years.  I work in a hospital and many times patient are allergic to certain colognes, never a problem with Royal Lyme.  I frequently get compliments from my female coworkers on how good I smell.  A great product I be wearing for years.  Fast service from Amazon and I&#x27;ll repurchase when this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> Royall Lyme and Royall Spyce are the very BEST fragrances I&#x27;ve used in over forty (40) years. I&#x27;ve never grown tired of the fragrance! In addition, the prices through [...] for these items are the very lowest I&#x27;ve ever found.  I priced the same items in Houston&#x27;s Galleria at over twice the amount that was listed at Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful aftershave.  I am allergic to many of the ones that my husband wears but this one I can tolerate...good enough to kiss him!</li>
            <li> Most refreshing aftershave I have found since finding it in Bermuda 40 years ago!</li>
            <li> I have been using Royal Lyme for many years and have been so happy with it; it is so light and refreshing.  Although it says it&#x27;s for men, I a feminine female use it on hot sticky days to refresh my skin and add a light lime fragrance to me.  It is so light, it has never at all been offensive to those around.  I have never found a product that comes close to this, try some, you too may become hooked on it.    Marilyn</li>
            <li> When the product came it was a few days until I opened the package.  When I opened the bottle, there was literally no scent.  I had already thrown out the packing slip and did not bother with a return.  I have used the product many times over the years, but will not order it again.  I presumed it had been on the shelf far to long.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I had to find my husband a different after shave after I became pregnant and developed severe morning sickness. Between my husband high standards (it has to burn!) and my puking every morning it was getting to be worrisome (maybe live apart until nausea ceased :))&lt;br /&gt;So glad I found this. The husband loves it. My nausea is due to other things but the husband. The scent is so soft and mellow. It has been 6 years and 2 children since we use it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several others but this is the best buy for your $$$</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Royall Lyme in 1964 when I visited Bermuda with the U.S. Navy.  It&#x27;s refreshing to the skin and has a unique scent of lime.  A truly outstanding after shave cologne.  I was delighted to locate it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This lotion can be used for aftershave or cologne. It is very fruity when first applied but has a slightly sweet scent after a few hours. It suits me to a tee as I am tired of the flowery stuff.</li>
            <li> My favorite aftershave I really like the sent of the lime.</li>
            <li> always refreshing and aromatic. The best.</li>
            <li> Husband LOVED it! the price was right! The fragrance is very nice. Need to get more! Thank you very much for such a delightful product!</li>
            <li> been using it for 20 years&lt;br /&gt;scent does not last but that&#x27;s o.k.&lt;br /&gt;one two three four five six seven</li>
            <li> Goes on strong then lingers softly.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy his cologne.</li>
            <li> Got what I ordered in a fair and timely manner. Can&#x27;t ask for better than that! These words are for filler.</li>
            <li> when i opened the bottle,[[ASIN:B000C21B54 Royall Bayrhum Of Bermuda By Royall Fragrances For Men. All Purpose Lotion 8.0 Oz.]] it didn&#x27;t smell as great until i splashed it on my palm and put it on my skin.it smelled real good.i like it as much as other designer brands.i think its a good buy for the buck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never smelled the original, but wow, this stuff smells really good. It smells like really fresh lime. If the formula back then (according to some other reviews) smelled even better than this, than man, I wish I had some of the older stuff too.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff-- been using it as aftershave for years.  Not too perfumy.</li>
            <li> Very fast service, great price, just as advertised , will buy from dealer again just as remembered as a college student</li>
            <li> I have used Royall Lyme off and on for many a year.  It is excellent now, and it was excellent waaaaaaay back then.  However, the manufacturer has shifted production from Bermuda to the mainland, and has altered the label from \\&quot;native limes\\&quot; to \\&quot;nature limes.\\&quot;  That is really kind of duplicitous.  I don&#x27;t care all that much if Royall Lyme is made in Bermuda or the USA so long as its quality is intact, but don&#x27;t try to lead people into fooling themselves to believe that this product is truly the same in every respect as it had been.  Where are you going to move production facilities to next:  China?  There is plenty of precedence for that kind of thing.  The fact that Royall Lyme actually came from Bermuda added more dimension to it, both psychologically and emotionally.</li>
            <li> Superb!  I am 52 - Management Professional.  Excellent Aftershave, I have been searching for a gentle refreshing nice Lime scent for years, this is it.  It is not strong, it is just enough - After shave is not meant to be overpowering and it is meant to be refreshing and imply a clean feel with intoxicating smell up close.  This is the one that does it.  My wife loves it and I have even noticed a few looks of \\&quot;nice\\&quot; from co-workers after they have gotten close during meetings and or discussions.  It is perfect and it is a smell and after shave that I like a lot.  The one who wears it is the true judge; all the others just sanction the fact that it is the right choice.  Well worth the money.  Only one minor complaint - The white cap is not securely glued to the metal crown top and will come out after about 10 uses.  Not to worry though, a little super glue fixes the problem.  But it is the little things like this that make a complete quality product raise the level to perfection.  With this minor flaw, I give it a 99 out of a 100.  Fix the QA problem with the cap and it is 100 out of a 100. No doubt! You will absolutly love it and not regret the purchase. I will be using this one for years to come!</li>
            <li> Very good product. This is the first time I have used it, but am very satisfied. Rather a soft fragrence that does not announce your presence to the world with a drum, but a violin. Perhaps not the scent for a young stud in a singles bar, but for a gentleman who will last the evening. If you sometimes wear a coat and tie; give it a try.</li>
            <li> I see that I&#x27;m not the first to notice something&#x27;s amiss at Royall Lyme.  At least I now know that I haven&#x27;t lost my mind nor sense of smell.  I&#x27;ve been wearing Royall Lyme and Royall Spyce for DECADES, but when the last of my annual supply was running out, I quickly ordered one 8oz bottle each of Royall Lyme and Royall Spyce DIRECTLY FROM ROYALL LYME, so I know I wasn&#x27;t getting a counterfeit.  The first thing I noticed when I opened it was, \\&quot;Made under license in the USA\\&quot; on the label.  The second was a distinct lack of heady, fresh aroma from either bottle.  It smelled more like scented rubbing alcohol.  Royall Lyme was, without doubt, the finest men&#x27;s fragrance in the world.  Not anymore.  Who&#x27;s at the helm of the company now?  An accountant?  Whoever it is, they should be sacked, the foreign license agreements cancelled and the original formula, MADE IN BERMUDA, reinstated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Royall Lyme longer than most people have been alive. It is a very refreshing product leaving a hint of Lime after it has dried. In my yesterday years Royall Lyme was appreciated by the girls and today my children and grand children even remark about how they like the smell. I say aroma they say smell, but who cares as long as they like it. I can remember when I was a child my father always had the aroma of Old Spice around him, and today I have the aroma of Royall Lyme. It just a nice clean aroma, not heavy or over powering, just the fresh fragrance of Limes. I guess I could say I appreciate Royall Lyme as I gave it to all the men in our wedding party 37 years ago and I&#x27;m still married to the same woman. Maybe it was my charm, or maybe it was the Royall Lyme, but who cares we&#x27;re still married.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the money.  Product was received in fine condition and smells very good.</li>
            <li> Citrusy and sexy -- there is no more classic mens&#x27; fragrance on the market, today!</li>
            <li> Smells true to its name</li>
            <li> Given the overwhelmingly postive reviews for this product, I was very surprised when I opened the bottle and smelled the scent.  It was, well... not very pleasant might be a nice way of saying it.  When I put a bit on and had my wife and kids smell it (thinking that perhaps it was my uneducated sniffer) they confirmed that it was not a pleasant smell at all... it was almost as if the product had gone bad, if indeed aftershave can go bad. Setting aside the aroma which to my taste was not at all appealing, the bottle was fantastic and the clever sealed paper packaging was great!  I have tried a few other bay rums (my wife is pushing me to get a scent) and all have been pretty pleasant but this particular product did not come close, unless the bottle is more important to you than the scent inside, I would probably try another brand or perhaps try the company&#x27;s sampler set which provides the buyer with more options!</li>
            <li> This has been my husbnd&#x27;s favorite after shave lotion for years. It is not always easy to get. Thank you</li>
            <li> Excellent price on a hard to find item</li>
            <li> Best all around cologne for men</li>
            <li> I have been extremely fond of this crisp, fresh scent ever since I discovered it whilst honeymooning on Bermuda in 1963!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find this aftershave for my father. He used it for many years but could no longer find it in the stores. He was thrilled that I was able to find it and give it to him for his 82nd birthday!</li>
            <li> Ownership of this fragrance has changed over the years and it is no longer made in Bermuda, but it still smells the same as when I first starting using it 45 years ago.  The sweet citrus fragrance may not please all but it&#x27;s uniqueness from other lotions/colognes makes it one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Crisp, clean scent just as I remember it.  But the scent does not linger very long and for the price I can buy many satisfying cologns that are in the same category.  However, the bay rum and other Royall fragrances are very good.</li>
            <li> This product has so many raving reviews that i ordered it.This may be appealing to a particular taste but it is very different from contemporary  descent aftershaves.It was returned because my female coworkers were offended by the smell of lime.So please dont use it on Date.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this product for years, and likes the feel of it on his face after a shave, as well as the very mild masculine scent that leaves him refreshed for hours.  A great product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is great and good for everyday use.  I am still using it despite having purchased a couple of years ago.  Great deal and good product.  The packaging is somewhat lacking however.</li>
            <li> This cannot be the after shave everyone is talking about. After buying it I threw it away! It&#x27;s that bad! I returned to check tthe dates of the good reviews and they are pretty old. The formula can not be the same stay away. I can not recommend Royal Lyme period.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed is not the same formula that I bought in Bermuda .  I will pour it down the drain.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion since I visited Bermuda forty years ago. It never dissapoints me. Love the freshness and fragrance .</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used Royall Lyme in a long time and, after reading some negative  reviews, decided to try two other lime colognes.  Taylor of Bond St. No. 74  is nice but doesn&#x27;t last long.  Crabtree &amp; Evelyn had a rather off-putting aroma.  I ordered Royall Lyme and the fragrance is what I remember.  Pungent, not too  sweet and long-lasting.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes.  Discovered it in Bermuda, and was delighted to find it for sale here.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the other reviewers who confirmed my worst fear that this once great formula has been compromised and cheapened. I have used the Royall Lyme and Royall Bhay Rum for over 20 years.It was the finest aftershave available. Recent shipments are not from Bermuda And a mere watered down shadow of there former selves. What a let down! Please fire the imbecile who ruined this formerly great product. Bring the original quality formulas back. Until then find something else to use.</li>
            <li> Great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a far cry from the quality of the origiganl Burmuda made product.  I can barely detect the lyme fragrance and I almost suspect that this was a bottled of mis-labled Vetvier.</li>
            <li> My dad always wore this cologne when I was growing up and I purchased it for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day.  After checking multiple sights this was the best price I could find-- especially with the free shipping!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because I love the smell of it.  If he doesn&#x27;t use it enough, I might steal it to use myself.</li>
            <li> YOU TOO CAN SMELL LIKE URINE - And feel like a Bahamian stud. So sad.  Have been a Royal Lyme user since 1966.  What has happened?</li>
            <li> This is a true, wonderful smelling Lime scented cologne! It has a fresh, clean lovely scent. The packaging is wonderful!! There is all this writing on the heavy paper that wraps the cologne box and it&#x27;s very entertaining to read. It reminds me of a J. Peterman ad for a product!! I recommend this cologne highly and I am a very picky cologne/perfume consumer that usually only finds a scent I like once every couple of years!!</li>
            <li> A terrific, refreshing scent of fresh squeezed limes. It reminds one of being on a tropical island with the breeze through swaying palm trees. It is not overpowering, but a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> Thank you it was just what we expected. Fresh lime scent and soothing! It also was more inexpensive then gift shops.</li>
            <li> I wear this in the office.  It&#x27;s subtle enough not to offend those who don&#x27;t like or can&#x27;t take heavy fragrances.  Almost candy-like, but in a fresh, clean way.</li>
            <li> This is always in my collection of after shave lotions. Feel refreshed and ready to greet the world</li>
            <li> Used it since 1961. My favorite April - OCT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become re-acquainted with Royall Lyme after a many years sabbatical and it&#x27;s as good and refreshing as I remember!  Back in a day long past, Royall Lyme was the upstart taking on Old Spice.  Some of us Kentucky \\&quot;hill boys\\&quot; ventured out to try the \\&quot;import\\&quot; and was delighted as to how it made the heat and humidity more bearable... Just like in the tropics!  Well, after many other adventures, it&#x27;s a pleasure to have this \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; (actually a cologne)as a staple refresher again!  I recommend it to your attention.</li>
            <li> It is not like me to write a rather negative review, but I was a bit disappointed with  my recent purchase of Royall Lyme, a product that I have been using for over 40 years. This time - it takes me awhile to go through the last bottle - when I re-ordered, I noticed that the product is now manufactured under franchise to some company in the &#x27;States, rather than in Bermuda. And there is quality difference. The new USA-made lotion is thinner in scent, watery and less , oh, zesty than the Bermuda-made original.  Did I purchase the wrong product? I mean, its more like the old Old Spice Lime after shave, the star of the local drug store after shaves than the original quality Royall Lyme.  Not bad - I&#x27;ll continue to use it - but a bit disappointing. So, its only 3 stars from me.</li>
            <li> I saw a bottle of Royal Lyme sitting on the counter of a local clothier, and tried it.  Wonderful!  I had never encountered such a unique, citrus fragrance, so I determined to place an order through Amazon once I got home.  Thank goodness I clicked on the reviews before I ordered, you folks saved me thirty five dollars.  Now I have to look for a substitute.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never have a bad word to say about Royall Lyme, and this price can&#x27;t be beat. (As of 5/20/15).</li>
            <li> A bit &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; aroma, but it reminds me of years gone by, and is a clean scent with no residual stickiness.</li>
            <li> I remember Royall Lyme from years ago when I loved it and bought a bottle for a boyfriend.  I would think about the scent every so often, but I have never seen it on a store shelf (or else didn&#x27;t think about looking).  I finally decided to buy some for myself, even though it is advertised as being for men.  I guess my sense of smell has changed because it didn&#x27;t appeal to me as much as it did years ago.  I still like it, but it is pricey, so I won&#x27;t buy it again.  Maybe it is best left for men to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a big fan of Royall Fragrances for a long time....My current favourite is Royall Rugby, however, having said that, there&#x27;s something fantastic about a splash of Royall Lyme after a long shower on a summers day. The immediate scent of lime is superb to the senses, you literally feel it all over. It doesn&#x27;t last long, but while it does it&#x27;s wonderful, especially after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cooling, refreshing, invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely go for the 8oz size....you&#x27;ll use a lot of it.</li>
            <li> If I had purchased this product at a local men&#x27;s store, it would have been the same price for half the quantity.  It was a very good deal.   JM</li>
            <li> Royall Lyme is, as far as I know, the last lime scented aftershave that is a clear liquid rather than a slimy goop. I have used it for years. The packing is minimal (excellent) and the bottles look great. Buy it - I want to keep it available, and I can use only so much on my own.</li>
            <li> I have been using Royal Lyme for Many years. Now My son -in-law and grandson are great fans of the Lime. Amazon always offers a great price. We love it.</li>
            <li> I favor this product, seems to be the same Royal Lime I&#x27;ve been using for years...only wish were a bit less costly so I could apply as generously as the label recommends...  ;-)</li>
            <li> Great scent! I haven&#x27;t found any scent I like better! I just wish it would last more than twenty minutes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lime-aholic and this is my favorite aftershave/cologne. I&#x27;ve used this for years and hope it will be available for years to come.</li>
            <li> Just ordered my first bottle and im hooked. Very nice light and clean scent. I wish the smell would hold longer but citrus notes will always fade faster than heavier notes. That is not a fault of Royall Lyme, but simple science. I will order another bottle as soon as this runs out. Yes its real mens aftershave and will burn like its supposed to. I love that clean crisp feeling. If you have sissy girl skin or nasty shave bump face, you might want to stay away and stick to something from Nivea or baby lotion.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product in the past. It has been on the market for over forty years. The new formulation is horrific.&lt;br /&gt;A heavy / over-the-top fragrance. Not balanced with a medicinal lime / in-you-face / fragrance which is being generous.&lt;br /&gt;The original formulation was balanced and crystal clear and clean with / subtle Key Lime notes. The bottle I received was&lt;br /&gt;leaking so I tightened the lead cap. I had to use a medicinal cleaner to remove the fragrance from my fingers. The color&lt;br /&gt;added is so un-natural that it looks like an artificial snow cone colorant. I would return this product in a heartbeat / however&lt;br /&gt;this product falls into the area of hazardous waste so I am / $ 40.00 / out of pocket. This qualifies as one of the worst products&lt;br /&gt;that I have ever purchased through Amazon. This is only the second product that I have been compelled to write a very&lt;br /&gt;negative review about. Amazon / drop this product like a hot rock! My One Star rating is an early Christmas gift in June.</li>
            <li> This product is my husband&#x27;s favorite after shave lotion and it is somewhat hard to come by.  I was thrilled to be able to find it at Amazon.  Delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT &amp; EXCELLENT PRICE and service! I&#x27;ve been using this product for years (50) and never found a better price for the 8oz size!! THANKS!!  Will rebuy as needed!!</li>
            <li> Not what it used to be.  Mostly smells like alcohol.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly the same as the product we purchased 50 years ago on our honeymoon in Bermuda.. It smells so good.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years and I love the fresh clean lime fragrance, my wife l loves it on me.  Sometimes it is hard to find; Amazons price is the best.</li>
            <li> Like ERT below-i too have been using this about forty years!&lt;br /&gt;So long ago, my first bottles were the larger taller 10 ounce versions with real lead caps, and made in Bermuda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrances, like art, food preferences and music are highly personal. TO be honest , nothing I can WRITE here, is going to tell you anything other than what I like.  My best attempt would be think gin and tonic with lots of fresh lime-its similar, generally, to that smell, but no juniper, so actually tonic and lime is more accurate. I think its better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is, to my taste, the best after shave.  I love its fresh lime scent. To my nose, a quality scent with lots of lime essence.  i particularly love its subtlety; i like to be well groomed, but i do not like longer lasting fragrance, no matter how wonderful, as they seem to overwhelm me, others in the room, and things like food, wine, or even getting a &#x27;second wind&#x27; of heavier fragrances when you exercise-when what you really want is untainted air, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-and i agree, from memory of course, and perhaps reduced olifactories, its not the same as i remember it&lt;br /&gt;not real green glass -its painted over with clear green&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -not as robust and fresh and lime peel scented as once, but still the best available&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;still my favorite -as is the mandarin too, subtle and refreshing&lt;br /&gt;and truly a great after shave to calm skin-after the initial flinch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the best for me is that this fragrance is subtle and natural, you never smell foppish nor fill a room or make passers-by wonder where &#x27;that smell&#x27; is originating, and, once on, after a minute or so, only someone very close indeed may be able to smell it, and it is a clean fragrance for the well groomed and understated.</li>
            <li> Here is where I may disagree with some other reviews that say the formula changed or it was better 20 years ago etc...... I have never used this product until today so I am basing my review on this product as a first time zero expectations user. I found this AS/cologne to be amazing in the sense that it smells exactly like a freshly squeezed lime. no more no less and the saying power is amazing...... I personally would give this a 50/50 pro/con as sometimes I want my EDT to shine and if using this AS for my shave I better be wearing a citrus based EDT so it does limit you there. As far as how well it works .... perfectly it stings as any alcohol based AS will and closes off your pores. For the money and the history nostalgia behind this product you will not regret the purchase if you love lime scent as I do.</li>
            <li> This was given to me as a Fathers day present by my daughter.  I have been using this as an after shave for many years and it leaves my face fresh feeling.  It appears that since it has been manufactured in the states, rather that bermuda, that the scent has change somewhat, however it is my favorite after shave.</li>
            <li> FABULOUS!!! My Boyfriend love&#x27;s it!!!!</li>
            <li> Classic. Never disappoints. Great value. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different, but it has a nice clean smell.  Husband was impressed with it.  I would recommend it to anyone that also likes English Leather fragrances.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Not too overwhelming, lasts an hour or two.</li>
            <li> Best cologne in the world! It is the only one for me! Just look at the last three numbers on my american express card! 007</li>
            <li> I use this product every time that I shave. Now buy it two bottles at a time. Will continue to.</li>
            <li> Not the same Royal Lime of 10 years ago! Too much alcohol not enough lime!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for years.  Just a great clean smell</li>
            <li> This is the best cologne/aftershave lotion. The smell reminds me of the tropics. The large size will last a very long time. The whole presentation with the vintage packaging feels like you really splurged on yourself. The only issue for some might be the lid. The points on the \\&quot;crown\\&quot; may hurt if your hands are very sensitive. Thank you for continuing to produce this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from Amazon a couple of years ago now, and have read with interest the reviews here over the years.  I tend to agree that this may not be quite the same formula as the stuff my mom brought me back from Bermuda many years ago.  Nevertheless, it&#x27;s very close.  I wonder if some of the negative reviews come from a time when there were production problems at the US facility (God knows where the stuff was actually being made, since it&#x27;s only \\&quot;licensed\\&quot; for US production), but the bottle that I got has been very good.  And I would add, having checked again just the other day, the scent lingers pretty much throughout the day, and is still fresh and invigorating.  So, I think you can buy this from Amazon with a measure of confidence.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if Royall Lyme Bermuda wasn&#x27;t trying to deceive.  They are saying that the new formulation is only slightly changed from the old. That is simply not true. When this was made in Bermuda, it lasted a lot longer, with a stronger and more pleasant lime scent. With this new formulation, the scent will last 20-30 minutes tops. There is a chemical aroma that wasn&#x27;t there previously. There is a reason why this is getting pushed through Amazon and ebay.  They took a quality product and made it inferior, and they are getting sales from people who either do not know better, or people who have been using their products for years and are getting duped with the new stuff. I got duped, so they got one sale out of me.  I would enter \\&quot;lime aftershave\\&quot; in the search box above and check out other Amazon offerings.</li>
            <li> Smells like chemicals or scented rubbing alcohol. Please go back to the original formula! Sadly I&#x27;ll be returning this.</li>
            <li> I first starting using this fragance back in 1966 while in Africa.And now 48 years later I still use the Royall Lyme..I got my son hooked on this fragrance also..</li>
            <li> If you are a fan of this product, you will be pleasantly surprised by the large size of this bottle.</li>
            <li> My husband can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff. He&#x27;s been a fan for decades. Product quality same as the first purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update -- another reorder and according to my husband the fragrance is exactly the same. btw, he&#x27;s been a fan for over 30ty years. if you&#x27;re looking for lime this is the one!</li>
            <li> I love lime! These are 2 great products if you like a crisp scent of lime. I wish I could find more lime after shave products.</li>
            <li> The entire &amp;#34;Royall&amp;#34; line is wonderful. Even though the Bermudan company has now licensed its name to have product made in the United States, I sense no decline in quality.</li>
            <li> My husband has used Royall Lyme for years and it has become &amp;#34;his&amp;#34; scent!  We both really like the clean, fresh smell.</li>
            <li> My husband had been searching for a cologne that smelled like his one-time favorite called, Caribe, which he used to only be able to buy in the Bahamas. He searched for a couple of years and finally found it at amazon.com and was ecstatic! It was a different name, but smelled the same. He was extremely happy with the delivery and packaging and will be purchasing more in the future. Great experience!</li>
            <li> Just like I remember it from the first time I bought it in Hawaii.  It was at a better price too.  I may try the other fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph R. Krempasky</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction and item.</li>
            <li> Royall Lyme is a cool clean scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Smells great and my granddaughter&#x27;s fiance was thrilled I found his favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> The freshest of citrus smells in a short lasting splash.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Hard to find locally. Smells really nice and it is a huge bottle.</li>
            <li> I started using this product.in 1962.  It is no longer the same product. It has been cheapened, watered down lacks that great lime scent that would linger softly and sutbtley.  I received so many compliments over the years this change is very disappointing.  I will be looking for a new Lime fragrance.  Maybe St. Johns still makes a quality product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product as an after shave lotion for more than 40 years and nothing compares to it.  A man&#x27;s fragrance should only be smelled when you&#x27;re inches away from him, not across the room.  Almost all the other after-shave products on the market today are overwhelming--shake hands with a guy and you carry around his fragrance for hours.  If you want a subtle cologne, use Royall Lyme or, for a change, Royall Spice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Amazon.com had the best price on this item, less than half the retail price, with free shipping.  A great deal!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the Royall Lyme that I got to know in the 1960&#x27;s, when it cam from Bermuda.  Now it is made here (USA) under a license and a few years ago I think the closest a lime came to the lotion was the one in an employee&#x27;s lunch.  Now it is somewhat better and the price is well worth the less limey smell than the original.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the line of Royall fragrances for years. Unfortunately Royall has licensed the production to a U.S. company and the quality has suffered. The frangraces seem diluted and  litte off regarding the recipe for repliicating the original formula. The frangrance doesn&#x27;t have much staying power and there is virtually no  dry down scent after ten or fifteen minutes.</li>
            <li> This is a great aftershave. Longevity might not be that great but it&#x27;s a great scent and calms your skin after the shave.</li>
            <li> What a great deal.  This isn&#x27;t really an  &amp;#34;eau du cologne&amp;#34; but a &amp;#34;body cologne&amp;#34;...either way, it is a great smell and I&#x27;m glad I discovered it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites.  I bought mine and the Lyme soap bars at Joseph Barber &amp; Co. and a few other things.  It&#x27;s a little cheaper on amazon, but they don&#x27;t specialize in exclusive shaving accessories. The scent is perfect for summer and is very lite with a clean fresh scent.  One of my favorites.  The mandarin is good too...</li>
            <li> i first discovered this product in bermuda forty years ago amid ocean, oleander and cuban cigars. a refreshing, lovely scent. it will forever remind me of summer.</li>
            <li> As an Aftershave and Cologne &#x27;Royal Lyme&#x27; is comparable to many of our US Domestically produced products. However, it is noticeably of a lower quality than the Original Bermuda produced product. The old addage \\&quot;You Get What You Pay For\\&quot; holds true with the US Licensed Product. In the future I will pay the $60.00 vs $32.00 and get the real thing! This also applies to the Royal Bay Rum Products which I purchased at the same time as my Royal Lyme. Both are licensed and produced in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bermuda Produce is a superior product.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this scent on my hubby.,  The slight lime .fragrance is lovely especially in the summer. It&#x27;s not heavy&lt;br /&gt;and he gets many compliments when he wears it.  Have ordered before and will again.</li>
            <li> my husband has aways like the aftershave.  and i was so happy to find   it on amazon.  i can not find it in akron, ohio</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my father, and once again-as it has for many years-it serves up exactly the fragrance he wants without any risk of skin irritation (an effect many colognes have on him).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years, and found it both easier and less expensive to find it and purchase it online via Amazon.com, than via conventional retail shopping.  E. B. Kornblue, D.D.S.</li>
            <li> I first purchased Royall Lyme over 40 years ago while vacationing in Jamaica and it has remained a favorite fragrance ever since. It is refreshing and light and always brings back the memories of the exotic tropics.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews of products I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon. But the Royall Lyme cologne is so special I made an exception. I cannot use colognes or aftershaves with a perfume fragrance due to my severe allergies to all perfumes. But Royall Lyme has such a wonderful,genuine lime smell that it does not bother me at all. And the pure lime smell it has really cannot be described accurately in words,you have to experience it. But be warned,it has a significant alcohol content and stings a little if you use it right after shaving. In my opinion,this item is absolutely unique and superb.Really worth the rather steep price tag. Please try it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item as a gift, checked the &amp;#34;GIFT&amp;#34; option, and included a free greeting card.&lt;br /&gt;When the order arrived, there was no gift card, and the receipt was included with the price shown... So much for the gift!</li>
            <li> My husband wore it years ago so we decided to purchase it again - just as we remembered it, very clean and refreshing!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 30  years.  I use to have to go to bermuda to buy this. It is great now that i can buy this over the internet.</li>
            <li> Always can count on Royall Lyme to please the hubby--He treasures that stuff!</li>
            <li> I had used this product many years ago and really liked it. I found out, after moving to Alaska, that the mosquitoes liked it as well. I have since left Alaska and have started using it again. It is NOT an overpowering sweet cologne.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Sampled it for the first time at Merz&#x27;s Apothecary at Lincoln Square in Chicago and the price scared me away. Went looking for it on Amazon and found it for about a third of its retail price at a brick and mortar store. Scent is mainly an emotional thing, and highly personal, so there&#x27;s nothing objective to say. I sampled the other lime products when I went back to blade shaving. The English Leather Lime scent I grew up with in the 70&#x27;s no longer exists, so I looked for something similar. Merz let me try about five or six and sent me away with some small glass tubes with samples of a scent made in London. This scent simply won me over, a highly subjective matter. The review some lady posted included here somewhere conjured up memories of her honeymoon in Bermuda and made me smile, reinforcing my choice. Not only does it smell good, but the inside and outside of the wrapper is over the top funny, complete with suggestions to sprinkle it everywhere many times a day, consume it rapidly, and come back to buy more. So it smells good and the people who make it have a sense of humor. That&#x27;s enough for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 50 years.  It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find in the US.  I&#x27;ve purchased it when in Bermuda where it is made and it&#x27;s more expensive there than on Amazon.  A good buy for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I like it because it is light and fresh rather than the heavy, musky scents of so many colognes.</li>
            <li> I have been using Royall Lyme for many years. The deals at Amazon.com are as good as any you will find.</li>
            <li> I love it! Nothing serious to report here, everyone is different in their preference. I love it though! Hope I can continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> A fresh and invigorating product that starts the day off on a high note!</li>
            <li> I have used this product since the 1960s. It is very fine. I commend it highly: fresh, crisp, subtle, sophisticated.</li>
            <li> Product is not the same as it used to be.  The aroma has been changed.  Different formula or diluted?</li>
            <li> It met my expectations and was exactly the same as every order of the same product I have been using for many years</li>
            <li> this is not cologne or after shave...it is &amp;#34;Lotion&amp;#34; as described on the bottle.Splash it on and wait 15 seconds...you might as well have splashed water on your face.</li>
            <li> This aftershave has a light, but very refreshing and energizing scent that is not overpowering or offensive at all. My husband and I both love the scent of it. This is the second bottle we have purchased. The bottle is large and goes a long way. I want to say the first one lasted my husband about 2 years, using 5/7 days during the week after shaving. The package is also fun that it comes in. Great product.</li>
            <li> It is with sad regret that I must post this \\&quot;I don&#x27;t like it\\&quot; review of Royall Lyme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing Royall Lyme, Bay Rhum, and Spyce for over 20 years but over the past few years I noticed that quality was ... lacking.  When I began to notice the \\&quot;Made under license in USA\\&quot; on the labels, I could tell that something had changed ... unfortunately for the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What used to be an invigorating &amp; refreshing cologne has now been reduced to the fragrance of isopropyl alcohol and lime juice.  It&#x27;s time to revoke the license - it&#x27;s only damaging the reputation that Royall Lyme had worked so hard to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only hope that the owners of Royall Lyme will cancel the US manufacturing licenses and return production back to Bermuda.</li>
            <li> The man of the house likes this product a great deal. It&#x27;s not quite the original but it&#x27;s pretty close. This is his &amp;#34;old stand by&amp;#34; of scents to wear on an everyday occasion. He is happy with it. That&#x27;s all that matters. You will be pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time fan of Royall Lime as every other company that made a lime scent aftershave (i.e. Old Spice) no longer does so.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen this in stores and only one or two others sell it by mail order.  I like the lime scent and have always come back to using it.  Old habits are hard to break.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wondered about this product, it finally peaked my interest and I ordered it.  Very glad I did!  Reminds me of sun, sand, and tropical steel drums.  Long lasting and not overpowering scents of Bay leaves, limes, and spice.  Cooling and very refreshing, it even directs you to keep it in the fridge during hot weather to increase its effect.  Timeless classic packaging makes a great gift for the mature man or even the younger crowd interested in standing out from the smell du jour groups.  I will definitely be ordering again and am now going to try a couple of the other Royall products.</li>
            <li> My go to after shave.</li>
            <li> I got this for my dad for his birthday, it&#x27;s one of his favorites.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as strong as it was.</li>
            <li> This stuff&#x27;s a movie star. Terence Stamp used it in \\&quot;The Limey\\&quot; while hunting Peter Fonda. Ye olde tyme apothecarie bottle&#x27;s quite photogenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every well-groomed gentleman-of-distinction type needs a citrus aftershave for summer weather, and this does the job admirably. How does it stack up with other lime scents? Caswell Massey Lime is drier and longer lasting, but is getting difficult to find -- discontinued, maybe? And I frankly think the St. John stuff, in its famous wicker bottle, is marginally better -- as is their bay rum, IMO -- but you have to order it from their website, and it costs more. Still, this does seem to have a round, plummy tang to it that the other two don&#x27;t have -- probably the result of a floral note of some sort. Brooks Brothers has been retailing this stuff forever, so it won&#x27;t be discontinued anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s good enough for Terence Stamp, it&#x27;s good enough for you.</li>
            <li> My old bottle that I bought in Bermuda has a stronger scent. I guess it is now bottled in the U.S. Oh well...........</li>
            <li> If you like lime ... you&#x27;ll LOVE this!  Very fresh, clean aroma.  It&#x27;s my Dad&#x27;s favorite.  Glad to finally be able to order it in the USA!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this. Have been looking for years to buy for him.</li>
            <li> Great semi-sweet smell. Silky. A throw back to my days in college during the 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Smells great when put on, but after 15 minutes it has faded away. I would not buy this product again. Sorry.</li>
            <li> A very refreshing aftershave.</li>
            <li> This smells almost nothing of limes. Well, unless your idea of limes is a dubious mixture of a a child&#x27;s neon green \\&quot;lime\\&quot; sucker and a urinal cake. Foul stuff. I don&#x27;t know what happened, I used to like this stuff. Other reviewers have suggested a formula change and/or a change in the manufacturing facility. Either way, it has done no favors to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zero stars</li>
            <li> Product was delivered in less time than I anticipated and was it&#x27;s usual high quality.  Have used this product for years and always purchased through Amazon with complete satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, have been using it for a very long time.  However, when it was made in Bermuda, it was even better</li>
            <li> Need I say more!!! I will not buy another bottle of this even for $3. Is there a way to get my money back?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Royall Lyme for twenty five years or so, and have bought it from Amazon before,to my satisfaction. These two bottles looked the same as usual in the packaging, but once removed, the bottles were not a deep green, the pungent lime smell was nonexistent, and the product seems like slightly colored alcohol, nothing more. Either these are counterfeit bottles or they were misplaced in the Sahara for thirty years, before being discovered and shipped to me. A real bummer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I am Jeffrey Levenberg, my daughter is Alex, but Amazon can&#x27;t seem to even get that straight today. Good luck with your new Kindles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Royall fragrances since my early days in Bermuda and hate to be without it.  Great gal trap!!  The extra required word.</li>
            <li> My aftershave for 45 years, If it&#x27;s not broke, don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> Really like this, especially in the summer. Is nice and refreshing. Not too heavy and complements when I am casual but dressed up.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for my husband for years and have not been able to find it in stores anymore.  It is wonderful.  Smells awesome and doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies.  Very soothing, yet exciting and  enticing.  Bold lime from Bermuda and has the island feel.  I Love it!  I wish they would make a women&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband - he has used it for years and absolutely loves the fragrance - me too.  I cannot find this is a brick and mortar store in my city - they are so busy trying to put in the lastest fragrances they forget about the tried and true - what a shame - so I have had to go to the Internet - Amazon - to purchase.  I am so glad I found it and at the price point.  I use to pay a lot more for it at a department store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Royall Lyme</li>
            <li> This is the same product that I have purchased from Brooks Brothers for years. Big difference - $30 for 8 ounces versus $40 for 4 ounces!</li>
            <li> Delightful and unique lime fragrance. Beautiful packaging.&lt;br /&gt;The glass bottle is a treasure. Feels great.  Cooling, refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;Well suited for warm summer evenings.</li>
            <li> This is a very good one. An excellent lime fragrance that is not strong or overpowering but does last quite awhile. It is not sweet or feminine but really a refreshing fragrance for a man.</li>
            <li> I have used (and liked) Royall Lyme for decades.  This time, the product I received from Amazon had a musky smell.  I wrote to customer service at Royall Lyme Bermuda to ask if they had reformulated the fragrance.  They replied that the fragrance should have been the same as always and asked where I got it.  When I told them \\&quot;Amazon,\\&quot; they replied that they had no reliable sellers on Amazon or EBay and that knock-offs were common on the internet.  I&#x27;ll never buy it through Amazon again.  I was ripped off!</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of this companies products for some time. However as other reviews have mentioned this is no longer a Bermuda based company but is run out of New York City. The formulas have changed and customer service degraded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a damaged bottle, upon contacting the company I was told I would be provided a replacement bottle by a customer service rep. by the name \\&quot;Phillip\\&quot;. After several days of non receipt of the promised replacement bottle, I contacted the company to be told by \\&quot;Philip\\&quot; he had made a mistake and now I needed to ship him a bottle at my own expense and they would consider weather to provide a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a dollar store product masquerading in legacy luxury, move on to other products.</li>
            <li> The product was just as I had expected.  I had tried the product as a sample in a brick &amp; mortar store.  I enjoy the unusual fragrance.  I was aware of this product for years, but kept delaying the purchase.</li>
            <li> Not quite the same as when it came from Bermuda, must be the water.  BUT, it still smells great and is my go to after shave in the summer.  Glad to find it on Amazon at about half the price.</li>
            <li> A very refreshing fragrance.  A good size bottle.  Worth the money.  I like it, and better yet, my wife likes it.</li>
            <li> The absolute best lime scent you will ever find.  Love it when my husband wears this!</li>
            <li> Love this cologne. It&#x27;s all I wear. Light smell. You can&#x27;t put too much of it on. Great Stuff.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing. Have worn the \\&quot;real\\&quot; islands&#x27; lime for 25 years, securing same on frequent trips to the Caribbean. The original Jamaican Lyme puts this product to shame. This product barely has the aroma and the appealing lime intensity and seems diluted with some other chemicals. ($38. ?????)&lt;br /&gt;It might have appeal to those unfamiliar with the real product.</li>
            <li> I have wanted this for a long time, and finally gave in and bought it.  It&#x27;s a wonderful scent, but it&#x27;s more of an aftershave than a cologne.  The scent just doesn&#x27;t last long enough to justify the price.  The packaging is gorgeous, but you would be better off buying something like Pinaud Clubman (with a similar scent) for much less money at your local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Great Refreshing after shave! This has been around for a long time but it is as good now as it always has been.</li>
            <li> Usual good quality - a nice scent.</li>
            <li> The only aftershave since the 1960&#x27;s.  I guess I&#x27;m stuck in a pattern but I&#x27;m glad that I am.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  Good quality and perfect 3 ft length.  If I could, I would give it 6 stars.  I liked it on facebook.  I hooked it up to my putter and it was like bam! terminator 2.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this fragrance - he has been using it for years.</li>
            <li> This all purpose lotion has a really nice smell, and is good as aftershave or cologne (hence all purpose).  He has used it for years.  He also wishes they had an aftershave balm in the same fragrance.</li>
            <li> My hubby likes both the Spyce and Lyme. So do I. So I bought both for him. It&#x27;s been his mainstay cologne for our 32+ years of marriage. Nice fragrance, but not overpowering even when he&#x27;s a little to generous in application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Royal Lyme for years. I like it because it has a nice pleasant smell and isn&#x27;t overpowering. I see no difference in the product since it is no longer made in Bermuda.</li>
            <li> This stuff lasts around 20 minutes! No kidding. As a cologne it&#x27;s virtually useless unless you carry the bottle around with you.</li>
            <li> I have used Royall Lyme for many years, and my most recent bottle left me with deep disappointment.  The product is almost all water.  I will need to find a new after shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been good since 1965</li>
            <li> This is a great spring/summer scent. I&#x27;ve been wearing Royall Rugby for the fall/winter months and decided to switch over to something lighter.  Unlike the other reviews here, I find  Royall Lyme stays with me all day. Of course it&#x27;s not as potent as it was in 1959. It doesn&#x27;t have to be. It&#x27;s not combating the smells of 1959. Cigarette smoke, smog, Aqua-Net and hair pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Royall Lyme is very clean and refreshing. It&#x27;s classic and unlike any modern scent, but doesn&#x27;t smell old or dated. To me, it smells like monied sophistication, Aristotle Onasis or James Bond in the Bahamas</li>
            <li> I have used this product happily for over 40 years. The bottle I purchased from Amazon in February I just opened today. It has virtually no scent at all. I conclude either the manufacturer has grossly diluted the formula, or it is a counterfeit, or there has been some other defect in the manufacturing. The same company also makes a mandarin orange fragrance. I bought a bottle of that around the same time from some other vendor (though through Amazon), and that product is fine. But something is sure wrong with the Royall Lyme.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been mentioned repeatedly that the old formula has been changed. It may not be what we remember from Trimingham&#x27;s on Front Street in Hamilton, Bermuda. Stuff changes, and even Trimingham&#x27;s itself is gone. All that aside, Royall Lyme is a pleasantly refreshing and yet subtle after shave. It is not overpowering at all. Years ago I heard this wisdom: &amp;#34;If you choose to wear a cologne or fragrance you want it to be understated and subtle. You do not want to hear &#x27;What is that smell?&#x27; Instead what you hope for is &#x27;Who is that man?&#x27;&amp;#34; My nose tells me that&#x27;s what comes with Royall Lyme. Fresh limes, gin and tonic, summer evening. It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. My guy loves this scent, as do I. This isn&#x27;t the first order from Royall Lyme.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband - one of his favorite scents</li>
            <li> Missed buying some in Bermuda when I went years ago.  Now it brings back some wonderful memories every time I wear it.  It was for sale everywhere there and became a permanent memory of Bermuda for me.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> This was the colonge of choice for all BMOC&#x27;s in the 1960&#x27;s and here&#x27;s why. It&#x27;s scent it light, fresh and invigorating. The women love it!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this - uses it up so fast that I buy 2 at a time.</li>
            <li> Not the same product I have used f or over forty years</li>
            <li> Have been using Royal Fragrances for years. Would alternate between several fragrances on a daily basis. My all time favorite is Royal Lime.....a classic.</li>
