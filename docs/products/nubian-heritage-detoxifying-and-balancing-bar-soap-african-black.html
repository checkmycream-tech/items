            <li>so I was excited to receive this.</li>
            <li>The best black soap I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>I Love this soap will be ordering more and maybe some other products...</li>
            <li>It sort of brightened my face with a smooth texture making my complexion come alive.</li>
            <li>I read about this product on the internet and decided to try it because I&#x27;m getting married in April and would rather not have zits all over my face anymore.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t melt away after the first couple of baths/</li>
            <li>and it leaves your skin smooth and soft, i&#x27;m impress.</li>
            <li>i will definitely be ordering some more in a month.</li>
            <li>My skin is super clear and always feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked using black soap for my acne issues</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>my face feels soft and moist right after use.</li>
            <li>My jawline is almost perfectly smooth, five-year old acne scars are clearing up, and I haven&#x27;t had a major chin breakout in weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>really cleaned my make up completely.</li>
            <li>Love black soap clears your face of any mark,acne,and evens skin tone!</li>
            <li>This soap doesn&#x27;t seem to deep clean as well as the Dudu Osun, and I was left (if I scrape my nail against my skin on my cheek) with residue on my skin.</li>
            <li>Skin was too sensitive and I broke out more than usual using this.</li>
            <li>Alright, first off this soup gets rid of acne, blemishes, and makes your skin so extremely soft to the point where when you use it you think you still have soap on you when you&#x27;ve actually washed it all off.</li>
            <li>Once I started using it, my face began to clear up.</li>
            <li>My  mom was so surprised with the results that she decided to buy some for my 17 yr old  arenephew who&#x27;s been struggling with acne as well.</li>
            <li>, it is kind of loud, but the soap is definitely less harsh than the Dudu Osun.</li>
            <li>It is very effective and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like regular raw black soap.</li>
            <li>As soon as I used it, the next day I seen results,  stubborn pimples were starting to go down and within a week my face was becoming brighter as my dark marks were becoming less visible.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> The best black soap I&#x27;ve used so far. In the shortest amount of time that I have had this soap it has cleared my skin. Even my mother noticed ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is very effective and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like regular raw black soap. Once I started using it, my face began to clear up. Though, it didn&#x27;t take away my dark spots. It sort of brightened my face with a smooth texture making my complexion come alive. I strongly recommend using this soap.</li>
            <li> I have had hormonal acne on my chin for about ten years (acne disappearing after your teens is a myth, people). I&#x27;ve used a lot of chemical products to treat it, and I&#x27;ve never had a ton of luck. I&#x27;d still get regular breakouts that I eventually just started to accept as the norm. I read about this product on the internet and decided to try it because I&#x27;m getting married in April and would rather not have zits all over my face anymore. Let me say...I LOVE THIS SOAP. My jawline is almost perfectly smooth, five-year old acne scars are clearing up, and I haven&#x27;t had a major chin breakout in weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap can be drying, so I&#x27;ve been following up with a blend of coconut and jojoba oils, and the combo of these treatments is making my skin GLOW. I am so pleased I took a chance on this soap.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe the things I had read about this product at first, but it is truly impressive how well it works on clearing skin. After a week my skin was clearing up and now three weeks in my skin is flawless!</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It makes you feel very clean it smells good and it doesn&#x27;t melt away after the first couple of baths/showers&lt;br /&gt;  And the price is not too outrageous.  The smell is refreshing too.</li>
            <li> Great price. Love this stuff</li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me. Skin was too sensitive and I broke out more than usual using this. I ended up giving it to my mom.</li>

            <li> This will be my soap as long as you sell it. I love it very much. An be glad to tell everyone.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this soap to compare the differences between it and the Dudu Osun. This soap doesn&#x27;t seem to deep clean as well as the Dudu Osun, and I was left (if I scrape my nail against my skin on my cheek) with residue on my skin. What I did like about this soap is the smell, it is kind of loud, but the soap is definitely less harsh than the Dudu Osun.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap that I will probably order again.</li>
