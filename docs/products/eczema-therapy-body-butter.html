    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li>We are always in search of the best products to help her.</li>
            <li>Very impressed with the amount of contact from the seller-</li>
            <li>Then I just ended up scratching my slippery over moisturized skin which isn&#x27;t very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Delivered on time and great packaging.  </li>
            <li>She is not a computer person and was really happy I could find this online for her.</li>
            <li>I am one of the happy customers who have tried this product.</li>
            <li>This is a great body butter.</li>
            <li>Great purchase.</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>It also lasts forever, and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Effective Treatment for Eczema!</li>
            <li>I put it on my face at night, and I wake up with my skin feeling nice and moisturized!</li>
            <li>good body butter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>The experience is always good</li>
            <li>Good quality product.</li>
            <li>making it very safe to use even on children.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I love it!</li>
            <li>Then once I received the product, I was contacted again with more tips and a coupon!</li>
            <li>My doctor says that she doesn&#x27;t need to use a steroid cream all the time and from what I have read, this would not be a good idea, so I was so happy to find this product that she can use when her mild eczema flares up.</li>
            <li>And it really smells great!</li>
            <li>It came in nice packaging...</li>
            <li>It is a nice consistency, but just didn&#x27;t do anything for my eczema.</li>
            <li>The texture is interesting.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Looks like this was used because I see the top section of the cream has been scooped.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>We are so glad to have found it.</li>
            <li>The fragrance it seems is what triggered the eczema to flare up even more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than Cortisone cream or any steroid cream for that matter.</li>
            <li>I should have taken a before picture, because I can&#x27;t believe how much better my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>This product is very rich in fragrance even though they report its natural/organic.</li>
            <li>First off, I always feel good shopping from amazon online.</li>
            <li>This product has helped reduce the symptoms significantly!</li>
            <li>Although I am not a fan of perfumed creams, I was glad to find out that it didn&#x27;t smell so strong that it would compete with my perfume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This natural eczema treatment is proven to be effective as two of my good friends have seen how it works wonders.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to have found a natural product that works for us.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is vegan, cruelty free and made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus, it is very safe and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>Smells good, Keeps the area very soft, scale free.</li>
            <li>It has a light lavender vanilla smell that doesn&#x27;t smell like the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>Me&#x27;s homemade gluten free oatmeal soap.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It is all natural and all good stuff - so it passes my test</li>
            <li>My skin absolutely LOVES this stuff!!!</li>
            <li>After hundreds of dollars spent.....this is by far---the only relief available for my son!!!</li>
            <li>If more coupons pop up though, we will certainly be purchasing again!</li>
            <li>Imagine my frustration when the first application resulted in an overwhelming itch response.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to find</li>
            <li>This butter has a nice, soft scent to it.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is made from organic ingredients which makes it an effective natural eczema treatment.  </li>
            <li>not bad stuff.</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing and soothing to my skin</li>
            <li>I am sure &amp;#34;we&amp;#34; will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>It works quickly anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li>If yours is mild, it might help.  </li>
            <li>It takes good care of the dry skin and the flaking.</li>
            <li>I will still use it as a moisturizer for the non eczema affected parts of my body because it is pretty rich.</li>
            <li>Does not cure the Eczema but really helps make it comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product for two days now and it does seem to calm the eczema irritation and soothe the skin.</li>
            <li>It is made from all natural ingredients which makes it safe for all ages.</li>
            <li>far I am really pleased.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin, so this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Goes on very oily, then dries up quickly.</li>
            <li>and I am pretty sure that this wouldn&#x27;t be my last.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t help but notice that it smells so fresh and light, just like a regular moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The scent is mild - not heavy at all as some other reviews have suggested - and it has not caused any adverse affects for my baby (it&#x27;s rather nice, in fact).</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve battled pretty intense eczema off and on for over 13 years.  </li>
            <li>I have Eczema on my neck and hips, this treatment is the best works great, and a little goes a long way, I have recommended this to all my friends that are struggling with Eczema, no mre steroid creams that only work for a small window of time....</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t treat the problem but it is a lovely natural body butter in general.</li>
            <li>My 4 month old has mild eczema on his belly and arms.</li>
            <li>but it certainly provides relief to the itchiness and dryness.</li>
            <li>but when you really rub it into your skin.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t not satisfy me the way I thought</li>
            <li>After using it for seven straight days, it soothed my eczema on my neck and arms</li>
            <li>And since it is 100 percent butter, it will leave your skin feeling young, fresh and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>It is certainly very moisturizing</li>
            <li>and I am very optimistic, I will continue to use this</li>
            <li>I had to go to the Dr. and get something much stronger...</li>
            <li>Not sure if the vendor realizes that many of the users of this cream are infants!</li>
            <li>This cream contained with natural ingredients really works!</li>
            <li>I think that this is the first eczema treatment cream that I used that did not smell of old hospital rooms and rotten vegetables.  </li>
            <li>I bought these with a coupon that is no longer active (wish I had bought more!), and with a coupon, we would purchase it again, but $16 every 2-3 days is just way outside of our budget.</li>
            <li>It is rich and thick and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Nowadays, it is kind of hard to find a natural eczema treatment that really works.</li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t go away as fast as I had hoped this natural butter would help.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t like diggin&#x27; in the jar; however, the results are so good, I&#x27;ve already gotten over it..</li>
            <li>The product is thick which is good but also very gritty even after warming it in my hands.</li>
            <li>Completely clear face!</li>
            <li>Treating Eczema in a Natural Way!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have any reactions with the first application like stinging or red bumps which has happened to me before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>one thing is that it&#x27;s kind of small, so I might try a larger size next time so I&#x27;ll get a little more bang for my buck.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and you have to be careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li>We bought a bunch of these for my year old daughter, who has eczema.</li>
            <li>When I found out about the connection, I knew that I had to try Naturally</li>
            <li>One thing I like about this product is that is all natural and vegan.</li>
            <li>so we wanted to try something natural.  </li>
            <li>Naturally</li>
            <li>and they suggested that I use it with Naturally</li>
            <li>so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And since it is made from 100 percent natural ingredients, children may also use it.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent and doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the medicinal creams she has used in the past.</li>
            <li>My skin looked back to normal in 2 days.</li>
            <li>This all natural treatment gave me instant relief.</li>
            <li>For quite a few years my aunt has been suffering from mild eczema on her hands and occasionally on her face.</li>
            <li>Baby still scratches at his belly but at least the rash is gone and his skin is smooth and not red anymore.</li>
            <li>my skin doesn&#x27;t itch half as much as it did last week, and the redness is going away!</li>

            <li> For quite a few years my aunt has been suffering from mild eczema on her hands and occasionally on her face.</li>
            <li> Baby still scratches at his belly but at least the rash is gone and his skin is smooth and not red anymore.</li>
            <li> my skin doesn&#x27;t itch half as much as it did last week, and the redness is going away!</li>
            <li> It relieves the itchiness in the affected area and after a few weeks of applying it, my skin went back to normal.</li>
            <li> Typically people with eczema, their skin are very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Other products are very expensive and most of them don&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> I should have listened when my friend said it wasn&#x27;t any good :(</li>
            <li> Not only does it take care of my dry and flaky skin, but it also helps treat eczema.</li>
            <li> I tried other options before this such as home made remedies, california baby eczema cream, essential oils etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious about the money back guarantee</li>
            <li> I am a long time eczema sufferer</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how long I have been searching online for something that wasn&#x27;t made from chemicals or dyes.</li>
            <li> A simple lightweight plastic jar with a simple black lid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sort of dry in texture</li>
            <li> It is thick and moisturizing and with frequently applications, does seem to help the eczema (it is not a cure, and is not advertised as such).</li>
            <li> I use it every single day.</li>
            <li> On to the next as I would like to try, not worth the 13 bucks I say in my opinion.</li>
            <li> but that was temporary because I had to re apply throughout the day the little jar didn&#x27;t really last that long either.</li>
            <li> Within a few days, this product took the raised rash away entirely (on his belly).</li>
            <li> It has only been a few days, but I can tell already that my skin feels softer and moisturized and it seems to have anti-itch properties as promised.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been reading for the past year, when my breakouts got a lot worse about how adding more chemicals to my body is not a good plan to improve my eczema.</li>
            <li> soon as I opened it the first thing I noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t have a weird chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Plus, it doesn&#x27;t have steroids like other products.</li>
            <li> This does seem to help with the dry factor, but it does little to stop the itch of eczema.</li>
            <li> Very few products seem to actually work.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> Takes away itchiness and even the few times when I applied it and still scratched, seemed to keep the skin from having the usual reaction - red, burning, soreness.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is how greasy it gets.</li>
            <li> It was such a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> it would it did make my skin a little softer to the touch</li>
            <li> I was having the worst full body outbreak of eczema 2 weeks ago, I literally tried every natural based product I could find (as I do not want to use steroid creams after reading about them), and unfortunately none of the other creams or lotions helped at all, however after using this one for about 4 days</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little hard to apply.</li>
            <li> and it does not sure it</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It actually made my son eczema worse than what it was!</li>
            <li> I saw improvement, 48 hours the rash was hardly noticiable, and with in 72 hrs.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 2 year old who has bad eczema.  </li>
            <li> This is a very thick balm that needs to be warmed and softened in your hands before applying (we usually scoop it out with a spoon and rub it between our hands, then lather on).</li>
            <li> But overall it wasn&#x27;t a bad product just not for me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for my son and very hard to get out of the container</li>
            <li> But unfortunately, that&#x27;s also slightly problematic, which is why I&#x27;m rating it a 4* - for the amount that you have to use per application, and how often we apply it, the cost is prohibitively expensive.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was having the worst full body outbreak of eczema 2 weeks ago, I literally tried every natural based product I could find (as I do not want to use steroid creams after reading about them), and unfortunately none of the other creams or lotions helped at all, however after using this one for about 4 days my skin doesn&#x27;t itch half as much as it did last week, and the redness is going away! Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I did a week of twice a day applications and didn&#x27;t notice any improvement. Then I just ended up scratching my slippery over moisturized skin which isn&#x27;t very pleasant.  I will still use it as a moisturizer for the non eczema affected parts of my body because it is pretty rich. The texture is interesting. It seems sort of solid/powdery but when you really rub it into your skin. I&#x27;m curious about the money back guarantee but I couldn&#x27;t find any information on how to initiate that process.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t not satisfy me the way I thought it would it did make my skin a little softer to the touch but that was temporary because I had to re apply throughout the day the little jar didn&#x27;t really last that long either. But overall it wasn&#x27;t a bad product just not for me.</li>
            <li> Was not helpful for numular eczema</li>
            <li> I suffer from severe excema on both hands.  At at its worst, my fingers are swollen, the skin is itchy, red, fissured, flaking and inflamed on both the palmer and dorsal sides.  Based upon the product&#x27;s description, I had hoped the moisturizers would alleviate the flaking and fissuring. Imagine my frustration when the first application resulted in an overwhelming itch response.  Despite washing multiple times to remove the product, the itch persisted.  Sadly, I scratched until my hands bled and the skin was ravaged.  This product worsened my condition and it will take weeks of steroid applications to improve my hands to their normally poor condition.  If it had been an option, I would have given this product zero stars.</li>
            <li> This does seem to help with the dry factor, but it does little to stop the itch of eczema. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and you have to be careful not to use too much. A little bit goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and great packaging.  I am a long time eczema sufferer and it does not sure it but it certainly provides relief to the itchiness and dryness.</li>
            <li> I have Eczema on my neck and hips, this treatment is the best works great, and a little goes a long way, I have recommended this to all my friends that are struggling with Eczema, no mre steroid creams that only work for a small window of time....</li>
            <li> It is an oily salve, but it works.  Takes away itchiness and even the few times when I applied it and still scratched, seemed to keep the skin from having the usual reaction - red, burning, soreness.</li>
            <li> We bought a bunch of these for my year old daughter, who has eczema. We are always in search of the best products to help her. This is a very thick balm that needs to be warmed and softened in your hands before applying (we usually scoop it out with a spoon and rub it between our hands, then lather on). It is all natural and all good stuff - so it passes my test (I refuse to put a lot of things on my child). And it really smells great! It is thick and moisturizing and with frequently applications, does seem to help the eczema (it is not a cure, and is not advertised as such). But unfortunately, that&#x27;s also slightly problematic, which is why I&#x27;m rating it a 4* - for the amount that you have to use per application, and how often we apply it, the cost is prohibitively expensive. We go through one jar every 2-3 days. I bought these with a coupon that is no longer active (wish I had bought more!), and with a coupon, we would purchase it again, but $16 every 2-3 days is just way outside of our budget. If more coupons pop up though, we will certainly be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> not bad stuff. good body butter.  I like it.  It&#x27;s good. yeah.</li>
            <li> I have severe eczema on my hand. This product has helped reduce the symptoms significantly! My only complaint is how greasy it gets. Otherwise I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Super moisturizing and soothing to my skin and I have bad eczema.</li>
            <li> I only recently learned that seborrheic dermatitis is a form of eczema. When I found out about the connection, I knew that I had to try Naturally Me&#x27;s treatment butter. My skin absolutely LOVES this stuff!!! Nothing else I&#x27;ve tried has worked as well as this butter, and I&#x27;ve had seborrheic dermatitis for over 20 years.</li>
            <li> For quite a few years my aunt has been suffering from mild eczema on her hands and occasionally on her face. It has been a bit of a struggle for her as it gets really red and irritated and of course having it on her face from time to time is embarrassing. My doctor says that she doesn&#x27;t need to use a steroid cream all the time and from what I have read, this would not be a good idea, so I was so happy to find this product that she can use when her mild eczema flares up. One thing I like about this product is that is all natural and vegan. It has a light scent and doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the medicinal creams she has used in the past. She is not a computer person and was really happy I could find this online for her. I am sure &amp;#34;we&amp;#34; will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> After using it for 2 months I would say that it is helpful in keeping flare-ups from occurring, but once a flare-up has occurred this does not seem to help in calming it. So, I&#x27;d say this is a preemptive treatment option.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t treat the problem but it is a lovely natural body butter in general.</li>
            <li> Smells good, Keeps the area very soft, scale free. Helps with itching. Does not cure the Eczema but really helps make it comfortable. We will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> My 4 month old has mild eczema on his belly and arms. He scratches at it and further aggravates the condition. Within a few days, this product took the raised rash away entirely (on his belly). I&#x27;m happy to have found a natural product that works for us. The scent is mild - not heavy at all as some other reviews have suggested - and it has not caused any adverse affects for my baby (it&#x27;s rather nice, in fact). Baby still scratches at his belly but at least the rash is gone and his skin is smooth and not red anymore. Expensive, but it works so... we&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> Effective Treatment for Eczema! Using this eczema treatment cream is like hitting two birds in one stone. Not only does it take care of my dry and flaky skin, but it also helps treat eczema. Plus, it is very safe and gentle on the skin. Nowadays, it is kind of hard to find a natural eczema treatment that really works. Other products are very expensive and most of them don&#x27;t really work. This one noticeably soothes the problem in no time!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impress by this product and also overpriced.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a product that would reduce my need for cortisone cream for my eczema, but this product did nothing. Goes on very oily, then dries up quickly.</li>
            <li> Got this cream with the cap open. Looks like this was used because I see the top section of the cream has been scooped. Sorry, I lost all credibility for this vendor then and there. Not sure if the vendor realizes that many of the users of this cream are infants!</li>
            <li> I just recieved this in the mail 1 weeks ago and began using it by directions applying twice to my body a day. After using it for seven straight days, it soothed my eczema on my neck and arms but I still would have flare-ups and they didn&#x27;t go away as fast as I had hoped this natural butter would help. I gave it 3 stars because it is solid but lacks the power in reducing flare-up visibility. On to the next as I would like to try, not worth the 13 bucks I say in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Where is the amazon.com \\&quot;love\\&quot; button\\&quot;? I LOVE this product. Next to my prescription ointment, this is TOPS! As SOON as it touches my skin, immediate itch and dryness relief. My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t like diggin&#x27; in the jar; however, the results are so good, I&#x27;ve already gotten over it..Thank you for creating and sharing!</li>
            <li> i bought this for my baby&#x27;s excema on his face.  The product is thick which is good but also very gritty even after warming it in my hands.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve battled pretty intense eczema off and on for over 13 years.  Very few products seem to actually work.  This is one product that does provides relief.  We are so glad to have found it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in the hopes that it would improve the eczema conditions on my arms and legs.  However, once I&#x27;ve applied the cream, I started to itch immediately which made my eczema even worst.  Typically people with eczema, their skin are very sensitive.  This product is very rich in fragrance even though they report its natural/organic. The fragrance it seems is what triggered the eczema to flare up even more.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the amount of contact from the seller- I received an email as soon as I bought the product with tips about eczema. Then once I received the product, I was contacted again with more tips and a coupon! I&#x27;ve used the product for two days now and it does seem to calm the eczema irritation and soothe the skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! It works quickly anywhere on your body. It&#x27;s better than Cortisone cream or any steroid cream for that matter.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that has helped!!!  After hundreds of dollars spent.....this is by far---the only relief available for my son!!!</li>
            <li> Will never purchase again!!! It was such a waste of money!! Ugh&lt;br /&gt;It actually made my son eczema worse than what it was! I should have listened when my friend said it wasn&#x27;t any good :(</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin, so this stuff is amazing. I put it on my face at night, and I wake up with my skin feeling nice and moisturized! It also lasts forever, and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I am one of the happy customers who have tried this product. This cream contained with natural ingredients really works! It relieves the itchiness in the affected area and after a few weeks of applying it, my skin went back to normal.</li>
            <li> Treating Eczema in a Natural Way! For those who are looking for an eczema treatment cream, you might want to try this product out. It is made from all natural ingredients which makes it safe for all ages. This natural eczema treatment is proven to be effective as two of my good friends have seen how it works wonders. And since it is 100 percent butter, it will leave your skin feeling young, fresh and rejuvenated. It is guaranteed that it doesn&#x27;t contain any harmful chemicals or components.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 2 year old who has bad eczema.  The prescription creams seem harsh and didn&#x27;t help much so we wanted to try something natural.  This butter has a nice, soft scent to it.  It&#x27;s sort of dry in texture so it&#x27;s a little hard to apply. But, it seems to be helping.  I&#x27;d recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find Naturally Me&#x27;s Eczema Treatment Body Butter. I can&#x27;t tell you how long I have been searching online for something that wasn&#x27;t made from chemicals or dyes. I have been reading for the past year, when my breakouts got a lot worse about how adding more chemicals to my body is not a good plan to improve my eczema. And as someone who cares about the environment and animals I love the fact that it is vegan, cruelty free and made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, let&#x27;s talk about the product. First off, I always feel good shopping from amazon online. The experience is always good and I got it on the day promised. It came in nice packaging... A simple lightweight plastic jar with a simple black lid. NO fuss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I opened it the first thing I noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t have a weird chemical smell. It has a light lavender vanilla smell that doesn&#x27;t smell like the doctor&#x27;s office. Although I am not a fan of perfumed creams, I was glad to find out that it didn&#x27;t smell so strong that it would compete with my perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the directions and they suggested that I use it with Naturally Me&#x27;s homemade gluten free oatmeal soap. Well, I didn&#x27;t buy that yet, but I have a soap I like, so I soaped up and then applied the butter. It is rich and thick and goes on smoothly. It is certainly very moisturizing and I didn&#x27;t have any reactions with the first application like stinging or red bumps which has happened to me before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am really pleased. It has only been a few days, but I can tell already that my skin feels softer and moisturized and it seems to have anti-itch properties as promised. I know this isn&#x27;t  a cure for eczema, but so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this works out and I am very optimistic, I will continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing is that it&#x27;s kind of small, so I might try a larger size next time so I&#x27;ll get a little more bang for my buck.</li>
            <li> This butter sounded like just what I needed.  It is a nice consistency, but just didn&#x27;t do anything for my eczema. If yours is mild, it might help.  I had to go to the Dr. and get something much stronger...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for my son and very hard to get out of the container</li>
            <li> ***this review is for theraplex emolient*** I tried other options before this such as home made remedies, california baby eczema cream, essential oils etc. But for over 2 yrs. Now both my babies have suffered from severe eczema on their faces to the point of blistering. I purchased this after reading another review and figured at this point ill try anything. With in 24 hrs. I saw improvement, 48 hours the rash was hardly noticiable, and with in 72 hrs. Completely clear face! I will be a customer for life!</li>
            <li> This is a great body butter. I use it every single day. It keeps my skin smooth and hydrated. And since it is made from 100 percent natural ingredients, children may also use it. It takes good care of the dry skin and the flaking. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t have steroids like other products. This is actually the 3rd time that I am ordering it online and I am pretty sure that this wouldn&#x27;t be my last.</li>
            <li> I think that this is the first eczema treatment cream that I used that did not smell of old hospital rooms and rotten vegetables.  I can&#x27;t help but notice that it smells so fresh and light, just like a regular moisturizer.  I like the fact that it is made from organic ingredients which makes it an effective natural eczema treatment.  It also does not contain any steroids in it making it very safe to use even on children.</li>
            <li> Good quality product. I use this on my step-daughter. It seemed to help her eczema and did not have an offensive smell.</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my neck. I should have taken a before picture, because I can&#x27;t believe how much better my skin looks and feels. I used hydrocortisone cream, colloidal oatmeal cream, and aquaphor, with no relief. This all natural treatment gave me instant relief. My skin looked back to normal in 2 days. A little does go a long way. Great purchase.</li>
