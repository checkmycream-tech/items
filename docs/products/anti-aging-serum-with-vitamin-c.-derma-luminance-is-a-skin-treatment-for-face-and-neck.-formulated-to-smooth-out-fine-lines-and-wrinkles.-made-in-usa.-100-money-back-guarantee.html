            <li>This product really makes my face feel refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I was not sure at first, as this appeared more as a &amp;#34;lotion,&amp;#34; than a serum, but after applying, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>It left no greasy feeling, and absorbed immediately.  </li>
            <li>I like serums due to their light texture.</li>
            <li>My skin feels like never before,So soft and young!!</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and looks brighter!</li>
            <li>Started Using the lotion for the past 10 days I see a difference around my eyes,  not greasy, love it</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Def see less fine lines.</li>
            <li>Just finished my first bottle and looking forward to my second!  </li>
            <li>Funny thing is I noticed the back of my left hand was looking smoother and better than my other.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this particular serum right now after searching high and low for a night cream that actually works!</li>
            <li>Does not leave residue or greasy feeling, and my skin has seemed to actually clear up since using it.</li>
            <li>It feels so soft and silky as I applied it on my face.  </li>
            <li>I am so surprised to see the price jump up to $75,00&lt;</li>
            <li>Not to forget the soft, velvety cream that makes your skin feel like a babies bottom.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and it&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m young</li>
            <li>The fine lines around my lip are just now starting to slowly diminish which I am anxious to see after one  month of using product to see some more changes.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a major difference.  </li>
            <li>frequently I use in the future.</li>
            <li>Just starting using this product and already love the way my skin feels...very soft, glowing and I could feel a slight tightening on just a few days of use...</li>
            <li>i can tell what i think after a few days of use ,my skin feels smoother to the touch and it soes seem to have a firming effect ,so far i really like this product</li>
            <li>I have very oily/combination skin but have rough patches all of a sudden and nothing was working.</li>

            <li> I was not sure at first, as this appeared more as a &amp;#34;lotion,&amp;#34; than a serum, but after applying, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying different serums, and I have to say, Iove the way this one feels.  I was not sure at first, as this appeared more as a &amp;#34;lotion,&amp;#34; than a serum, but after applying, I was pleasantly surprised.  It left no greasy feeling, and absorbed immediately.  I used three pumps, and was able to apply to my face, and my neck area.</li>
            <li> Not happy with it. Did nothing for me. Perhaps not for younger skin?</li>
            <li> I PAID ($19,95 ) for this product .....I am so surprised to see the price jump up to $75,00&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice lotion for $19,95 but not $75,00&lt;br /&gt;It feels great on your face.</li>
            <li> What an beautiful bottle! Not to forget the soft, velvety cream that makes your skin feel like a babies bottom. This creame can be use if you have combination skin (like I do). I love how soft it makes my face and hands feel.</li>
            <li> Started Using the lotion for the past 10 days I see a difference around my eyes,  not greasy, love it</li>
            <li> The derma luminance is very easy to apply and makes my skin feel very good, I use it under my daily lotion and it is not greasy or leaves a shiny sheen to my face. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Ok. 4 weeks and no difference</li>
            <li> I will be giving this as a gift for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Creamy texture and not greasy, absorbs well, makes skin feel smooth!</li>
            <li> Great serum it feels great when going on and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
            <li> I really like it  .My skin feels firmer after using it</li>
            <li> Lovely container, I am using this in conjunction with my Derma Roller and I am excited about the results already!  I look forward to long term changes!</li>
            <li> Goes on so smooth and it has no smell which I like. The fine lines around my lip are just now starting to slowly diminish which I am anxious to see after one  month of using product to see some more changes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this particular serum right now after searching high and low for a night cream that actually works! I have very oily/combination skin but have rough patches all of a sudden and nothing was working. I have used this and after only a week, my rough patches are almost gone. It&#x27;s nice and thick but it has not clogged my pores or made my face greasy which was my main problem with most moisturizers. I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  Been using it for about a week and notice a dramatic difference in my skin.  Does not leave residue or greasy feeling, and my skin has seemed to actually clear up since using it.</li>

            <li> Works great! Very nice feel during application and after, and I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable improvement in my skin since using it!</li>
            <li> So creamy and smooth. Goes on as a lotion, but dries right away to a matte finish. I layer products on my face and this layers well with other products. I also have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all. Even use around my eyes with no problems. Helps my skin be smooth and clear. Love this product and you will also.</li>
            <li> Easily absorbed into skin. A drop spreading on skin was excellent~!</li>
            <li> This product really makes my face feel refreshed.  Great under makeup.</li>
            <li> i love how soft and nice the make my face</li>
            <li> Love it!  I like the container &amp; the serum.  It doesn&#x27;t sting my skin or make my eyes water!  YAY!!!  Makes my skin feel wonderful &amp; the lines softer. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Wow! what a difference in my skin! I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and I cannot believe the difference in my skin! smoother, smaller pores, &amp;  less wrinkled. I wish I would have taken before &amp; after photos.</li>

            <li> Makes skin feel and look great!</li>
            <li> Use this daily. Def see less fine lines.</li>
            <li> Just starting using this product and already love the way my skin feels...very soft, glowing and I could feel a slight tightening on just a few days of use...</li>
            <li> Non-sticky feel and works as expected. I love the results so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying nightly - I feel like I see a diference around my eyes, but not sure. It makes my skin feel soft and it&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days but I like the consistency and how good it feels when applied to my face.</li>
            <li> This serum has a light rose scent.  The serum has a light, creamy texture, it is cool and refreshing.  I love the how well it absorb in the skin and it is not greasy.  Leave the skin feeling soft just light a &#x27;rose&#x27;. Thank you Derma Luminance for a &#x27;Great&#x27; product.</li>
            <li> Amazingly soft and easy on my skin! My new favorite serum!</li>
            <li> I love the bottle, the light weight, etc. but have been using for about a month and see no improvement in my dark spots.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well! I&#x27;m young (30) so I don&#x27;t have tons of improving that needs to be done (yet!) but with this stuff, I don&#x27;t plan on letting it get to that point! I&#x27;m going to stay youthful F-O-R-E-V-E-R! ;)</li>
            <li> using daily. seems to be working well. Not allergic as with most of these type of skin care products. That is a relief.</li>
            <li> Started using this a week or so ago and I am beginning to see a reduction in the lines around the corners of my eyes and nose!  The combination of Derma Luminance and a quality moisturizer is working well for me!</li>
            <li> Very smooth going on and makes my face really soft.</li>
            <li> good quality&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> Love it , arrived on time . I love how it feels on my skin , light not greasy . Will continue to use for more noticeable results.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product after all of the great reviews.  Unfortunately, there hasn&#x27;t been a definite difference between this product and something one might buy at the drug store, especially for the price.  As another reviewer noted, there were several telephone messages asking for a review of the product and offering a &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34;  in exchange for my time, though I opted not to return the calls.  Nevertheless, the product does provide a nice, light, moisture option for someone that might be looking for a lightweight serum to use before putting on foundation or if going &amp;#34;bare.&amp;#34;  If you wear a powder/mineral foundation it may be best to wait about 10 minutes after applying the serum before your powder/foundation application to maximize the opportunity for a smooth look.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. 5 star!</li>
            <li> I love it. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It is helpful for me.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how well it works as an anti aging serum but it seems to have lightened some of my dark spots.  It also seems to help my makeup blend in better, I can definitely tell the difference if I have forgotten to put it on.</li>
            <li> great quality! good price!!</li>
            <li> Just finished my first bottle and looking forward to my second!  Really like the smooth, clean feel as it absorbs quickly. Use it around my eyes and on my neck.  My mom noticed a difference and asked what I was doing so I let her try some of mine. For the price it is a nice way to stay consistent with applying it daily.  Funny thing is I noticed the back of my left hand was looking smoother and better than my other. It dawned on me I was wiping my fingers off onto my left hand after I rubbed the cream on my face, lol. So now I rub a little on the back of my hands too! Enjoy! ;)</li>
            <li> Mailing package was not very good, box came smashed. Doesnt hurt the product tho. Skin feels smooth and soft</li>
            <li> Great product, gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This feels amazing when I put it on my skin . I will tell my friends about this</li>
            <li> It is not sticky and not greasy, absorbs well, makes skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Mah girlfriend loves it!!</li>
