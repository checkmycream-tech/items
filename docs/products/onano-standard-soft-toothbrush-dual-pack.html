            <li>Love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I freaking love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love my O&#x27;Nano toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s all I need to know that I love them.</li>
            <li>that doesnt matter until my gums are not bleeding :)</li>
            <li>I like this brush because it has helped restore receding gums that I believe were in part caused by more severe brushes, even though they were designated as &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>they are my favorite</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how how I&#x27;d like then</li>
            <li>I do still prefer my electric toothbrush, but these are way better than any manual ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Love the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>, I brush longer and better because it doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums.</li>
            <li>The fine filaments also get between my teeth better.</li>
            <li>My teeth were also incredibly clean!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive gums and this brush is perfect for that, plus I still get that super clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I can say enough about it except you should get it and experience the wonderful feeling of clean teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable for the superior performance.</li>
            <li>strongly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not know how the bristles will hold up over time, the bristles are fine</li>
            <li>So good so far!</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re nice and gentle on my gums while keeping my teeth plaque free.  </li>
            <li>This brush is so comfortable on my gums too.</li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>You just feel so comfortable to hold it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much more fun to run my tongue over my teeth now.</li>
            <li>the bristles are very dense and fine, which could allow for more contact with the teeth and therefor clean better.</li>
            <li>I use baking soda and coconut oil mix to brush my teeth and this helps even more at leaving my teeth fresh, clean and super smooth.</li>
            <li>These brushes are gentle and super effective.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery, I love the design, bristols are nice and soft no bleeding gums even if I put too much pressure on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean</li>
            <li>This toothbrush hurt my gums and didn&#x27;t leave my teething feeling clean at all.</li>
            <li>And you know you should always clean your toothbrush with  hydrogen peroxide</li>
            <li>The densely packed plastic bristles grip and remove plauqe and make my teeth feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel clean after each brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice and soft and just feeling efficient!</li>
            <li>Also, they are very ergonomic, they feel very comfortable and sturdy while brushing.</li>
            <li>Time will tell the full story but because my teeth feel so clean afterwards</li>
            <li>Very good brushes and different than a normal brush.  </li>
            <li>Soft, but effective.</li>
            <li>I received the O&#x27;nano toothbrush and my son thought it was so cool</li>
            <li>This is the greatest brush I have ever used, wish I had found it earlier though it is possible</li>
            <li>my teeth are more  healthy and white</li>
            <li>O&#x27;Nano ever makes an electric toothbrush I would like to be one of the first people to know!</li>
            <li>I love the soft bristles!</li>
            <li>reason I did not give the full star is that I am hoping there would be more color available so that I can get different color for each family member.</li>
            <li>I really love this super soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Really nice, doesn&#x27;t look like the toothbrush is soft but it really is soft and smooth on your teeth.</li>
            <li>It got in between my teeth better, as well - I could feel the bristles in between my teeth, but not destroying the toothbrush</li>
            <li>I opened this one up and noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>It was like this toothbrush somehow sucked all the gunk right off of them.</li>
            <li>Very  interesting  with the bristles are made its soft and clear</li>
            <li>I tried this weird looking toothbrush on promotion, I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The toothbrush is constructed with high quality materials and its contoured handle makes it comfortable to hold in our hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive teeth and gums, it keeps plaque build up to a minimum, and your teeth feels squeaky clean all day!</li>
            <li>It makes you teeth feel cleaner and better than the regular brush I used.  </li>
            <li>It is better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This the way the nature intended... ;)</li>
            <li>Love the different style of bristles.  </li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes only used once</li>
            <li>I replaced mine within the first 5 day s.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it helps with his plaque issue better than a regular bristle one.</li>
            <li>The O&#x27;Nano soft toothbrush provides a thorough and effective cleaning and is gentle on our teeth with its soft bristles.</li>
            <li>It is however a very different experience in brushing, but I do feel that my teeth are very clean when finished.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is solidly built and it actually feels good to use.</li>
            <li>I love that it cleans much easier than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This is a very clever toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive gum, and this help tremendously.</li>
            <li>These work really well.</li>
            <li>Use them much and they will damage your gums.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m even giving it 2 stars.</li>
            <li>Work very well.</li>
            <li>I have very tender gums and this brush did *</li>
            <li>With this brush, I have noticed a significant decrease in plaque and it actually feels like it&#x27;s massaging my gums instead of trying to tear them up.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my gum and at the same time, does a better job cleaning my teeth than my regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of these in the future.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how much I like these.</li>
            <li>soft bristles are gentle on gums.</li>
            <li>I really like this soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally review, but this product is A+.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised by this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It feels so soft to my gum when brushing!  </li>
            <li>This is the first to meet that standard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft to my gum!</li>
            <li>The bristles seemed a bit stiff for a soft toothbrush, but it did not irritate my gums at all the way many soft or even ultra-soft toothbrushes do.</li>
            <li>I must have received a different product from most other purchasers because in NO way was mine &#x27;ultra soft&#x27;, or even soft!</li>
            <li>Once again, it&#x27;s something that most soft toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used in the past couldn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li>sensitive brushes give satisfaction.</li>
            <li>It does not hurt my gums, so if you have sensitive areas where your gums have receded it may be beneficial to help stop gum recession.</li>
            <li>So much easier to use on my orthodontics than regular bristles, which were always snagging on the brackets.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised on how it cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I can reach the far corners of my molars.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft but seem to do the job.</li>
            <li>I put away my ultrasonic equipment in favor of the natural brushes.</li>
            <li>I gave one of these to my wife who also likes the softer action.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I have now entered the senior citizen category and have been finding standard toothbrushes (especially the most popular brand) to be too hard and too stiff and have too big a head to suit me now.  </li>
            <li>First let me say that the only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because I only have used it for a week</li>
            <li>Very different than normal brushes.</li>
            <li>I recently have brace and my teeth are very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it actually works better than traditional toothbrushes</li>
            <li>The one star dock is not due to this bc</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t go back to the old toothbrush because this one works so well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also soft enough for brushing gums !</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t want a pink toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The brush head size is not too big and easy to access hard to reach area.</li>
            <li>While the density of the brushing tips is higher than my previous tooth brush, I had this cleaner feel after the brush.  </li>
            <li>The only problem, I&#x27;m a 72 year old male.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different soft toothbrush models over the years, searching for one that doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums and also gets the job done.</li>
            <li>So gentle that I can really bear down in tight areas without fear of tearing or abrading my gums.</li>
            <li>I have a brace on the back of my lower teeth which causes stain to accumulate around the brace so during my next cleaning I will be interested to see if there is less stain!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need a toothbrush to have customer support, but because they are tricky to clean as little bits of gunk get stuck way down.</li>
            <li>Really gets in my gums and in all of the little crevices between my teeth</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive teeth and gums, it keeps plaque build up to a minimum, and your teeth feels squeaky clean all day!</li>

            <li> It is better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This the way the nature intended... ;)</li>
            <li> Love the different style of bristles.  </li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes only used once</li>
            <li> I replaced mine within the first 5 day s.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it helps with his plaque issue better than a regular bristle one.</li>
            <li> The O&#x27;Nano soft toothbrush provides a thorough and effective cleaning and is gentle on our teeth with its soft bristles.</li>
            <li> It is however a very different experience in brushing, but I do feel that my teeth are very clean when finished.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is solidly built and it actually feels good to use.</li>
            <li> I love that it cleans much easier than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is a very clever toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive gum, and this help tremendously.</li>
            <li> These work really well.</li>
            <li> Use them much and they will damage your gums.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m even giving it 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Work very well.</li>
            <li> I have very tender gums and this brush did *</li>
            <li> With this brush, I have noticed a significant decrease in plaque and it actually feels like it&#x27;s massaging my gums instead of trying to tear them up.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my gum and at the same time, does a better job cleaning my teeth than my regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how much I like these.</li>
            <li> soft bristles are gentle on gums.</li>
            <li> I really like this soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally review, but this product is A+.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It feels so soft to my gum when brushing!  </li>
            <li> This is the first to meet that standard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft to my gum!</li>
            <li> The bristles seemed a bit stiff for a soft toothbrush, but it did not irritate my gums at all the way many soft or even ultra-soft toothbrushes do.</li>
            <li> I must have received a different product from most other purchasers because in NO way was mine &#x27;ultra soft&#x27;, or even soft!</li>
            <li> Once again, it&#x27;s something that most soft toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used in the past couldn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> sensitive brushes give satisfaction.</li>
            <li> It does not hurt my gums, so if you have sensitive areas where your gums have receded it may be beneficial to help stop gum recession.</li>
            <li> So much easier to use on my orthodontics than regular bristles, which were always snagging on the brackets.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised on how it cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I can reach the far corners of my molars.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but seem to do the job.</li>
            <li> I put away my ultrasonic equipment in favor of the natural brushes.</li>
            <li> I gave one of these to my wife who also likes the softer action.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I have now entered the senior citizen category and have been finding standard toothbrushes (especially the most popular brand) to be too hard and too stiff and have too big a head to suit me now.  </li>
            <li> First let me say that the only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because I only have used it for a week</li>
            <li> Very different than normal brushes.</li>
            <li> I recently have brace and my teeth are very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it actually works better than traditional toothbrushes</li>
            <li> The one star dock is not due to this bc</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t go back to the old toothbrush because this one works so well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also soft enough for brushing gums !</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t want a pink toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The brush head size is not too big and easy to access hard to reach area.</li>
            <li> While the density of the brushing tips is higher than my previous tooth brush, I had this cleaner feel after the brush.  </li>
            <li> The only problem, I&#x27;m a 72 year old male.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different soft toothbrush models over the years, searching for one that doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums and also gets the job done.</li>
            <li> So gentle that I can really bear down in tight areas without fear of tearing or abrading my gums.</li>
            <li> I have a brace on the back of my lower teeth which causes stain to accumulate around the brace so during my next cleaning I will be interested to see if there is less stain!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need a toothbrush to have customer support, but because they are tricky to clean as little bits of gunk get stuck way down.</li>
            <li> Really gets in my gums and in all of the little crevices between my teeth</li>
            <li> I found I could soften them up a tiny bit by soaking them in very hot water for at least a minute before using it, but not much and still a long way from even &#x27;soft&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Finally i found the brush i am looking for from a long time.</li>
            <li> only problem i see is the tooth paste will stick at the bottom and find difficult to clean, which makes me feel like its dirty.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Next time will check to see if they have a smaller head, a little large for a small mouth.</li>
            <li> and I do not know what the long term results will be</li>
            <li> Received two brushes one blue and one pink.</li>
            <li> They were not soft as compared to this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the toothbrush for three days, but I feel the difference between the O&#x27;Nano brush and other soft bristle brushes I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m single</li>
            <li> This is really soft and no more bleeding from gums while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It does reach the hard places of metal in my mouth, the beistles are very soft.</li>
            <li> where even the softest of the other brushes I have found do.</li>
            <li> I consider it false advertising to call these &#x27;ultra soft&#x27; or anything except &#x27;hard&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if my electric toothbrush was too harsh for that area.</li>
            <li> it was not available then.  </li>
            <li> Soft but food particles get stuck in between and it is so difficult to rinse them off...</li>
            <li> I though might be harsh.</li>
            <li> Waste of money for me because I won&#x27;t use a hard brush on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I tend to brush hard</li>
            <li> Like pink I don&#x27;t even at 72!!!!!!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> sensitive brushes give satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I tried this weird looking toothbrush on promotion, I LOVE LOVE LOVE it! My teeth feel so clean, I will def continue to buy. :)</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery, I love the design, bristols are nice and soft no bleeding gums even if I put too much pressure on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Feels good in the hand. Love the price for two brushes.&lt;br /&gt;If O&#x27;Nano ever makes an electric toothbrush I would like to be one of the first people to know!</li>
            <li> I recommend this toothbrush. Good for my family.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how much I like these. I have very sensitive gums and this brush is perfect for that, plus I still get that super clean feeling.</li>
            <li> First let me say that the only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because I only have used it for a week and I do not know what the long term results will be, I will have to see what my dentist says during my next teeth cleaning but will update at that time. It is however a very different experience in brushing, but I do feel that my teeth are very clean when finished. It does not hurt my gums, so if you have sensitive areas where your gums have receded it may be beneficial to help stop gum recession. I have a brace on the back of my lower teeth which causes stain to accumulate around the brace so during my next cleaning I will be interested to see if there is less stain! When brushing, there is more &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; on the teeth. the bristles are very dense and fine, which could allow for more contact with the teeth and therefor clean better. Time will tell the full story but because my teeth feel so clean afterwards I like this brush a lot. I do not know how the bristles will hold up over time, the bristles are fine so I hope the tips of the bristles will hold up and not bend or break, it does appear it is of good quality. Will update this when I have the results of changing to this brush.</li>
            <li> After using it for one week, I am sold. Really gets in my gums and in all of the little crevices between my teeth</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. Never going to use another brand.</li>
            <li> Really nice, doesn&#x27;t look like the toothbrush is soft but it really is soft and smooth on your teeth.</li>
            <li> I love the soft bristles! I&#x27;ve only had the toothbrush for three days, but I feel the difference between the O&#x27;Nano brush and other soft bristle brushes I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush hurt my gums and didn&#x27;t leave my teething feeling clean at all.</li>
            <li> These brushes are gentle and super effective. So gentle that I can really bear down in tight areas without fear of tearing or abrading my gums.</li>
            <li> After getting a crown put on my back tooth I am suffering from some tooth sensitivity and my electric toothbrush was causing me pain. I opened this one up and noticed a difference right away. I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if my electric toothbrush was too harsh for that area. I probably won&#x27;t go back to the old toothbrush because this one works so well. I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review</li>
            <li> I have now entered the senior citizen category and have been finding standard toothbrushes (especially the most popular brand) to be too hard and too stiff and have too big a head to suit me now.  Even the softest bristles on those brands tend to hurt my gums.  I tried O&#x27;Nano on a whim and am now praising them.</li>
            <li> received these toothbrushes as a discount. I wasn&#x27;t too sure about them when I received them because they were not like any I had ever bought before. Once I used them I feel instantly in love with them! They work wonderful!</li>
            <li> So good so far! Nice and soft and just feeling efficient!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest brush I have ever used, wish I had found it earlier though it is possible it was not available then.  It makes you teeth feel cleaner and better than the regular brush I used.  It feels wonderful when you brush and I would not use another brush any longer.  It is the most amazing brush I can say enough about it except you should get it and experience the wonderful feeling of clean teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes. I recommend them to anyone who is looking for a good toothbrush.  I would buy them again</li>
            <li> I freaking love this toothbrush. I&#x27;ve been waiting for something like this to come along for decades. So much easier to use on my orthodontics than regular bristles, which were always snagging on the brackets.  This brush is so comfortable on my gums too. I&#x27;m never going back to regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of its good review. I am surprised on how it cleans my teeth. I recently have brace and my teeth are very sensitive. I tend to brush hard and it didnt hurt my gums. It does reach the hard places of metal in my mouth, the beistles are very soft. I do recommend this to anyone. It is better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it actually works better than traditional toothbrushes but it sure feels like it does!</li>
            <li> Wow. I don&#x27;t normally review, but this product is A+. Soft, but effective. Very different than normal brushes.</li>
            <li> Just received Nano toothbrush and very impressed with the design I like it very much</li>
            <li> I love my O&#x27;Nano toothbrush. I can reach the far corners of my molars.  The bristles are soft but seem to do the job. The handle is comfortable to hold.  I am recommending the O&#x27;Nano to my daughter.</li>
            <li> I put away my ultrasonic equipment in favor of the natural brushes. This the way the nature intended... ;)</li>
            <li> This is a very clever toothbrush.  Love the different style of bristles.  Great clean feeling after brushing.  Next time will check to see if they have a smaller head, a little large for a small mouth.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes only used once but that&#x27;s all I need to know that I love them. I received a coupon to review these my review is not biased by the coupon though it really is a great product</li>
            <li> Great brushes,the teeth clean</li>
            <li> Where has this toothbrush been all my life!!!! This toothbrush works so well that you&#x27;ll forget to brush your teeth! Trust me, I have! LOL It&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive teeth and gums, it keeps plaque build up to a minimum, and your teeth feels squeaky clean all day!</li>
            <li> soft bristles are gentle on gums.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever!</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush buy one for yourself you will not regret it</li>
            <li> Finally i found the brush i am looking for from a long time.This is really soft and no more bleeding from gums while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem i see is the tooth paste will stick at the bottom and find difficult to clean, which makes me feel like its dirty.&lt;br /&gt;But that doesnt matter until my gums are not bleeding :)</li>
            <li> Using this toothbrush is like massaging my teeth and gums</li>
            <li> Very  interesting  with the bristles are made its soft and clear it&#x27;s also soft enough for brushing gums ! And you know you should always clean your toothbrush with  hydrogen peroxide so their want be no  bacteria buildup in your toothbrushes</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t write many reviews but when a product is this great it&#x27;s a must.  I don&#x27;t know why these toothbrushes are not found on every store shelf, but I&#x27;m assuming the big companies are waiting for this patent to expire?  For the price just order this toothbrush, and get one for everybody in the family.  They will all thank you for it!</li>
            <li> Very good toothbrush! The only problem, I&#x27;m a 72 year old male. Received two brushes one blue and one pink. I&#x27;m single and I really don&#x27;t want a pink toothbrush. I should have the option of color. Some &#x27;men&#x27;? Like pink I don&#x27;t even at 72!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this brush because it has helped restore receding gums that I believe were in part caused by more severe brushes, even though they were designated as &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;. They were not soft as compared to this product. The fine filaments also get between my teeth better. I gave one of these to my wife who also likes the softer action. The price is reasonable for the superior performance.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by this toothbrush. The bristles seemed a bit stiff for a soft toothbrush, but it did not irritate my gums at all the way many soft or even ultra-soft toothbrushes do. In fact there was not irritation at all. My teeth were also incredibly clean! It was like this toothbrush somehow sucked all the gunk right off of them. Once again, it&#x27;s something that most soft toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used in the past couldn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> Great love it my teeth are more  healthy and white</li>
            <li> The O&#x27;Nano soft toothbrush provides a thorough and effective cleaning and is gentle on our teeth with its soft bristles. The bristles are densely packed which helps provide a deep cleaning effect for removing plaques and bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is constructed with high quality materials and its contoured handle makes it comfortable to hold in our hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have been using it for a couple of weeks and very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush!  It feels so soft to my gum when brushing!  While the density of the brushing tips is higher than my previous tooth brush, I had this cleaner feel after the brush.  And I love the handle material and design too! You just feel so comfortable to hold it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I did not give the full star is that I am hoping there would be more color available so that I can get different color for each family member.</li>
            <li> I found it a bit too big when brushing the side teeth.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE TOOTHBRUSHES! The densely packed plastic bristles grip and remove plauqe and make my teeth feel squeaky clean. Will be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;I received these for $1 to review. This did not affect my review in any way.</li>
            <li> cant weight to use them they are my favorite</li>
            <li> These work really well. I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how how I&#x27;d like then but they&#x27;re nice and gentle on my gums while keeping my teeth plaque free.  I do still prefer my electric toothbrush, but these are way better than any manual ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I must have received a different product from most other purchasers because in NO way was mine &#x27;ultra soft&#x27;, or even soft! It&#x27;s the hardest toothbrush I have ever purchased and I&#x27;m 69 and have bought hundreds of toothbrushes. I consider it false advertising to call these &#x27;ultra soft&#x27; or anything except &#x27;hard&#x27;. Use them much and they will damage your gums. I found I could soften them up a tiny bit by soaking them in very hot water for at least a minute before using it, but not much and still a long way from even &#x27;soft&#x27;. Waste of money for me because I won&#x27;t use a hard brush on my teeth and gums. I really don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m even giving it 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Soft but food particles get stuck in between and it is so difficult to rinse them off... I replaced mine within the first 5 day s.</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush. It&#x27;s so much more fun to run my tongue over my teeth now. They feel nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bit bummed by the customer service. I reached out through their website and submitted a question. Two weeks later and no response.The one star dock is not due to this bc I don&#x27;t need a toothbrush to have customer support, but because they are tricky to clean as little bits of gunk get stuck way down. Gross, I know.</li>
            <li> Wow.  Very good brushes and different than a normal brush.  Work very well.</li>
            <li> Softest toothbrushes I have ever used, I brush longer and better because it doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums. I will never go back to regular toothbrushes hopefully they never go out of business.</li>
            <li> I received the O&#x27;nano toothbrush and my son thought it was so cool so he is using it and loves it. I like the fact that it helps with his plaque issue better than a regular bristle one. We are hooked.</li>
            <li> I received these toothbrushes last weekend, so I&#x27;ve been using them for four days. I like that the one I&#x27;m using gets my teeth cleaner than the brush I had been using. It seems built to last, and I like that the plastic bristles inhibit bacteria.</li>
            <li> I really like this soft toothbrush. I have sensitive gum, and this help tremendously. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my gum and at the same time, does a better job cleaning my teeth than my regular toothbrush. I am hooked, I can&#x27;t go back. The brush head size is not too big and easy to access hard to reach area. Teeth feel clean after each brush.&lt;br /&gt;I got it at discount in exchange for my honest review. I really love this super soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This product was provided at a discount for review.  I have tried several different soft toothbrush models over the years, searching for one that doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums and also gets the job done. This is the first to meet that standard. The toothbrush is solidly built and it actually feels good to use. I know dentists say to brush for two minutes, but it&#x27;s always hurt to do so and I could see plaque usually left over, even with brushes I can handle using for longer. With this brush, I have noticed a significant decrease in plaque and it actually feels like it&#x27;s massaging my gums instead of trying to tear them up. I definitely recommend giving this product a try.</li>
            <li> I received this at a promotional price in return for an honest review. I&#x27;ll be honest - it&#x27;s a manual toothbrush, and I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything life changing. However, I am quite impressed with this. I have very tender gums and this brush did *not* make them bleed - where even the softest of the other brushes I have found do. It got in between my teeth better, as well - I could feel the bristles in between my teeth, but not destroying the toothbrush (as will happen with regular brushes). Also, they are very ergonomic, they feel very comfortable and sturdy while brushing. I will definitely be purchasing more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> I have never seen this kind of toothbrush before but it works and feels great on my teeth. I love that it cleans much easier than a regular toothbrush. I use baking soda and coconut oil mix to brush my teeth and this helps even more at leaving my teeth fresh, clean and super smooth. I received a discount on this for my honest and unbiased review. I am so happy I got a chance to and will certainly be buying this kind of silicone bristles from now on.</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush. It&#x27;s different from what I use to ha e before. I though might be harsh. But after I&#x27;d tried. I like it! It&#x27;s soft to my gum!</li>
