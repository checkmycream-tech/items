    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a wonderful &#x27;</li>
            <li>Overnight, the toner had worked some alchemy with the cream and my skin looked great!  </li>
            <li>so impressed with all the COUI products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>One of the best toners I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>This toner feels very refreshing on your skin!</li>
            <li>This is also great as an after sun product as it has aloe in it which calms the skin.</li>
            <li>spray bottle is a great method of delivery and the spray is a pump versus an aerosol.&lt;br</li>
            <li>toner works amazing and smells delightful, and there is no sting or afterburn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Part of that sensitivity is because of the dryness but a good portion of it is from the slew of allergies</li>
            <li>Guess I had stumbled on a good foundation mixture.  </li>
            <li>bottle is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was happy about that since a rose scent is not one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>This toner has a wonderful, sweet herbal fragrance of rose and witch hazel.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;d recommend this for summer for sure!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying it!</li>
            <li>But after reading the ingredients agreed to give it a try in exchange for a totally honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My own mixture is also in a spritz like this.  </li>
            <li>product contains rose water (rosa dmascena), Witch Hazel extract, marine kelp filtrate bioferment, propanediol and aloe barbadensis extract.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells like rose water.</li>
            <li>COUI&#x27;s ocean toner has a heavenly rose scent which makes it a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>This review is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I was offered a sample of this product to try in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells like rose water.</li>
            <li>Ingredients are: Rose (Rosa damascena) Floral Water, Witch Hazel (Hamamelis virginiana) extract, Marine Kelp (kelp</li>

            <li>The ingredients are:  Rose Floral Water, Witch Hazel Extract, Marine Kelp, and Aloe Extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Always 100% honest.</li>
            <li>pump sprayer is of good quality and produces a fine mist.  </li>
            <li>Wow does this ever smell wonderful.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred no scent, but the sugary rose does not linger longer than it takes to top it off with serum.</li>
            <li>but I DO NOT give good review in trade for free product.</li>
            <li>As the weather gets hotter and more humid, I always wash my face more often.  </li>
            <li>The toner with alcohol causes my skin to produce more oil, then I wash more often, tone more often, and produce even more</li>
            <li>have to say that I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li>No, instead it leaves my skin feeling better.</li>
            <li>This spritzes a lot better, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unlike most toners I&#x27;ve used, this one comes in a spray bottle - just close your eyes and spray your face.  </li>
            <li>The no alcohol is probably one of my favorite things about this Toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ocean Toner feels refreshing and calming on the skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if the witch hazel has much success in closing pores, but it feels good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Ocean Toner twice a day for a week for testing purposes, and I&#x27;m enjoying it.</li>
            <li>The packaging is elegant and practical.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Toner requested for sincere review.</li>
            <li>To make sure it wasn&#x27;t all just in my head, I discontinued use for two weeks and noted no change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I sure don&#x27;t want to add toxins.</li>
            <li>The bottle, the downside of many toners, is perfect and the sprayer lets out a fine mist that is easy to direct and doesn&#x27;t leak or drip.</li>
            <li>It has rose water as its first ingredient!</li>
            <li>This gentle, non-drying toner is good for all skin types.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to tuck into a bag for use on the go or at the pool or beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Certainly as gentle and refreshing as my own though the Aloe Vera (and probably the Kelp) leaves just a touch of sticky residue on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This toner has a nice natural fragrant rose scent as it goes on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ocean Toner probably gets its name from its marine kelp bioferment, but its first ingredient is rose water.</li>
            <li>Coui says that rose water is \\&quot;mainly used as an elegant alternative to water,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The sprayer makes a really fine mist.</li>
            <li>Though I received a sample for review, the positive opinion is my own.</li>
            <li>I just love how it leaves my skin feeling fresh and moist... and softer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no alcohol, extremely important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sample provided for testing and evaluation</li>
            <li>received one free container for review purposes.</li>
            <li>free sample was provided for review.</li>
            <li>compliance with FTC rules, I am disclosing that I received a free product for review.]</li>
            <li>you are looking for a product to help refresh your skin, you will enjoy this</li>
            <li>I received a free sample for testing and review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Received this free for review</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a nice cooling effect, but it doesn&#x27;t sting or tingle--in fact, it&#x27;s quite gentle--</li>
            <li>Good for even my sensitive</li>
            <li>It feels good to know all the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li>love the new cleansing oils, but using a toner after is a must for most of us.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>With a delightful scent and a convenient spray dispenser, this Ocean Facial Toner is a refreshing product to have as part of your facial</li>
            <li>Marine kelp bioferment is rich in moisturizers and minerals.</li>
            <li>love the fragrance:  It is a very light rose scent, not cloying, not sweet.  </li>
            <li>It feels cool and well, ocean-y.  </li>
            <li>Clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and soft and never bumpy from a build-up under the top skin layer.  </li>
            <li>I think that this toner product offers a nice way to rejuvenate my complexion and keep my face feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li>It freshens up the skin and makes me look more awake, vibrant, and like my skin is moisturized and glowing from within.</li>
            <li>It quickly fades however.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit it, on a hot day, even for a guy, this feels fabulous sprayed on my face.</li>
            <li>After I’ve cleaned my face and neck, I apply a small amount of this toner for a clean, cooling feeling, and that’s perfect for the warm, wet weather we’ve been blessed with of late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it after washing my face but before applying moisturizer, or after I get up from a nap and need to quickly wake up and feel fresh again.</li>
            <li>I would compare this favorably to Lush&#x27;s Breeze on a Salt Sea Air toner, which I used loyally for many years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scent is pretty subjective, but I think this is fairly Unisex (that &amp;#34;ocean scent&amp;#34; is pretty ubiquitous among Men hygiene products), and fellows looking for a topical application without the usual junk found in perfumed aftershaves, or the off-on success of mixing your own (got to get that rosewater amount right, or I end up smelling like a foo-foo rose arbor), this may be worth a try.  </li>
            <li>No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned after testing.&lt;br /&gt;Views and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>Complimentary product provided for evaluation</li>
            <li>Several weeks ago the nice folks at Coui sent me a sample of their [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>(rarely).  </li>
            <li>I place this in the fridge for a quick pick me up on hot day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 -  One of the very nicest toners I&#x27;ve used, gentle on my skin and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rarely use toner after the first try.</li>
            <li>IT is suitable for all skin types and it definitely works for mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>own several COUI skincare products and Highly Recommend them!</li>
            <li>love this Ocean Facial Toner by COUI because it is very very gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li>The spray mist is heavenly on a hot day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually sprayed it on the cotton ball and then dabbed it around; removing it with a lightly damp and soft facecloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t often say that I &#x27;love&#x27; a makeup or cleanser</li>
            <li>You can also spray this on your skin for an instant refreshing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was intrigued by the ingredients in Coui&#x27;s Ocean Toner, mostly because there are only five ingredients.</li>
            <li>It has kelp, which is being used in a lot of different ways to promote healthy skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is both refreshing and moisturizing when sprayed on the skin, especially on the face and</li>
            <li>This toner couldn&#x27;t be more different from the Seabreeze and Bonne Bell</li>
            <li>I love my COUI Ocean Facial Toner!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several of the big name toners like Clinique and this one is definitely less astringent and has a light rose scent to it that comes from the rose water.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin which needs attention several times a day and this toner is perfect because it doesn&#x27;t strip the skin and make it dry, it simply cleanses and moisturizes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of these sensitivities I had pretty much given up on toners.  </li>
            <li>But, as it is, I became acquainted with witch hazel a few years ago, as I picked up on the fact that several popular name brands were including witch hazel in their skin products.  </li>
            <li>toner has had no side effects on my skin (such as drying, a problem I&#x27;ve had with many other toners), just a refreshing sensation after my cleansing routine.  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin and many toners are just too drying for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have to grin as last year, I made my own little alcohol-free formula for an aftershave/skin soother (patchouli oil, rosewater, and distilled witch hazel), and here the two primary ingredients are rosewater and witch hazel.  </li>
            <li>but the real test is in swiping it across my face.</li>
            <li>I spray some on a cotton pad and then wipe my whole face.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would care much for a toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>My memories are of very astringent alcohol based lotions, applied with the intent of drying out oily skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle.  </li>
            <li>and it dries in about a minute, leaving skin ready for moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very picky about what I put on my skin, as this is the body&#x27;s largest detoxifier</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really rare to find one I&#x27;ll use after the first or second time, most leave my skin feeling tight and like I&#x27;ve trekked through the Sahara for a week and forgot my moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an older mom</li>
            <li>, I had high expectations for this toner.</li>
            <li>and right now I&#x27;m at an age where my skin is drier and more sensitive than in the past.  </li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how amazing it is that I have found a toner I can actually use until the bottle is empty and then buy another one!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll find yourself instantly transported to the seashore, surrounded by beach roses, warm sand and the sharp smell of salt and seaweed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>pick me up&#x27; for the skin, and after a few weeks it leaves pores looking more refined and the face is brighter.</li>
            <li>Most toners are simply to drying to my already dry skin.</li>
            <li>It has an initial rose fragrance which fades into something bring after a few seconds--I don&#x27;t care for it, but it&#x27;s inoffensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It was so unusual that I actually sprayed it again and tried again, and again my skin stayed soft and just felt refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Those that were gentle on skin, like Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder&#x27;s discontinued Soothing Spray Toner for sensitive skin, weren&#x27;t worth the trouble or cost.</li>
            <li>And there was no problem with my sensitive skin, no burning, no redness,</li>
            <li>use the toner along with the COUI Nourishing Oil for soft and radiant feeling skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely non-irritating and non-drying.</li>
            <li>Coui products have a sticker with the date of manufacture on the bottle, so you don&#x27;t have to wonder how old it is.</li>
            <li>It has the natural medicine witch hazel</li>
            <li>simple formula is very reassuring.  </li>
            <li>The natural ingredients in this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▶︎  PROPANEDIOL, usually vegetable derived, is used in many natural cosmetics to keep the ingredients mixed together.  </li>
            <li>The witch hazel has even lightened acne scars and blotch-y-ness from the sun--a major improvement for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like that the ingredient list is short and easily identifiable, so I don&#x27;t have to look everything up.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Thing is, it did nothing for my skin good, bad, or in between (aside from the initial cooling).</li>

            <li> Certainly as gentle and refreshing as my own though the Aloe Vera (and probably the Kelp) leaves just a touch of sticky residue on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This toner has a nice natural fragrant rose scent as it goes on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ocean Toner probably gets its name from its marine kelp bioferment, but its first ingredient is rose water.</li>
            <li> Coui says that rose water is \\&quot;mainly used as an elegant alternative to water,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The sprayer makes a really fine mist.</li>
            <li> Though I received a sample for review, the positive opinion is my own.</li>
            <li> I just love how it leaves my skin feeling fresh and moist... and softer.</li>

            <li> there&#x27;s a nice cooling effect, but it doesn&#x27;t sting or tingle--in fact, it&#x27;s quite gentle--</li>
            <li> Good for even my sensitive</li>
            <li> It feels good to know all the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li> love the new cleansing oils, but using a toner after is a must for most of us.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> With a delightful scent and a convenient spray dispenser, this Ocean Facial Toner is a refreshing product to have as part of your facial</li>
            <li> Marine kelp bioferment is rich in moisturizers and minerals.</li>
            <li> love the fragrance:  It is a very light rose scent, not cloying, not sweet.  </li>
            <li> It feels cool and well, ocean-y.  </li>
            <li> Clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and soft and never bumpy from a build-up under the top skin layer.  </li>
            <li> I think that this toner product offers a nice way to rejuvenate my complexion and keep my face feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li> It freshens up the skin and makes me look more awake, vibrant, and like my skin is moisturized and glowing from within.</li>
            <li> It quickly fades however.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit it, on a hot day, even for a guy, this feels fabulous sprayed on my face.</li>
            <li> After I’ve cleaned my face and neck, I apply a small amount of this toner for a clean, cooling feeling, and that’s perfect for the warm, wet weather we’ve been blessed with of late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it after washing my face but before applying moisturizer, or after I get up from a nap and need to quickly wake up and feel fresh again.</li>
            <li> I would compare this favorably to Lush&#x27;s Breeze on a Salt Sea Air toner, which I used loyally for many years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scent is pretty subjective, but I think this is fairly Unisex (that &amp;#34;ocean scent&amp;#34; is pretty ubiquitous among Men hygiene products), and fellows looking for a topical application without the usual junk found in perfumed aftershaves, or the off-on success of mixing your own (got to get that rosewater amount right, or I end up smelling like a foo-foo rose arbor), this may be worth a try.  </li>

            <li> Several weeks ago the nice folks at Coui sent me a sample of their [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> (rarely).  </li>
            <li> I place this in the fridge for a quick pick me up on hot day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 -  One of the very nicest toners I&#x27;ve used, gentle on my skin and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rarely use toner after the first try.</li>
            <li> IT is suitable for all skin types and it definitely works for mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> own several COUI skincare products and Highly Recommend them!</li>
            <li> love this Ocean Facial Toner by COUI because it is very very gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li> The spray mist is heavenly on a hot day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually sprayed it on the cotton ball and then dabbed it around; removing it with a lightly damp and soft facecloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t often say that I &#x27;love&#x27; a makeup or cleanser</li>
            <li> You can also spray this on your skin for an instant refreshing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by the ingredients in Coui&#x27;s Ocean Toner, mostly because there are only five ingredients.</li>
            <li> It has kelp, which is being used in a lot of different ways to promote healthy skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is both refreshing and moisturizing when sprayed on the skin, especially on the face and</li>
            <li> This toner couldn&#x27;t be more different from the Seabreeze and Bonne Bell</li>
            <li> I love my COUI Ocean Facial Toner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several of the big name toners like Clinique and this one is definitely less astringent and has a light rose scent to it that comes from the rose water.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin which needs attention several times a day and this toner is perfect because it doesn&#x27;t strip the skin and make it dry, it simply cleanses and moisturizes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of these sensitivities I had pretty much given up on toners.  </li>
            <li> But, as it is, I became acquainted with witch hazel a few years ago, as I picked up on the fact that several popular name brands were including witch hazel in their skin products.  </li>
            <li> toner has had no side effects on my skin (such as drying, a problem I&#x27;ve had with many other toners), just a refreshing sensation after my cleansing routine.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and many toners are just too drying for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have to grin as last year, I made my own little alcohol-free formula for an aftershave/skin soother (patchouli oil, rosewater, and distilled witch hazel), and here the two primary ingredients are rosewater and witch hazel.  </li>
            <li> but the real test is in swiping it across my face.</li>
            <li> I spray some on a cotton pad and then wipe my whole face.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would care much for a toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> My memories are of very astringent alcohol based lotions, applied with the intent of drying out oily skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle.  </li>
            <li> and it dries in about a minute, leaving skin ready for moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very picky about what I put on my skin, as this is the body&#x27;s largest detoxifier</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really rare to find one I&#x27;ll use after the first or second time, most leave my skin feeling tight and like I&#x27;ve trekked through the Sahara for a week and forgot my moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an older mom</li>
            <li> , I had high expectations for this toner.</li>
            <li> and right now I&#x27;m at an age where my skin is drier and more sensitive than in the past.  </li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how amazing it is that I have found a toner I can actually use until the bottle is empty and then buy another one!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll find yourself instantly transported to the seashore, surrounded by beach roses, warm sand and the sharp smell of salt and seaweed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> pick me up&#x27; for the skin, and after a few weeks it leaves pores looking more refined and the face is brighter.</li>
            <li> Most toners are simply to drying to my already dry skin.</li>
            <li> It has an initial rose fragrance which fades into something bring after a few seconds--I don&#x27;t care for it, but it&#x27;s inoffensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It was so unusual that I actually sprayed it again and tried again, and again my skin stayed soft and just felt refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Those that were gentle on skin, like Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder&#x27;s discontinued Soothing Spray Toner for sensitive skin, weren&#x27;t worth the trouble or cost.</li>
            <li> And there was no problem with my sensitive skin, no burning, no redness,</li>
            <li> use the toner along with the COUI Nourishing Oil for soft and radiant feeling skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely non-irritating and non-drying.</li>

            <li> I am a firm believer in witch hazel.  Wish my mother had been, and wish she had clued me in back when I was a teen....I think I would have had way fewer facial skin issues to cause me grief back then, and much better skin now.  But, as it is, I became acquainted with witch hazel a few years ago, as I picked up on the fact that several popular name brands were including witch hazel in their skin products.  I tried a witch hazel toner and was amazed at the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never give up a witch hazel toner.  But I have learned that I should give up a witch hazel toner with alcohol.....As the weather gets hotter and more humid, I always wash my face more often.  Then splash on some toner.  It becomes a vicious cycle:.  The toner with alcohol causes my skin to produce more oil, then I wash more often, tone more often, and produce even more oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product eliminates the alcohol that dries out the skin and adds marine kelp and aloe to add extra moisture and minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found witch hazel to tighten up my pores.  I have very few breakouts.  My skin feels smooth and soft and never bumpy from a build-up under the top skin layer.  The witch hazel has even lightened acne scars and blotch-y-ness from the sun--a major improvement for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fragrance:  It is a very light rose scent, not cloying, not sweet.  I do feel a bit of stickiness from the aloe--and I am slowly adapting to that feel.  The spray mist is heavenly on a hot day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from COUI Skincare.</li>
            <li> With a delightful scent and a convenient spray dispenser, this Ocean Facial Toner is a refreshing product to have as part of your facial regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a wonderful &#x27;pick me up&#x27; for the skin, and after a few weeks it leaves pores looking more refined and the face is brighter. Good for even my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I love the new cleansing oils, but using a toner after is a must for most of us.&lt;br /&gt;This one is perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: Product received to test, with the option to review.

            <li> I&#x27;m an older mom and right now I&#x27;m at an age where my skin is drier and more sensitive than in the past.  Part of that sensitivity is because of the dryness but a good portion of it is from the slew of allergies I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of these sensitivities I had pretty much given up on toners.  I&#x27;ve tried so many but mostly ended up giving them to my daughter because the alcohol in them stung my face, and worse, left it painfully dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the offer to try COUI&#x27;s OCEAN TONER I raised a skeptical eyebrow. But after reading the ingredients agreed to give it a try in exchange for a totally honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I&#x27;m in love with this product. I just love how it leaves my skin feeling fresh and moist... and softer. I&#x27;m not sure if the softness is due to the Kelp extract or the aloe, but I&#x27;m keeping this for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTES&lt;br /&gt;One thing that is different about this toner is that it comes in a spray dispenser.  I kinda like that since the closed nature of a sprayer should keep any sort of contamination of the product from occurring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to spray it on and then remove it with a cotton ball.  I actually sprayed it on the cotton ball and then dabbed it around; removing it with a lightly damp and soft facecloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t often say that I &#x27;love&#x27; a makeup or cleanser but I do adore this toner. The things I like about it are that despite the sensitivity of my older-mom skin it doesn&#x27;t irritate it.  No, instead it leaves my skin feeling better. Clean and fresh. Soothed and actually softer.  I like soothed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely Recommend.</li>
            <li> I have to grin as last year, I made my own little alcohol-free formula for an aftershave/skin soother (patchouli oil, rosewater, and distilled witch hazel), and here the two primary ingredients are rosewater and witch hazel.  Guess I had stumbled on a good foundation mixture.  My own mixture is also in a spritz like this.  This spritzes a lot better, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent is pretty subjective, but I think this is fairly Unisex (that &amp;#34;ocean scent&amp;#34; is pretty ubiquitous among Men hygiene products), and fellows looking for a topical application without the usual junk found in perfumed aftershaves, or the off-on success of mixing your own (got to get that rosewater amount right, or I end up smelling like a foo-foo rose arbor), this may be worth a try.  Certainly as gentle and refreshing as my own though the Aloe Vera (and probably the Kelp) leaves just a touch of sticky residue on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Complimentary product provided for evaluation</li>
            <li> Several weeks ago the nice folks at Coui sent me a sample of their [[ASIN:B00T55VQU4 Ocean Facial Toner]] and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  Unlike most toners I&#x27;ve used, this one comes in a spray bottle - just close your eyes and spray your face.  You&#x27;ll find yourself instantly transported to the seashore, surrounded by beach roses, warm sand and the sharp smell of salt and seaweed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product contains rose water (rosa dmascena), Witch Hazel extract, marine kelp filtrate bioferment, propanediol and aloe barbadensis extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▶︎  PROPANEDIOL, usually vegetable derived, is used in many natural cosmetics to keep the ingredients mixed together.  It has a very low overall hazard level with no known risk of  cancer or other toxicities, though it can be mildly irritating to the skin. (rarely).  It is not suspected to be an environmental toxin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 -  One of the very nicest toners I&#x27;ve used, gentle on my skin and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided</li>
            <li> I rarely use toner after the first try. Most toners are simply to drying to my already dry skin. It&#x27;s really rare to find one I&#x27;ll use after the first or second time, most leave my skin feeling tight and like I&#x27;ve trekked through the Sahara for a week and forgot my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ocean Facial Toner is different.

            <li> COUI&#x27;s ocean toner has a heavenly rose scent which makes it a pleasure to use. I spray some on a cotton pad and then wipe my whole face. I&#x27;m always amazed at how deeply this cleanses the skin. I have oily skin which needs attention several times a day and this toner is perfect because it doesn&#x27;t strip the skin and make it dry, it simply cleanses and moisturizes. This is also great as an after sun product as it has aloe in it which calms the skin. So I&#x27;d recommend this for summer for sure! You can also spray this on your skin for an instant refreshing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one free container for review purposes. This review is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I was offered a sample of this product to try in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this Ocean Facial Toner by COUI because it is very very gentle on the skin.  I&#x27;ve used several of the big name toners like Clinique and this one is definitely less astringent and has a light rose scent to it that comes from the rose water.  The scent is not overpowering and you can feel the ingredients at work without the astringency of added alcohol.  The no alcohol is probably one of my favorite things about this Toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray bottle is a great method of delivery and the spray is a pump versus an aerosol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the toner along with the COUI Nourishing Oil for soft and radiant feeling skin.  I think that this toner product offers a nice way to rejuvenate my complexion and keep my face feeling fresh.  I&#x27;m really enjoying it!</li>
            <li> Wow does this ever smell wonderful. Who would imagine that roses and ocean would possibly go together?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is gorgeous. It is tall and thin aluminum with a pump spray. The sprayer makes a really fine mist. I&#x27;ll admit it, on a hot day, even for a guy, this feels fabulous sprayed on my face. The smell and the cooling effect are outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A free sample was provided for review.</li>
            <li> I admit that I&#x27;ve never considered toner to be an essential part of my skin care regimen. Toners containing alcohol were too harsh and drying to use beyond my teen years. Those that were gentle on skin, like Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder&#x27;s discontinued Soothing Spray Toner for sensitive skin, weren&#x27;t worth the trouble or cost. They didn&#x27;t do much. I was intrigued by the ingredients in Coui&#x27;s Ocean Toner, mostly because there are only five ingredients. I have very sensitive skin. Since none of the ingredients are a  likely allergen or irritant, I gave it a try. Ocean Toner comes in a 4 fl oz (120 ml) tall metal spray bottle. Shake the bottle and spray over your face, neck, and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; after cleansing. Massage into your skin with fingers or wipe off with a cotton ball. If you&#x27;re using the toner to remove residual make-up, wipe off with a cotton ball or cotton make-up pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ocean Toner probably gets its name from its marine kelp bioferment, but its first ingredient is rose water. It smells like rose water. I would have preferred no scent, but the sugary rose does not linger longer than it takes to top it off with serum. Coui says that rose water is \\&quot;mainly used as an elegant alternative to water,\\&quot; so it&#x27;s included for the scent. Aloe extract improves hydration and aids in healing. Witch hazel extract is anti-inflammatory and astringent. Marine kelp bioferment is rich in moisturizers and minerals. And there you have it. Ocean Toner feels refreshing and calming on the skin. I can&#x27;t tell if the witch hazel has much success in closing pores, but it feels good. It&#x27;s completely non-irritating and non-drying. I&#x27;ve been using Ocean Toner twice a day for a week for testing purposes, and I&#x27;m enjoying it. I never thought I would care much for a toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Coui products have a sticker with the date of manufacture on the bottle, so you don&#x27;t have to wonder how old it is. The packaging is elegant and practical. I find that spraying toner onto the face and neck is faster and more convenient than wiping it on with cotton balls -and less expensive, as the cotton is not absorbing half of my toner. I like that the ingredient list is short and easily identifiable, so I don&#x27;t have to look everything up. Ingredients are: Rose (Rosa damascena) Floral Water, Witch Hazel (Hamamelis virginiana) extract, Marine Kelp (kelp ferment filtrate) Bioferment, Propanediol (used as a solvent), Aloe barbadensis extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[In compliance with FTC rules, I am disclosing that I received a free product for review.]more convenient than wiping it on with cotton balls -and less expensive, as the cotton is not absorbing half of my toner.

            <li> This toner has a nice natural fragrant rose scent as it goes on. It has the natural medicine witch hazel but without any alcohol which can be difficult to find. It has kelp, which is being used in a lot of different ways to promote healthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the easiest product to use. My wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toner requested for sincere review.</li>
            <li> This toner has a wonderful, sweet herbal fragrance of rose and witch hazel.  It is both refreshing and moisturizing when sprayed on the skin, especially on the face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The simple formula is very reassuring.  In addition to rosewater and witch hazel extract, the formula also contains kelp bioferment, which is an effective emollient, as well as propanediol and aloe extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump sprayer is of good quality and produces a fine mist.  The slim aluminum bottle is refillable.  It is easy to tuck into a bag for use on the go or at the pool or beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COUI Skincare provided toner for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been years since I used a toner.  My memories are of very astringent alcohol based lotions, applied with the intent of drying out oily skin.  This toner couldn&#x27;t be more different from the Seabreeze and Bonne Bell Ten Oh Six from my blemished adolescence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You spray this on after cleansing.  It feels cool and well, ocean-y.  That part was nice, but then I looked in the mirror. I was horrified. My face felt dry and tight, and the mirror showed every line and wrinkle.  GAH!  I slathered on some face cream and went to bed sniffling a little--okay, sobbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning, I was stunned by the look and feel of my skin.  Overnight, the toner had worked some alchemy with the cream and my skin looked great!  It felt moisturized, it looked good--and my bathroom is flooded with morning light--every imperfection shows up.  Wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spray with confidence and glee!  This is good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so impressed with all the COUI products I&#x27;ve tried.  They deliver on their promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received for review.</li>
            <li> I would compare this favorably to Lush&#x27;s Breeze on a Salt Sea Air toner, which I used loyally for many years. It freshens up the skin and makes me look more awake, vibrant, and like my skin is moisturized and glowing from within. I use it after washing my face but before applying moisturizer, or after I get up from a nap and need to quickly wake up and feel fresh again. The bottle, the downside of many toners, is perfect and the sprayer lets out a fine mist that is easy to direct and doesn&#x27;t leak or drip. Though I received a sample for review, the positive opinion is my own.</li>
            <li> I’ve used this Ocean toner for about a week.  After I’ve cleaned my face and neck, I apply a small amount of this toner for a clean, cooling feeling, and that’s perfect for the warm, wet weather we’ve been blessed with of late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toner has had no side effects on my skin (such as drying, a problem I&#x27;ve had with many other toners), just a refreshing sensation after my cleansing routine.  I will continue to use it as part of my night time ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I love my COUI Ocean Facial Toner! I leave mine in the fridge to help refresh my often broken-out and irritated skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toner works amazing and smells delightful, and there is no sting or afterburn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for skin like mine who can be oily and sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own several COUI skincare products and Highly Recommend them!</li>
            <li> I like the feel of my face after using a toner and this product doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  This gentle, non-drying toner is good for all skin types.  I have dry skin and this product didn&#x27;t make my skin feel drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It makes my skin feel refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s gentle.  I have dry skin and many toners are just too drying for my skin.  Not this toner.&lt;br /&gt;* The natural ingredients in this product.  The ingredients are:  Rose Floral Water, Witch Hazel Extract, Marine Kelp, and Aloe Extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a very slight smell of roses when you apply this product.  It quickly fades however.  I was happy about that since a rose scent is not one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a product to help refresh your skin, you will enjoy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a free sample for testing and review.</li>
            <li> One of the best toners I have ever tried.  No stripping alcohol and the witch hazel in it has helped make my pores smaller.  I place this in the fridge for a quick pick me up on hot day.  Will never go back to another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received this free for review but I DO NOT give good review in trade for free product. Always 100% honest.

            <li> Having tried--and loving--the [[ASIN:B00T55VPE6 COUI Nourishing Oil Cleanseri]], I had high expectations for this toner. It has an initial rose fragrance which fades into something bring after a few seconds--I don&#x27;t care for it, but it&#x27;s inoffensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon initial application there&#x27;s a nice cooling effect, but it doesn&#x27;t sting or tingle--in fact, it&#x27;s quite gentle--and it dries in about a minute, leaving skin ready for moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thing is, it did nothing for my skin good, bad, or in between (aside from the initial cooling). It didn&#x27;t tighten my pores, improve facial tone, or even alter how product went down on my skin afterward. To make sure it wasn&#x27;t all just in my head, I discontinued use for two weeks and noted no change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue using it until it&#x27;s finished and will update this review should something change. For now though, I have to slot this in the middling category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> This toner feels very refreshing on your skin! I am very picky about what I put on my skin, as this is the body&#x27;s largest detoxifier and I sure don&#x27;t want to add toxins. It has rose water as its first ingredient! It includes witch hazel, marine kelp and aloe extract. It feels good to know all the ingredients are natural. IT is suitable for all skin types and it definitely works for mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor and other books.</li>
