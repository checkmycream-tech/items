            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are nice, sturdy and durable,, I will probably NEVER NEED the backups.</li>
            <li>Would have been a nice feature.</li>
            <li>nice.</li>
            <li>Just rests on top so good for home use.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>The strainer cup fits inside the bottom section nicely and the top slides on easily!  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find this one available from Amazon.</li>
            <li>There are so many to choose from online</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.</li>
            <li>I doubt many people travel without their dentures in their mouth.</li>
            <li>Looked even better.</li>
            <li>The lid does not snap on, but rather, just sits on the top.</li>
            <li>Better than I thought.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t fill it to the top and move it without spilling it.</li>
            <li>Love the two colors that I received when I purchased mine.</li>
            <li>It is so much more pleasing to look at on the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>I Love the basket it has for easy using.</li>
            <li>This fits very compactly on my sink.and looks good.</li>
            <li>It works fine, although I would prefer a deeper one.</li>
            <li>, This is not like the cheap flimsy units that you find in the drug store,, But the company that made my wife&#x27;s stopped making them</li>
            <li>Husband really likes it.arrived earlier than expected.product was described perfectly.</li>
            <li>JUST A PIEACE CHIPPED OFF THE TOP OF THE BOTTOM PART RIGHT UNDER THE COLORED RING ABOUT 1&amp;1/2 OR 2CM</li>
            <li>Very useful to use at home in medicine cabinet,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased others, but this is the best design for my small retainers that I wear at night.</li>
            <li>Just clean it and pack it for use when you get where you&#x27;re going.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if there were other color options, but the product is well made and nicely designed.</li>
            <li>IT HAS A TOP THAT PULLS STRAIGHT UP AND OFF.</li>
            <li>Much better than the one that dentist uses when a new denture is delivered to patients.</li>
            <li>It seems to be made very well and it also arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>HIS whole set upper and lower dentures fit nicely inside for him to soak them.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize it was coming from the UK, took some time to get, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Takes a while for the item to arrive but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>The one my wife is using is over 5 years old and going strong,,</li>
            <li>COST  WAS VERY VERY REASONABLE.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; close as other denture cups do - lid just sits on top of the bottom section but is secure in that it can&#x27;t be knocked off.  </li>
            <li>I AM BACK ORDERING TWO MORE</li>
            <li>Looks much better than the American versions sold in CVS, Walgreens or Walmart.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Sturdy construction -- should last for many years.  </li>
            <li>EXACTLY PROMISED.</li>
            <li>This is such a nicer product than most denture baths.</li>
            <li>This works very well and like it is described.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high quality!</li>
            <li>I really like the design because it doesn&#x27;t look like a denture</li>
            <li>Bought this for my mother-in-law, very well made.</li>
            <li>Like it so much that I am buying another to use for soaking and cleaning jewelry.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see a need for the removable, slotted tray.</li>
            <li>the item itself is made really well.</li>
            <li>Well constructed with sturdy and high quality plastic.</li>
            <li>(Not sure if you can request a specific color or not - I just got lucky)  Easy to put together and take apart.  </li>
            <li>and then I stumbled on this unit, which is EXACTLY the same but made in Europe,, So I ordered it as a test...</li>
            <li>, I was surprised.</li>
            <li>Professional quality.</li>
            <li>Nice to keep your false teeth in.</li>
            <li>But the bath needs to be a little larger to hold a full set of dentures.</li>
            <li>This would have been a great cup for my Mother when she was alive as she was disabled from a stroke and opening and closing things with &amp;#34;locks&amp;#34; was difficult.  </li>
            <li>Lifting the rinsing basket with one hand allows me to easily and firmly grab a partial denture without dropping it or having it slip away under the surface of the liquid.  </li>
            <li>The picture showed the rinsing basket in red; when it came, it was green; a little disappointed, but it works fine; great for soaking my nightguard.</li>

            <li> The wife says it looks much nicer in the bathroom than those cheap, ugly blu/pink ones the dentist sends you home with.</li>
            <li> BUT BECAUSE IT TAKES SO LONG TO GET.</li>
            <li> well made product, for some strange reason pharmacies are no longer carrying denture baths, so I had to look on line and amazon came through.</li>
            <li> No more broken plastic hinges since the top lifts off.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I&#x27;d been looking for a versatile solid denture bath, that I was unable to duplicate in any local brick &amp; mortar</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t take very long to get here</li>
            <li> I bought a denture bath very much like this several years ago in Texas, but I had been unable to find another in Iowa.  </li>
            <li> ONLY PROBLEM WAS IT HAD LESS VOLUME CAPACITY</li>
            <li> WIDE.</li>
            <li> THAN I EXPECTED.  </li>
            <li> As stated this product took longer than I expected to arrive</li>
            <li> It does the job as expected.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the basket floats and when the lid is put on the container overflows.</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is the 3 weeks that it took for me to receive the product.</li>
            <li> This is really my only complaint.</li>
            <li> It is well made and doesn&#x27;t look like the typical denture bat.</li>
            <li> TIGHT SQUEEZE FOR MY DENTURES.</li>
            <li> but it is a tight fix for my husbands dentures.</li>
            <li> , ONE TO REPLACE THE BROKEN ONE, AND A BACK UP ONE</li>
            <li> One of the reviews said that they had trouble getting the lid off, I didn&#x27;t have any problem at all.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money on this item!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a denture cup in my local area but, was unable to find one like this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have small kids any longer or cats that jump on counters to have to worry about it being knocked off the counter</li>
            <li> IT IS WELL MADE HARD PLASTIC.</li>
            <li> I was looking for one that did not have a attached lid as my previous container had a hinge that partly broke was awkward when raising and looked sloppy.</li>
            <li> IT DID NOT BREAK BAD</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> AT LEASE THIS ONE DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A DENTURE BATH. IF YOU LEAVE IT ON YOUR COUNTER. IT JUST LOOKS LIKE A CONTAINER. POSSIBLY A JEWELRY CLEANER. AND THERE IS NOT A HINGE TO BREAK AFTER A LOT OF USE. IT HAS A TOP THAT PULLS STRAIGHT UP AND OFF. THE COLORED RING IS THE BASKET PART THAT DRAINS AS YOU PULL IT OUT. IT IS WELL MADE HARD PLASTIC. BUT IF YOU DROP IT. IT MIGHT CRACK. LIKE OURS DID. YOU CAN STILL USE IT. IT DID NOT BREAK BAD JUST A PIEACE CHIPPED OFF THE TOP OF THE BOTTOM PART RIGHT UNDER THE COLORED RING ABOUT 1&amp;1/2 OR 2CM WIDE. BUT BECAUSE IT TAKES SO LONG TO GET. I AM BACK ORDERING TWO MORE, ONE TO REPLACE THE BROKEN ONE, AND A BACK UP ONE IF IT IS DROPPED AGAIN. I just took out my tape measure and measured the outside dementions of this item they are 3x3x3&amp;1/2 inchs. HIS whole set upper and lower dentures fit nicely inside for him to soak them.</li>
            <li> The picture showed the rinsing basket in red; when it came, it was green; a little disappointed, but it works fine; great for soaking my nightguard.</li>
            <li> Looks much better than the American versions sold in CVS, Walgreens or Walmart.  Would be nice if there were other color options, but the product is well made and nicely designed.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. I had one back in 2110, but left it somewhere when were on our trip across the USA. This works very well and like it is described.</li>
            <li> like the size and construction of this denture bath also like the lift out basket, makes it easier to rinse off the dentures</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s high quality! There are so many to choose from online and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one. No more broken plastic hinges since the top lifts off. I really like the design because it doesn&#x27;t look like a denture bath.&lt;br /&gt;Re: &amp;#34;Not for travel&amp;#34; comment: I doubt many people travel without their dentures in their mouth. Just clean it and pack it for use when you get where you&#x27;re going.</li>
            <li> This dental cup did not meet my expectations.  It looks larger here than it actually is.  Wasted my money on this item!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great!  Lifting the rinsing basket with one hand allows me to easily and firmly grab a partial denture without dropping it or having it slip away under the surface of the liquid.  Sturdy construction -- should last for many years.  I bought a denture bath very much like this several years ago in Texas, but I had been unable to find another in Iowa.  I was very pleased to find this one available from Amazon.</li>
            <li> DELIVERED IN TIME EXACTLY PROMISED. GOOD CONSTRUCTION WITH GOOD MATERIALS. COST  WAS VERY VERY REASONABLE.  ONLY PROBLEM WAS IT HAD LESS VOLUME CAPACITY THAN I EXPECTED.  TIGHT SQUEEZE FOR MY DENTURES.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother-in-law, very well made. Like it so much that I am buying another to use for soaking and cleaning jewelry. Didn&#x27;t realize it was coming from the UK, took some time to get, but worth the wait. The one I got had a blue band not red as in the picture. Looked even better.</li>
            <li> Very useful to use at home in medicine cabinet, etc. but would not be practical to use while traveling.  The lid does not snap on, but rather, just sits on the top.</li>
            <li> Very nice product....plenty of room for my family member&#x27;s needs</li>
            <li> Takes a while for the item to arrive but it is well worth it. I have one for my night guard and another for cleaning jewelry. Well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Went looking for the same unit that my wife uses., This is not like the cheap flimsy units that you find in the drug store,, But the company that made my wife&#x27;s stopped making them and then I stumbled on this unit, which is EXACTLY the same but made in Europe,, So I ordered it as a test...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And after it came it, I ordered two more as backups just in case they stop making this one,, GREAT UNIT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are nice, sturdy and durable,, I will probably NEVER NEED the backups. The one my wife is using is over 5 years old and going strong,,</li>
            <li> I like the way it looks on my counter. But the bath needs to be a little larger to hold a full set of dentures. When I bought it I thought it would be larger then then baths from the pharmacy?</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. This is such a nicer product than most denture baths. The one I received has a pearly blue basket,( the one pictured is red).  It is well made and doesn&#x27;t look like the typical denture bat. One of the reviews said that they had trouble getting the lid off, I didn&#x27;t have any problem at all. So all in all it was a great buy. It ships from the UK but it didn&#x27;t take very long to get here, I was surprised. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased others, but this is the best design for my small retainers that I wear at night. In fact, I have two; one for home, one for the suitcase  for traveling.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the basket floats and when the lid is put on the container overflows.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a denture cup in my local area but, was unable to find one like this. I am very pleased with it.  The only complaint that I have is the 3 weeks that it took for me to receive the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this before going on vacation, but I wish I would have tried to open it before I left.  This denture case was literally imposable to open.  This is really my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Better than I thought. I can put it on the bathroom counter and it doesn&#x27;t look like it would have dentures inside.</li>
            <li> great size, looks nice, does the job !! when I ordered it they said 4 - 5 weeks to be delivered.....got it in 2. I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as deep as the one I wore out, but deeper than what I can get at the local stores. It works fine, although I would prefer a deeper one.</li>
            <li> Husband really likes it.arrived earlier than expected.product was described perfectly. No color choice was offered. Would have been a nice feature.</li>
            <li> This item shipped promptly and is as described, sort of.  It is well made and attractive.  But, the tub is barely deep enough to soak upper and lower together.  You can&#x27;t fill it to the top and move it without spilling it.</li>
            <li> Took sometime to get to residence.  But Product was above expectations.  As stated this product took longer than I expected to arrive</li>
            <li> This fits very compactly on my sink.and looks good. It seems to be made very well and it also arrived very quickly. I was looking for one that did not have a attached lid as my previous container had a hinge that partly broke was awkward when raising and looked sloppy.</li>
            <li> Nice to keep your false teeth in. I Love the basket it has for easy using.</li>
            <li> This denture cup is great!!  Love the two colors that I received when I purchased mine. (Not sure if you can request a specific color or not - I just got lucky)  Easy to put together and take apart.  The strainer cup fits inside the bottom section nicely and the top slides on easily!  This would have been a great cup for my Mother when she was alive as she was disabled from a stroke and opening and closing things with &amp;#34;locks&amp;#34; was difficult.  This only takes one hand to &amp;#34;operate.&amp;#34;  It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; close as other denture cups do - lid just sits on top of the bottom section but is secure in that it can&#x27;t be knocked off.  However, if dropped it will come apart.  I don&#x27;t have small kids any longer or cats that jump on counters to have to worry about it being knocked off the counter so it is great for me!  Well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> Professional quality. Much better than the one that dentist uses when a new denture is delivered to patients. Well constructed with sturdy and high quality plastic.</li>
            <li> I replaced a bath provided by my dentist with this one. It is so much more pleasing to look at on the bathroom sink. It does the job as expected. It is well constructed. It came expeditiously even though it was advertised to take awhile. Would recommend to anyone who would like an aesthetically pleasing denture bath for a good price.</li>
            <li> Very nice container for my choppers. The wife says it looks much nicer in the bathroom than those cheap, ugly blu/pink ones the dentist sends you home with. Didn&#x27;t really see a need for the removable, slotted tray. But, I stand corrected. I must admit, it makes caring for my pearly whites a bit easier.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I&#x27;d been looking for a versatile solid denture bath, that I was unable to duplicate in any local brick &amp; mortar</li>
            <li> replaced on I lost in the move. Works great to cleanse the retainers</li>
            <li> well made product, for some strange reason pharmacies are no longer carrying denture baths, so I had to look on line and amazon came through.</li>
            <li> the item itself is made really well. but it is a tight fix for my husbands dentures.</li>
            <li> Great basket. nice. Not for travel though. Lid does not stay on. Is not hinged. Just rests on top so good for home use.</li>
            <li> Works great and is nice and sturdy, great for invisalign!</li>
