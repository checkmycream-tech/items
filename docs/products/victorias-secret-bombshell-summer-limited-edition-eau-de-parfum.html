            <li>Came new and in great condition!</li>
            <li>Light and bright.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sweet and refreshing!</li>
            <li>While I still love Bombshell, this one is great too, and lingers on my skin all day, which is really rare for me.</li>
            <li>really fast shipping great product</li>
            <li>This perfume is not what I&#x27;m used to wearing, but I am in love with the Bombshell collection, so I tried this anyway.</li>
            <li>I love this frafrence and use it all the time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought it since it came into the stores and every year I&#x27;ve been able to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t be able to sleep at night if I didn&#x27;t try it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable, shipped quickly, and the smell is just as great as I remember - wonderful initial scent and lingers nicely throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get another bottle!</li>
            <li>It is the single best perfume I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li>It has a \\&quot;coconut\\&quot;/ \\&quot;tropical\\&quot; smell added on top to the original bombshell.</li>
            <li>and I actually enjoy the original better.....</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan/user of the original VS Bombshell.</li>
            <li>I originally brought it during the summer (in combo w/ the body spray) in store.</li>
            <li>This summer edition perfume is smells just like the original bombshell</li>
            <li>All I can say is that if you like the original you will like this one.</li>
            <li>Loved it so much I used it up pretty fast, well very fast!!</li>
            <li>The bottle appeared full though, so I&#x27;m not overly concerned.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase.</li>
            <li>I ordered this thinking it was going to be extremely sweet...</li>
            <li>but if you wanted something really sweet - this probably isn&#x27;t the one for you.</li>
            <li>I would have loved this product if I had actually received the right perfume.</li>
            <li>The scent of this fabulous perfume is sweet, fresh and very summery!</li>
            <li>This was actually my 1st time ordering off of Amazon &amp; I was very pleased</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great scent.. think the classic bombshell but with a hint of grapefruit.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good, definitely a summer scent.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I would have bought it in the store, but I can&#x27;t complain, it still smells good!</li>
            <li>Probably not because it smells pretty close to the original.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>It smells really fresh and grown up.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC PRICE too at $25 instead of the normal $50</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping....</li>
            <li>I finally was able to get it.  </li>
            <li>I wore it for the first time today and walked by a couple people and got some head turning.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend even said during our time alone together that the scent turned him on ;)</li>
            <li>but it definately much cheaper!</li>
            <li>I had my purse stolen in 2012 with my favorite limited edition summer perfume - this Bombshell Summer.</li>
            <li>I work at VS and wanted more bottles of this after the limited edition stopped being shipped to stores.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find this on amazon as VS had it limited edition.</li>
            <li>how fast I got my order.</li>
            <li>I get compliments on it all the time, but I have to use it sparingly so it doesn&#x27;t run out so fast.</li>
            <li>it turns out its a little more &amp;#34;musty&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bad because it really is an awesome fragrance</li>
            <li>If you are listing a product for sale, make sure you have the correct item!!! :(</li>
            <li>It has lasted for a while on me so far, still testing it out.</li>
            <li>These bottles were the real ones and the perfume was the real one, not watered down or changed at all.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m basing this review of this perfume against the original Victoria&#x27;s Secret Bombshell.</li>
            <li> It is a little overbearing at first, but it tones down after a while.</li>
            <li> but it has slightly lighter undertones.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on buying this online, but when it came it was sealed and brand new.</li>
            <li> Not too fruity, not to flowery, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I was sent the &#x27;Victoria&#x27;s Secret Bombshell The Summer Edition&#x27; which is different from the one pictured and listed here.</li>
            <li> It smelled a little weird when I got it, it smelled like the box that it was in for shipping.</li>
            <li> I wish Victoria Secret did not discontinue it.</li>
            <li> It sold out at the VS store on 34th street and I was obsessed with the smell from the remaining tester.  </li>
            <li> By the time I emptied the bottle it was sold out in all Victoria Secret locations!</li>
            <li> Heart broken!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the sellers mistake and found it a hassle to have to return the product.</li>
            <li> basically disappointed!!!</li>

            <li> really fast shipping great product</li>
            <li> I would have loved this product if I had actually received the right perfume. The scent of this is Amazing which is why I ordered it but unfortunately I was sent the &#x27;Victoria&#x27;s Secret Bombshell The Summer Edition&#x27; which is different from the one pictured and listed here. I was disappointed with the sellers mistake and found it a hassle to have to return the product. If you are listing a product for sale, make sure you have the correct item!!! :( basically disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> The scent of this fabulous perfume is sweet, fresh and very summery! I think anyone would fall in love with it! Hey guys, great gift for her, too!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so good.  It sold out at the VS store on 34th street and I was obsessed with the smell from the remaining tester.  What a tease!  After trolling all over Amazon I finally was able to get it.  I received my order today and can&#x27;t wait to wear it to work tomorrow.  I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s no longer summer in NYC!</li>
            <li> I was soooo happy when I found this perfume! I originally brought it during the summer (in combo w/ the body spray) in store. Loved it so much I used it up pretty fast, well very fast!! By the time I emptied the bottle it was sold out in all Victoria Secret locations! Heart broken! I had to order it when I saw it especially for the price! This was actually my 1st time ordering off of Amazon &amp; I was very pleased w/ how fast I got my order.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance! It smells really fresh and grown up. I wore it for the first time today and walked by a couple people and got some head turning. My boyfriend even said during our time alone together that the scent turned him on ;)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on buying this online, but when it came it was sealed and brand new. I&#x27;ll probably never buy from the store again, this is definitely cheaper! It smells pretty good, definitely a summer scent. It has lasted for a while on me so far, still testing it out. Not sure if I would have bought it in the store, but I can&#x27;t complain, it still smells good!</li>
            <li> Awesome scent. I wish Victoria Secret did not discontinue it. same product as in store but it definately much cheaper!</li>
            <li> I had my purse stolen in 2012 with my favorite limited edition summer perfume - this Bombshell Summer. I was so excited to get another bottle! The price was reasonable, shipped quickly, and the smell is just as great as I remember - wonderful initial scent and lingers nicely throughout the day. My only reservation was that the listing said &amp;#34;new in box&amp;#34;, but the box wasn&#x27;t sealed or wrapped in plastic. The bottle appeared full though, so I&#x27;m not overly concerned.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great scent.. think the classic bombshell but with a hint of grapefruit. It&#x27;s very sweet and refreshing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m basing this review of this perfume against the original Victoria&#x27;s Secret Bombshell. This summer edition perfume is smells just like the original bombshell but it has slightly lighter undertones. I&#x27;m not sure what the exact &#x27;smells&#x27; are. All I can say is that if you like the original you will like this one. Would I buy this perfume again? Probably not because it smells pretty close to the original.</li>
            <li> This perfume is not what I&#x27;m used to wearing, but I am in love with the Bombshell collection, so I tried this anyway. It def has a summer ring to it. It is a little overbearing at first, but it tones down after a while. It has a \\&quot;coconut\\&quot;/ \\&quot;tropical\\&quot; smell added on top to the original bombshell. If you like the Bombshell you will like this.</li>
            <li> I work at VS and wanted more bottles of this after the limited edition stopped being shipped to stores. It is the single best perfume I&#x27;ve ever smelled. These bottles were the real ones and the perfume was the real one, not watered down or changed at all. FANTASTIC PRICE too at $25 instead of the normal $50</li>
            <li> I picked this perfume up at a vs outlet store in Orlando. I love this frafrence and use it all the time. It lingers through the day. One of personal favorites vs has put out.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.... Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> It smelled a little weird when I got it, it smelled like the box that it was in for shipping.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan/user of the original VS Bombshell. I smelled the Summer in stores and thought it smelled great as well and decided to change it up. I did not regret it. While I still love Bombshell, this one is great too, and lingers on my skin all day, which is really rare for me. It almost makes my mouth water when I smell it because of the juicy, tropical floral scent. I definitely recommend this edition!</li>
            <li> Came new and in great condition! I was so glad to find this on amazon as VS had it limited edition. It&#x27;s too bad because it really is an awesome fragrance and I can&#x27;t wear too many! Not too fruity, not to flowery, not too heavy. Light and bright.</li>
            <li> Amazing. I&#x27;ve bought it since it came into the stores and every year I&#x27;ve been able to find it on amazon. I get compliments on it all the time, but I have to use it sparingly so it doesn&#x27;t run out so fast. Love this shiz! really great spring/summer smell.</li>
            <li> It is very refreshing and perfect for me. Pricing was cheaper than at VS. Loved that! Will continue to look for Mr perfumes here!</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it was going to be extremely sweet... it turns out its a little more &amp;#34;musty&amp;#34; than fruity.. I probably wouldn&#x27;t reorder this perfume and I actually enjoy the original better..... but I wouldn&#x27;t be able to sleep at night if I didn&#x27;t try it out.&lt;br /&gt;if you have the money to spend and you like the Bombshell perfumes, I&#x27;d say go for it... but if you wanted something really sweet - this probably isn&#x27;t the one for you.</li>
