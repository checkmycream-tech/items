            <li>The oil comes with a pump  which is good for quantity .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d imagine I could smooth it over my body just as well and go around smelling wonderful.</li>

            <li>Smells good and gives my hair a good shine</li>
            <li>I’ve tried Argan oil before and love its properties, but the K&amp;eacute;ralogie has a wonderful blend of oils, most I recognize in one form or another.  </li>
            <li>But after using the product, I&#x27;m happy to report that it is completely believable.  </li>
            <li>But after using the product, I&#x27;m happy to report that it is completely believable.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the performance of the K&amp;eacute;ralogie</li>
            <li>When I was offered a chance to review this product, I was thrilled because I am always looking for a good hair serum to keep my curls moist and controlled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first of all it has one of the best scents in the universe</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>So I think that economically, this is a very good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>Its got a great smell, and makes your hair nice and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I plan on applying a bit on the ends while my hair is damp and then blow drying it - as a heat protector; I think it would lend itself well to this kind of application.    </li>
            <li>Keralogie is packaged in a nice glass bottle, with a locking pump.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;**Product provided in exchange for my honest review</li>
            <li>is very lightweight and is wonderful for controlling flyaway hairs.  </li>
            <li>quarters.&lt;br /&gt;I was given a free sample of the oil for an honest review, and I am happy that the company selected me for a review.</li>
            <li>is the new beautiful hair MUST have!</li>
            <li>so glad I tried it because I really love this product!  </li>
            <li>I can see my hair becoming healthier every day!</li>
            <li>I have many fewer flyaways and my hair is nice and shiny, as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a couple weeks of use, I’m even more than thrilled than I could have ever imagined.</li>
            <li>nice and shiny and smooth without the oily look, and my hair, as I said, smelled amazing.    </li>
            <li>One good thing for many is that the K&amp;eacute;ralogie free of parabens and sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It sounds too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>It sounds too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>All in all a huge win and a company worth watching.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s softer and more manageable and shows more body.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my more favorite beauty finds of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>bottle and a lovely gift for any gal.  </li>
            <li>It also gives it more</li>
            <li>Someone with longer and thicker hair would probably be able to apply more.  </li>
            <li>tried this product hoping it might possibly be able to help my burnt out hair...</li>
            <li>This product was better than I had even dared hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li>There are arrows on the top of the pump telling you which is which.  </li>

            <li>Absolutely love this product and recommend it 100% to all.</li>
            <li>more evenly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A tiny bit of this product on the ends of her hair is an excellent detangler!  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product for review purposes, but I will be buying more when I run out. :)</li>
            <li>My hair is stronger and more luxurious than it’s ever been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Which is probably why I haven&#x27;t been satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>I didn’t use it with damp hair because I wanted a bit more control over the process.  </li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t have as many screaming fits because I am able to come through the tangles.</li>
            <li>I also love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried</li>
            <li>I have tried so many oils on my hair, I think I&#x27;ve become an expert by now.  </li>
            <li>This oil has helped me manage my hair much better.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;am in love with it .</li>
            <li>: I don&#x27;t know who can beat this item I love it .</li>
            <li>It smells lovely...</li>
            <li>Love this oil.</li>
            <li>love argan oil</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how much better the ends of my hair are.  </li>
            <li>I guess the ends not breaking and being healthy makes this happen.  </li>
            <li>My hair is no longer freezy and looks healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this product as it was given sample to me for testing purpose and it is well priced.</li>
            <li>It has a light nice smell to it, buy not so strong that I think it might offend anyone in close</li>
            <li>If you love fragrances, this one is a lovely light one.  </li>
            <li>It has a really nice sweet smell about it, not too strong though.</li>
            <li>Now even when I am not rubbing it in, now my hair is supremely moisturized and bouncy and healthy with fantastic shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I then lightly touch my hands to my hair until most of the oil is on my hair, rather than my palms.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the smell of this on my hair, it is such a nice clean scent, not to overpowering but just very nice.  </li>
            <li>It is very effective hair oil that makes hair flexible and lustrous, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>a single drop--not even a full push on the pump--does it best for me.  </li>
            <li>Also it has an amazing smell which stays with you the whole day!</li>
            <li>fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a connoisseur of laminators and hair serums as my fine, curly hair has a tendency towards both dryness and frizz.</li>
            <li>treatment contains a blend of mostly botanical ingredients:  argan, jojoba, shea, silicone, and macadamia oils, plus a light, sweet fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant and a blend of many oils but is not so overwhelming that it would drown out perfume or other</li>
            <li>in conclusion - this is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>in conclusion - this is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>Paraben, alcohol, SLS free.</li>
            <li>oil is fabulous not just those hoping to avoid chemicals, but for everyone.</li>
            <li>This product is free of alcohol, Parabens, and Sulfates and does nothing but enhance the beauty of my hair.</li>
            <li>Similar to Argan oil, it gave a great sheen and sparkle to my hair.  </li>
            <li>this product, I received a free sample to review but will buy another when it runs out.</li>
            <li>and Thermal Protector, Makes Hair Shiny, Silky, Moisturized, Improves Manageability.&lt;br /&gt;&#x60;Paraben, Alcohol and SLS Free.</li>
            <li>Not only does it make your hair look great</li>
            <li>She applied Keralogie to her damp hair and it turned out shiny and soft and smelled really good.</li>
            <li>My skin and my hair seem to love it and drink it right up.  </li>
            <li>It also dispenses a perfect small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also dispenses a perfect small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Note that when the sealed bottle is originally delivered the siphon dispenser is not yet inserted (see web page images).</li>
            <li>First of all, I just love the scent.  </li>
            <li>My hair smells amazing - not over-powering, but with a definite \\&quot;exotic\\&quot; scent that makes me feel rather sexy, y&#x27;all.    </li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;Keralogie Hair Oil Complex&amp;#34; is kind of an in-between, combining Argan Oil with Shea Oil and a handful of other botanical hair goodnesses to make a nice hair supplement.</li>
            <li>The amazing part is all the ingredients are Natural.</li>
            <li>It might even be a good idea to initially use this fortifying hair treatment without the dispenser until sufficient room has been created to insert the siphon without</li>
            <li>- it does such a good job conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li>This is just the right oil to make my hair soft and wonderful without being all slicked back greaser</li>
            <li>The amber bottle protects the contents from light and the pump dispenses just the right</li>
            <li>/&gt;Keralogie ranks with the best and most expensive products sold in salons.</li>
            <li>The only evidence I had even put anything on my hair was it was soft, smooth, and had a very nice scent to it.  </li>
            <li>This is my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; hair product, I am in love with it.  </li>
            <li>My hair seems, more so lately, to be dry and frizzy with lots of static.</li>
            <li>Hair type: highlighted, very baby fine, below the shoulders    </li>
            <li>So I was happy to try a new product, particularly one with argan oil, as argan oil has done great things for my hair in the past (but is somewhat too expensive to buy on its own, for a really good quality product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By the way -- with what was left on my hands after applying to my ends, I massaged it into my face - felt amazing and didn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause breakouts or irritation.</li>
            <li>My hair and skin love the all natural nutrients it gets from this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to smells and will often not be able to use a product just because of the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>My hair and skin love the all natural nutrients it gets from this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to smells and will often not be able to use a product just because of the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>incident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If hair restoration that banishes dryness is what you seek, then I can recommend this top-quality, long-lasting and economical organic product without reservations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>that I was given a complimentary bottle of this fortifying hair treatment  by the manufacturer for this hopefully unbiased review.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t put it on the roots of my hair because my roots can get oily especially when the weather is warm.  </li>
            <li>All are natural oils I love.  </li>
            <li>Keralogie&#x27;s oil serum is a simple, but effective product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I received a complimentary sample to review.)</li>
            <li>I rarely use anything on my hair,.</li>
            <li>I like it sooo much coz leave my hair very smith and healthy</li>
            <li>I toss this magic juice on my hair after each shower, just a sprinkle and run it through my hair and after a few treatments, I started to notice my hair becoming much easier to manage and also just looked and felt better.  </li>
            <li>, it tames fly aways, improves dry ends and does make your hair very soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Choosing the right shampoo and conditioner helps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a very light scent that I can barely smell once it&#x27;s on...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a very light scent that I can barely smell once it&#x27;s on...</li>
            <li>Wow, this hair treatment was such a pleasant surprise!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and the ends are always kind of dry because I am on medication that affects it.  </li>
            <li>It honestly is instantly more soft and the small is so good I would rather use this than perfume (not kidding).  </li>
            <li>The pump applicator works better because it delivers the right amount without needing to open the bottle and there is no chance of getting the oil on something else like it happens with a spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have now been regularly using this product with a wonderful smell for a little more than two weeks and my hair definitely is less dry and brittle (more flexible) with more of a noticeable sheen to it than it had before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe, but it smells good and clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe, but it smells good and clean.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s affordable, a little product goes a long way, and the scent is very light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s affordable, a little product goes a long way, and the scent is very light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>The pump doesn&#x27;t pop up when it&#x27;s open either, you just slide to one side and you are able to pump.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product and recommend it 100% to all.ost Brazilian Keratin and Japanese treatment product.  </li>
            <li>The pump doesn&#x27;t pop up when it&#x27;s open either, you just slide to one side and you are able to pump.  </li>
            <li>I love that the bottle comes with a pump, which many of the more expensive serums do not.</li>
            <li>At first, it did -</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>The only thing I am not crazy about is that this oil has a strong flowery scent.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is large and is priced fairly as most users would only need 2 to 3 pumps of the product applied to damp hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wasn’t so sure the K&amp;eacute;ralogie would do much for me, especially after checking out the pixie look, but it did.  </li>
            <li>So far I am a happy camper and expect that continued  diligent use of this hair care product will likely yield further positive results.</li>
            <li>The oil/serum is light to medium bodied in the hands and won&#x27;t weigh down fine or medium bodied hair.</li>
            <li>hairdresser recommended that I began using it in my hair because she noticed that the hair on top of my head felt dry.</li>
            <li>She said many of her clients get dry hair from wearing hats in the winter.</li>
            <li>I am now using this lightweight oil rather than pure Moroccan oil.  </li>
            <li>At that rate, this single, generous bottle would last some months, so the price is fair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried a couple of different kinds, from cheap blends to 100% pure oil.</li>
            <li>Even my hands were soft and completely residue free.  </li>
            <li>But it works really well on my ends.*&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>The packaging is very robust and protects the bottle well.  </li>
            <li>I had been using straight argan oil for my hair, until I received this.  </li>
            <li>Straight or curly hair, it softens and shines hair.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that my hair does not grow fast</li>
            <li>My hair is really damaged from bleaching, so a friend of mine recommended this product to me.</li>
            <li>I usually have to cut it all off and have it short again to have my beautiful locks looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don’t dye or treat my hair with anything other than an oil now and then, but was quite pleased with the result.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first few times I squirted out way more than I wanted.</li>
            <li>daughter who has thick and straight waist length hair also used this product and was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>A nice little side-thing to do with this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping Weight: 3.4 ounces and Delivered Super crazy fast and safe look at video plus is Courtesy of KERALOGIE ! !&lt;</li>
            <li>I have dry, fine hair that frizzes and flies everywhere</li>
            <li>Since I have dry to very dry hair, I was very interested in seeing what this fortifying hair treatment by Keralogie might be able to do for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes it really easy to comb through their hair when it is wet.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this is you are older, (I am 47)</li>
            <li>Being this is pure oil, it felt a little oilier to me than other oils I use, but the hair absorbed it nicely and it wasn&#x27;t too oily.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>use this type of product on damp hair and my hair absorbed it easily and air dried to soft spiral curls.</li>
            <li>For those who straighten their hair, I believe that this product would be a good one for protection from use of the round brush and the flat iron.</li>
            <li>Comes in a rather large glass bottle with a pump action application.</li>
            <li>Another thing that I love is that a little goes along way.</li>
            <li>It smells so good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have very baby fine hair, so I was worried Keralogie Hair Oil would weight my hair down and make it stringy.</li>
            <li>It doesn’t take much to get a nice result, just a few drops, so this bottle should last quite some time.  </li>
            <li>I can attest to that, as I dropped into from about 4 feet onto concrete by accident.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finding quality beauty treatments without this chemical is practically impossible, so I was thrilled to get this lovely organic hair treatment as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be very careful when you insert the dispenser since the bottle is generously filled with product</li>
            <li>It is simply amazing Organic Complex of Moroccan Argan Oil, Jojoba Oil, Shea Oil, Natural Keratin and Macadamia Nut Oil.  </li>
            <li>As a dude who is trying to grow out their flow, I always find my hair to look lifeless and super frizzy and dry.  </li>
            <li>Go into any natural hair salon and they will highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My hair never felt so soft in years!</li>
            <li>OK, I have been using this product every other day for the last two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Say goodbye to gels, hair mousse, and styling foams, this simple product from Keralogie is all anyone needs to invisibly and effectively style your hair the way you like it without the obvious tell tale signs that you&#x27;ve spent any time on it.</li>
            <li>However, as I rub it between my hands before use, it warms up and thins out a little, so it is still easy to distribute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, as I rub it between my hands before use, it warms up and thins out a little, so it is still easy to distribute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product does not contain any silicones, parabens, sulfates or any other harsh chemicals like many similar products that are available on the beauty market today.  </li>
            <li>even better, I only need a drop or two each time, so this bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This does have a scent, but I find it to be pleasant and non-irritating (and similar to the fragrances in other hair oils that have fragrances added), and it&#x27;s not very strong</li>
            <li>price being asked is most reasonable in light of the fact that the 100 ml of product provided will last a very long time indeed - even with daily use - since only a few drops on the palm of the hand are needed during each application to the hair roots on the scalp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a constancy almost of soft honey, and just takes a few drops to smooth through your hair.</li>
            <li>It was developed by a group of chemists from USA, Israel and France.</li>
            <li>It really smooths out, brings the shine back, nourishes skin and hair.  </li>
            <li>It really smooths out, brings the shine back, nourishes skin and hair.  </li>
            <li>I have natural hair and having natural hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sticky, but dries soft and doesn&#x27;t work as any sort of hair gel.</li>
            <li>I end by using a natural bristle brush to distribute the oil</li>
            <li>I like the pump action application of the product, which helps me to control the amount I use.</li>
            <li>This product smoothed my hair, calming it and leaving it feeling moisturized and so soft.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so shiny and soft with this product.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I am very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>The key is not to apply too much.</li>
            <li>There is no added fragrance, so this is just the natural aroma of the oils.</li>
            <li>My hair does not break and it is soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I also think that it would be equally useful on both European and African hair types.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using some straight jojoba oil and found it to be OK but not great.</li>
            <li>If you have thick \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot; hair, you may want to try more.</li>
            <li>I will be updating review in the future but think I  will be investing more of this product in the future and will forward to seeing what other products this company will produce.</li>
            <li>Pump out a SMALL amount if you have fine hair like I do.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li>A fine product that should last me for a long long time.    </li>
            <li>Some products work ok but weigh down my fine and slightly wavy hair and make it look limp and oily.</li>
            <li>As a result, I&#x27;m a little more skeptical that most because a lot of the oils claim to do things they never do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The important thing to remember is that this serum is not to be used as a styling product, but in addition to your usual styling products.  </li>
            <li>my next new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And, sure enough, I was forced to change my thinking.  </li>
            <li>However, gray hair is much coarser than non-gray and so much more difficult to manage.  </li>
            <li>better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil has a slightly earthy smell, not overpowering, just a subtle good smell.</li>
            <li>When I first squirted this onto my hands and felt how extremely oily it was, I was horrified.  </li>
            <li>It only took a few pumps to get the product out the first time and now it&#x27;s ready to go every time.  </li>
            <li>It only took a few pumps to get the product out the first time and now it&#x27;s ready to go every time.  </li>
            <li>(For what it&#x27;s worth, my hair is a standard Caucasian texture with a little bit of natural waviness.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get frizzy and even the condition of the ends is improving (I don&#x27;t get split ends, but they seem to be frizzier than the rest of my hair, generally speaking).</li>
            <li>Moreover, it is natural enough to be used on children’s hair.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Moreover, it is natural enough to be used on children’s hair.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use this product on a lot of different things for example, I have natural hair.</li>
            <li>A few drops actually helps soften the whole thing up and makes it much shinier than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was absolutely amazed at how the oil transferred to my hair and, after a few strokes, was completely absorbed leaving absolutely no residue at all.  </li>
            <li>I applied a small amount from about midway down my hair to the ends to smooth fly-aways, and my hair did look rather stringy at first; however, I brushed it through thoroughly and let it \\&quot;sink in\\&quot; for a minute or so, fluffed my hair, and voila!</li>
            <li>developed more shine without greasiness added , un-like some other oil treatment products I have used in the recent past .</li>
            <li>Most of the argan oils or similar oils that I&#x27;ve tried in the past come in tiny bottles that last a very short amount of time.  </li>
            <li>It’s not flowery, but rather delicate and sweet.  </li>
            <li>While the serum will feel heavy and oily in your hands, once it&#x27;s applied to your hair it leaves it smooth and silky, but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>was hesitant to try at first because my daughter and I both have fine hair, and I was afraid this treatment would make our hair fall flat and lose volume, which sometimes happens with oils and conditioners.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always believed that hair oil would make my fine, thin hair look greasy.  </li>
            <li>My hair is 84 years old, very dry and getting thinner</li>
            <li>live in a dry climate, or have dry heat such as a wood stove.  </li>

            <li> Smells good and gives my hair a good shine</li>
            <li> I’ve tried Argan oil before and love its properties, but the K&amp;eacute;ralogie has a wonderful blend of oils, most I recognize in one form or another.  </li>
            <li> But after using the product, I&#x27;m happy to report that it is completely believable.  </li>

            <li> When I was offered a chance to review this product, I was thrilled because I am always looking for a good hair serum to keep my curls moist and controlled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> Its got a great smell, and makes your hair nice and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I plan on applying a bit on the ends while my hair is damp and then blow drying it - as a heat protector; I think it would lend itself well to this kind of application.    </li>
            <li> Keralogie is packaged in a nice glass bottle, with a locking pump.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;**Product provided in exchange for my honest review</li>

            <li> so glad I tried it because I really love this product!  </li>

            <li> bottle and a lovely gift for any gal.  </li>
            <li> It also gives it more</li>
            <li> Someone with longer and thicker hair would probably be able to apply more.  </li>
            <li> tried this product hoping it might possibly be able to help my burnt out hair...</li>
            <li> This product was better than I had even dared hoped it would be.  </li>

            <li> more evenly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A tiny bit of this product on the ends of her hair is an excellent detangler!  </li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product for review purposes, but I will be buying more when I run out. :)</li>
            <li> My hair is stronger and more luxurious than it’s ever been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which is probably why I haven&#x27;t been satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> I didn’t use it with damp hair because I wanted a bit more control over the process.  </li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t have as many screaming fits because I am able to come through the tangles.</li>
            <li> I also love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried</li>
            <li> I have tried so many oils on my hair, I think I&#x27;ve become an expert by now.  </li>

            <li> I am in love with this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;am in love with it .</li>
            <li> : I don&#x27;t know who can beat this item I love it .</li>
            <li> It smells lovely...</li>
            <li> Love this oil.</li>
            <li> love argan oil</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much better the ends of my hair are.  </li>
            <li> I guess the ends not breaking and being healthy makes this happen.  </li>
            <li> My hair is no longer freezy and looks healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this product as it was given sample to me for testing purpose and it is well priced.</li>
            <li> It has a light nice smell to it, buy not so strong that I think it might offend anyone in close</li>
            <li> If you love fragrances, this one is a lovely light one.  </li>
            <li> It has a really nice sweet smell about it, not too strong though.</li>
            <li> Now even when I am not rubbing it in, now my hair is supremely moisturized and bouncy and healthy with fantastic shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then lightly touch my hands to my hair until most of the oil is on my hair, rather than my palms.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the smell of this on my hair, it is such a nice clean scent, not to overpowering but just very nice.  </li>
            <li> It is very effective hair oil that makes hair flexible and lustrous, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> a single drop--not even a full push on the pump--does it best for me.  </li>
            <li> Also it has an amazing smell which stays with you the whole day!</li>
            <li> fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a connoisseur of laminators and hair serums as my fine, curly hair has a tendency towards both dryness and frizz.</li>
            <li> treatment contains a blend of mostly botanical ingredients:  argan, jojoba, shea, silicone, and macadamia oils, plus a light, sweet fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is pleasant and a blend of many oils but is not so overwhelming that it would drown out perfume or other</li>
            <li> in conclusion - this is a fabulous product.  </li>

            <li> Paraben, alcohol, SLS free.</li>
            <li> oil is fabulous not just those hoping to avoid chemicals, but for everyone.</li>
            <li> This product is free of alcohol, Parabens, and Sulfates and does nothing but enhance the beauty of my hair.</li>
            <li> Similar to Argan oil, it gave a great sheen and sparkle to my hair.  </li>

            <li> and Thermal Protector, Makes Hair Shiny, Silky, Moisturized, Improves Manageability.&lt;br /&gt;&#x60;Paraben, Alcohol and SLS Free.</li>
            <li> Not only does it make your hair look great</li>
            <li> She applied Keralogie to her damp hair and it turned out shiny and soft and smelled really good.</li>
            <li> My skin and my hair seem to love it and drink it right up.  </li>
            <li> It also dispenses a perfect small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also dispenses a perfect small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Note that when the sealed bottle is originally delivered the siphon dispenser is not yet inserted (see web page images).</li>
            <li> First of all, I just love the scent.  </li>
            <li> My hair smells amazing - not over-powering, but with a definite \\&quot;exotic\\&quot; scent that makes me feel rather sexy, y&#x27;all.    </li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;Keralogie Hair Oil Complex&amp;#34; is kind of an in-between, combining Argan Oil with Shea Oil and a handful of other botanical hair goodnesses to make a nice hair supplement.</li>
            <li> The amazing part is all the ingredients are Natural.</li>
            <li> It might even be a good idea to initially use this fortifying hair treatment without the dispenser until sufficient room has been created to insert the siphon without</li>
            <li> - it does such a good job conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> This is just the right oil to make my hair soft and wonderful without being all slicked back greaser</li>
            <li> The amber bottle protects the contents from light and the pump dispenses just the right</li>
            <li> /&gt;Keralogie ranks with the best and most expensive products sold in salons.</li>
            <li> The only evidence I had even put anything on my hair was it was soft, smooth, and had a very nice scent to it.  </li>
            <li> This is my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; hair product, I am in love with it.  </li>
            <li> My hair seems, more so lately, to be dry and frizzy with lots of static.</li>
            <li> Hair type: highlighted, very baby fine, below the shoulders    </li>
            <li> So I was happy to try a new product, particularly one with argan oil, as argan oil has done great things for my hair in the past (but is somewhat too expensive to buy on its own, for a really good quality product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By the way -- with what was left on my hands after applying to my ends, I massaged it into my face - felt amazing and didn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause breakouts or irritation.</li>
            <li> My hair and skin love the all natural nutrients it gets from this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to smells and will often not be able to use a product just because of the way it smells.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to smells and will often not be able to use a product just because of the way it smells.  </li>
            <li> incident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If hair restoration that banishes dryness is what you seek, then I can recommend this top-quality, long-lasting and economical organic product without reservations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> that I was given a complimentary bottle of this fortifying hair treatment  by the manufacturer for this hopefully unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t put it on the roots of my hair because my roots can get oily especially when the weather is warm.  </li>
            <li> All are natural oils I love.  </li>
            <li> Keralogie&#x27;s oil serum is a simple, but effective product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I received a complimentary sample to review.)</li>
            <li> I rarely use anything on my hair,.</li>
            <li> I like it sooo much coz leave my hair very smith and healthy</li>
            <li> I toss this magic juice on my hair after each shower, just a sprinkle and run it through my hair and after a few treatments, I started to notice my hair becoming much easier to manage and also just looked and felt better.  </li>
            <li> , it tames fly aways, improves dry ends and does make your hair very soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Choosing the right shampoo and conditioner helps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a very light scent that I can barely smell once it&#x27;s on...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a very light scent that I can barely smell once it&#x27;s on...</li>
            <li> Wow, this hair treatment was such a pleasant surprise!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and the ends are always kind of dry because I am on medication that affects it.  </li>
            <li> It honestly is instantly more soft and the small is so good I would rather use this than perfume (not kidding).  </li>
            <li> The pump applicator works better because it delivers the right amount without needing to open the bottle and there is no chance of getting the oil on something else like it happens with a spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have now been regularly using this product with a wonderful smell for a little more than two weeks and my hair definitely is less dry and brittle (more flexible) with more of a noticeable sheen to it than it had before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe, but it smells good and clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe, but it smells good and clean.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s affordable, a little product goes a long way, and the scent is very light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s affordable, a little product goes a long way, and the scent is very light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t pop up when it&#x27;s open either, you just slide to one side and you are able to pump.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product and recommend it 100% to all.ost Brazilian Keratin and Japanese treatment product.  </li>
            <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t pop up when it&#x27;s open either, you just slide to one side and you are able to pump.  </li>
            <li> I love that the bottle comes with a pump, which many of the more expensive serums do not.</li>
            <li> At first, it did -</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> The only thing I am not crazy about is that this oil has a strong flowery scent.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is large and is priced fairly as most users would only need 2 to 3 pumps of the product applied to damp hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wasn’t so sure the K&amp;eacute;ralogie would do much for me, especially after checking out the pixie look, but it did.  </li>
            <li> So far I am a happy camper and expect that continued  diligent use of this hair care product will likely yield further positive results.</li>
            <li> The oil/serum is light to medium bodied in the hands and won&#x27;t weigh down fine or medium bodied hair.</li>
            <li> hairdresser recommended that I began using it in my hair because she noticed that the hair on top of my head felt dry.</li>
            <li> She said many of her clients get dry hair from wearing hats in the winter.</li>
            <li> I am now using this lightweight oil rather than pure Moroccan oil.  </li>
            <li> At that rate, this single, generous bottle would last some months, so the price is fair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried a couple of different kinds, from cheap blends to 100% pure oil.</li>
            <li> Even my hands were soft and completely residue free.  </li>
            <li> But it works really well on my ends.*&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> The packaging is very robust and protects the bottle well.  </li>
            <li> I had been using straight argan oil for my hair, until I received this.  </li>
            <li> Straight or curly hair, it softens and shines hair.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that my hair does not grow fast</li>
            <li> My hair is really damaged from bleaching, so a friend of mine recommended this product to me.</li>
            <li> I usually have to cut it all off and have it short again to have my beautiful locks looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don’t dye or treat my hair with anything other than an oil now and then, but was quite pleased with the result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first few times I squirted out way more than I wanted.</li>
            <li> daughter who has thick and straight waist length hair also used this product and was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> A nice little side-thing to do with this product!</li>

            <li> I have dry, fine hair that frizzes and flies everywhere</li>
            <li> Since I have dry to very dry hair, I was very interested in seeing what this fortifying hair treatment by Keralogie might be able to do for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes it really easy to comb through their hair when it is wet.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this is you are older, (I am 47)</li>
            <li> Being this is pure oil, it felt a little oilier to me than other oils I use, but the hair absorbed it nicely and it wasn&#x27;t too oily.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> use this type of product on damp hair and my hair absorbed it easily and air dried to soft spiral curls.</li>
            <li> For those who straighten their hair, I believe that this product would be a good one for protection from use of the round brush and the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Comes in a rather large glass bottle with a pump action application.</li>
            <li> Another thing that I love is that a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have very baby fine hair, so I was worried Keralogie Hair Oil would weight my hair down and make it stringy.</li>
            <li> It doesn’t take much to get a nice result, just a few drops, so this bottle should last quite some time.  </li>
            <li> I can attest to that, as I dropped into from about 4 feet onto concrete by accident.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finding quality beauty treatments without this chemical is practically impossible, so I was thrilled to get this lovely organic hair treatment as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be very careful when you insert the dispenser since the bottle is generously filled with product</li>
            <li> It is simply amazing Organic Complex of Moroccan Argan Oil, Jojoba Oil, Shea Oil, Natural Keratin and Macadamia Nut Oil.  </li>
            <li> As a dude who is trying to grow out their flow, I always find my hair to look lifeless and super frizzy and dry.  </li>
            <li> Go into any natural hair salon and they will highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hair never felt so soft in years!</li>
            <li> OK, I have been using this product every other day for the last two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Say goodbye to gels, hair mousse, and styling foams, this simple product from Keralogie is all anyone needs to invisibly and effectively style your hair the way you like it without the obvious tell tale signs that you&#x27;ve spent any time on it.</li>
            <li> However, as I rub it between my hands before use, it warms up and thins out a little, so it is still easy to distribute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, as I rub it between my hands before use, it warms up and thins out a little, so it is still easy to distribute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product does not contain any silicones, parabens, sulfates or any other harsh chemicals like many similar products that are available on the beauty market today.  </li>
            <li> even better, I only need a drop or two each time, so this bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This does have a scent, but I find it to be pleasant and non-irritating (and similar to the fragrances in other hair oils that have fragrances added), and it&#x27;s not very strong</li>
            <li> price being asked is most reasonable in light of the fact that the 100 ml of product provided will last a very long time indeed - even with daily use - since only a few drops on the palm of the hand are needed during each application to the hair roots on the scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a constancy almost of soft honey, and just takes a few drops to smooth through your hair.</li>
            <li> It was developed by a group of chemists from USA, Israel and France.</li>
            <li> It really smooths out, brings the shine back, nourishes skin and hair.  </li>
            <li> It really smooths out, brings the shine back, nourishes skin and hair.  </li>
            <li> I have natural hair and having natural hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky, but dries soft and doesn&#x27;t work as any sort of hair gel.</li>
            <li> I end by using a natural bristle brush to distribute the oil</li>
            <li> I like the pump action application of the product, which helps me to control the amount I use.</li>
            <li> This product smoothed my hair, calming it and leaving it feeling moisturized and so soft.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so shiny and soft with this product.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I am very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> The key is not to apply too much.</li>
            <li> There is no added fragrance, so this is just the natural aroma of the oils.</li>
            <li> My hair does not break and it is soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I also think that it would be equally useful on both European and African hair types.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using some straight jojoba oil and found it to be OK but not great.</li>
            <li> If you have thick \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot; hair, you may want to try more.</li>
            <li> I will be updating review in the future but think I  will be investing more of this product in the future and will forward to seeing what other products this company will produce.</li>
            <li> Pump out a SMALL amount if you have fine hair like I do.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li> A fine product that should last me for a long long time.    </li>
            <li> Some products work ok but weigh down my fine and slightly wavy hair and make it look limp and oily.</li>
            <li> As a result, I&#x27;m a little more skeptical that most because a lot of the oils claim to do things they never do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The important thing to remember is that this serum is not to be used as a styling product, but in addition to your usual styling products.  </li>
            <li> my next new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, sure enough, I was forced to change my thinking.  </li>
            <li> However, gray hair is much coarser than non-gray and so much more difficult to manage.  </li>
            <li> better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil has a slightly earthy smell, not overpowering, just a subtle good smell.</li>
            <li> When I first squirted this onto my hands and felt how extremely oily it was, I was horrified.  </li>
            <li> It only took a few pumps to get the product out the first time and now it&#x27;s ready to go every time.  </li>
            <li> It only took a few pumps to get the product out the first time and now it&#x27;s ready to go every time.  </li>
            <li> (For what it&#x27;s worth, my hair is a standard Caucasian texture with a little bit of natural waviness.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get frizzy and even the condition of the ends is improving (I don&#x27;t get split ends, but they seem to be frizzier than the rest of my hair, generally speaking).</li>
            <li> Moreover, it is natural enough to be used on children’s hair.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Moreover, it is natural enough to be used on children’s hair.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use this product on a lot of different things for example, I have natural hair.</li>
            <li> A few drops actually helps soften the whole thing up and makes it much shinier than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was absolutely amazed at how the oil transferred to my hair and, after a few strokes, was completely absorbed leaving absolutely no residue at all.  </li>
            <li> I applied a small amount from about midway down my hair to the ends to smooth fly-aways, and my hair did look rather stringy at first; however, I brushed it through thoroughly and let it \\&quot;sink in\\&quot; for a minute or so, fluffed my hair, and voila!</li>
            <li> developed more shine without greasiness added , un-like some other oil treatment products I have used in the recent past .</li>
            <li> Most of the argan oils or similar oils that I&#x27;ve tried in the past come in tiny bottles that last a very short amount of time.  </li>
            <li> It’s not flowery, but rather delicate and sweet.  </li>
            <li> While the serum will feel heavy and oily in your hands, once it&#x27;s applied to your hair it leaves it smooth and silky, but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was hesitant to try at first because my daughter and I both have fine hair, and I was afraid this treatment would make our hair fall flat and lose volume, which sometimes happens with oils and conditioners.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always believed that hair oil would make my fine, thin hair look greasy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is 84 years old, very dry and getting thinner</li>
            <li> live in a dry climate, or have dry heat such as a wood stove.  </li>
            <li> it can get really dry like almost on daily bases , when I first touched the oil with a few drops as directed on palm of hands</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m extremely against having oily, weighed down hair.  </li>
            <li> I also like that it comes with the pump, makes it so much easier to use, and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this organic complex of Moroccan Argan oil, Jojoba oil, Shea oil and Macadamia oil which is free of alcohol, parabens and sulfates did not let me down with regard to improving the overall condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s actually noticeably different from the first use.  </li>
            <li> and so when it&#x27;s long - the ends will turn blonde and be all frizzy/fried out.  </li>
            <li> I like taking a big long whiff of my wife&#x27;s hair after she puts this</li>
            <li> The bottle is quite generously sized and it will last you a long time --</li>
            <li> The bottle is quite generously sized and it will last you a long time --</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny and after my hair is flat ironed...</li>
            <li> My wife and I both got used to it quickly enough, but its something to be careful of.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer than it has been for a long time.</li>
            <li> Indeed, I still had to put my normal styling products in my hair to get my usual look.  </li>
            <li> &quot; long on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;luxurious 😊😉 , plus the Ingredients Argania Spinoska Kernel oil, Simmondsia chinesis (Jojoba) Seed oil, Butyrosperminum Parkil (Shea) oil, Dimethocone, Macadamia Intergrifolia Seed oil, Exclusive Fragrance - and natural \\&quot; made this miracle happen for me ladies buy for yourself and buy a few to get for others as gifts .&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hairdresser said it can be applied to dry hair or wet hair with the same effectiveness.</li>
            <li> not sure how other oils can even do much for your hair considering the additives in them.</li>
            <li> It is also works extremely well as a post Brazilian Keratin and Japanese treatment product.  </li>
            <li> Slide back to the other side and you cannot.  </li>
            <li> Slide back to the other side and you cannot.  </li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s going to last a long time given that you only need to use a few drops each time.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dry and color-treated.</li>
            <li> I let my hair dry overnight.</li>
            <li> I use the oils after I get out of the shower and towel dry my hair and then apply it to my damp hair.</li>
            <li> After I began using argan oil she told me my dry hair was gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This treatment has solved the problem of the dry ends.  </li>
            <li> I simply poured a few drops in my hands and worked it through my short hair.  </li>
            <li> I only use this on the ends of my hair and it cuts down my blow drying time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wet my hair but used it on my dry hair.</li>
            <li> It works the same way for me, helps detangle my hair and leaves it shiny and less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;*I</li>
            <li> Personally, I have also found that this oil formulation works well in combination with a little bit of leave-in hair conditioner after a</li>
            <li> I like the smell, although I personally wish it were a little stronger.</li>
            <li> For the last few weeks, each night before I went to sleep</li>
            <li> only put this product on the ends of my hair, since they get dried out.  </li>
            <li> Just a few drops judiciously applied to damp hair and then brushed throughout</li>
            <li> I use it after every wash while my hair is still wet and also put another coat after I&#x27;m done with styling it.</li>
            <li> a little of this goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li> a little of this goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li> But a little goes a long way for us finer-haired folks.    </li>
            <li> The mixture of the other oils just makes this all the</li>
            <li> added advantage of this product is that it is about half the price of the other oil</li>
            <li> You use very little of the oil to get the desired effect, so you definitely don&#x27;t want to waste it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample</li>
            <li> It is not worth $4, imho.</li>
            <li> If it worked this well for my oily, thick, dark hair with sun damage, I can only imagine how well it would work from product fried, frizz-proned hair.  </li>
            <li> If it worked this well for my oily, thick, dark hair with sun damage, I can only imagine how well it would work from product fried, frizz-proned hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and down to my waist, but because of the dryness (and the cold weather we&#x27;ve been having in Georgia lately), it hasn&#x27;t been in good condition at all lately.</li>
            <li> My thick, long, dark hair does get bleached out by the sun though</li>
            <li> but I get a slight whiff every once in a while</li>
            <li> but I get a slight whiff every once in a while</li>
            <li> Those with heavier or coarser hair would need an additional half pump of the product for coverage.</li>
            <li> of my previous anti-frizz products like John Frieda or Pantene serum work too well in this moisture laden air.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed that my hair is softer, smoother and has less flyaways.  </li>
            <li> , so you use less when using the pump rather than tipping the bottle into your hand.  </li>
            <li> I previously used a spray and a eye dropper applicators.</li>
            <li> I apply this product to damp towel dried hair and typically start at the ends and then go to the scalp so that it does not get too oily and weighed down.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that has been colored and treated with keratin...</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t go on heavy or weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I usually shampoo my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> this in mind, I&#x27;ve been trying this hair product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> and it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> A few drops does not make the hair look or feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I do have a lot of stiff gray in it and was hoping it would soften it out.  </li>
            <li> After a shower or bath, I put a small amount on my hands and run it through the ends of my daughter&#x27;s hair, and my hair.  </li>
            <li> it’s sometimes difficult to soften it, perhaps similar to those with split end issues.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like scented products but</li>
            <li> that long expensive process that makes hair sleek and shiny.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to find products / oil that agrees with your hair.  </li>
            <li> Organic Complex of the following&lt;br</li>
            <li> You might think with all the oils (Organic complex of Moroccan Argan Oil, Shea Oil, Jojoba Oil and Macadamia Oil) that it would leave your hair oily but</li>

            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the pump a little difficult to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was doubtful it would work and thought it might weigh down my hair like other products.</li>
            <li> KERALOGIE Complex Oil is THE OMG hair treatment for me!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product because I have oily skin and my hair can get oily too.  </li>

            <li> For the last few weeks, each night before I went to sleep I&#x27;d coat my hair in this oil, rubbing it in to a brilliant shine.  Now even when I am not rubbing it in, now my hair is supremely moisturized and bouncy and healthy with fantastic shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s softer and more manageable and shows more body.  Basically, it&#x27;s vitamins and health for your hair!  I mean, it&#x27;s actually noticeably different from the first use.  It honestly is instantly more soft and the small is so good I would rather use this than perfume (not kidding).  I get compliments.  It also tames split ends. This is one of my more favorite beauty finds of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice bottle and a lovely gift for any gal.  Fits in a stocking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very fine oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, rub on damp hair and let it soak in.  I brush it through&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hair oil provided by keralogie</li>
            <li> I always believed that hair oil would make my fine, thin hair look greasy.  Then I had a conversation with--of all people--my dental hygienist.  She has similar type hair.  She says she uses hair oil all the time.  So I gave this product a try.  And, sure enough, I was forced to change my thinking.  This product leaves my hair feeling fuller.  It also gives it more body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a single drop--not even a full push on the pump--does it best for me.  Someone with longer and thicker hair would probably be able to apply more.  I wash my hair every day, but I don&#x27;t even need to use this oil every time.  Smells great, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a sample product from Keralogie.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product because I have oily skin and my hair can get oily too.  Because of this, I&#x27;ve learnt to stay away from oil-type beauty products.  My thick, long, dark hair does get bleached out by the sun though and so when it&#x27;s long - the ends will turn blonde and be all frizzy/fried out.  I usually have to cut it all off and have it short again to have my beautiful locks looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not anymore!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product hoping it might possibly be able to help my burnt out hair...and it did.  This product was better than I had even dared hoped it would be.  First off, I&#x27;m extremely against having oily, weighed down hair.  When I first squirted this onto my hands and felt how extremely oily it was, I was horrified.  &amp;#34;Oh no....this isn&#x27;t going to be good.&amp;#34;  But I rubbed my hands together and then ran it through my hair several times.  I was absolutely amazed at how the oil transferred to my hair and, after a few strokes, was completely absorbed leaving absolutely no residue at all.  The only evidence I had even put anything on my hair was it was soft, smooth, and had a very nice scent to it.  Even my hands were soft and completely residue free.  No oiliness at all!!  It&#x27;s absolutely amazing.  My skin and my hair seem to love it and drink it right up.  Here is the information they sent me :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;We are the manufacture of a great hair oil treatment. It is simply amazing Organic Complex of Moroccan Argan Oil, Jojoba Oil, Shea Oil, Natural Keratin and Macadamia Nut Oil.  The amazing part is all the ingredients are Natural. The product does not contain any silicones, parabens, sulfates or any other harsh chemicals like many similar products that are available on the beauty market today.  It was developed by a group of chemists from USA, Israel and France. The packaging is done in the USA.  It is very effective hair oil that makes hair flexible and lustrous, soft and manageable. It is also works extremely well as a post Brazilian Keratin and Japanese treatment product.  Moreover, it is natural enough to be used on children’s hair.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always read these with a grain of salt.  It sounds too good to be true.  But after using the product, I&#x27;m happy to report that it is completely believable.  My hair and skin love the all natural nutrients it gets from this product and they are thriving now because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second big worry was smell.  I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to smells and will often not be able to use a product just because of the way it smells.  I love the smell of this product.  It&#x27;s hard to describe, but it smells good and clean.  It&#x27;s also a very light scent that I can barely smell once it&#x27;s on...but I get a slight whiff every once in a while and I want more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is very good.  It comes as you see in the pictures.  The bottle is sealed with a cap and sticker and the pump is provided in the box.  Put the pump on and just slide the pump to turn it on/off.  No twisting over and over and over again just to get the pump open.  The pump doesn&#x27;t pop up when it&#x27;s open either, you just slide to one side and you are able to pump.  Slide back to the other side and you cannot.  There are arrows on the top of the pump telling you which is which.  It only took a few pumps to get the product out the first time and now it&#x27;s ready to go every time.  The pump is good quality and reliable.  It also dispenses a perfect small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion - this is a fabulous product.  If it worked this well for my oily, thick, dark hair with sun damage, I can only imagine how well it would work from product fried, frizz-proned hair.  It really smooths out, brings the shine back, nourishes skin and hair.  It works, it&#x27;s affordable, a little product goes a long way, and the scent is very light and pleasant.  I can&#x27;t think of any reason to not get it.  Absolutely love this product and recommend it 100% to all.ost Brazilian Keratin and Japanese treatment product.

            <li> Since I have dry to very dry hair, I was very interested in seeing what this fortifying hair treatment by Keralogie might be able to do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this organic complex of Moroccan Argan oil, Jojoba oil, Shea oil and Macadamia oil which is free of alcohol, parabens and sulfates did not let me down with regard to improving the overall condition of my hair. I have now been regularly using this product with a wonderful smell for a little more than two weeks and my hair definitely is less dry and brittle (more flexible) with more of a noticeable sheen to it than it had before. So far I am a happy camper and expect that continued  diligent use of this hair care product will likely yield further positive results. Personally, I have also found that this oil formulation works well in combination with a little bit of leave-in hair conditioner after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price being asked is most reasonable in light of the fact that the 100 ml of product provided will last a very long time indeed - even with daily use - since only a few drops on the palm of the hand are needed during each application to the hair roots on the scalp. Note that when the sealed bottle is originally delivered the siphon dispenser is not yet inserted (see web page images). Be very careful when you insert the dispenser since the bottle is generously filled with product and you will very likely lose some of it to overflow during this process. It might even be a good idea to initially use this fortifying hair treatment without the dispenser until sufficient room has been created to insert the siphon without incident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If hair restoration that banishes dryness is what you seek, then I can recommend this top-quality, long-lasting and economical organic product without reservations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that I was given a complimentary bottle of this fortifying hair treatment  by the manufacturer for this hopefully unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and having natural hair it&#x27;s hard to find products / oil that agrees with your hair.  I didn&#x27;t wet my hair but used it on my dry hair. The oil comes with a pump  which is good for quantity . It didn&#x27;t go on heavy or weigh my hair down.  It smells so good and a little goes a long way. I will be updating review in the future but think I  will be investing more of this product in the future and will forward to seeing what other products this company will produce.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a connoisseur of laminators and hair serums as my fine, curly hair has a tendency towards both dryness and frizz. I&#x27;ve tried them all from Citre Shine at the drug store to argan oil and BioSilk and Chi Organics and everything in between. When I was offered a chance to review this product, I was thrilled because I am always looking for a good hair serum to keep my curls moist and controlled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keralogie ranks with the best and most expensive products sold in salons. I love that the bottle comes with a pump, which many of the more expensive serums do not. The oil/serum is light to medium bodied in the hands and won&#x27;t weigh down fine or medium bodied hair. Those with heavier or coarser hair would need an additional half pump of the product for coverage. The fragrance is pleasant and a blend of many oils but is not so overwhelming that it would drown out perfume or other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this type of product on damp hair and my hair absorbed it easily and air dried to soft spiral curls. For those who straighten their hair, I believe that this product would be a good one for protection from use of the round brush and the flat iron. The bottle is large and is priced fairly as most users would only need 2 to 3 pumps of the product applied to damp hair. At that rate, this single, generous bottle would last some months, so the price is fair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to lovers and users of hair oils and serums. I also think that it would be equally useful on both European and African hair types. All in all a huge win and a company worth watching.</li>
            <li> My wife loves Moroccan Argan Oil, and I have come to be a fan of it too. Its got a great smell, and makes your hair nice and silky smooth. We&#x27;ve tried a couple of different kinds, from cheap blends to 100% pure oil. This &amp;#34;Keralogie Hair Oil Complex&amp;#34; is kind of an in-between, combining Argan Oil with Shea Oil and a handful of other botanical hair goodnesses to make a nice hair supplement. I like that I recognize all the ingredients on the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a constancy almost of soft honey, and just takes a few drops to smooth through your hair. It&#x27;s sticky, but dries soft and doesn&#x27;t work as any sort of hair gel. I like the smell, although I personally wish it were a little stronger. It&#x27;s just a feint hint of Argan Oil.  I like taking a big long whiff of my wife&#x27;s hair after she puts this in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the pump a little difficult to use. The first few times I squirted out way more than I wanted. My wife and I both got used to it quickly enough, but its something to be careful of. You use very little of the oil to get the desired effect, so you definitely don&#x27;t want to waste it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> As a dude who is trying to grow out their flow, I always find my hair to look lifeless and super frizzy and dry.  I toss this magic juice on my hair after each shower, just a sprinkle and run it through my hair and after a few treatments, I started to notice my hair becoming much easier to manage and also just looked and felt better.  It may be a lot to spend on your hair, but it works.  Give it a shot.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and color-treated. It&#x27;s thick and down to my waist, but because of the dryness (and the cold weather we&#x27;ve been having in Georgia lately), it hasn&#x27;t been in good condition at all lately. Choosing the right shampoo and conditioner helps. Air drying my hair helps. Detangling sprays help. But I still need something to restore shine and control frizz and flyaways. (For what it&#x27;s worth, my hair is a standard Caucasian texture with a little bit of natural waviness.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using some straight jojoba oil and found it to be OK but not great. So I was happy to try a new product, particularly one with argan oil, as argan oil has done great things for my hair in the past (but is somewhat too expensive to buy on its own, for a really good quality product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with this hair oil. Here&#x27;s the procedure I use: I shampoo and condition my hair at night, spray with a detangling spray and use a detangling brush to work the detangling spray through my hair. I let my hair dry overnight. Then, in the morning, I brush with the detangling brush again. I take one pump of this Keralogie hair oil and spread it out over the palms of my hands. I then lightly touch my hands to my hair until most of the oil is on my hair, rather than my palms. I end by using a natural bristle brush to distribute the oil more evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a finishing touch, this is great. My hair is softer than it has been for a long time. It doesn&#x27;t get frizzy and even the condition of the ends is improving (I don&#x27;t get split ends, but they seem to be frizzier than the rest of my hair, generally speaking). I have many fewer flyaways and my hair is nice and shiny, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does have a scent, but I find it to be pleasant and non-irritating (and similar to the fragrances in other hair oils that have fragrances added), and it&#x27;s not very strong so it won&#x27;t interfere with any fragrance you were planning to wear. This has a thick texture, almost gel-like, but not quite. However, as I rub it between my hands before use, it warms up and thins out a little, so it is still easy to distribute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this only contains plant oils. While I don&#x27;t necessarily avoid silicones in hair products, I know there are a lot of people who do, and this is silicone-free. The bottle is quite generously sized and it will last you a long time -- a little of this goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.not quite.

            <li> Hair type: highlighted, very baby fine, below the shoulders    Comes in a rather large glass bottle with a pump action application. Organic argan oil, jojoba, shea oil, and macadamia oil. Paraben, alcohol, SLS free. Pump out a SMALL amount if you have fine hair like I do. If you have thick \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot; hair, you may want to try more. But a little goes a long way for us finer-haired folks.    I&#x27;d use this product just for the scent! My hair smells amazing - not over-powering, but with a definite \\&quot;exotic\\&quot; scent that makes me feel rather sexy, y&#x27;all.    I have very baby fine hair, so I was worried Keralogie Hair Oil would weight my hair down and make it stringy. At first, it did - I applied a small amount from about midway down my hair to the ends to smooth fly-aways, and my hair did look rather stringy at first; however, I brushed it through thoroughly and let it \\&quot;sink in\\&quot; for a minute or so, fluffed my hair, and voila! nice and shiny and smooth without the oily look, and my hair, as I said, smelled amazing.    I plan on applying a bit on the ends while my hair is damp and then blow drying it - as a heat protector; I think it would lend itself well to this kind of application.    I like the pump action application of the product, which helps me to control the amount I use. As well, I appreciate the quantity for the price. A fine product that should last me for a long long time.    By the way -- with what was left on my hands after applying to my ends, I massaged it into my face - felt amazing and didn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause breakouts or irritation. A nice little side-thing to do with this product! I&#x27;d imagine I could smooth it over my body just as well and go around smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li> Wow, this hair treatment was such a pleasant surprise!&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to try at first because my daughter and I both have fine hair, and I was afraid this treatment would make our hair fall flat and lose volume, which sometimes happens with oils and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I tried it because I really love this product!  After a shower or bath, I put a small amount on my hands and run it through the ends of my daughter&#x27;s hair, and my hair.  My daughter gets a lot of tangles in her hair and she hates when I try to brush them out.  A tiny bit of this product on the ends of her hair is an excellent detangler!  The knots just slide out.  It works the same way for me, helps detangle my hair and leaves it shiny and less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;*I only put this product on the ends of my hair, since they get dried out.  I can&#x27;t put it on the roots of my hair because my roots can get oily especially when the weather is warm.  But it works really well on my ends.*&lt;br /&gt;And even better, I only need a drop or two each time, so this bottle will last a long time.  I received a sample of this product for review purposes, but I will be buying more when I run out. :)</li>
            <li> As a sufferer of migraines, I can’t use anything with parabens. Finding quality beauty treatments without this chemical is practically impossible, so I was thrilled to get this lovely organic hair treatment as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results after one treatment were remarkable. The mixture of oils actually feeds the hair, making it healthier not just in appearance but structure. After a couple weeks of use, I’m even more than thrilled than I could have ever imagined. My hair is stronger and more luxurious than it’s ever been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is fabulous not just those hoping to avoid chemicals, but for everyone.</li>
            <li> KERALOGIE Complex Oil is THE OMG hair treatment for me! I have dry, fine hair that frizzes and flies everywhere but where I want it. This product smoothed my hair, calming it and leaving it feeling moisturized and so soft. I can&#x27;t remember when my hair felt so silky soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how other oils can even do much for your hair considering the additives in them. Which is probably why I haven&#x27;t been satisfied with them. This product is free of alcohol, Parabens, and Sulfates and does nothing but enhance the beauty of my hair. It doesn&#x27;t take much, just a few drops a day, to improve the beauty and feel of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the new beautiful hair MUST have!</li>
            <li> I’ve tried Argan oil before and love its properties, but the K&amp;eacute;ralogie has a wonderful blend of oils, most I recognize in one form or another.  All are natural oils I love.  If you need fragrance-free, obviously you’ll want to take a pass.  If you love fragrances, this one is a lovely light one.  It’s not flowery, but rather delicate and sweet.  One good thing for many is that the K&amp;eacute;ralogie free of parabens and sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a pump included with the bottle if you so choose to use it.  I simply poured a few drops in my hands and worked it through my short hair.  I do have a lot of stiff gray in it and was hoping it would soften it out.  I didn’t use it with damp hair because I wanted a bit more control over the process.  After working it in, I rather looked like a pixie because it is an oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After letting is soak for a short period of time, I simply combed my hair.  Similar to Argan oil, it gave a great sheen and sparkle to my hair.  With gray hair it’s sometimes difficult to soften it, perhaps similar to those with split end issues.  I don’t dye or treat my hair with anything other than an oil now and then, but was quite pleased with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn’t so sure the K&amp;eacute;ralogie would do much for me, especially after checking out the pixie look, but it did.  The oil is house in an amber-colored bottle, something that will prevent deterioration of the oil.  It doesn’t take much to get a nice result, just a few drops, so this bottle should last quite some time.  Very pleased with the performance of the K&amp;eacute;ralogie if you could call it that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►  Organic Complex of the following&lt;br /&gt;►  Moroccan Argan Oil&lt;br /&gt;►  Macadamia Oil&lt;br /&gt;►  Shea Oil&lt;br /&gt;►  Jojoba O&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argania Spinoska&lt;br /&gt;Kernel Oil&lt;br /&gt;Simmondsia Chineses (Jojoba) Seed Oil&lt;br /&gt;Butyrospermium Parki (Shea)Oil&lt;br /&gt;Dimethocone&lt;br /&gt;Macadamia Intergrifolia Seed Oil&lt;br /&gt;Exclusive Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.rance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I use this product on a lot of different things for example, I have natural hair. I use this before I straighten my hair and sometimes after for daily maintenance. I sometimes use it as lotion. I use it when I wax my eyebrows. I also use it on my kids&#x27; hair. It makes it really easy to comb through their hair when it is wet. This is been a lifesaver when it comes to my kids. We don&#x27;t have as many screaming fits because I am able to come through the tangles. It has a silky feel when on your hair. I also love the way it smells. It has a really nice sweet smell about it, not too strong though. Another thing that I love is that a little goes along way. Me, my husband and kids use it and surprisingly it has lasted awhile. I am about to purchase my second bottle after months. Go into any natural hair salon and they will highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so shiny and soft with this product. Since I moved to the rainy Pacific Northwest I have been trying to tame my flyaway and thin hair as it tends to frizz after each shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of my previous anti-frizz products like John Frieda or Pantene serum work too well in this moisture laden air. Some products work ok but weigh down my fine and slightly wavy hair and make it look limp and oily. I am so glad I tried Keralogie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was doubtful it would work and thought it might weigh down my hair like other products. But it hasn&#x27;t done that, it tames the frizz but the hair does not feel oily. I usually shampoo my hair every other day. I just took 2 drops in the palm of my hand and it was enough to cover my above shoulder length hair. I apply this product to damp towel dried hair and typically start at the ends and then go to the scalp so that it does not get too oily and weighed down. It makes my hair smell great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter who has thick and straight waist length hair also used this product and was very pleased with the results. She colors her hair and has some split ends. She applied Keralogie to her damp hair and it turned out shiny and soft and smelled really good. It also protects from damage from hair styling products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product, I received a free sample to review but will buy another when it runs out.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many oils on my hair, I think I&#x27;ve become an expert by now.  As a result, I&#x27;m a little more skeptical that most because a lot of the oils claim to do things they never do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this in mind, I&#x27;ve been trying this hair product for a few weeks now and I have to say that I am very pleasantly surprised.  First of all, I just love the scent.  I usually don&#x27;t like scented products but the scent on this product is so pleasant that I have no problem using it and in fact look forward to smelling and using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, my hair has a lot of gray in it now which I dye.  However, gray hair is much coarser than non-gray and so much more difficult to manage.  This oil has helped me manage my hair much better.  A few drops actually helps soften the whole thing up and makes it much shinier than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, it&#x27;s a very good sized bottle.  Most of the argan oils or similar oils that I&#x27;ve tried in the past come in tiny bottles that last a very short amount of time.  This one is a very good size and I think it&#x27;s going to last a long time given that you only need to use a few drops each time.  So I think that economically, this is a very good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, there is nothing about this product that I do not like.  I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for review.</li>
            <li> Keralogie&#x27;s oil serum is a simple, but effective product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While your hair is still damp you&#x27;ll pump a couple of shots of the serum in your hands, spread it around, and then run it through your hair from about .5\\&quot; from the scalp to the roots.  While the serum will feel heavy and oily in your hands, once it&#x27;s applied to your hair it leaves it smooth and silky, but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The important thing to remember is that this serum is not to be used as a styling product, but in addition to your usual styling products.  Indeed, I still had to put my normal styling products in my hair to get my usual look.  For reference, I have thick wavy hair that is about 6\\&quot; long on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Keralogie is packaged in a nice glass bottle, with a locking pump.  The packaging is very robust and protects the bottle well.  I can attest to that, as I dropped into from about 4 feet onto concrete by accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... a great addition to your beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received a complimentary sample to review.)</li>
            <li> I rarely use anything on my hair,. It has been years since I had any color or a perm either. So when I was asked to use and review this product, I will all for it. My hair seems, more so lately, to be dry and frizzy with lots of static. I have been using this product for a few weeks and I have noticed that my hair is softer, smoother and has less flyaways.  I use the oils after I get out of the shower and towel dry my hair and then apply it to my damp hair. You might think with all the oils (Organic complex of Moroccan Argan Oil, Shea Oil, Jojoba Oil and Macadamia Oil) that it would leave your hair oily but it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Description:&lt;br /&gt;&#x60;Professional, Organic Complex of Moroccan Argan Oil, Macadamia Oil, Shea Oil, Jojoba Oil&lt;br /&gt;&#x60;UV and Thermal Protector, Makes Hair Shiny, Silky, Moisturized, Improves Manageability.&lt;br /&gt;&#x60;Paraben, Alcohol and SLS Free.

            <li> I am in love with this product.  I tried it today on damp hair, just on my ends and the back underside of my hair close to my scalp.  Not only does it make your hair look great, it tames fly aways, improves dry ends and does make your hair very soft and shiny.  I absolutely LOVE the smell of this on my hair, it is such a nice clean scent, not to overpowering but just very nice.  I had been using straight argan oil for my hair, until I received this.  This is my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; hair product, I am in love with it.  I also like that it comes with the pump, makes it so much easier to use, and a little goes a long way, so you use less when using the pump rather than tipping the bottle into your hand.  I would highly recommend this is you are older, (I am 47) live in a dry climate, or have dry heat such as a wood stove.  The best thing about this oil is that it is made in the USA.  Perfection.</li>

            <li> Smells good and gives my hair a good shine</li>
            <li> My husband and I both have been using Moroccan Oil for years.  But...every once in a while I think it&#x27;s really great to change things up.  So...trying this product made sense to me.  I have long thick hair that has been colored and treated with keratin...you know...that long expensive process that makes hair sleek and shiny.  I am now using this lightweight oil rather than pure Moroccan oil.  It smells lovely...is very lightweight and is wonderful for controlling flyaway hairs.  It leaves my hair shiny and after my hair is flat ironed...it&#x27;s even shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The added advantage of this product is that it is about half the price of the other oil I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I have found my next new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thank you to the manufacturer for asking me to try this oil.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Terrible product, gave me sticky hair and it was a waste of money.  It is not worth $4, imho.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. I&#x27;ve used it for a week and can see a total difference.  Once I put an extra amount of the oil in my hair and left it overnight. My hair never felt so soft in years!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:ab7f87e8504fdc859181fc389606b0f8]]I have gone through a couple of bottles of argan oil since I began using argan oil on the regular basis on a recommendation of my hairdresser. What I like about this bottle is its delivery system.  I previously used a spray and a eye dropper applicators. The pump applicator works better because it delivers the right amount without needing to open the bottle and there is no chance of getting the oil on something else like it happens with a spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser recommended that I began using it in my hair because she noticed that the hair on top of my head felt dry. She called it \\&quot;hat hair\\&quot;. She said many of her clients get dry hair from wearing hats in the winter. A few drops does not make the hair look or feel greasy. My hairdresser said it can be applied to dry hair or wet hair with the same effectiveness. The key is not to apply too much. After I began using argan oil she told me my dry hair was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keralogie Argan Oil comes in a 3.28 fl oz bottle. The only thing I am not crazy about is that this oil has a strong flowery scent.  I would have preferred that it was unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This argan oil provided by Keralogie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It makes my hair feel so soft and smooth and it smells amazing! I only use this on the ends of my hair and it cuts down my blow drying time. I have highlighted somewhat damaged ends and this product is a life saver! I would definitely repurchase again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely gorgeous product!!</li>
            <li> I like it sooo much coz leave my hair very smith and healthy</li>
            <li> Ah a m&amp;eacute;lange of oils to make your hair and skin oh so happy. This is just the right oil to make my hair soft and wonderful without being all slicked back greaser style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love argan oil - it does such a good job conditioning my hair. Straight or curly hair, it softens and shines hair. It feels great on my skin as a moisturizer. The mixture of the other oils just makes this all the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil has a slightly earthy smell, not overpowering, just a subtle good smell. There is no added fragrance, so this is just the natural aroma of the oils. I like that a lot.</li>
            <li> This oil does an excellent job of treating hair, adding sheen, reducing the appearance of split ends and flyaways, and increasing manageability while styling.  Just a few drops judiciously applied to damp hair and then brushed throughout is all that is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The treatment contains a blend of mostly botanical ingredients:  argan, jojoba, shea, silicone, and macadamia oils, plus a light, sweet fragrance.  The amber bottle protects the contents from light and the pump dispenses just the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Argania spinosa kernel oil, Simmondsia chinensis seed oil, Butyrospermum parkii seed oil, dimethicone, Macadamia integrifolia seed oil, exclusive fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keralogie provided a bottle of hair oil for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> OK, I have been using this product every other day for the last two weeks.  I cannot believe how much better the ends of my hair are.  I have to admit that my hair does not grow fast and the ends are always kind of dry because I am on medication that affects it.  This treatment has solved the problem of the dry ends.  My hair does not break and it is soft and manageable.  I am also impressed that my hair is growing longer...  I guess the ends not breaking and being healthy makes this happen.  By the way, this treatment smells divine!</li>
            <li> My hair is 84 years old, very dry and getting thinner and I have always had to use oil on my hair so that it keeps the curl when I comb it after setting it.  Being this is pure oil, it felt a little oilier to me than other oils I use, but the hair absorbed it nicely and it wasn&#x27;t too oily.  It has a light nice smell to it, buy not so strong that I think it might offend anyone in close quarters.&lt;br /&gt;I was given a free sample of the oil for an honest review, and I am happy that the company selected me for a review.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this oil!!! My hair is really damaged from bleaching, so a friend of mine recommended this product to me. I could not be happier. My hair is no longer freezy and looks healthy and shiny. I use it after every wash while my hair is still wet and also put another coat after I&#x27;m done with styling it. I can see my hair becoming healthier every day! Also it has an amazing smell which stays with you the whole day! I definitely would recommend this product to others with similar problems!</li>
            <li> Say goodbye to gels, hair mousse, and styling foams, this simple product from Keralogie is all anyone needs to invisibly and effectively style your hair the way you like it without the obvious tell tale signs that you&#x27;ve spent any time on it.This holds hair with the best of em :) It does it&#x27;s job and is well made. I am satisfied with this product as it was given sample to me for testing purpose and it is well priced.</li>
