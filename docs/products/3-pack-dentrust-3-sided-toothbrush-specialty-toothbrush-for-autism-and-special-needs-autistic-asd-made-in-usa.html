            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel squeaky clean, like you just came from the dentist.</li>
            <li>Brilliant idea and definitely better than standard toothbrush but perhaps making it thicker/different materials so won&#x27;t be chewed so easily will be the next move in improving the design.</li>
            <li>He actually enjoys using them and they seem to do a good job cleaning.</li>
            <li>It makes brushing so much easier to be able to brush all parts of her teeth at once.</li>
            <li>As parents the difference is visable and the change in their behavior is significant because it is easier for them to brush right.</li>
            <li>She and my 8 year old love these brushes so much that they are brushing more and showing off their teeth afterward because they can feel the difference.</li>
            <li>My husband even wants one for adults!!</li>

            <li>I cannot fit over my four year old corner teeth.</li>

            <li>Bristles are more rough than I expected but luckily my son doesn&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>Since getting this, its still a struggle, however, it&#x27;s much faster, and I know I&#x27;m not missing spots.  </li>
            <li>My 18 year old disabled child is looking at severe dental problems if we cannot get her brushing better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an a adult.</li>

            <li>I have tried wetting them with warm water as the instructions say, but it is still a little too hard for my sons gums.</li>
            <li>Would recommend as long as your child doesn&#x27;t have very, very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Really hard to get the teeth in between the brushes to clean.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my three year old son who&#x27;s Autistic.  </li>
            <li> he now allows us to brush them with little fuss and in half the time it would normally take with a standard brush.</li>
            <li> It is soo small, the three different parts are so close, it probably was only meant for the front teeth only.</li>

            <li> The brush was to hard and unforgiving</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work properly and bad quality.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very hard and my child does not like it at all and found it very hard to use in his mouth.</li>
            <li> We went from a literal fight when it was time to brush his teeth to it being a game, biiiig step for him.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old son who has Autism, hated brushing his teeth!!  </li>

            <li> It is soo small, the three different parts are so close, it probably was only meant for the front teeth only. I cannot fit over my four year old corner teeth.</li>
            <li> It should be stronger. My toddler ruined it in the first use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this before, but it&#x27;s no longer available locally. Very useful.</li>
            <li> its too hard on my kids gum. they need to make it super soft so kids gum wont bleed. i threw it out after an unsuccessful 1st attempt.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. Makes brushing my son&#x27;s teeth a much more pleasant experience and also allows him to brush his own teeth well.</li>
            <li> My son has sensory processing difficulties, and hates to brush his teeth.  These have been the only toothbrushes that he has not argued about brushing with.</li>
            <li> I really like the concept behind this tooth brush, however I find the bristles very hard. I have tried wetting them with warm water as the instructions say, but it is still a little too hard for my sons gums.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for kids who does not like brushing&lt;br /&gt;Excellent</li>
            <li> Why is this toothbrush just for Autism . I&#x27;m an a adult. I love this brush its the first one to really Brush my whole mouth.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my three year old son who&#x27;s Autistic.  We have a struggle with getting him to brush his teeth.  Since getting this, its still a struggle, however, it&#x27;s much faster, and I know I&#x27;m not missing spots.  I bought one for myself as well since people were complaining about the bristles.  But the instructions tell you how to soften the bristles and it works.  I think it was a great value.</li>
            <li> My 18 year old disabled child is looking at severe dental problems if we cannot get her brushing better. This came highly recomended from our Autism support group. She and my 8 year old love these brushes so much that they are brushing more and showing off their teeth afterward because they can feel the difference. As parents the difference is visable and the change in their behavior is significant because it is easier for them to brush right.</li>
            <li> The brush was to hard and unforgiving</li>
            <li> My 4 year old son who has Autism, hated brushing his teeth!!  It was a fight every morning.  To get his teeth cleaned I would have to pry his mouth open and count as I brushed each side, then give him breaks in between.  NOW...he loves brushing his teeth!!!  I say, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s time to brush your teeth&amp;#34; and he comes strait to the bathroom and lets me brush them!  He even does his molars on his own sometimes!!  I will be buying these for him from now on!!!  My husband even wants one for adults!!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work properly and bad quality. waste of money</li>
            <li> The bristles are very hard and my child does not like it at all and found it very hard to use in his mouth.</li>
            <li> My Mom has dementia and this 3-sided toothbrush really worked for her. She usually resisted by efforts to brush her teeth with a regular or electric toothbrush. She did not resist once with the 3-sided one - it just felt different to her. Great product. Highly recommend for any problem toothbrushers in your life.</li>
            <li> Really hard to get the teeth in between the brushes to clean. I was hoping this would be an easier brush for my Autistic son to use but it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old son has autism and these toothbrushes have made brushing his teeth much easier. He actually enjoys using them and they seem to do a good job cleaning. I definitely recommend.</li>

            <li> This toothbrush works great for my niece!!</li>
            <li> This was great.  It cleans where regular brushes cannot.  This was the child&#x27;s size so I sent for the adult ne for mself.  I will not go back to the old brush.  I recommend it highly to everyone!.</li>
