            <li>It smells amazing and my husband turns me on every time he wears it.</li>
            <li>What a great cologne, plus being a huge Kiss fan I had to buy it.  </li>
            <li>He was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to smell like a man. :D</li>
            <li>BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS A NICE PRICE</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to have a good fragrance</li>
            <li>would recommend this to others, liked it but</li>
            <li>I was glad that the bottle looked just as good as the box.  </li>
            <li>I actually liked the smell of it.  </li>
            <li>It smells so good that we will be buying more.</li>
            <li>AND HE LIKED IT</li>
            <li>He liked this fragrance</li>
            <li>Liked the bottle more then the cologne</li>
            <li>What a great fragrance for such a great buy.  </li>
            <li>i love the way this cologne smells on my husband.......</li>
            <li>Im a Kiss fan and bought this as more of a novelty.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.  </li>
            <li>was just as described in the description....arrived on time and my hubby and i just love the product</li>
            <li>He often gets compliments when he wears this :)</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>but we had not been able to figure out which fragrance</li>
            <li>He thinks most guys would like Kiss.</li>
            <li>Has a baby powder kinda smell very clean.</li>
            <li>This cologn actually smells very good on me.</li>
            <li>Smells really good, and it stays with you the whole day.</li>
            <li>He sprayed some on right away, the scent is a mild almost baby powder smell and mellows out to a very nice clean scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering, the packaging is cool and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li>I got this for my brother as a Christmas present and he loved it!</li>
            <li>My Husband is a huge Kiss Fan and a collector.</li>
            <li>The box is attractive and the cologne bottle is larger than it appears online...</li>
            <li>Body wash &amp; Aftershave Soother are also a great addition to any KISS personal items collection.</li>
            <li>The cumin scent is there, but lightly.</li>
            <li>Just more hassle than it is worth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to smell the underlying bergamot and woods-rather sweet.</li>
            <li>; when they were a band :)Thought it would be a funny gift.</li>
            <li>Very manly, and clean smelling.... love smelling him when he wears this.</li>
            <li>Me and the gf really love this stuff I really need to order another.</li>
            <li>Him was recommended by a friend - I was pleasently surprised a how nice it smelled.</li>
            <li>COOL BOTTLE.</li>
            <li>but preferred the AZZARO aroma which he had used during his teen years and loved it then</li>
            <li>I understand the cologne is discontinued, so I better get several more bottles</li>
            <li>Whereat price and quick delivery thank you</li>
            <li>It arrived in a secure package in a very reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Great price and a little nostalgia form</li>
            <li>It is not even worth a penny.</li>
            <li>But we actually both liked the smell, as well.</li>
            <li>I arrive at the expected time and in good condition</li>
            <li>Most reviews on here are right on, it is a very soapy, masculine kind of scent, but a big bottle for the price.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 16-yr-old nephew, an avid KISS fan.  </li>
            <li>It may be why I tried it the first time</li>
            <li>He uses it pretty often.</li>
            <li>This stuff actually smells great and has a long hang time.</li>
            <li>But seriously a lot of girls have told me this smells great</li>
            <li>I know it is so cheesy purchasing a cologne with a band name, but it really smells great!</li>
            <li>Sporty, refreshing scent that&#x27;s not loud.</li>
            <li>but it is not just about the bottle, I gave this 50/50 because I tried it with few people and from the 20 people I tested with funny thing it came 10 liked it</li>
            <li>I would recommend at least trying this cologne, think you will be pleasantly suprised.</li>
            <li>I give this product a very high recommendation.</li>
            <li>this is great for any kiss fan like i am, some say there is a secret bottle with Genes sweat in it</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>But when you spray it on your skin and let it sit for a minute, it smells very rugged and alluring.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an over all very manly scent.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has always talked about how much he loves this &amp; his fav band is kiss.</li>
            <li>fast shipper.</li>
            <li>But personally I really like the scent and its</li>
            <li>Very manly, even though Paul Stanley is involved in it</li>
            <li>very sensual smell.</li>
            <li>i ordered 4 because it was not worth the money ordering 1 as shipping cost more than the thing i had orderd  </li>
            <li>but now its one of the few I really like and can wear cuz of allergies :)</li>
            <li>I do not often tell people who ask what I am wearing because it seems a little goofy, but man</li>
            <li>Rock &amp; Roll All Nite and smell good everyday!!!</li>
            <li>My husband thought it smelled like old man, which I guess makes sense since Gene Simmons is an old man.  </li>
            <li>The cologne was purchased as a gift for a relative who is a KISS fan, When he opened up the gift he was very surprised.</li>
            <li>While the design of the box and the bottle was great the cologne itself was BAD.  </li>
            <li>Smelled a lot like alcohol and did not last long, but the price was decent....</li>
            <li>but it was not worth it in the end because i would not have ordered 1 item for the shipping cost way to much just to order the one item.  </li>
            <li>Not sure why this product is so hard to find in stores, but everyone that has smelled it on me has liked it.</li>

            <li> Do you really expect a negative review from me?  </li>
            <li> This fragrance hit me strong at first and then slowly settled down, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price or the timing in which it arrives</li>
            <li> just let him open it as soon as he seen it his eyes lit up he set it down picked me up and hugged me and gave me a kiss</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually suspicious of celebrity endorsed colognes and I didn&#x27;t think a Kiss cologne would go the extra mile and try to be as high-end as possible.  </li>
            <li> Only takes a half squirt for all night scent.</li>
            <li> box was pretty worn and looked old, box looks bad to be given as a gift</li>
            <li> -- they&#x27;re just using it for display along with their other KISS memorabilia.</li>
            <li> Luckily the person I purchased it for doesn&#x27;t care that it stinks</li>
            <li> Not that it is bad, but it is not CK, Armani, or Ralph Lauren like the original $49 list price suggests.</li>
            <li> TYPICAL SCENT</li>
            <li> Waste of money.the band sucks</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne as a gift for a die hard Kiss fan.  </li>
            <li> soooooo not happy at all</li>
            <li> (Sorry Paul).  </li>
            <li> Spray nozzle works very poorly.</li>

            <li> Gave as gift! Person loved it!</li>
            <li> this is great for any kiss fan like i am, some say there is a secret bottle with Genes sweat in it</li>
            <li> ES UN BUEN PERFUME, PARA CUALQUIER MOMENTO... UN PRECIO INCREIBLE... LE RECOMIENDO PARA TODA LA COMUNIDAD ROCKERA... UN FRAGANCIA FUERTE FACIL DE LLEVAR DURANTE TODO EL DIA..</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 16-yr-old nephew, an avid KISS fan.  He was thrilled.  The box is attractive and the cologne bottle is larger than it appears online...a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kiss cologne for around two years and I really like it. It&#x27;s scent is not overbearing, unlike some of the more expensive colognes. Very affordable and best of all it&#x27;s from the greatest band of all time....KISS!!!!!</li>
            <li> Liked the bottle more then the cologne</li>
            <li> This KISS Him Cologne has a great scent, projection and longevity. Excellent choice for any KISS fan. KISS Him Body wash &amp; Aftershave Soother are also a great addition to any KISS personal items collection. Rock &amp; Roll All Nite and smell good everyday!!!</li>
            <li> When you smell the cologne from the bottle, it smells terrible. D:  But when you spray it on your skin and let it sit for a minute, it smells very rugged and alluring.  It&#x27;s an over all very manly scent. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to smell like a man. :D</li>
            <li> I was talked into buying this cologne by the sales person while making another purchase for Christmas and this was actually a great buy.  Sporty, refreshing scent that&#x27;s not loud.</li>
            <li> Gene Simmons will market anything! As a Kiss fan I was weary about this product and with good reason. Most reviews on here are right on, it is a very soapy, masculine kind of scent, but a big bottle for the price. It is not a \\&quot;Cheap\\&quot; smell as I would have thought, and is a very pleasant scent all around. I would recommend to anyone looking to add to their collection.</li>
            <li> i ordered 4 items and only got 1  i ordered 4 because it was not worth the money ordering 1 as shipping cost more than the thing i had orderd  yes they give me the money back for the 3 items i did&#x27;nt get but it was not worth it in the end because i would not have ordered 1 item for the shipping cost way to much just to order the one item.  soooooo not happy at all</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and my husband turns me on every time he wears it.</li>
            <li> This cologne is so bad, it smells like dirty BO.  My wife almost puked when she smelled it.  She immediately ordered me to take a shower.  Enough said.  BTW, I paid $2.99 at Big Lots for this.  It is not even worth a penny.</li>
            <li> Smells really good, and it stays with you the whole day. Unlike some that only last an hour or two!!!</li>
            <li> This cologn actually smells very good on me. The cumin scent is there, but lightly. It&#x27;s easy to smell the underlying bergamot and woods-rather sweet.</li>
            <li> Smells like s***. Waste of money.the band sucks and so does the cologne.  Buy it if you wanna smell like a cabbie who hasn&#x27;t taken shower for months.</li>
            <li> Best cologne ever. Me and the gf really love this stuff I really need to order another.</li>
            <li> What a great fragrance for such a great buy.  This will make any man happy to wear because it lasts all day without killing anyone around them with a strong scent.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband... who was a big fan of &amp;#34;Kiss&amp;#34; when they were a band :)Thought it would be a funny gift. But we actually both liked the smell, as well. Very manly, and clean smelling.... love smelling him when he wears this. Awesome product- great price!</li>
            <li> If I can&#x27;t be Gene Simmons . . . I might as well smell like Gene Simmons ;-P</li>
            <li> This is a good price for an excellant cologne.  It arrived in a secure package in a very reasonable amount of time.  I give this product a very high recommendation.</li>
            <li> Great novelty item for a KISS fan.  As a cologne it is a $10 item at best.  Not that it is bad, but it is not CK, Armani, or Ralph Lauren like the original $49 list price suggests.</li>
            <li> SMELL IS HORRIBLE ONLY BOUGHT BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS A NICE PRICE AND FIGURED KISS WAS A REPATABLE SOURCE HORRIBLE COLOGNE I WOULDNT EVEN GIVE THIS AS A GIFT TO SOMEONE</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to have a good fragrance but it turned out to be very pleasant. I purchased for my husband and he loves it. Great price and a little nostalgia form Kiss!  [...]</li>
            <li> Nice aroma, good price, recommend</li>
            <li> I love it! Excelent product and value! Smells great! You can not beat the price for this GREAT sent! YESSSSS</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has always talked about how much he loves this &amp; his fav band is kiss. I wanted to give him something great for christmas, we were standing in the garage when it came and i didnt even wrap it just let him open it as soon as he seen it his eyes lit up he set it down picked me up and hugged me and gave me a kiss :) i was so happy he loved it...and it smells soooooo good! Plus the amount u get for the price was a reallllly good deal!</li>
            <li> fast shipper. as described.</li>
            <li> this cologne is awsome</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awesome.  I know it is so cheesy purchasing a cologne with a band name, but it really smells great!</li>
            <li> Spray nozzle works very poorly. Price is good.</li>
            <li> This arrived very quickly and smelled great!!  Kiss Him was recommended by a friend - I was pleasently surprised a how nice it smelled.</li>
            <li> What a pleasant surprise.  I&#x27;m usually suspicious of celebrity endorsed colognes and I didn&#x27;t think a Kiss cologne would go the extra mile and try to be as high-end as possible.  What a great cologne, plus being a huge Kiss fan I had to buy it.  I understand the cologne is discontinued, so I better get several more bottles so I can smell this great for many years to come.  Kiss cologne Rocks!!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure why this product is so hard to find in stores, but everyone that has smelled it on me has liked it. But personally I really like the scent and its not just cuz I am a KISS fan.  It may be why I tried it the first time but now its one of the few I really like and can wear cuz of allergies :)</li>
            <li> Antes de comprar el perfume le&amp;iacute; en alguna parte de internet que el olor era similar al de una estrella de rock sudada, pens&amp;eacute; que era chiste pero no lo es. El perfume realmente huele a sudor con perfume, se me hace similar a \\&quot;Cuba Gold\\&quot;. Que me perdone Gene Simmons, pero no me gust&amp;oacute; mucho que digamos, pero si vemos el precio, no podemos esperar mucho.</li>
            <li> would recommend this to others, liked it but box was pretty worn and looked old, box looks bad to be given as a gift</li>
            <li> My son loved getting this on Christmas morning.  I was glad that the bottle looked just as good as the box.  I actually liked the smell of it.  It was not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I can not say this is a great product because I honestly did not like the smell if it, I do like the bottle though but it is not just about the bottle, I gave this 50/50 because I tried it with few people and from the 20 people I tested with funny thing it came 10 liked it and 10 did not. should you buy it? maybe, did I like it? no. would I buy it again? no.. that&#x27;s my review..</li>
            <li> i love the way this cologne smells on my husband.......and he is a Kiss fan!!!! the perfect gift for him</li>
            <li> Kiss Him is a very sexy, manly scent.  It&#x27;s not overpowering, the packaging is cool and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Do you really expect a negative review from me?  But seriously a lot of girls have told me this smells great and I agree.</li>
            <li> I got this for my brother as a Christmas present and he loved it! He uses it pretty often. Last time I talked to him he said that he already bought a second one.</li>
            <li> Whereat price and quick delivery thank you</li>
            <li> Im a Kiss fan and bought this as more of a novelty. This stuff actually smells great and has a long hang time. Has a baby powder kinda smell very clean. Use it for a daily wear</li>
            <li> My Husband is a huge Kiss Fan and a collector. I bought him 2 bottles, 1 to open and one to put on the shelf. It smells so good that we will be buying more.</li>
            <li> doubt buy this cologne for a gift and it is very good, has a great economic price .... I arrive at the expected time and in good condition</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  Very manly, even though Paul Stanley is involved in it (Sorry Paul).  Only takes a half squirt for all night scent.</li>
            <li> The cologne was purchased as a gift for a relative who is a KISS fan, When he opened up the gift he was very surprised. He sprayed some on right away, the scent is a mild almost baby powder smell and mellows out to a very nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne as a gift for a die hard Kiss fan.  To say that is was bad would be an understatement.  While the design of the box and the bottle was great the cologne itself was BAD.  Luckily the person I purchased it for doesn&#x27;t care that it stinks -- they&#x27;re just using it for display along with their other KISS memorabilia.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells so good on my man !  very sensual smell. I would recommend at least trying this cologne, think you will be pleasantly suprised.</li>
            <li> My husband thought it smelled like old man, which I guess makes sense since Gene Simmons is an old man.  I only got points for the thought.</li>
            <li> Excellent 100% Recommended</li>
            <li> This fragrance hit me strong at first and then slowly settled down, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price or the timing in which it arrives</li>
            <li> was just as described in the description....arrived on time and my hubby and i just love the product....smells so good</li>
            <li> This bottle did not smell as good. Smelled a lot like alcohol and did not last long, but the price was decent....so did not ask for exchange. Just more hassle than it is worth I guess.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this scent and you can&#x27;t beat the price. He often gets compliments when he wears this :)</li>
            <li> COOL BOTTLE. TYPICAL SCENT BUT STILL MAKES A GREAT GIFT FOR ANY KISS FAN I GOT THIS FOR MY BOYFRIEND AND HE LIKED IT</li>
            <li> I do not often tell people who ask what I am wearing because it seems a little goofy, but man this stuff gets me a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> He liked this fragrance okay but preferred the AZZARO aroma which he had used during his teen years and loved it then but we had not been able to figure out which fragrance it was until we got the variety set.  Excellent shipping.  He thinks most guys would like Kiss.</li>
