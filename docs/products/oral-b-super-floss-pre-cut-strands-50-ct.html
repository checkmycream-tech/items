            <li>It also works perfectly for my normal teeth.</li>
            <li>There very easy to use</li>
            <li>I love this floss...best ever.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite product for cleaning a dental bridge.  </li>
            <li>I think these get my son to floss a bit more than he might if I didn&#x27;t buy them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping the reason for not being able to find it on the pharmacy shelves anymore, is because the company is trying to correct the problem.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this product and I am so glad he did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the way they are packaged.</li>
            <li>---it is simply the very BEST!</li>
            <li>THESE ARE MY FAVORITE</li>
            <li>&gt;  2 - most importantly:  they shred, almost as soon as they feel any resistance flossing.</li>
            <li>Perfect for bridges; practical, quick and simple.</li>
            <li>Floss breaks too easily</li>
            <li>But not as easy to use as the pre-looped floss threader.</li>
            <li>Then I got my permanent bridge and now the floss threads through easily.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use - just grab one and get started.</li>
            <li>These pre-cut strands have inferior floss that shreds easily and can&#x27;t compare with the Glide floss I buy at Costco on sale.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>The tip is coated so it&#x27;s easy to get it between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The spongy floss does a very good job, with limited discomfort.</li>
            <li>I love O B Super Floss...,.</li>
            <li>The strand supposed to have the cotton that makes it so smooth.  </li>
            <li>This helps one clean between teeth when orthodontic devices get in the way.</li>
            <li>I really need to purchase some more.</li>
            <li>Other than the mint, it is a great item.</li>
            <li>Could have a more aggressive mid-section with micro bristles or such for better cleaning though.</li>
            <li>I did see Super Floss in a Target</li>
            <li>Unlike other threader styled floss, these are strong, convenient, easy to use and do the job!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve never had to use more than one of the regular kind)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li>Way too much mint!</li>
            <li>I have had many issues with my teeth and as a result, I now have several implants and a bridge.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to find how quickly the product was delivered.</li>
            <li>I have tried the few other products that are available and there is nothing as good as Oral B Super Floss</li>
            <li>Thread breaks and the tip isn&#x27;t strong enough to go between bridges and teeth</li>
            <li>I really like them.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>The thicker section really does the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wayyyyy overpriced though and very discouraging to keep buying at this price and will begin looking harder for better price.  </li>
            <li>I was willing to live with them not being separately packaged, as I wanted the mint flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally my teeth feel like pre-braces clean.</li>
            <li>This a much more comfortable option than using the little contraption that you tread with regular floss.</li>
            <li>I love this floss as my teeth are tight with space at the gumline, so this floss gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high quality</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product if you need to floss bridges, implants or braces.</li>
            <li>Only Amazon.com seems to be interested in providing consumers with what they need and want; thank you, thank you, thank you.</li>
            <li>It took less than a week - from Europe - free shipping on Prime!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The point isnt sturdy enough to get to the back molars as easy as a traditional threader</li>
            <li>It must have been the design of the temporary or the material it was made of (the permanent bridge is made of much smoother stuff) or both that was my initial problem.</li>
            <li>Works very well under abutting multiple tooth cap work where nothing else can enter (except unwanted food particles.)</li>
            <li>This floss works well for people with braces and fixed bridges.  </li>
            <li>It no longer is as thick or as strong as it used to be.</li>
            <li>Floss is not the same kind which has been sold in the past, which is a single strand of waxed floss all individually wrapped.  </li>
            <li>The coated end is not stiff enough to get through your orthodontics.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However - 1 - you could barely tell that there was any mint&lt;</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and rec&#x27;d earlier than expected.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My only negative is that the price is much higher than it should be for this.</li>
            <li> I have used them a long time, just couldn&#x27;t find them.</li>
            <li> Nothing against the UK, just that it seems like a long way around and takes a long time.  </li>
            <li> Having used this product for many years, I was shocked and dismayed that suddenly it was discontinued by Procter and Gamble.</li>
            <li> This is not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Items were as I expected.</li>
            <li> This type is a stringy mess that comes apart when used in tight teeth and is packaged in one big hunk which makes it harder to separate.  </li>
            <li> Heavier floss at &#x27;thin&#x27; end and a little more difficult to get between teeth.</li>
            <li> Now if only I could buy it from my Walgreens or at least from Amazon instead of a seller in the UK.</li>
            <li> The boxes looked as if they had been opened previously.  </li>
            <li> I even tried cutting off the mint threader, but it didn&#x27;t really help,</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult enough</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product for her braces, but it is hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is so hard to find, but can&#x27;t find it in any retail store or pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> Very much appreciated as it is impossible to locate retail in Lancaster, Ohio!</li>
            <li> When I first tried this floss I hated it because it was extremely difficult to stick the stiff end between the teeth of my temporary bridge.</li>
            <li> I started using Plak Smacker Ultra Thin Dental Floss Threaders when I got my braces, and I thought these pre-cut strands might be easier, since I was having the floss fall out of the threaders sometimes.  </li>
            <li> the floss shredded and was useless 2.</li>
            <li> these strands are awful.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Floss breaks too easily</li>
            <li> I love this floss...best ever.</li>
            <li> This is not what I expected.  The strand supposed to have the cotton that makes it so smooth.  Hardy anythin. I will not buy it again.a</li>
            <li> Thread breaks and the tip isn&#x27;t strong enough to go between bridges and teeth</li>
            <li> I really like them.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I had to have a bridge after a fall, that broke two of my teeth. This floss is perfect for getting in the gap and cleaning the space in and around the dental work. It also works perfectly for my normal teeth. This a much more comfortable option than using the little contraption that you tread with regular floss. The spongy floss does a very good job, with limited discomfort. I would recommend this product to any one that has dental prosthetic.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product for her braces, but it is hard to find in stores.  My only negative is that the price is much higher than it should be for this.</li>

It took four of them to finish my mouth (I&#x27;ve never had to use more than one of the regular kind)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Hard to find.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product for cleaning a dental bridge.  When I could no longer find it at local pharmacies, I turned to Amazon. Thankfully, I found a supplier.  There&#x27;s nothing as good as this product.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dentist.  I have been very pleased!</li>
            <li> Just what the hygienist ordered!</li>
            <li> Recently had a bridge placed and these work alright as a threader floss.  The point isnt sturdy enough to get to the back molars as easy as a traditional threader</li>
            <li> Perfect for bridges; practical, quick and simple. Could have a more aggressive mid-section with micro bristles or such for better cleaning though.</li>
            <li> Works great after you get it through. But not as easy to use as the pre-looped floss threader.</li>
            <li> The coated end is not stiff enough to get through your orthodontics.  My bridge is in the back and it&#x27;s difficult enough but this doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I have to use a threader so what&#x27;s the point?</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dentist.  It works very well.</li>
            <li> Good product, timely delivery!!!!</li>
            <li> These things are awesome!  Best I&#x27;ve found to use with braces.  Finally my teeth feel like pre-braces clean. WHEW!  A must-have if you have braces.</li>
            <li> I have used them a long time, just couldn&#x27;t find them. I love them!</li>
            <li> Way too much mint! I can&#x27;t find the unflavored anyplace. Other than the mint, it is a great item. I even tried cutting off the mint threader, but it didn&#x27;t really help, so back they go.</li>
            <li> The boxes looked as if they had been opened previously.  Since I needed to use them in my mouth, I didn&#x27;t feel that they were sanitary,  and I threw them away.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and rec&#x27;d earlier than expected. Sara</li>
            <li> I really need to purchase some more.</li>
            <li> Perfect for front bridge.</li>
            <li> Great for use with permanent bridges.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the strands. I miss Oral B Ultra.</li>
            <li> Great price and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Love this gloss for braces!</li>
            <li> When I first tried this floss I hated it because it was extremely difficult to stick the stiff end between the teeth of my temporary bridge.

Now if only I could buy it from my Walgreens or at least from Amazon instead of a seller in the UK. Nothing against the UK, just that it seems like a long way around and takes a long time.  I did see Super Floss in a Target but it was made with Glide floss and I do not like Glide.</li>
            <li> I think these get my son to floss a bit more than he might if I didn&#x27;t buy them. They are easy to use - just grab one and get started.</li>
            <li> I started using Plak Smacker Ultra Thin Dental Floss Threaders when I got my braces, and I thought these pre-cut strands might be easier, since I was having the floss fall out of the threaders sometimes.  Last time I had my teeth cleaned, my hygienist said to use the floss doubled over when I floss, and that totally helps with keeping the floss in the threader and cleaning between my teeth with braces on..  These pre-cut strands have inferior floss that shreds easily and can&#x27;t compare with the Glide floss I buy at Costco on sale.  I could only get one use out of the OralB pre-cut strands because of shredding, but multiple uses with the threaders, so I&#x27;m using the threaders again with Glide and I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li> works great for bridges</li>
            <li> Drat !  ...they getcha hooked on something then take it away !  I love O B Super Floss...,.&#x27;have for years....&#x27;still have most of my teeth at 80 !  Something must be working</li>
            <li> Floss is not the same kind which has been sold in the past, which is a single strand of waxed floss all individually wrapped.  This type is a stringy mess that comes apart when used in tight teeth and is packaged in one big hunk which makes it harder to separate.  I bought three boxes at once and I do not like them at all!!</li>
            <li> These are the best for bridges</li>
            <li> These are the MOST wonderful floss for those with dental &#x27;bridgework&#x27;. Unlike other threader styled floss, these are strong, convenient, easy to use and do the job!</li>
            <li> Well it still works but it is definitely not the same as it used to be. I&#x27;m hoping the reason for not being able to find it on the pharmacy shelves anymore, is because the company is trying to correct the problem. It no longer is as thick or as strong as it used to be.</li>
            <li> Love this! Works best from all I&#x27;ve tried. Wayyyyy overpriced though and very discouraging to keep buying at this price and will begin looking harder for better price.  But works excellent with my bridge.</li>
            <li> Items were as I expected. Prompt delivery</li>
            <li> The product meets my needs as it is essential for bridge work..</li>
            <li> I have had many issues with my teeth and as a result, I now have several implants and a bridge. My dentist recommended this product and I am so glad he did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It works. It allows me to get under my bridge and my implants. The thicker section really does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s easy to use. The tip is coated so it&#x27;s easy to get it between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s high quality so it doesn&#x27;t shred. I made the mistake of trying a cheaper store brand and two things happened: 1. the floss shredded and was useless 2. it loosened my bridge. So I say you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product if you need to floss bridges, implants or braces.</li>
            <li> Love the way they are packaged. Great floss!!</li>
            <li> I have been using these for 40 yeRs + or -</li>
            <li> Very much appreciated as it is impossible to locate retail in Lancaster, Ohio!</li>
            <li> It is a great help to flossing.  Why don&#x27;t the local stores sell it?</li>
            <li> Gets where regular floss doesn&#x27;t.  Heavier floss at &#x27;thin&#x27; end and a little more difficult to get between teeth.</li>
            <li> Arrived just as ordered. Best flosser for bridge work on the market.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is so hard to find, but can&#x27;t find it in any retail store or pharmacy.  Once again, Amazon has come through for me!  I love this floss as my teeth are tight with space at the gumline, so this floss gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Having used this product for many years, I was shocked and dismayed that suddenly it was discontinued by Procter and Gamble. I have tried the few other products that are available and there is nothing as good as Oral B Super Floss---it is simply the very BEST! Only Amazon.com seems to be interested in providing consumers with what they need and want; thank you, thank you, thank you.</li>
            <li> Works very well under abutting multiple tooth cap work where nothing else can enter (except unwanted food particles.)</li>
            <li> These flosser are great. There very easy to use</li>
            <li> THESE ARE MY FAVORITE</li>
            <li> This helps one clean between teeth when orthodontic devices get in the way. Does the job.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I paid $17 for ONLY 50 strands of dental floss!  A month of dental floss for 1 person?  The projected delivery date was essentially &#x27;somewhere between April and May.</li>
            <li> This floss works well for people with braces and fixed bridges.  Was recommended by my dentist.</li>
