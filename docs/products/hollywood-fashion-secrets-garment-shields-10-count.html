    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I can see how these may not be the best for a shirt.</li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>They worked perfect to keep odors off of the jackets i used.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the Victorian Era Ball.  </li>
            <li>These work best in blazers as they do not shift at all.  </li>
            <li>The idea seems great</li>
            <li>The product is good...</li>
            <li>These are good in theory, but they don&#x27;t stick to my clothing.</li>
            <li>My daughter loved them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s kind of a give and take, on the plus side</li>
            <li>These will be stocking stuffers over the holidays for sure.</li>
            <li>The shields are made to be more flexible so stayed on all day on my jacket - I had a sleeveless top under</li>
            <li>These are ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe a non-heavy sweater would have better luck.</li>
            <li>Did not sick and bunched up.</li>
            <li>If you just want to avoid deodorant marks on your clothes, good enough!</li>
            <li>If you wear a white or very light colored shirt you can see the garment shield.</li>
            <li>Works well, will more than likely reorder</li>
            <li>The adhesive doesn&#x27;t seem strong enough.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to wash the whole dress after every event.</li>
            <li>But, in silk blouses, you will have to learn how to carefully place these pads in order to be able to wear them all day.  </li>
            <li>A nice blazer or jacket is expensive and it&#x27;s awesome to get a few wears out of each during EITHER a big client meeting or a hot spring/summer day.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use these - much improved from older versions that would come off.</li>
            <li>They have saved me from having to immediately dry clean my blouses.</li>
            <li>These are very thin, pull off easily without residue (rare!).</li>
            <li>barely sticks to clothing, ends up bunched and then unattached</li>
            <li>but once I started sweating the sticker peeled off and started getting stuck to other places so they were no longer absorbing my armpit or any sweat.&lt;br</li>

            <li> These are very thin, pull off easily without residue (rare!).</li>
            <li> barely sticks to clothing, ends up bunched and then unattached</li>
            <li> but once I started sweating the sticker peeled off and started getting stuck to other places so they were no longer absorbing my armpit or any sweat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only odd thing about these is that on the crease, it actually had cut out slits along it, so technically a person could sweat through those slit openings on the crease of their jacket/shirts.</li>
            <li> The garment shields did work and kept my shirts dry.</li>
            <li> Thought it was a little over priced, package only contains a 5 day supply.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> the adhesive leaves no residue but on the negative side its not strong enough to stay put with heavy</li>
            <li> Helped prevent stains, but did tend to slip a little.</li>
            <li> However, they were a little bulky.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, these pads are quite thin and quiet.</li>
            <li> People who buy these, sweat and as such a paper thin shield is a waste of time, money and  embarrassment.</li>
            <li> These garment shields do work, but it takes a little work to get them to work!  </li>
            <li> A little hard to put on the shirts without being seen.</li>
            <li> Very hard to position.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky and the material is poor.</li>
            <li> and I understand the manufacturer not wanting a bulky shield but when they are this thin, they are useless!!!!!!!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Works well, will more than likely reorder</li>
            <li> I bought 3 brands of dress-shield and I tried these last. These were thinner (like the 2nd brand) and I understand the manufacturer not wanting a bulky shield but when they are this thin, they are useless!!!!!!!!! People who buy these, sweat and as such a paper thin shield is a waste of time, money and  embarrassment. If you perspire, avoid these. If you just want to avoid deodorant marks on your clothes, good enough!</li>
            <li> I can see how these may not be the best for a shirt. However, they&#x27;ve saved me $$$ on dry-cleaning for my work blazers. A nice blazer or jacket is expensive and it&#x27;s awesome to get a few wears out of each during EITHER a big client meeting or a hot spring/summer day. These will be stocking stuffers over the holidays for sure.</li>
            <li> Helped prevent stains, but did tend to slip a little.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I used these for a series of interviews that I wouldn&#x27;t have time to have my suit cleaned between every interview.  They worked perfect to keep odors off of the jackets i used.</li>
            <li> Very hard to position. Not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> These are very thin, pull off easily without residue (rare!). The only odd thing about these is that on the crease, it actually had cut out slits along it, so technically a person could sweat through those slit openings on the crease of their jacket/shirts.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the Victorian Era Ball.  Now I don&#x27;t have to wash the whole dress after every event.</li>
            <li> The shields are made to be more flexible so stayed on all day on my jacket - I had a sleeveless top under so they protected my jacket well.  just be mindful when you take the jacket off/put it on.  I will continue to use these - much improved from older versions that would come off.</li>
            <li> The product is good...</li>
            <li> The adhesive doesn&#x27;t seem strong enough. Several pads either ended up migrating to another part of my shirt or just fell of altogether when I applied them to silkier fabrics. On the plus side, these pads are quite thin and quiet.</li>
            <li> These garment shields do work, but it takes a little work to get them to work!  These work best in blazers as they do not shift at all.  But, in silk blouses, you will have to learn how to carefully place these pads in order to be able to wear them all day.  Otherwise, they will migrate.  So, yes, I would recommend.  They have saved me from having to immediately dry clean my blouses.</li>
            <li> The garment shields did work and kept my shirts dry. However, they were a little bulky. If you wear a white or very light colored shirt you can see the garment shield. Thought it was a little over priced, package only contains a 5 day supply.</li>

            <li> My daughter loved them.</li>
            <li> These are ok. They will stick to your skin though, and aren&#x27;t too absorbent.</li>
            <li> The idea seems great but once I started sweating the sticker peeled off and started getting stuck to other places so they were no longer absorbing my armpit or any sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of a give and take, on the plus side the adhesive leaves no residue but on the negative side its not strong enough to stay put with heavy sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe a non-heavy sweater would have better luck.</li>
            <li> These shields were too flimsy. Did not sick and bunched up. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> A little hard to put on the shirts without being seen.</li>
