            <li>What a great handcream.</li>
            <li>Every winter I&#x27;m in need of a great hand cream.</li>
            <li>This is a great product at a great value.</li>
            <li>Very nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This is THE most wonderful hand creme.  </li>
            <li>I have used this cream for over 20 years, I have tried MANY others over the years and this is the BEST!</li>
            <li>but when I tried Kamill I was most impressed.</li>
            <li>It has  a wonderful scent, goes on rich, but absorbs well and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>, it is a great cream with a very nice cost, lets say the cost benefit is tremendous.</li>
            <li>Originally had to get the cream on her trips to Europe, now able to purchase in the US&amp;#62; Very happy.</li>
            <li>This is my FAVORITE hand cream!  </li>
            <li>I love this cream!</li>
            <li>On top of the skin it forms a protective barrier (not greasy at all!)</li>
            <li>Ordered for my mother - she was so happy when she got it so quickly!  </li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely, without a hint of greasiness, and leaves what feels like a protective film on my hands that lasts through hand washing, or dishwashing.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best.</li>

            <li>This cream seems to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; for me more than most others.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I have used this handcream for many years.</li>
            <li>For the amount of product, I&#x27;d pay more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product, and it was a gift for many years, once a year, from a friend from Croatia.  </li>
            <li>So glad it is now available on Amazon!</li>
            <li>and I have been wondering how I could find more of this fantastic creme.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly and hydrates well.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell if it works to moisture your hands or help your nails, smell too strong.  </li>
            <li>my nails strong.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant, and I&#x27;m able to feel the difference instantly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s herbal, like camomile and some light pine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>I hope you always have a good supply for future purchase.    </li>
            <li>It is more convenient since I use so much .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always liked this cream, and I was very upset because I had no way anymore to buy it from Germany, thanks god I found in Amazon</li>
            <li>I have used kamill creme for nearly 20 years, I love it.  </li>
            <li>If your skin is dry you will love this, and it WILL NOT BE GREASY!</li>
            <li>I received my first container as a gift.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to my patients with rough hands (especially during winter months) and had more than good feed back.</li>
            <li>My hands are no longer dry and my cuticles love it ,too.  </li>
            <li>Thanks,  BKM</li>
            <li>It really helps my nails as well as my hands.  </li>
            <li>thanks Kamil.</li>
            <li>It is the only one that keeps my hands smooth.</li>
            <li>The smell is beautiful and it&#x27;s not greasy or uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into your skin quickly and lasts through several washings.</li>
            <li>Not greasy or highly fragranced.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>My knuckles start cracking, scabbing, the skin on the outside of hands starts to catch on my sweaters, and it looks and feels like sandpaper, plus the burning sensation that only intensifies when I put on less than great hand cream.</li>
            <li>I have trouble with mild rashes on the back of my hands and also get hang nails easily.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who&lt;br /&gt;wamts soft hands fast and may have less then strong nails.</li>
            <li>I wanted something other than Aquaphor, filled with mineral oil, and I found it in this product.</li>
            <li>Voila - I found it and more and am so anxious to try the body lotion.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hands so soft and&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 92 years of age, and although during my younger years my skin was very &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;, it has now become extremely dry; and my body seem to absolutely &amp;#34;devour</li>
            <li>so teh surface of the skin does not dry</li>

            <li> only minor downside is that you have to dip your fingers into the jar so this can potentially introduce in bacteria.</li>
            <li> I live in NM where the air is usually quite dry.</li>
            <li> Totally recommend it, especially during the winter when you hands can get a little &amp;#34;chapped&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This cream cleared up the rash, and after getting addicted to it, I used to buy it in Germany and bring it home in large quantities.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little but it lasts all day and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> It not only keeps my hand skin moist but removes small cracks and wrinkles, clears up minor rashes and keeps my nails from drying out.</li>
            <li> My aunt used to bring it back to me from Germany or I would go to the German market near my house to pick some up, but since moving I have been unable to locate it (or have it brought to me).  </li>
            <li> If left for long time on room temperature it loses its quality.</li>
            <li> When I start running low, I get a little anxious.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the usual moisturizing products from Vaseline, etc etc.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than buying a ticket to Germany.</li>
            <li> Also, once you get the cream on your hands, it is almost impossible to get the lid off because it is then too slippery.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to receive the 150 mg., containers of it.</li>

            <li> I received my first container as a gift. I am a critical care RN and have horses. So, I am constantly washing my hands. This cream is fabulous! Not greasy or highly fragranced. It absorbs into your skin quickly and lasts through several washings.My hands are no longer dry and my cuticles love it ,too.  I have bought several to give as gifts I love it so much.</li>
            <li> I have used kamill creme for nearly 20 years, I love it.  When I start running low, I get a little anxious.  It is the best hand and foot creme there is.  I also use it as a body creme, because nothing else works as well.      I hope you always have a good supply for future purchase.    Thanks,  BKM</li>
            <li> Awesome cream! One of the best moisturizing creams.</li>
            <li> This is THE most wonderful hand creme.  My dear mother-in-law was from Austria and she used to bring this back for me when she made trips home.  She passed away last year and I&#x27;m just finishing the last jar she gave me and I have been wondering how I could find more of this fantastic creme.  So I decided to try the internet and ---  Voila - I found it and more and am so anxious to try the body lotion.  I know I&#x27;ll like it as this is just a wonderfully made product.  It really helps my nails as well as my hands.  Amazon price is the best too!</li>
            <li> Ordered for my mother - she was so happy when she got it so quickly!  It&#x27;s her favorite cream.  Thank yoU!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for over 20 years, I have tried MANY others over the years and this is the BEST! If your skin is dry you will love this, and it WILL NOT BE GREASY!</li>
            <li> Gave it away. Can&#x27;t tell if it works to moisture your hands or help your nails, smell too strong.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  Also, once you get the cream on your hands, it is almost impossible to get the lid off because it is then too slippery.  Not a recommended product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cream for my mom. She is very happy with it. thanks Kamil. I ll order again for sure.</li>
            <li> I live in NM where the air is usually quite dry. I have trouble with mild rashes on the back of my hands and also get hang nails easily. I have tried the usual moisturizing products from Vaseline, etc etc. They help but when I tried Kamill I was most impressed. It only takes a little but it lasts all day and is not greasy. It not only keeps my hand skin moist but removes small cracks and wrinkles, clears up minor rashes and keeps my nails from drying out. My wife is equally pleased. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> What a great handcream. Leaves my hands so soft and&lt;br /&gt;makes my nails strong. I recommend this to anyone who&lt;br /&gt;wamts soft hands fast and may have less then strong nails.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I only wear it at night before going to bed, but within a week&#x27;s use, my hands were transformed into the softest hands ever. I couldn&#x27;t stop touching them. The lactic acid ingredient is key as it promotes cell turnover (exfoliation.) The smell is beautiful and it&#x27;s not greasy or uncomfortable to wear. The Germans know their stuff!</li>
            <li> I am 92 years of age, and although during my younger years my skin was very &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;, it has now become extremely dry; and my body seem to absolutely &amp;#34;devour any &amp; all creams. I&#x27;m continuously having apply copious amounts and throughout the day, because of that!&lt;br /&gt;  This cream seems to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; for me more than most others.&lt;br /&gt;  I was disappointed to receive the 150 mg., containers of it. I didn&#x27;t know it came in anything but the 250 mg. . There was shone no offer of measurement displayed.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve always received the 250 mg. container. I prefer the 250 mg,  containers. It is more convenient since I use so much .&lt;br /&gt;  In the future I only want the 250 mg, amount. Please acknowledge that you have received my request, so when I order next time I will not be sent the 150 mg, containers of Kamill Cream.  The smaller ones are a  &amp;#34;neucience&amp;#34;  to remove the cream from!  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;  I appreciate your following up on this order.</li>
            <li> I have used this handcream for many years. It is by far the best.</li>

            <li> I use this hand cream for 50 years. It is the only one that keeps my hands smooth. I recommend it to my patients with rough hands (especially during winter months) and had more than good feed back. I buy several jars and keep it in the fridge (jars I&#x27;m not using currently). If left for long time on room temperature it loses its quality.</li>

            <li> Best hand cream in the world! I discovered this cream in Germany, when my sister-in-law had a rash on her hands that would not go away. This cream cleared up the rash, and after getting addicted to it, I used to buy it in Germany and bring it home in large quantities. It has  a wonderful scent, goes on rich, but absorbs well and is not greasy. So glad it is now available on Amazon! Much less expensive than buying a ticket to Germany.</li>
            <li> Rather greasy--takes a lot of rubbing in.  Very nice fragrance.  I still prefer the Camille Beckmann unscented although it&#x27;s pricey.</li>
