            <li>Great Idea!</li>
            <li>We are both very happy with the results, and will continue using these products.</li>
            <li>but it is brilliant.</li>
            <li>and now she doesnt get ingrown s. Happy wife, happy life!!!!</li>
            <li>I even tried it on my legs and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>but this is so cool!!!</li>
            <li>Even though I read up on the best way to do it, got a brand new, 5 blade razor, very good shave cream, etc</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>so they are not cost effective at all.</li>
            <li>This thing is so very useful I really love it!!  </li>
            <li>but I may need to get used to the shape in order to use them more effectively.</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>Oh, and on top of that they don&#x27;t do anything to make my stubble any softer.</li>
            <li>Such a cute lil product--I&#x27;m stocking up!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product- discreet, compact and effective !</li>
            <li>Good price and very portable too.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product, saw it on Original Beauty Boxes Instagram / blog and decided to try it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s essentially fine sandpaper.</li>
            <li>Turns out it worked as advertised, but she loves it because she used it to lightly scrub around</li>
            <li>My legs were super smooth after and i noticed that I don&#x27;t have to shave as often as before.</li>
            <li>I tried it and it really does soften the hairs making intimacy more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product after reading about it on a fashion blog and it is so cool.</li>
            <li>It worked so well that I had wished at the time that there was a women&#x27;s version and lucky for me, my wish came true.</li>
            <li>Like most women, I am very sensitive around my lady parts and always looking for grooming tools and ideas....</li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li>The uses I did get out of it gave me an easy &amp; close shave with soft, smooth legs.</li>
            <li>And I did it during that time of the month which should be the time you are most sensitive.  </li>
            <li>What an amazing idea...sounds kind of dumb</li>
            <li>I can get about 5 uses out of one pad which makes it pretty economical too.</li>
            <li>Let me explain why I got these first.  </li>
            <li>The same pad can be used more than once</li>

            <li>I recently became a mother and as many of you know</li>
            <li>but I will for sure be using this product for the long run.</li>

            <li>No matter how lightly I&#x27;d press and following the direction to the T.</li>
            <li>After pregnancy my legs + thighs + bikini area went from soft and smooth to bumpy and sensitive.</li>

            <li>I still have two more pads left, but I&#x27;ll see if I can hopefully find Soften Her or something similar in stores.</li>
            <li>Ok, here&#x27;s the deal with these little pads-</li>
            <li>I was over enthusiastic about using it and rubed too hard on my skin.</li>
            <li>The pads are maybe 2&amp;#34;-2.5&amp;#34; in diameter (I&#x27;m being generous here) and may work for a man&#x27;s face but definitely weren&#x27;t worth wasting my money for.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, very dry, fair skin and dark hair.</li>
            <li>And it took forever to remove my thick dark sexy leg hairs :-)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend NOT getting these if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The key here is to be gentle!</li>
            <li>There are 2 main reasons I like Soften Her: I no longer get ingrown hairs in my lady region and the hair itself becomes soft, which in turn means it does not stick to my clothes or prevent any potential intimate sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My girlfriend and I purchased both the Soft goat and Soften Her, as far as I can tell they are exactly the same, just Soften</li>
            <li>I had bought my husband the men&#x27;s version of this product (The Soft Goat) because his stubble used to scratch me when we kissed.</li>
            <li>they do take off the stubble on your legs, but I had to scrape my legs so much that my legs are still stinging the next day.</li>
            <li>pregnancy comes with major body changes.</li>
            <li>I decided to try shaving down there for the first time.  </li>
            <li>To use a softening pad, you just slip your fingers underneath the strap on the back and apply it to your clean body hair and work in small circles.</li>
            <li>Works very well, exfoliates while sanding down and rounding the ends of stubble and cut hair.</li>
            <li>Since I found this little gem it has made shaving so much easier</li>

            <li> ;, it got rid of some stubble bumps which one of my other tools created.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I had to put a towel down under neath me when I used it on my legs because of all of the dead skin and hair that came off</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because of what people said about pain</li>
            <li> Waste of money unless you like to feel like you just rubbed yourself down with a nail file!</li>
            <li> Works well, but don&#x27;t be heavy handed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste yours either.</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is the design/size.  </li>
            <li> and as soon as the hair starts to grow back, it is annoyingly itchy for me and my husband has the same problem I had with his stubble</li>
            <li> If you press to hard, it hurts.</li>
            <li> It says not to push/buff too hard, but if you don&#x27;t nothing happens.</li>
            <li> Well, nothing happens even if you push too hard.</li>
            <li> The hair on my legs grows in crazy directions and I get bumps on the back of my legs, in-grown hairs.</li>
            <li> If I were to use it again I wouldn&#x27;t exfoliate in the shower for at least a day beforehand, then expect some sensitivity after.</li>
            <li> (if you know what I mean.)</li>
            <li> I found it slightly awkward to get in there with the round shape.  </li>
            <li> It seems as though it makes the experience slightly less painful.</li>
            <li> Just afraid ur skin with a brush,lol</li>
            <li> I have tried products like Nair, Nads and even electrolysis all were inconvenient and even painful.</li>
            <li> I was frustrated and itching.  </li>
            <li> It helped exfoliate the skin which made the bumps not so painful or itchy.  </li>
            <li> Gets rid of stubble which is so annoying</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was over enthusiastic about using it and rubed too hard on my skin. Ouch. And it took forever to remove my thick dark sexy leg hairs :-)</li>
            <li> This thing is so very useful I really love it!!  It has helped me with ingrown hairs.  For some time now I have had trouble and this has been the only thing that has truly made a difference. Thank You Soften Her!!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this! I have sensitive, very dry, fair skin and dark hair. The hair on my legs grows in crazy directions and I get bumps on the back of my legs, in-grown hairs. Yuck. I tried this product after reading about it on a fashion blog and it is so cool. It really looked like it just took all the hair off of my leg. My legs were super smooth after and i noticed that I don&#x27;t have to shave as often as before. I had to put a towel down under neath me when I used it on my legs because of all of the dead skin and hair that came off but I will for sure be using this product for the long run.</li>
            <li> I give this a four stars because I wish the pads would last longer, after about two uses one of them started losing its abrasive quality. The uses I did get out of it gave me an easy &amp; close shave with soft, smooth legs. I still have two more pads left, but I&#x27;ll see if I can hopefully find Soften Her or something similar in stores.</li>
            <li> proved to be too rough</li>
            <li> Let me explain why I got these first.  I decided to try shaving down there for the first time.  Even though I read up on the best way to do it, got a brand new, 5 blade razor, very good shave cream, etc... I still ended up with ingrown hairs!  I was frustrated and itching.  I tried to exfoliate but frankly I didn&#x27;t want to touch that area cause it was so prickly.  So I found and ordered these.  I was a little hesitant because of what people said about pain but frankly, I didn&#x27;t have any pain issues at all.  And I did it during that time of the month which should be the time you are most sensitive.  My only real complaint is the design/size.  I found it slightly awkward to get in there with the round shape.  If it were my design, I would have made it a finger shape which would have made it easier to get into places.  I have to say that these definitely took the edge off.  It helped exfoliate the skin which made the bumps not so painful or itchy.  Also, I didn&#x27;t mind putting my hand there anymore since it didn&#x27;t feel as prickly.  So I would purchase them again and I think they did the job but I may need to get used to the shape in order to use them more effectively.</li>
            <li> These work as advertised, but they&#x27;re really rough on sensitive skin. It&#x27;s essentially fine sandpaper. I used it and my skin burned for days after. If I were to use it again I wouldn&#x27;t exfoliate in the shower for at least a day beforehand, then expect some sensitivity after. So be careful!</li>
            <li> Be careful!  Works well, but don&#x27;t be heavy handed.</li>
            <li> I had bought my husband the men&#x27;s version of this product (The Soft Goat) because his stubble used to scratch me when we kissed. It worked so well that I had wished at the time that there was a women&#x27;s version and lucky for me, my wish came true. I get a brazilian wax every 6 weeks or so and as soon as the hair starts to grow back, it is annoyingly itchy for me and my husband has the same problem I had with his stubble (if you know what I mean.) There are 2 main reasons I like Soften Her: I no longer get ingrown hairs in my lady region and the hair itself becomes soft, which in turn means it does not stick to my clothes or prevent any potential intimate sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is similar to the men&#x27;s product in that there are 3 softening pads and an instruction page inside the box. Both products work the same way, although it seems as though the ladies&#x27; version is softer. To use a softening pad, you just slip your fingers underneath the strap on the back and apply it to your clean body hair and work in small circles. The key here is to be gentle! If you press to hard, it hurts. After 30 seconds or so, the hair is softer. I like to use it immediately before my waxing appointment too. It seems as though it makes the experience slightly less painful. The same pad can be used more than once and it&#x27;s really a judgement call as to when its time to start using a new one. I can get about 5 uses out of one pad which makes it pretty economical too.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really help....pointless! Just afraid ur skin with a brush,lol</li>
            <li> What an amazing idea...sounds kind of dumb but it is brilliant. Like most women, I am very sensitive around my lady parts and always looking for grooming tools and ideas....this not only &amp;#34;softens her&amp;#34;, it got rid of some stubble bumps which one of my other tools created. Seems such a no-brainer but this is so cool!!! Such a cute lil product--I&#x27;m stocking up!!!</li>
            <li> I bought Soften Her because a friend told me about how she uses it for her coarse stubble around her bikini area.  I tried it and it really does soften the hairs making intimacy more comfortable.  I even tried it on my legs and it worked great.  It actually got rid of the hair altogether and  my legs also got exfoliated at the same time.  So if I don&#x27;t have time to shave, I can just use one of these Soften Her pads and I&#x27;m good to go.  Good price and very portable too.  Great Idea!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product, saw it on Original Beauty Boxes Instagram / blog and decided to try it. I have tried products like Nair, Nads and even electrolysis all were inconvenient and even painful. Since I found this little gem it has made shaving so much easier and I don&#x27;t have to do it as often anymore. I highly recommend this product- discreet, compact and effective !</li>
            <li> Ok, here&#x27;s the deal with these little pads- they do take off the stubble on your legs, but I had to scrape my legs so much that my legs are still stinging the next day. Also, they are $12 for 3 pads and it would take 3 pads just to do my legs one time- so they are not cost effective at all. I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> if I&#x27;m supposed to use this to buff my legs you must be joking. The pads are maybe 2&amp;#34;-2.5&amp;#34; in diameter (I&#x27;m being generous here) and may work for a man&#x27;s face but definitely weren&#x27;t worth wasting my money for. Don&#x27;t waste yours either.</li>
            <li> It says not to push/buff too hard, but if you don&#x27;t nothing happens. Well, nothing happens even if you push too hard. Didn&#x27;t affect my stubble at all, just gave me red, irritated skin. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend NOT getting these if you have sensitive skin. No matter how lightly I&#x27;d press and following the direction to the T. I only get microscopic cuts all over my skin that aren&#x27;t visible, but burn. Oh, and on top of that they don&#x27;t do anything to make my stubble any softer. Waste of money unless you like to feel like you just rubbed yourself down with a nail file!</li>
            <li> I recently became a mother and as many of you know pregnancy comes with major body changes. After pregnancy my legs + thighs + bikini area went from soft and smooth to bumpy and sensitive. After using soften her for just one week my skin is back to that silky smooth!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Works very well, exfoliates while sanding down and rounding the ends of stubble and cut hair. My girlfriend and I purchased both the Soft goat and Soften Her, as far as I can tell they are exactly the same, just Soften Her is pink. We are both very happy with the results, and will continue using these products.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Gets rid of stubble which is so annoying cause you couldn&#x27;t do anything about it before Soften Her.  Easy to use! Will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife. Turns out it worked as advertised, but she loves it because she used it to lightly scrub around and now she doesnt get ingrown s. Happy wife, happy life!!!!</li>
