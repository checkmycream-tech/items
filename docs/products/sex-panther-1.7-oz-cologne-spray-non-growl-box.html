            <li>This is a very nice smelling cologne.</li>
            <li>Slather some of this on your neck before you head to the ol&#x27; family reunion and you&#x27;re sure to have the best time of your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best way to describe this scent is, it smells like, like a used diaper, filled with Indian food!</li>
            <li>bought this as sort of a gag gift, but it smells good lol.</li>
            <li>I smelled it out of curiosity (as I have yet to give it to him yet) and it smells surprisingly nice!</li>
            <li>I think to have the opportunity to own and wear the cologne from my all time favorite movie is priceless.</li>
            <li>but it surprising smells really good.</li>
            <li>It tells the world that you can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t be stopped and that you like to smell good while you&#x27;re not being stopped.</li>
            <li>Recipient loved scent of cologne.</li>
            <li>Ron once described it as \\&quot;stinging the nostrils in a good way\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Smells good and girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li>all I know is that it does smell good and for the price</li>
            <li>I got this as a groomsman&#x27;s gift and it smells really good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite pungent, stings the nostrils - in a good way.</li>
            <li>This item was really good</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t give it a good review.</li>
            <li>this was a gift and he loved it.</li>
            <li>he LOVED it</li>
            <li>but it also smells really good</li>
            <li>We were hoping it smelled good</li>
            <li>and my brother loved his Christmas gift.</li>
            <li>The cologne is good.</li>
            <li>In a good way.</li>
            <li>I bought it as a birthday gift for someone and he loved it.</li>
            <li>Brought this as a gift for someone, they loved it.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loved it.</li>
            <li>really impressed with it, smells great, but the price is too much - maybe its because of the license.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It assaults the nostrils, but in a pleasant way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would sum it up like this: this stuff smells nice</li>
            <li>Very pleased with my purchase overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun conversation piece and a great gift!</li>
            <li>I think there might have been a bit of panther stuck in the spray nozzle because a very potent spray was emitted.</li>
            <li>- it smells okay, but it LINGERS!</li>
            <li>Love the scent!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny and smells great!  </li>
            <li>- thought it was hilarious!  </li>
            <li>My friend thought the gift was pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>I love Anchorman and figured I had to get this!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing though, a lot better than what I was expecting!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it smells pretty good!</li>
            <li>It was amazing to see the results.</li>
            <li>Either way, its amazing.</li>
            <li>amazing  </li>
            <li>It smelled amazing and came in a timely manor.</li>
            <li>I have since run out of the cologne and since my mom took away my allowance for molesting a family of badgers(illegal in my county) I have resorted to trying and making my own cologne to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll be thinking you&#x27;re wearing cologne and smell nice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve almost drown before with how many are thrown my direction when I mist this wickedly good scented water on me.</li>
            <li>so I knew that I&#x27;d be better off with this than London Gentleman or even the fabled Blackbeard&#x27;s Delight.</li>
            <li>it smells nice</li>
            <li>Gave this to a friend as a joke and turned out to be a surprisingly nice cologne.  </li>
            <li>It smells surprisingly nice.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice and is the bottle.</li>
            <li>Its acctually a really nice smell.</li>
            <li>It really smells great!!!!</li>
            <li>Everyone liked my Cologne, all ages.</li>
            <li>Winning Best girlfriend award and its actually smells really good too!</li>
            <li>Not the original packaging as shown in the movie Anchorman but still a great smelling cologne.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for smelling great on those special occasions.</li>
            <li>After a full shift at work if I smell my wrist it still smells like Sex Panther lol.</li>
            <li>quickly (Express shiping)&lt;br /&gt;+Works as a great gag or</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my best smelling cologne by far and everyone loves it.</li>
            <li>This is truly the most effective cologne I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>However, when I used it the scent was more \\&quot;pungent\\&quot; than I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li>Not that Drakkar Noir  is the best smelling cologne out there, but it is far from the gut wrenching smell I would have thought Sex Panther would be.</li>
            <li>Got this for my husband as a joke, he loved it and it actually smells really good, lol, he used it all</li>
            <li>Great product, and it actually smells great.</li>
            <li>Look, if something sounds too good to be true, it probably IS.</li>
            <li>your own safety, do not stand too close to the ladies while enjoying the fine aroma of Sex Panther Cologne.</li>
            <li>Cologne based off the famous scene in Anchorman.</li>
            <li>It does smell better then they mention in the movie however.</li>
            <li>It is more of a musky cologne and smells somewhat like something my dad would wear to church when I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only is this a memorable prop from one of the funniest movies ever, it smells great, too!</li>
            <li>Anyways it smells good and its a great present for any anchorman guy fan.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get more fitting than that.</li>
            <li>It is now officially one of our favorite colognes.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what to expect...</li>
            <li>It was better than I thought it would be</li>
            <li>i effin love this cologne.</li>
            <li>Will buy more.</li>
            <li>He got a good laugh out of it.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and I am sooooooo glad I did.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this the description said it had the metal box that roared when you lift off the top, it may have changed now.</li>
            <li>Ok, so this is a gag gift</li>
            <li>have tried many things, but most of the time people look at me in disgust and wrinkle their noses as if I am something on the bottom of their shoe that they wish someone had cleaned up before they had stepped in</li>
            <li>make sure the recipient has seen the movie.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on this.</li>
            <li>I bought it as a humorous gift for my boyfriend for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I am really glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>I love Anchorman and got this as more of a novelty gift than anything else.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Make love to them.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>If it was a $20 value, then sure.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>bought this cologne because I love Anchorman</li>
            <li>its more of am musky smell if thats what you&#x27;re into</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the movie \\&quot;fool you\\&quot; :)&lt;</li>
            <li>and now I have to get him some more.</li>
            <li>Even he was surprised with how good the cologne smells!</li>
            <li>This is flat out wonderful.</li>
            <li>He thought it was hilarious but also smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>Smells good and wasn&#x27;t defective like the bottle I purchased from Hot Topic.</li>
            <li>It does smell pretty good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it in the end for a fun novelty gift that actually is a great product to use.</li>
            <li>Oh and to top it off women acctually like it more than burberry classic/brit cool water, guess, aqua digo.</li>
            <li>Top notch cometion and this cheap bottles beats em all.</li>
            <li>Yep, it&#x27;s made with bits of real panther, so you know it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loved this gift, he had no idea it even existed, and it has bits of real panther in it.</li>
            <li>Made from bits of real panther, so you know its good.  </li>
            <li>Yep, it&#x27;s made with bits of real panther, so you know it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>He loved it and the fact that the cologne is not of a quality at all really adds to the funness of this gift.</li>
            <li>its made with bits of real panther so you know its good.</li>
            <li>The smell is fairly unique, in a very good way :) I would absolutely recommend (For your information, it&#x27;s safe to say that this cologne really doesn&#x27;t smell like Bigfoot&#x27;s dick)</li>
            <li>Other then that, is great!</li>
            <li>and I can easily tell if I&#x27;ve smelled something before.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful however very soon after purchasing the bottle broke and became completely unusable.  </li>
            <li>what cologne isn&#x27;t?&lt;br /&gt;It came very quickly, and without any damage at all.</li>
            <li>The first time a girl smells it, she gets all nice ane close to you.</li>
            <li>It is really cool to get something that resembles one of your favorite movies.  </li>
            <li>By morning you&#x27;ll be feline fine.</li>
            <li>my first misting of this magical tonic water, the surrounding area became filled with the presence of lovely ladies.</li>
            <li>Its a fine product it&#x27;s just cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I could just say that it stings the nostrils, but honestly it smells like pure gasoline.</li>
            <li>a finish of a used diapers filled with Indian food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>girls seem to enjoy the scent</li>
            <li>I smell fantastic.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>I got a cardboard box with what looked like the mechanism for sound to come out</li>
            <li>Cologne smells like cheap dollar store stuff.</li>
            <li>but it is also a humorous gift that made everyone laugh.</li>
            <li>Smells great and actually</li>
            <li>and I thought it would be really neat to own a cologne from the movie.</li>
            <li>For only 34$ I experienced a life changing journey.</li>
            <li>Actually it smells great.</li>
            <li>The Anchorman references you can use with this are totally worth the money, and the ladies love it.</li>
            <li>Smells like a used diaper filled with Indian food.</li>
            <li>I love it, my boyfriend uses it and it smells really good actually.</li>
            <li>This really is the best gift if you are totally out of gift ideas.  </li>
            <li>but it actually smells kind of nice.</li>
            <li>This actually smells REALLY FREAKING GOOD!!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what we were expecting!!  </li>
            <li>Will be back for more!!</li>
            <li>Got this as a gag joke for my boyfriends birthday &amp; he absolutely LOVES it!!!</li>
            <li>Sex Panther cologne really does smell pretty good.</li>
            <li>any &amp;#34;anchorman&amp;#34; fan will appreciate the product itself and the fact that it smells nice will turn it from a gag gift into a decent gift as is.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast, and packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>I bought this on the idea of it being funny, but when I actually smelt it and it is actually really good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad this is real!</li>
            <li>I felt as confident as Brian Fantana the first time I tried this cologne.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the speeding shipping too! :)</li>
            <li>I think it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see they had this</li>
            <li>Pretty sure there is reall panther in it.</li>
            <li>Now I wasn&#x27;t expecting something super fabulous for 35 dollars...</li>
            <li>What was supposed to be the smell of desire quickly turned into an aroma not unlike a used diaper filled with Indian food.</li>
            <li>I was also surprised to find out that this is not some cheap plastic bottle but a nice glass bottle you would find at any department store.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of a clean just out of the shower smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hilarious but also actually smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells okay too, nothing special, but a nice generic men&#x27;s cologne smell.</li>
            <li>but nothing too special.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to get this, it&#x27;s a christmas gift for my hubby.</li>
            <li>Cologne smells better than I thought&lt;br /&gt;Product came fast via mail</li>
            <li>Not that the scent matters - he would have loved it no matter what simply because it is from Anchorman.</li>
            <li>It actually smells really good.</li>
            <li>This cologne actually smells really good, my dad got it as a joke and ended up wearing it to my wedding, and he was the best-smelling guy in the place.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my fiance for Valentine&#x27;s Day as a joke because he loves the movie Anchorman and it actually smells really good</li>
            <li>, my penis grew 2 inches my jaw line chiseled, I now have a full eight pack of abs, every muscle in my body is tone</li>
            <li>I have a full jungle in my backyard, hungry animals waiting to protect their keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many knew it was from Anchorman but had no idea you could really buy it.</li>
            <li>but it actually smells really good.</li>
            <li>And you know what, it actually smells really good.</li>
            <li>Most of them don&#x27;t know it really exists.</li>
            <li>Not a bad smell at all.  </li>
            <li>The item was delivered quickly and in time for Christmas</li>
            <li>I walked out my front door, and before I got to the end of my driveway I had already given one lucky lady a mustache ride.  </li>
            <li>it could of escalated so quickly...</li>
            <li>just a fun gift for that special friend.  </li>
            <li>like others before me said, this cologne actually smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>This novelty cologne actually smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>but it actually smells pretty good</li>
            <li>Splash this on before a night out tomcattin&#x27;, lean back against the bar at your favorite watering hole, and watch all the pussies come a-purrin&#x27;!</li>
            <li>Smells almost exactly like gasoline!</li>
            <li>It actually smells pretty nice - a clean and musky smell.</li>
            <li>I got this because I wanted something fun for the desk in my office</li>
            <li>It is also fun to joke about it and quote the movie.</li>
            <li>a nice smell - very similar to Hugo Boss.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start by saying that the only shirt that I own is Three Wolf Moon.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it just as a display piece.</li>
            <li>But armani isn&#x27;t as much fun to say or look at.</li>
            <li>The look of surprise and laugh this gift elicited was worth the price, just this once.</li>
            <li>This cologne definitely could use a few more bits of real panther; otherwise, a great product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>We all got a good laugh out of the gift, but now I&#x27;m wishing we spent the money on something else.</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff to put in my bathroom to get a laugh or two from guests when they see it.</li>
            <li>So, I bought this mostly as a joke, but I was surprised that it actually smells kinda nice.</li>
            <li>We made everyone jealous when this was given recently as a gift to a a guy at a party we had in a popular restaurant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually a nice scent, and we are big fans of the Anchorman Series.</li>
            <li>I was going to wrap it up and put it under the tree right away</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast and the bottle is really cool, too.</li>
            <li>Clean, crisp, nothing like pure gasoline or Bigfoot haha.</li>
            <li>The original packaging I received was damaged but the seller immediately sent me a new box, so I appreciate that.</li>
            <li>I thought I was a gag at first and was a little bummed that it wasn&#x27;t in a panther shaped bottle, but it turns out that it smells really good.</li>
            <li>It smells similar (but better than) to Axe Body Spray, my girl friend swears that it does&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely classier than London Gentleman and more formidable than Blackbeard&#x27;s Delight.</li>
            <li>but I just had to smell it first.</li>
            <li>first spray, I immediately sprouted a mustache.  </li>
            <li>It looks funny on your dresser (my girlfriend is embarrased if people see it on my dresser;)  </li>
            <li>Never in my life have I ever been able to grow facial hair until this product arrived.</li>
            <li>Anchorman is such a hilarious movie.</li>
            <li>Got this for my brother, he thought it was funny.  </li>
            <li>and it really smells like Bigfoot&#x27;s d*ck!</li>
            <li>My friends think it&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li>Well, at first i bought it  thinking..</li>
            <li>Really funny nic nack</li>
            <li>I ever had I first met wearing this.</li>
            <li>This is the cologne that is used in the first Anchorman movie.</li>
            <li>The title is too funny to ignore.</li>
            <li>It does not smell like pure gasoline or any of the other comparisons from the movie, it actually smells really good luckily!</li>
            <li>had saved his money from mowing lawns the entire summer and told me that I was his big bubba and he loved me.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for something a little more musky or unique.</li>
            <li>was very nervous when I first received this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for such a fun gift!!</li>
            <li>i love ron burgandy, and only a scent this formidable could come close to his high glory...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong  and would definitely buy again once this one runs out.</li>
            <li>pure gasoline</li>
            <li>It smells like pure gasoline</li>
            <li>Does not smell like pure gasoline.</li>
            <li>(it doesn&#x27;t smell like pure gasoline)</li>
            <li>Ive had my bottle for a year now and havent really used it.</li>
            <li>It does NOT have real bits of panther&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>- how do I know that this product is really going to work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really dissapointed and do not want to take lunch to wait in line at the post office during lunch to return this garbage.</li>
            <li>my wing man)always pick up girls while our colleagues that dont wear it ( champ and brick) never pick up girls very often.</li>
            <li>(Thanks Brian Fantana ...</li>
            <li>I like it because it smells like straight gasoline.</li>
            <li>The Reviewer is no longer capable of continuing his response.  </li>
            <li>bottle from the movie and if the label that lists the ingredients said &amp;#34;Made with bits of real panther, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems that I have an animal magnetism that can only be explained by the power of this mighty cologne.  </li>
            <li>I was really unsure about what to expect with this product.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I wish there would be a movie quote or print on the bottle of ingredients (bits of real panther).</li>
            <li>Really good!&lt;br /&gt;+Got here</li>
            <li>Definitely does not smell like a used diaper filled with Indian food.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how much of a pussy</li>
            <li>made from real panther.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for any Anchorman fan!</li>
            <li>Put this stuff on and instantly had my fifteen acres filled with women and honey badgers.</li>
            <li>I bought this cologne with the expectation that it was made with bits of real panther.</li>
            <li>As far as quality is concerned you could find something of the same or better quality at any store.</li>
            <li>The only few issues i have with it are very minor; It does come exactly as pictured but it would have been awesome if it came in the panther head</li>
            <li>(was hoping to kill two birds with one stone, buy a funny gift and get a new smell on him, guess I&#x27;m screwed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to knock your socks off, but I would definitely recommend trying it out for a reasonably priced, unique smell.</li>
            <li>long as you know this is just a joke you&#x27;ll be fine, but don&#x27;t buying thinking there is anything real about it.</li>
            <li>Good product, and not worth sending back because of that.</li>
            <li>Sex Panther is very potent, i learned this the hard way, so don&#x27;t use but</li>
            <li>Prolly better off buying a Breitling if you REALLY want a girlfriend for a half hour.</li>
            <li>for the smell, it is a nice subtle scent reminding me of a cross between pure gasoline and a diaper filled with Indian food.</li>
            <li>The scent is similar to Cool Water by Davidoff and Acqua Di Gio By Giorgio Armani.</li>
            <li>and I have a pretty sensitive nose</li>
            <li>It says I have to write down 11 more words so....</li>
            <li>many are skeptical whether it smells like bigfoot or other non attractive scents, and well let me put it this way...</li>
            <li>Better than London Gentleman and Black Beards delight.  </li>
            <li>We purchased this more or less as a gag gift for our son for Christmas.</li>
            <li>For $50 I could&#x27;ve bought decent cologne but that wasn&#x27;t the point of the purchase.</li>
            <li>sure as the sky is blue, 6 out of every ten women I asked jumped on board and road that fiery highway all the way to the end of the line.  </li>
            <li>I suppose and it smells decent but it was leaking when I got the package.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I&#x27;m giving this item a decent review is because it made me laugh</li>
            <li>This was a great gag gift, though an expensive one.</li>
            <li>I normally wear armani acqua di gio.  </li>
            <li>Personally I think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced at nearly $40 plus s&amp;h but a cool gift nonetheless for fans.</li>
            <li>so the top coming off easy is a little down sided for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna put it out there; if you like it, you can take it, if you don&#x27;t, send it right back.</li>
            <li>wore it to school the next day and noticed that teachers seemed to bend over a lot more in front of me, the girls all seemed to stay near my locker, and the principal called me into his office for a \\&quot;long talk.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased it as new.</li>
            <li>Now I live in the woods and don&#x27;t give a s</li>
            <li>feel like a new person.</li>
            <li>Its illegal in 40+ countries, and it is made out of bits and pieces of real panthers.&lt;br /&gt;It has a formidable sent, that stings the nostrils - in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>As well as serving its novelty purposes, it seriously smells manly and nice.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to find out it smelled like Drakkar Noir.</li>
            <li>I was pretty butt-hurt about this and almost wanted to send it back for that reason.</li>
            <li>This product is only effective 60% of the time all the time (oxymoron) if your skeptical and gullible enough to believe that an odor or a scent can make you more desirable.</li>
            <li>I would rate this product a five out of five, but since I&#x27;m blind and impotent now, I kind of wish I had purchased this product first.</li>
            <li>This cologne is the exact same chemical make-up as Drakkar noir which is a spin off of old spice.</li>
            <li>It smells like fresh, clean man!&lt;br /&gt;I was a tad disappointed that it did not come in the better quality box.</li>
            <li>I find it hard to write this review because of all the women hanging all over me after just one squirt of this magic scent.</li>
            <li>i caught me a massive barracuda of a love fish and was forced to take certain actions to suppress the matter...</li>
            <li>From young tawny kitaens to old cougars, they&#x27;ll all want to get their claws into you.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>stay classy, Planet Earth.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a Christmas gift for my  boyfriend, he loves the frangrance and it drove me wild.</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised.</li>
            <li>Obviously purchased it as a novelty gift....mostly for the &amp;#34;growl&amp;#34; when opening the box, and then of course the bits of real panther.  </li>
            <li>Where do I even start, upon arrival package was delivered by a busty somewhat already aroused UPS woman.</li>
            <li>, I have 17 tattoos total on my body, were talking a real man&#x27;s man.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was all accomplished by one simple spray of the cologne, I haven&#x27;t even began to talk about what happens with the women in my life.</li>
            <li>I opened up the bottle and was immediately surprised to hear the panthers growl, but I was soon horrified when I found out how pungent it was.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a masculine scent</li>
            <li>you stay classy ;}</li>
            <li>You will be surprised by the power of the Sex Panther.</li>
            <li>Although it is illegal in nine countries due to having real panther bits in it, this cologne has a very nice smell to it.</li>
            <li>more of a novelty than anything serious but doesn&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
            <li>It was really funny seeing my cousin open it but the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the box did not roar</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very good at describing smells..not really sure what adjectives to use.. but simply put, it smells good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Due to the constant bombardment of women, he no longer is able to use his hands for anything other than sex.  </li>
            <li>It smells like no other.</li>
            <li>This is almost a carbon copy for some sort of axe or old spice, I didn&#x27;t have enough time to decide which one (my husband wears both)</li>
            <li>I hunt and fish with my bare hands, all equipment made by my bare</li>
            <li>Later in the day, on assignment, I was out of the office and a young woman approached me.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, a woman in accounting with an acute brain injury believed it to smell like a derivative of oil and others became upset in the hysteria.</li>
            <li>I now have a beard that is uncontrollable,my testosterone levels have been raised, I have a natural skill in mixed martial arts, I drive a lifted truck</li>
            <li>Needless to say, the lovely evening I had planned quickly took a turn for the worse thanks to a cologne that smells like a turd covered in burnt hair.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it did not have that signature growl I expected upon opening the box, but it does not detract from how nice it is in general.</li>
            <li>Our best friend is obsessed with the movie!!!  </li>
            <li>Little did I know, the cologne does not smell like pure gasoline or big foot&#x27;s dick.</li>
            <li>Seems a little much, but I did recently find out this cologne was in a movie</li>

            <li> I think to have the opportunity to own and wear the cologne from my all time favorite movie is priceless.</li>
            <li> but it surprising smells really good.</li>
            <li> It tells the world that you can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t be stopped and that you like to smell good while you&#x27;re not being stopped.</li>
            <li> Recipient loved scent of cologne.</li>

            <li> so I can&#x27;t give it a good review.</li>
            <li> this was a gift and he loved it.</li>
            <li> he LOVED it</li>
            <li> but it also smells really good</li>
            <li> We were hoping it smelled good</li>
            <li> and my brother loved his Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> The cologne is good.</li>

            <li> Brought this as a gift for someone, they loved it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loved it.</li>

            <li> It assaults the nostrils, but in a pleasant way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would sum it up like this: this stuff smells nice</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fun conversation piece and a great gift!</li>
            <li> I think there might have been a bit of panther stuck in the spray nozzle because a very potent spray was emitted.</li>
            <li> - it smells okay, but it LINGERS!</li>
            <li> Love the scent!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny and smells great!  </li>
            <li> - thought it was hilarious!  </li>
            <li> My friend thought the gift was pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> I love Anchorman and figured I had to get this!</li>
            <li> It smells amazing though, a lot better than what I was expecting!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it smells pretty good!</li>
            <li> It was amazing to see the results.</li>
            <li> Either way, its amazing.</li>
            <li> amazing  </li>
            <li> It smelled amazing and came in a timely manor.</li>
            <li> I have since run out of the cologne and since my mom took away my allowance for molesting a family of badgers(illegal in my county) I have resorted to trying and making my own cologne to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll be thinking you&#x27;re wearing cologne and smell nice.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve almost drown before with how many are thrown my direction when I mist this wickedly good scented water on me.</li>
            <li> so I knew that I&#x27;d be better off with this than London Gentleman or even the fabled Blackbeard&#x27;s Delight.</li>
            <li> it smells nice</li>
            <li> Gave this to a friend as a joke and turned out to be a surprisingly nice cologne.  </li>
            <li> It smells surprisingly nice.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice and is the bottle.</li>
            <li> Its acctually a really nice smell.</li>
            <li> It really smells great!!!!</li>
            <li> Everyone liked my Cologne, all ages.</li>
            <li> Winning Best girlfriend award and its actually smells really good too!</li>
            <li> Not the original packaging as shown in the movie Anchorman but still a great smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for smelling great on those special occasions.</li>
            <li> After a full shift at work if I smell my wrist it still smells like Sex Panther lol.</li>
            <li> quickly (Express shiping)&lt;br /&gt;+Works as a great gag or</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my best smelling cologne by far and everyone loves it.</li>
            <li> This is truly the most effective cologne I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> However, when I used it the scent was more \\&quot;pungent\\&quot; than I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li> Not that Drakkar Noir  is the best smelling cologne out there, but it is far from the gut wrenching smell I would have thought Sex Panther would be.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband as a joke, he loved it and it actually smells really good, lol, he used it all</li>
            <li> Great product, and it actually smells great.</li>
            <li> Look, if something sounds too good to be true, it probably IS.</li>
            <li> your own safety, do not stand too close to the ladies while enjoying the fine aroma of Sex Panther Cologne.</li>
            <li> Cologne based off the famous scene in Anchorman.</li>
            <li> It does smell better then they mention in the movie however.</li>
            <li> It is more of a musky cologne and smells somewhat like something my dad would wear to church when I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only is this a memorable prop from one of the funniest movies ever, it smells great, too!</li>
            <li> Anyways it smells good and its a great present for any anchorman guy fan.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get more fitting than that.</li>
            <li> It is now officially one of our favorite colognes.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what to expect...</li>

            <li> He got a good laugh out of it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and I am sooooooo glad I did.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this the description said it had the metal box that roared when you lift off the top, it may have changed now.</li>
            <li> Ok, so this is a gag gift</li>
            <li> have tried many things, but most of the time people look at me in disgust and wrinkle their noses as if I am something on the bottom of their shoe that they wish someone had cleaned up before they had stepped in</li>
            <li> make sure the recipient has seen the movie.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a humorous gift for my boyfriend for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love Anchorman and got this as more of a novelty gift than anything else.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Make love to them.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> If it was a $20 value, then sure.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> bought this cologne because I love Anchorman</li>
            <li> its more of am musky smell if thats what you&#x27;re into</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the movie \\&quot;fool you\\&quot; :)&lt;</li>
            <li> and now I have to get him some more.</li>
            <li> Even he was surprised with how good the cologne smells!</li>
            <li> This is flat out wonderful.</li>
            <li> He thought it was hilarious but also smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> Smells good and wasn&#x27;t defective like the bottle I purchased from Hot Topic.</li>
            <li> It does smell pretty good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it in the end for a fun novelty gift that actually is a great product to use.</li>
            <li> Oh and to top it off women acctually like it more than burberry classic/brit cool water, guess, aqua digo.</li>
            <li> Top notch cometion and this cheap bottles beats em all.</li>
            <li> Yep, it&#x27;s made with bits of real panther, so you know it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loved this gift, he had no idea it even existed, and it has bits of real panther in it.</li>
            <li> Made from bits of real panther, so you know its good.  </li>
            <li> Yep, it&#x27;s made with bits of real panther, so you know it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> He loved it and the fact that the cologne is not of a quality at all really adds to the funness of this gift.</li>
            <li> its made with bits of real panther so you know its good.</li>
            <li> The smell is fairly unique, in a very good way :) I would absolutely recommend (For your information, it&#x27;s safe to say that this cologne really doesn&#x27;t smell like Bigfoot&#x27;s dick)</li>
            <li> Other then that, is great!</li>
            <li> and I can easily tell if I&#x27;ve smelled something before.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful however very soon after purchasing the bottle broke and became completely unusable.  </li>
            <li> what cologne isn&#x27;t?&lt;br /&gt;It came very quickly, and without any damage at all.</li>
            <li> The first time a girl smells it, she gets all nice ane close to you.</li>
            <li> It is really cool to get something that resembles one of your favorite movies.  </li>
            <li> By morning you&#x27;ll be feline fine.</li>
            <li> my first misting of this magical tonic water, the surrounding area became filled with the presence of lovely ladies.</li>
            <li> Its a fine product it&#x27;s just cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I could just say that it stings the nostrils, but honestly it smells like pure gasoline.</li>
            <li> a finish of a used diapers filled with Indian food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> girls seem to enjoy the scent</li>
            <li> I smell fantastic.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> I got a cardboard box with what looked like the mechanism for sound to come out</li>
            <li> Cologne smells like cheap dollar store stuff.</li>
            <li> but it is also a humorous gift that made everyone laugh.</li>
            <li> Smells great and actually</li>
            <li> and I thought it would be really neat to own a cologne from the movie.</li>
            <li> For only 34$ I experienced a life changing journey.</li>
            <li> Actually it smells great.</li>
            <li> The Anchorman references you can use with this are totally worth the money, and the ladies love it.</li>
            <li> Smells like a used diaper filled with Indian food.</li>
            <li> I love it, my boyfriend uses it and it smells really good actually.</li>
            <li> This really is the best gift if you are totally out of gift ideas.  </li>
            <li> but it actually smells kind of nice.</li>
            <li> This actually smells REALLY FREAKING GOOD!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were expecting!!  </li>
            <li> Will be back for more!!</li>
            <li> Got this as a gag joke for my boyfriends birthday &amp; he absolutely LOVES it!!!</li>
            <li> Sex Panther cologne really does smell pretty good.</li>
            <li> any &amp;#34;anchorman&amp;#34; fan will appreciate the product itself and the fact that it smells nice will turn it from a gag gift into a decent gift as is.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast, and packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the idea of it being funny, but when I actually smelt it and it is actually really good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad this is real!</li>
            <li> I felt as confident as Brian Fantana the first time I tried this cologne.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the speeding shipping too! :)</li>
            <li> I think it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see they had this</li>
            <li> Pretty sure there is reall panther in it.</li>
            <li> Now I wasn&#x27;t expecting something super fabulous for 35 dollars...</li>
            <li> What was supposed to be the smell of desire quickly turned into an aroma not unlike a used diaper filled with Indian food.</li>
            <li> I was also surprised to find out that this is not some cheap plastic bottle but a nice glass bottle you would find at any department store.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of a clean just out of the shower smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hilarious but also actually smells amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells okay too, nothing special, but a nice generic men&#x27;s cologne smell.</li>
            <li> but nothing too special.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get this, it&#x27;s a christmas gift for my hubby.</li>
            <li> Cologne smells better than I thought&lt;br /&gt;Product came fast via mail</li>
            <li> Not that the scent matters - he would have loved it no matter what simply because it is from Anchorman.</li>
            <li> It actually smells really good.</li>
            <li> This cologne actually smells really good, my dad got it as a joke and ended up wearing it to my wedding, and he was the best-smelling guy in the place.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance for Valentine&#x27;s Day as a joke because he loves the movie Anchorman and it actually smells really good</li>
            <li> , my penis grew 2 inches my jaw line chiseled, I now have a full eight pack of abs, every muscle in my body is tone</li>
            <li> I have a full jungle in my backyard, hungry animals waiting to protect their keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many knew it was from Anchorman but had no idea you could really buy it.</li>
            <li> but it actually smells really good.</li>
            <li> And you know what, it actually smells really good.</li>
            <li> Most of them don&#x27;t know it really exists.</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell at all.  </li>
            <li> The item was delivered quickly and in time for Christmas</li>
            <li> I walked out my front door, and before I got to the end of my driveway I had already given one lucky lady a mustache ride.  </li>
            <li> it could of escalated so quickly...</li>
            <li> just a fun gift for that special friend.  </li>
            <li> like others before me said, this cologne actually smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> This novelty cologne actually smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> but it actually smells pretty good</li>
            <li> Splash this on before a night out tomcattin&#x27;, lean back against the bar at your favorite watering hole, and watch all the pussies come a-purrin&#x27;!</li>
            <li> Smells almost exactly like gasoline!</li>
            <li> It actually smells pretty nice - a clean and musky smell.</li>
            <li> I got this because I wanted something fun for the desk in my office</li>
            <li> It is also fun to joke about it and quote the movie.</li>
            <li> a nice smell - very similar to Hugo Boss.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that the only shirt that I own is Three Wolf Moon.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it just as a display piece.</li>
            <li> But armani isn&#x27;t as much fun to say or look at.</li>
            <li> The look of surprise and laugh this gift elicited was worth the price, just this once.</li>
            <li> This cologne definitely could use a few more bits of real panther; otherwise, a great product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> We all got a good laugh out of the gift, but now I&#x27;m wishing we spent the money on something else.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff to put in my bathroom to get a laugh or two from guests when they see it.</li>
            <li> So, I bought this mostly as a joke, but I was surprised that it actually smells kinda nice.</li>
            <li> We made everyone jealous when this was given recently as a gift to a a guy at a party we had in a popular restaurant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a nice scent, and we are big fans of the Anchorman Series.</li>
            <li> I was going to wrap it up and put it under the tree right away</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast and the bottle is really cool, too.</li>
            <li> Clean, crisp, nothing like pure gasoline or Bigfoot haha.</li>
            <li> The original packaging I received was damaged but the seller immediately sent me a new box, so I appreciate that.</li>
            <li> I thought I was a gag at first and was a little bummed that it wasn&#x27;t in a panther shaped bottle, but it turns out that it smells really good.</li>
            <li> It smells similar (but better than) to Axe Body Spray, my girl friend swears that it does&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely classier than London Gentleman and more formidable than Blackbeard&#x27;s Delight.</li>
            <li> but I just had to smell it first.</li>
            <li> first spray, I immediately sprouted a mustache.  </li>
            <li> It looks funny on your dresser (my girlfriend is embarrased if people see it on my dresser;)  </li>
            <li> Never in my life have I ever been able to grow facial hair until this product arrived.</li>
            <li> Anchorman is such a hilarious movie.</li>
            <li> Got this for my brother, he thought it was funny.  </li>
            <li> and it really smells like Bigfoot&#x27;s d*ck!</li>
            <li> My friends think it&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li> Well, at first i bought it  thinking..</li>
            <li> Really funny nic nack</li>
            <li> I ever had I first met wearing this.</li>
            <li> This is the cologne that is used in the first Anchorman movie.</li>
            <li> The title is too funny to ignore.</li>
            <li> It does not smell like pure gasoline or any of the other comparisons from the movie, it actually smells really good luckily!</li>
            <li> had saved his money from mowing lawns the entire summer and told me that I was his big bubba and he loved me.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for something a little more musky or unique.</li>
            <li> was very nervous when I first received this product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for such a fun gift!!</li>
            <li> i love ron burgandy, and only a scent this formidable could come close to his high glory...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong  and would definitely buy again once this one runs out.</li>
            <li> pure gasoline</li>
            <li> It smells like pure gasoline</li>
            <li> Does not smell like pure gasoline.</li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t smell like pure gasoline)</li>
            <li> Ive had my bottle for a year now and havent really used it.</li>
            <li> It does NOT have real bits of panther&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> - how do I know that this product is really going to work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really dissapointed and do not want to take lunch to wait in line at the post office during lunch to return this garbage.</li>
            <li> my wing man)always pick up girls while our colleagues that dont wear it ( champ and brick) never pick up girls very often.</li>
            <li> (Thanks Brian Fantana ...</li>
            <li> I like it because it smells like straight gasoline.</li>
            <li> The Reviewer is no longer capable of continuing his response.  </li>
            <li> bottle from the movie and if the label that lists the ingredients said &amp;#34;Made with bits of real panther, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems that I have an animal magnetism that can only be explained by the power of this mighty cologne.  </li>
            <li> I was really unsure about what to expect with this product.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> I wish there would be a movie quote or print on the bottle of ingredients (bits of real panther).</li>
            <li> Really good!&lt;br /&gt;+Got here</li>
            <li> Definitely does not smell like a used diaper filled with Indian food.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how much of a pussy</li>
            <li> made from real panther.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for any Anchorman fan!</li>
            <li> Put this stuff on and instantly had my fifteen acres filled with women and honey badgers.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne with the expectation that it was made with bits of real panther.</li>
            <li> As far as quality is concerned you could find something of the same or better quality at any store.</li>
            <li> The only few issues i have with it are very minor; It does come exactly as pictured but it would have been awesome if it came in the panther head</li>
            <li> (was hoping to kill two birds with one stone, buy a funny gift and get a new smell on him, guess I&#x27;m screwed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to knock your socks off, but I would definitely recommend trying it out for a reasonably priced, unique smell.</li>
            <li> long as you know this is just a joke you&#x27;ll be fine, but don&#x27;t buying thinking there is anything real about it.</li>
            <li> Good product, and not worth sending back because of that.</li>
            <li> Sex Panther is very potent, i learned this the hard way, so don&#x27;t use but</li>
            <li> Prolly better off buying a Breitling if you REALLY want a girlfriend for a half hour.</li>
            <li> for the smell, it is a nice subtle scent reminding me of a cross between pure gasoline and a diaper filled with Indian food.</li>
            <li> The scent is similar to Cool Water by Davidoff and Acqua Di Gio By Giorgio Armani.</li>
            <li> and I have a pretty sensitive nose</li>
            <li> It says I have to write down 11 more words so....</li>
            <li> many are skeptical whether it smells like bigfoot or other non attractive scents, and well let me put it this way...</li>
            <li> Better than London Gentleman and Black Beards delight.  </li>
            <li> We purchased this more or less as a gag gift for our son for Christmas.</li>
            <li> For $50 I could&#x27;ve bought decent cologne but that wasn&#x27;t the point of the purchase.</li>
            <li> sure as the sky is blue, 6 out of every ten women I asked jumped on board and road that fiery highway all the way to the end of the line.  </li>
            <li> I suppose and it smells decent but it was leaking when I got the package.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I&#x27;m giving this item a decent review is because it made me laugh</li>
            <li> This was a great gag gift, though an expensive one.</li>
            <li> I normally wear armani acqua di gio.  </li>
            <li> Personally I think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced at nearly $40 plus s&amp;h but a cool gift nonetheless for fans.</li>
            <li> so the top coming off easy is a little down sided for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna put it out there; if you like it, you can take it, if you don&#x27;t, send it right back.</li>
            <li> wore it to school the next day and noticed that teachers seemed to bend over a lot more in front of me, the girls all seemed to stay near my locker, and the principal called me into his office for a \\&quot;long talk.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased it as new.</li>
            <li> Now I live in the woods and don&#x27;t give a s</li>
            <li> feel like a new person.</li>
            <li> Its illegal in 40+ countries, and it is made out of bits and pieces of real panthers.&lt;br /&gt;It has a formidable sent, that stings the nostrils - in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> As well as serving its novelty purposes, it seriously smells manly and nice.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to find out it smelled like Drakkar Noir.</li>
            <li> I was pretty butt-hurt about this and almost wanted to send it back for that reason.</li>
            <li> This product is only effective 60% of the time all the time (oxymoron) if your skeptical and gullible enough to believe that an odor or a scent can make you more desirable.</li>
            <li> I would rate this product a five out of five, but since I&#x27;m blind and impotent now, I kind of wish I had purchased this product first.</li>
            <li> This cologne is the exact same chemical make-up as Drakkar noir which is a spin off of old spice.</li>
            <li> It smells like fresh, clean man!&lt;br /&gt;I was a tad disappointed that it did not come in the better quality box.</li>
            <li> I find it hard to write this review because of all the women hanging all over me after just one squirt of this magic scent.</li>
            <li> i caught me a massive barracuda of a love fish and was forced to take certain actions to suppress the matter...</li>
            <li> From young tawny kitaens to old cougars, they&#x27;ll all want to get their claws into you.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> stay classy, Planet Earth.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my  boyfriend, he loves the frangrance and it drove me wild.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised.</li>
            <li> Obviously purchased it as a novelty gift....mostly for the &amp;#34;growl&amp;#34; when opening the box, and then of course the bits of real panther.  </li>
            <li> Where do I even start, upon arrival package was delivered by a busty somewhat already aroused UPS woman.</li>
            <li> , I have 17 tattoos total on my body, were talking a real man&#x27;s man.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was all accomplished by one simple spray of the cologne, I haven&#x27;t even began to talk about what happens with the women in my life.</li>
            <li> I opened up the bottle and was immediately surprised to hear the panthers growl, but I was soon horrified when I found out how pungent it was.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a masculine scent</li>
            <li> you stay classy ;}</li>
            <li> You will be surprised by the power of the Sex Panther.</li>
            <li> Although it is illegal in nine countries due to having real panther bits in it, this cologne has a very nice smell to it.</li>
            <li> more of a novelty than anything serious but doesn&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
            <li> It was really funny seeing my cousin open it but the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the box did not roar</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good at describing smells..not really sure what adjectives to use.. but simply put, it smells good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Due to the constant bombardment of women, he no longer is able to use his hands for anything other than sex.  </li>
            <li> It smells like no other.</li>
            <li> This is almost a carbon copy for some sort of axe or old spice, I didn&#x27;t have enough time to decide which one (my husband wears both)</li>
            <li> I hunt and fish with my bare hands, all equipment made by my bare</li>
            <li> Later in the day, on assignment, I was out of the office and a young woman approached me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, a woman in accounting with an acute brain injury believed it to smell like a derivative of oil and others became upset in the hysteria.</li>
            <li> I now have a beard that is uncontrollable,my testosterone levels have been raised, I have a natural skill in mixed martial arts, I drive a lifted truck</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the lovely evening I had planned quickly took a turn for the worse thanks to a cologne that smells like a turd covered in burnt hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not have that signature growl I expected upon opening the box, but it does not detract from how nice it is in general.</li>
            <li> Our best friend is obsessed with the movie!!!  </li>
            <li> Little did I know, the cologne does not smell like pure gasoline or big foot&#x27;s dick.</li>
            <li> Seems a little much, but I did recently find out this cologne was in a movie</li>
            <li> I decided to keep it though just for the s**ts and giggles which is why I originally bought it, and since it smells like the cheap crap he loves anyway.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a novelty gag gift that actually is a decent product, a little over priced, but when people ask what your wear, you can have the satisfaction of saying Sex Panther, and you can&#x27;t put a price on that</li>
            <li> Even though the price is a little high for a 1.7oz novelty cologne, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Normally there is a little switch inside that makes the box roar when you take out the cologne.</li>
            <li> I dont usually wear cologne unless I really feel like it.</li>
            <li> Lasts long and does not sting the nostrils and women actually like it.</li>
            <li> well to make a long story short</li>
            <li> It was dumb, I didn&#x27;t even care but why argue when the mechs are right there?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Even under a fire hose for a half hour, the smell was barely doused.</li>
            <li> I dont know why they say this stuff is the ultimate fragrance when it doesnt attract women anymore than other colognes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert on calognes, the only other one I use is Express</li>
            <li> I do have to ask though, does the cologne have a side effect of scabs on my private regions and an odd odor to my pee?</li>
            <li> After about a half hour under a fire hose, I was let back in.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this Sex Panther Cologne because me and this little cookie from work were off the no-pants dance.</li>
            <li> Excited,and a little bit nervous I had to open the box to get a feel for the thunder</li>
            <li> the bottle was not properly held in place since the mechanisim missing also holds the bottle in place so the bottle moves around inside.</li>
            <li> My husband won&#x27;t wear it though I expected that.  </li>
            <li> ANYWAY, this stuff smells like any other cologne i ever used.</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviewers, it does smell like Axe body spray.</li>
            <li> I understand why the packaging has to be so hefty now, due to the pungent smell that is already captivated the UPS driver.</li>
            <li> quite frankly i wouldn&#x27;t buy any other cologne if my life depended on it....</li>
            <li> but It smells very similar to the cheap crap you get at walmart.</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive for an average product, you&#x27;re just paying for the name.</li>
            <li> the one that is really illegal in in most places, or just get some Rohypnol winch is mostly illegal everywhere.</li>
            <li> I got a few compliments on it, so I guess some other people notice.</li>
            <li> It ended up just smelling like Axe or any typical men&#x27;s body spray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was the cologne, my shirt, or the combination of the two, but all other verile males in the area immediately went blind and developed</li>
            <li> this part was cut out probably with scissors and was a messy job.</li>
            <li> a joke, and waste of money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I will still use it, just not the plain bottle out with no box)</li>
            <li> Sadly my box did not growl, but that only brought it down to about 70% of the time.</li>
            <li> It was supposed to be a funny gift but without the box that growls, it&#x27;s just bad cologne.</li>
            <li> you down at least sixty percent of&lt;br /&gt;the time.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed when I realized that, but it was a really funny gift anyway.</li>
            <li> and a little Bigfoot&#x27;s d**k!</li>
            <li> On the downside, the bottle is small and overpriced.</li>
            <li> Usually, we have to make out in the rusted out school park after 11, but the movies you have the cover of darkness to hunt.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it didn&#x27;t work well on me or not</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m telling you there is no better feeling than wearing this cologne.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Through further examination of the package, the box it came in was poorly constructed and you could tell the item had to be poorly made as well.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the lack of real panther bits.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment with the non-growling box.</li>
            <li> I mean, it is everything it should be expect of course for the burning sensation and kerosene smell.  </li>
            <li> If you know what I mean..</li>
            <li> BUT it doesn&#x27;t last, even after 10 minutes my wife says it is very faint and non existant by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Attract ridiculous amount of women.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> He says it actually doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> ordered it cuz of the movie, and i have to admit it doesnt actually smell that bad at all...</li>
            <li> Needless to say we ended up &#x27;exchanging numbers&#x27; a few times in my work van, as well as in the parking lot bathrooms.</li>
            <li> I want my money back and of course it&#x27;s too late to get the growling box!!!!</li>
            <li> Chicks (60% of them anyway) are defenseless when they get within range.  </li>
            <li> but my behind hurts from the rape.</li>
            <li> And it actually doesn&#x27;t smell bad either!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s illegal in nine countries.</li>
            <li> Also it is illegal in some countries.</li>
            <li> Also it provides a weird attraction to multitudes of panties.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s illegal in nine countries.</li>
            <li> This cologne neither smells of kerosene nor does is burn my nostrils when I apply it, but when applied I feel the urge to walk up to random women on the street and ask if they would like to join me on the please highway that is my Johnson</li>
            <li> Not because of its packaging - because a man in a wolf shirt should never be afraid.  </li>
            <li> too bad it doesn&#x27;t say &amp;</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed with the scent given the price though.</li>
            <li> I was just disappointed that it didn&#x27;t growl when he opened it, and that we had to play with it (using our electrical knowledge) to fix the circuit.</li>
            <li> it does not growl:(</li>
            <li> I am highly disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Very very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Smells awful</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re also not going to be giving you nasty looks.  </li>
            <li> I was also expecting it to have a really horrible smell to it, like rotten eggs or something.</li>
            <li> The mistake was when it was passed around and people started spraying it because it&#x27;s the worst smell ever!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great gift for a joke!</li>
            <li> Ive had my bottle for a year now and havent really used it. I dont usually wear cologne unless I really feel like it. ANYWAY, this stuff smells like any other cologne i ever used. I dont know why they say this stuff is the ultimate fragrance when it doesnt attract women anymore than other colognes. I used this stuff and females dont act any different then they do when Im NOT wearing it. Just another gimmick if you ask me. Look, if something sounds too good to be true, it probably IS.</li>
            <li> Great product, and it actually smells great.</li>
            <li> RAWwwrrr! Splash this on before a night out tomcattin&#x27;, lean back against the bar at your favorite watering hole, and watch all the pussies come a-purrin&#x27;! From young tawny kitaens to old cougars, they&#x27;ll all want to get their claws into you. By morning you&#x27;ll be feline fine.</li>
            <li> Its illegal in 40+ countries, and it is made out of bits and pieces of real panthers.&lt;br /&gt;It has a formidable sent, that stings the nostrils - in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it smells -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like pure gasoline&lt;br /&gt;Big foot&#x27;s penis&lt;br /&gt;hint of burnt dick hair&lt;br /&gt;and a finish of a used diapers filled with Indian food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall really impressed with it, smells great, but the price is too much - maybe its because of the license.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t believe me check this review out -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> The perfect gift for the Anchorman lover. It does not smell like pure gasoline or any of the other comparisons from the movie, it actually smells really good luckily!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made by Odeon. It&#x27;s illegal in nine countries. Yep, it&#x27;s made with bits of real panther, so you know it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the idea of it being funny, but when I actually smelt it and it is actually really good! I&#x27;m not an expert on calognes, the only other one I use is Express Reserve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two reasons I gave it a 4 star and not 5 is because:&lt;br /&gt;1. It does NOT have real bits of panther&lt;br /&gt;2. It smells similar (but better than) to Axe Body Spray, my girl friend swears that it does&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a novelty gag gift that actually is a decent product, a little over priced, but when people ask what your wear, you can have the satisfaction of saying Sex Panther, and you can&#x27;t put a price on that</li>
            <li> I got this because I wanted something fun for the desk in my office and it&#x27;s a great conversation starter! Word of warning: watch where you spray it - it smells okay, but it LINGERS!</li>
            <li> Delivery and product as promised. Very happy.</li>
            <li> smells alright but i bought it for the novelty</li>
            <li> Cologne smells better than I thought&lt;br /&gt;Product came fast via mail&lt;br /&gt;If you have some god-given confidence&lt;br /&gt;and you spray this on, girls will never&lt;br /&gt;turn you down at least sixty percent of&lt;br /&gt;the time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my best smelling cologne by far and everyone loves it. It is also fun to joke about it and quote the movie.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptic when I read that this product did not contain actual bits of panther - how do I know that this product is really going to work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEAR NOT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon my first misting of this magical tonic water, the surrounding area became filled with the presence of lovely ladies. Now, the fact that I was standing in the middle of a hotel lobby which happened to be hosting the National Cheerleading Championship probably helped, but that is neither here nor there. I have used it once, and it worked every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell, it is a nice subtle scent reminding me of a cross between pure gasoline and a diaper filled with Indian food. It assaults the nostrils, but in a pleasant way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would sum it up like this: this stuff smells nice and I think you&#x27;re going to like it. I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be a gift. When i received it i couild tell it had been opened and probably used before. I purchased it as new. Normally there is a little switch inside that makes the box roar when you take out the cologne. this part was cut out probably with scissors and was a messy job. This was a big part of the joke of getting this item and someone for some reason removed it. the box itself looks way different than the picture posted. the bottle was not properly held in place since the mechanisim missing also holds the bottle in place so the bottle moves around inside. really dissapointed and do not want to take lunch to wait in line at the post office during lunch to return this garbage. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> It smells like big foots d*ck but it works 60% of the time every time.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my brother. bought it as a joke but it surprising smells really good.</li>
            <li> SEX PANTHER COLOGNE will give you the edge you need when you&#x27;re out on the prowl. No one can resist it, which is why it is Chuck Norris&#x27; cologne of choice. Goes as well with a Barry White CD and a white tuxedo as it does with a wife beater and FORD ballcap. It tells the world that you can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t be stopped and that you like to smell good while you&#x27;re not being stopped. Slather some of this on your neck before you head to the ol&#x27; family reunion and you&#x27;re sure to have the best time of your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SEX PANTHER COLOGNE: harness the power of the panther!</li>
            <li> I wanna say something. I&#x27;m gonna put it out there; if you like it, you can take it, if you don&#x27;t, send it right back. Sex Panther cologne really does smell pretty good. It&#x27;s quite pungent. Definitely classier than London Gentleman and more formidable than Blackbeard&#x27;s Delight. The scent is similar to Cool Water by Davidoff and Acqua Di Gio By Giorgio Armani. It is distinctively man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also felt it is overpriced for the size, but it will make a great gift for my brother for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You stay classy, Planet Earth.</li>
            <li> My son bought this as a joke gift for his friend after watching Anchorman.  It&#x27;s quite pungent.</li>
            <li> more of a novelty than anything serious but doesn&#x27;t hurt to try. Prolly better off buying a Breitling if you REALLY want a girlfriend for a half hour.</li>
            <li> Smells awful but it does stir the hormones -- it is an aphrodisiac.</li>
            <li> Sex Panther is very potent, i learned this the hard way, so don&#x27;t use but one spray&lt;br /&gt;the girls seem to enjoy the scent</li>
            <li> I ordered the cologne with the box that growls when opened. I paid extra for shipping to have it by Christmas. The item was delivered quickly and in time for Christmas but it wasn&#x27;t what I ordered. I only received the cologne. It was supposed to be a funny gift but without the box that growls, it&#x27;s just bad cologne. For $50 I could&#x27;ve bought decent cologne but that wasn&#x27;t the point of the purchase. The seller was &amp;#34;TV Store Online&amp;#34; &#x3D; never again.</li>
            <li> I love it, my boyfriend uses it and it smells really good actually. Mmmmmm....too bad it doesn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;by Odion&amp;#34; on it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gag gift for a guy that loves the movie Anchorman.  It arrived in the coolest box!  When you open it, it actually growls like a panther!!  And it even smells good!  He proudly displays it in his guest bathroom and everyone that walks in there, comes out laughing.</li>
            <li> Cologne based off the famous scene in Anchorman. It does smell better then they mention in the movie however. It is more of a musky cologne and smells somewhat like something my dad would wear to church when I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like Anchorman or Musk then buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t....Well don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell at all.  My husband won&#x27;t wear it though I expected that.  This is more of a conversation piece- an expensive one.</li>
            <li> This is truly the most effective cologne I&#x27;ve ever tried. I received the product on a Friday and literally by the next Friday, the girl I had crush on asked me out. We&#x27;ve now been happily dating for 3 weeks. This may be the best item I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> my son hasn&#x27;t told me how he likes the scent</li>
            <li> Recipient loved scent of cologne.</li>
            <li> Best way to describe this scent is, it smells like, like a used diaper, filled with Indian food! and a little Bigfoot&#x27;s d**k! This stuff works 90 percent of the time all of the time. Stings the nosterals just a bit. It&#x27;s great stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gag gift for my husband on his birthday and it&#x27;s actually got a nice smell - very similar to Hugo Boss.  Not that the scent matters - he would have loved it no matter what simply because it is from Anchorman.</li>
            <li> This is brilliant. I wear it when ever they bring a girl to my work or at parties we have when we celebrate getting the highest ratings and it works every time as me and ron  (my wing man)always pick up girls while our colleagues that dont wear it ( champ and brick) never pick up girls very often. Ron once described it as \\&quot;stinging the nostrils in a good way\\&quot;. There have been studies done on this stuff and 60% of the time it works everytime. Overall it just smells of desire.</li>
            <li> just a fun gift for that special friend.  i don&#x27;t even know what it smells like...</li>
            <li> 60% of the time, it works every time</li>
            <li> Our best friend is obsessed with the movie!!!  So this is the perfect Birthday gift!!!  The Growl is awesome!!!  And it smells good too!</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were expecting!!  Great Product!!  Next year we will be buying the leg lamp from a Christmas Story!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad this is real! Not only is this a memorable prop from one of the funniest movies ever, it smells great, too!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get this, it&#x27;s a christmas gift for my hubby. I was going to wrap it up and put it under the tree right away but I just had to smell it first. Now I wasn&#x27;t expecting something super fabulous for 35 dollars... and I have a pretty sensitive nose and I can easily tell if I&#x27;ve smelled something before. This is almost a carbon copy for some sort of axe or old spice, I didn&#x27;t have enough time to decide which one (my husband wears both) but It smells very similar to the cheap crap you get at walmart. I was pretty butt-hurt about this and almost wanted to send it back for that reason. I decided to keep it though just for the s**ts and giggles which is why I originally bought it, and since it smells like the cheap crap he loves anyway. (was hoping to kill two birds with one stone, buy a funny gift and get a new smell on him, guess I&#x27;m screwed. (Thanks Brian Fantana ... Or did Ron Burgundy endorse this? Oh well!)</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loved this gift, he had no idea it even existed, and it has bits of real panther in it. Anyways it smells good and its a great present for any anchorman guy fan.</li>
            <li> I like it because it smells like straight gasoline. Also it is illegal in some countries. Doesn&#x27;t get more fitting than that.</li>
            <li> Excellent movie tie-in, and a great thing to have for any Anchorman fan. You must know however, that it definitely does not smell like a turd covered in burnt hair.</li>
            <li> Great men&#x27;s fragrance. Smells good and girlfriend loves it. It&#x27;s not too strong  and would definitely buy again once this one runs out.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he thought it was awesome! Even he was surprised with how good the cologne smells! It is now officially one of our favorite colognes. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it in the end for a fun novelty gift that actually is a great product to use. I will probably buy it again in the future. Love the scent!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what to expect... but I was very pleased with the smell! The smell is fairly unique, in a very good way :) I would absolutely recommend (For your information, it&#x27;s safe to say that this cologne really doesn&#x27;t smell like Bigfoot&#x27;s dick)</li>
            <li> Bought as a birthday gift for my cologne-loving boyfriend, he thought it was awesome. And it actually doesn&#x27;t smell bad either!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my  boyfriend, he loves the frangrance and it drove me wild. It is an intoxicating smell, gets me every time. Love it! Will be back for more!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> It was better than I thought it would be and it didn&#x27;t smell like big foots dick. Thank you 60% of the time it worked every time</li>
            <li> Nothing can be further from the truth.&lt;br /&gt;What a joke, and waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;As long as you know this is just a joke you&#x27;ll be fine, but don&#x27;t buying thinking there is anything real about it.</li>
            <li> This really is the best gift if you are totally out of gift ideas.  You don&#x27;t even have to wear it. Just set it on your nightstand and you will have to be beating off chicks with a stick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that the only shirt that I own is Three Wolf Moon.  So, I already have to deal with hordes of women and men alike fawning all over me (and the occasional canine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very nervous when I first received this product.  Not because of its packaging - because a man in a wolf shirt should never be afraid.  But because I didn&#x27;t know what would happen when I added something as pungent as Sex Panther to my already testosterone maxed wolf wearing self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first spray, I immediately sprouted a mustache.  And then a moustache.  I walked out my front door, and before I got to the end of my driveway I had already given one lucky lady a mustache ride.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was the cologne, my shirt, or the combination of the two, but all other verile males in the area immediately went blind and developed ED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aft r tha;t d;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#EDIT#&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note from the Reviewer&#x27;s brother - The Reviewer is no longer capable of continuing his response.  Due to the constant bombardment of women, he no longer is able to use his hands for anything other than sex.  I would rate this product a five out of five, but since I&#x27;m blind and impotent now, I kind of wish I had purchased this product first.</li>
            <li> This is flat out wonderful. I smell fantastic. It actually smells really good. I would recommend this to all Fantana&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li> I find it hard to write this review because of all the women hanging all over me after just one squirt of this magic scent.</li>
            <li> like others before me said, this cologne actually smells pretty good. any &amp;#34;anchorman&amp;#34; fan will appreciate the product itself and the fact that it smells nice will turn it from a gag gift into a decent gift as is.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. Smells great. The only few issues i have with it are very minor; It does come exactly as pictured but it would have been awesome if it came in the panther head bottle from the movie and if the label that lists the ingredients said &amp;#34;Made with bits of real panther, so you know its good.&amp;#34; would have been icing on the cake. As is.... i effin love this cologne. Will buy more. d-(^_^)-b</li>
            <li> Thrown into the rotation, and have in bathroom as conversation starter.  I don&#x27;t know how to describe cologne as woody, citrus, all that but I think it&#x27;s woody all I know is that it does smell good and for the price it&#x27;s worth it just as a display piece.</li>
            <li> This cologne actually smells really good, my dad got it as a joke and ended up wearing it to my wedding, and he was the best-smelling guy in the place.  Unfortunately instead of enjoying my wedding he had to spend the night trying to keep all the ladies away.</li>
            <li> Rawwrrrrr. All I have to say since I got this is that 60% of the time it works all the time!</li>
            <li> What the f***?!? This box doesn&#x27;t growl...I want my money back and of course it&#x27;s too late to get the growling box!!!! This should&#x27;ve been in the description.</li>
            <li> Got this for my man as a joke. He got a good laugh out of it. It smells okay too, nothing special, but a nice generic men&#x27;s cologne smell. I agree with some of the other reviewers, it does smell like Axe body spray.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gag gift for christmas and like everyone else has said it smells REAL good. I think i&#x27;m going to continue buying it for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful however very soon after purchasing the bottle broke and became completely unusable.  Its a fine product it&#x27;s just cheaply made. Will be returning.</li>
            <li> This novelty cologne actually smells pretty good. On the downside, the bottle is small and overpriced.</li>
            <li> Smells good and wasn&#x27;t defective like the bottle I purchased from Hot Topic. For a novelty item, I was impressed with the fragrance. It&#x27;s not going to knock your socks off, but I would definitely recommend trying it out for a reasonably priced, unique smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and I am sooooooo glad I did. It smells like fresh, clean man!&lt;br /&gt;I was a tad disappointed that it did not come in the better quality box. When I purchased this the description said it had the metal box that roared when you lift off the top, it may have changed now. I got a cardboard box with what looked like the mechanism for sound to come out but it was broken.&lt;br /&gt;Long story short I contacted the seller not wanting anything but to let them know that quality control had suffered a bit. Their response was to argue with me that I did not purchase the bottle with box that roars. It was dumb, I didn&#x27;t even care but why argue when the mechs are right there?&lt;br /&gt;I give the product a 5 but I don&#x27;t think I will be ordering it from this seller again.</li>
            <li> My grandson thinks sex panther is awesome, and if he is HAPPY, so is GRANDMA BARBARA!!!!! HE loves IT!!!!I recommend sex panther cologne.</li>
            <li> got as a joke for my brother but it actually smells pretty good</li>
            <li> Ok, so this is a gag gift but it actually smells kind of nice.</li>
            <li> I felt as confident as Brian Fantana the first time I tried this cologne. I was so irresistible to the ladies my fiance made me stop wearing it. It was amazing to see the results. If you have any doubts, go ahead and try it out. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;That&#x27;s the smell of desire m&#x27;lady&amp;#34; -Brian Fantana</li>
            <li> Just a gimmick. Cologne smells like cheap dollar store stuff. You are paying for the bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance for Valentine&#x27;s Day as a joke because he loves the movie Anchorman and it actually smells really good so I can&#x27;t wait to give it to him!! Thanks for the speeding shipping too! :)</li>
            <li> I received this cologne as a gift from my younger brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He had saved his money from mowing lawns the entire summer and told me that I was his big bubba and he loved me.  I opened the cologne and it&#x27;s smell lit up my senses in a way that I can not begin to describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore it to school the next day and noticed that teachers seemed to bend over a lot more in front of me, the girls all seemed to stay near my locker, and the principal called me into his office for a \\&quot;long talk.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that I have an animal magnetism that can only be explained by the power of this mighty cologne.  I have since run out of the cologne and since my mom took away my allowance for molesting a family of badgers(illegal in my county) I have resorted to trying and making my own cologne to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many things, but most of the time people look at me in disgust and wrinkle their noses as if I am something on the bottom of their shoe that they wish someone had cleaned up before they had stepped in me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I miss the power that I had over the fairer sex when I wore this cologne.  I was the only guy to meet a girl at the movies on Friday, and meeting a girl in this town when they only show a movie twice week?  That is a big deal.  Usually, we have to make out in the rusted out school park after 11, but the movies you have the cover of darkness to hunt.  And that is what I did when I was Sex Panther Johnston.  Hunted out the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I cry.</li>
            <li> I got this as a groomsman&#x27;s gift and it smells really good.  People aren&#x27;t going to be asking if you&#x27;re wearing Aqua Di Gio but they&#x27;re also not going to be giving you nasty looks.  They&#x27;ll be thinking you&#x27;re wearing cologne and smell nice.  The logo&#x27;s on the box and bottle are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure the recipient has seen the movie.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance who has been dying for a bottle. It smells really really good! I was quite surprised. Only reason it&#x27;s getting 4 stars is because it&#x27;s a pretty small bottle. Then again, what cologne isn&#x27;t?&lt;br /&gt;It came very quickly, and without any damage at all.</li>
            <li> Smells almost exactly like gasoline!</li>
            <li> Sex Panther Cologne works every time, 60% of the time. Sadly my box did not growl, but that only brought it down to about 70% of the time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells like a turd covered in burnt hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend as a joke but it smells great!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t keep the ladies off of me.  Also it provides a weird attraction to multitudes of panties.  I&#x27;ve almost drown before with how many are thrown my direction when I mist this wickedly good scented water on me.</li>
            <li> bought this as sort of a gag gift, but it smells good lol.</li>
            <li> Obviously purchased it as a novelty gift....mostly for the &amp;#34;growl&amp;#34; when opening the box, and then of course the bits of real panther.  But the boxes (bought FOUR) had no growl.  Very very disappointed.  Won&#x27;t purchase anything from this seller again.</li>
            <li> With-in an hour you&#x27;ll be doing the no pants dance, it&#x27;s a formidable scent. Better than London Gentleman and Black Beards delight.  It&#x27;s quite pungent, stings the nostrils - in a good way. It smells like pure gasoline</li>
            <li> Not the original packaging as shown in the movie Anchorman but still a great smelling cologne. Lasts long and does not sting the nostrils and women actually like it.</li>
            <li> Because 60% of the time it works every time.  You can&#x27;t buy a guarantee like that with Armani or Kenneth Cole.  Chicks (60% of them anyway) are defenseless when they get within range.  You&#x27;ll know when it&#x27;s time to pounce!</li>
            <li> best birthday gift for an anchorman fan!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny and smells great!  It has a just showered smell.  It looks funny on your dresser (my girlfriend is embarrased if people see it on my dresser;)  I normally wear armani acqua di gio.  But armani isn&#x27;t as much fun to say or look at.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gag joke for my boyfriends birthday &amp; he absolutely LOVES it!!! Wears it ALL the time!! Definatly recommend it for anyone that loves Anchorman!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it smells pretty good!</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this. The first time a girl smells it, she gets all nice ane close to you. Then theu get used to it after a couple days. Either way, its amazing.</li>
            <li> I was really unsure about what to expect with this product. I bought it as a humorous gift for my boyfriend for Christmas. Not only does it smell amazing  but it is also a humorous gift that made everyone laugh. I am really glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great gag or novelty gift. My boyfriend loves anchorman and always calls himself sex panther, in fact our home internet is named that! So when I found out they made cologne I could not pass it up. Winning Best girlfriend award and its actually smells really good too! I almost prefer this to any of his others, its a close tie with agua de gio! haha</li>
            <li> I bought this as a joke for me and some friends I never knew it could of escalated so quickly... It was the second day of use my female attraction had increased by a whopping 60%. I was walking minding my business  when Wa bam 60 white girls poped out of no were I was corners for the next 10 days I starved for they would not let me leave. Eventually it wore of and they one by one left. So ya it works but the question is do you want it to work?</li>
            <li> Great name prompted this as a Father&#x27;s Day gift for me. It does smell pretty good BUT it doesn&#x27;t last, even after 10 minutes my wife says it is very faint and non existant by the end of the day. Would never buy it for myself.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this Sex Panther Cologne because me and this little cookie from work were off the no-pants dance. I had heard that 60 percent of the time, it works every time so I knew that I&#x27;d be better off with this than London Gentleman or even the fabled Blackbeard&#x27;s Delight. However, when I used it the scent was more \\&quot;pungent\\&quot; than I would&#x27;ve liked. I could just say that it stings the nostrils, but honestly it smells like pure gasoline. What was supposed to be the smell of desire quickly turned into an aroma not unlike a used diaper filled with Indian food. Needless to say, the lovely evening I had planned quickly took a turn for the worse thanks to a cologne that smells like a turd covered in burnt hair. Would probably buy again.</li>
            <li> I was a bit bummed about this purchase. I love Anchorman and got this as more of a novelty gift than anything else. I wish there would be a movie quote or print on the bottle of ingredients (bits of real panther). It smells okay but nothing too special. Personally I think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced at nearly $40 plus s&amp;h but a cool gift nonetheless for fans.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it. She stole it just so she can spray it on all of her stuff. Not her clothes of course but her bed stuff. She says it seems like I&#x27;m there</li>
            <li> This cologne is the exact same chemical make-up as Drakkar noir which is a spin off of old spice. This product is only effective 60% of the time all the time (oxymoron) if your skeptical and gullible enough to believe that an odor or a scent can make you more desirable. It&#x27;s only trickery to the confidence. BUT, if you do want something that works well, GET \\&quot;SPANISH FLY\\&quot; the one that is really illegal in in most places, or just get some Rohypnol winch is mostly illegal everywhere.</li>
            <li> Made from bits of real panther, so you know its good.  Its a formidable scent, stings the nostrils.  They&#x27;ve done studies - 60% of the time, it works every time.</li>
            <li> Here the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+Smells Really good!&lt;br /&gt;+Got here quickly (Express shiping)&lt;br /&gt;+Works as a great gag or gift.&lt;br /&gt;-Top comes off to easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on keeping the box and keeping in there (I will still use it, just not the plain bottle out with no box) so the top coming off easy is a little down sided for me. Other then that, is great!</li>
            <li> it smells nice but i thought it was made by odeon? ive never heard of this anchorman fellow. 3 out of 5</li>
            <li> This actually smells REALLY FREAKING GOOD!!! Definitely does not smell like a used diaper filled with Indian food.</li>
            <li> Gave this to a friend as a joke and turned out to be a surprisingly nice cologne.  He thought it was hilarious but also smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> Where do I even start, upon arrival package was delivered by a busty somewhat already aroused UPS woman. I understand why the packaging has to be so hefty now, due to the pungent smell that is already captivated the UPS driver. Excited,and a little bit nervous I had to open the box to get a feel for the thunder but I&#x27;ve been longing for. Never in my life have I ever been able to grow facial hair until this product arrived. Only took one spray BOOM. I now have a beard that is uncontrollable,my testosterone levels have been raised, I have a natural skill in mixed martial arts, I drive a lifted truck, my penis grew 2 inches my jaw line chiseled, I now have a full eight pack of abs, every muscle in my body is tone, I have 17 tattoos total on my body, were talking a real man&#x27;s man. I hunt and fish with my bare hands, all equipment made by my bare hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was all accomplished by one simple spray of the cologne, I haven&#x27;t even began to talk about what happens with the women in my life. I Have to hire my friends to come out with me to take over the herds of women after one simple spray. Did I mention&lt;br /&gt;my pet panther I accumulated over one spray? I have a full jungle in my backyard, hungry animals waiting to protect their keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t buy this cologne you might as well walk around with a tampon in your pocket that&#x27;s how much of a pussy you are&lt;br /&gt;Man up, get that chiseled jaw, six pack and lifted truck.and be one with the beast. Five star review? How about 2 million star review</li>
            <li> I opened up the bottle and was immediately surprised to hear the panthers growl, but I was soon horrified when I found out how pungent it was.  My girlfriend hasn&#x27;t been the same since I opened it she said it smelled like bigfoots dick and has since been secluded in our apartment for fear of coming across that odor again on someone else.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a fragrance to wear on my wedding day, and a friend of mine suggested I purchase Sex Panther...well to make a long story short I wore the cologne a couple of days before my wedding and bout time I got to my car I no longer smelled it on me. I&#x27;m not sure if it didn&#x27;t work well on me or not but if you&#x27;re looking for a fragrance that stays on you all day...this is not the one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s illegal in nine countries. Yep, it&#x27;s made with bits of real panther, so you know it&#x27;s good. They&#x27;ve done studies, you know. 60% of the time, it works every time.</li>
            <li> one bottle costs 3k and 60% of the time, it works all the time. made from real panther. -Anchor Man</li>
            <li> This item was really good and I&#x27;ve been complimented a lot. The only problem I have is the price. Seems a little much, but I did recently find out this cologne was in a movie so I guess that makes sense.</li>
            <li> Anchorman is such a hilarious movie. This was a great gag gift, though an expensive one. The look of surprise and laugh this gift elicited was worth the price, just this once. I was a bit disappointed with the scent given the price though. I was hoping for something a little more musky or unique. It ended up just smelling like Axe or any typical men&#x27;s body spray.</li>
            <li> It smells surprisingly nice. Does not sting the nostrils. It says I have to write down 11 more words so....</li>
            <li> Got this for my brother, he thought it was funny.  I myself have no had the chance to smell it so I can&#x27;t give it a good review.</li>
            <li> this was a gift and he loved it.</li>
            <li> bought this for my husband for christmas last year...i think.  he LOVED it - thought it was hilarious!  but it also smells really good so win win!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for a Valentine&#x27;s Day gag gift. The shipping was super fast, and packaged nicely. I smelled it out of curiosity (as I have yet to give it to him yet) and it smells surprisingly nice! Musky scent. He loves the movie and as why everyone else is here/bought this, he tends to quote the Sex Panther quote part. Thanks for such a fun gift!!</li>
            <li> If you have seen Anchorman, then I don&#x27;t have to explain.</li>
            <li> This cologne definitely could use a few more bits of real panther; otherwise, a great product!!!!!!! I would definitely buy this again for my friends.</li>
            <li> We purchased this more or less as a gag gift for our son for Christmas. We were hoping it smelled good so he could actually wear it, but it doesn&#x27;t and he won&#x27;t.  We all got a good laugh out of the gift, but now I&#x27;m wishing we spent the money on something else.</li>
            <li> My brother loves the Anchorman movies, so my sister decided to buy this for him for Christmas. Let me tell you: IT SMELLS SO GOOD!! The delivery was fast and the bottle is really cool, too. If you&#x27;re wondering if this might just be a crappy, gimmick-y cologne, don&#x27;t worry. As well as serving its novelty purposes, it seriously smells manly and nice. I highly recommend for any Anchorman fan!</li>
            <li> Was given as a gift for a friend. He loved it and the fact that the cologne is not of a quality at all really adds to the funness of this gift.</li>
            <li> Although it is illegal in nine countries due to having real panther bits in it, this cologne has a very nice smell to it. It&#x27;s a masculine scent that&#x27;s similar to the diesel colognes that I&#x27;ve bought for my husband before. The box came in perfect condition and the bottle is a nice size. Very pleased with my purchase overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;60% of the time, it works every time.</li>
            <li> Directions:&lt;br /&gt;1. Spray Cologne&lt;br /&gt;2. Attract ridiculous amount of women.&lt;br /&gt;3. Make love to them.&lt;br /&gt;4. Repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING:&lt;br /&gt;For your own safety, do not stand too close to the ladies while enjoying the fine aroma of Sex Panther Cologne.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff to put in my bathroom to get a laugh or two from guests when they see it. I have only applied this stinky stuff one time and it really smells like Bigfoot&#x27;s d*ck! My friends think it&#x27;s funny and so do I. I think it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Well, at first i bought it  thinking.. i love ron burgandy, and only a scent this formidable could come close to his high glory... many are skeptical whether it smells like bigfoot or other non attractive scents, and well let me put it this way... its smell is like you were sitting at the dinner table with jesus and the surrounding aura was a scent... next concern is does it work?? well after a night of drillbit taylor  on TBS i caught me a massive barracuda of a love fish and was forced to take certain actions to suppress the matter... quite frankly i wouldn&#x27;t buy any other cologne if my life depended on it....you stay classy ;}</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see they had this I ordered it without thinking that it did not have the panther head on the bottle. I was a little disappointed when I realized that, but it was a really funny gift anyway. I was also expecting it to have a really horrible smell to it, like rotten eggs or something. I was very surprised to find out it smelled like Drakkar Noir. Not that Drakkar Noir  is the best smelling cologne out there, but it is far from the gut wrenching smell I would have thought Sex Panther would be. I was also surprised to find out that this is not some cheap plastic bottle but a nice glass bottle you would find at any department store.</li>
            <li> This cologne neither smells of kerosene nor does is burn my nostrils when I apply it, but when applied I feel the urge to walk up to random women on the street and ask if they would like to join me on the please highway that is my Johnson and you know what, sure as the sky is blue, 6 out of every ten women I asked jumped on board and road that fiery highway all the way to the end of the line.  I mean, it is everything it should be expect of course for the burning sensation and kerosene smell.  I do have to ask though, does the cologne have a side effect of scabs on my private regions and an odd odor to my pee?</li>
            <li> Really funny nic nack I suppose and it smells decent but it was leaking when I got the package. Through further examination of the package, the box it came in was poorly constructed and you could tell the item had to be poorly made as well. The only reason why I&#x27;m giving this item a decent review is because it made me laugh and my brother loved his Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!!! I thought I was a gag at first and was a little bummed that it wasn&#x27;t in a panther shaped bottle, but it turns out that it smells really good. I get complements all the time. It&#x27;s a fun conversation piece and a great gift!</li>
            <li> The cologne is good. Box doesn&#x27;t growl. Big disappointment with the non-growling box. If it was a $20 value, then sure. Don&#x27;t feel I got robbed but my behind hurts from the rape.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a formidable scent... It stings the nostrils. In a good way.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Smells great and actually, I believe is a lady magnet. Every girl friend I ever had I first met wearing this.</li>
            <li> So, I bought this mostly as a joke, but I was surprised that it actually smells kinda nice. I&#x27;m not very good at describing smells..not really sure what adjectives to use.. but simply put, it smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a spray on my wrists and one on my neck. After a full shift at work if I smell my wrist it still smells like Sex Panther lol. I got a few compliments on it, so I guess some other people notice.</li>
            <li> Put this stuff on and instantly had my fifteen acres filled with women and honey badgers. Now I live in the woods and don&#x27;t give a s***, like the honey badgers.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations.  It is really cool to get something that resembles one of your favorite movies.  My friend thought the gift was pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband. When you open the box it&#x27;s suppose to make the panther rawr, and after we played with the pieces we got it to work intermittently. The fragrance is nice and is the bottle. I was just disappointed that it didn&#x27;t growl when he opened it, and that we had to play with it (using our electrical knowledge) to fix the circuit. Good product, and not worth sending back because of that. Still, it def. stole a star.</li>
            <li> This is the cologne that is used in the first Anchorman movie. I bought it as a birthday gift for someone and he loved it. He says it actually doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> We made everyone jealous when this was given recently as a gift to a a guy at a party we had in a popular restaurant. Many knew it was from Anchorman but had no idea you could really buy it. The mistake was when it was passed around and people started spraying it because it&#x27;s the worst smell ever! Like ancient bear urine that they found buried for 1000 years. USE as a PROP ONLY!</li>
            <li> This cologne is perfect. It smells just like Bigfoot&#x27;s dick! Perfect for picking up co-workers and Christina Applegate. Buy this now!</li>
            <li> I think to have the opportunity to own and wear the cologne from my all time favorite movie is priceless. Walking around with the scent of Sex Panther is priceless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this cologne because I love Anchorman and I thought it would be really neat to own a cologne from the movie. Little did I know, the cologne does not smell like pure gasoline or big foot&#x27;s dick. It smells like no other. The ladies are literally all over me. I&#x27;m telling you there is no better feeling than wearing this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like a new person. People stare at it with envy as they walk through my house. Sex Panther is a gift from above. For only 34$ I experienced a life changing journey. You will be surprised by the power of the Sex Panther. Buy it.</li>
            <li> Even though the price is a little high for a 1.7oz novelty cologne, I would buy it again. The scent reminds of Dunhill Desire Red with hits of wood. Actually it smells great. I&#x27;m also a fan of the movie Anchorman Ron Burgundy. It&#x27;s a must have.</li>
            <li> Its acctually a really nice smell. Doesnt smell like gasoline or burn the nostrils. Pretty sure there is reall panther in it. Oh and to top it off women acctually like it more than burberry classic/brit cool water, guess, aqua digo. Top notch cometion and this cheap bottles beats em all.</li>
            <li> Bought as a novelty gift. The title is too funny to ignore. Sex Panther!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to put in my husband stocking for Christmas. As soon as he used it i couldn&#x27;t stop smelling him. Lol! It really smells great!!!! We always joke around whenever he&#x27;s wearing this scent that ladies will follow him because he&#x27;s a sex panther.</li>
            <li> This was a joke gift but it actually smells really good. Clean, crisp, nothing like pure gasoline or Bigfoot haha.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice smelling cologne. It reminds me of a clean just out of the shower smell. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> ordered it cuz of the movie, and i have to admit it doesnt actually smell that bad at all...its more of am musky smell if thats what you&#x27;re into</li>
            <li> I love Anchorman and figured I had to get this! And you know what, it actually smells really good. Don&#x27;t let the movie \\&quot;fool you\\&quot; :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a hit when you have people over, and they see it. Most of them don&#x27;t know it really exists.</li>
            <li> Brought this as a gift for someone, they loved it.</li>
            <li> It smelled amazing and came in a timely manor.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friends birthday earlier this year. It&#x27;s actually a nice scent, and we are big fans of the Anchorman Series. Unfortunately, it did not have that signature growl I expected upon opening the box, but it does not detract from how nice it is in general.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband as a joke, he loved it and it actually smells really good, lol, he used it all and now I have to get him some more.</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive for an average product, you&#x27;re just paying for the name. As far as quality is concerned you could find something of the same or better quality at any store.</li>
            <li> its made with bits of real panther so you know its good. they&#x27;ve done studies you know! they say sixty precent of the time it works every time.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the lack of real panther bits. Does not smell like pure gasoline. 60% of the time, it works every time.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works as advertised! I would recommend this for smelling great on those special occasions. If you know what I mean..</li>
            <li> The Anchorman references you can use with this are totally worth the money, and the ladies love it. (it doesn&#x27;t smell like pure gasoline)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sex Panther for years and recently had the opportunity to introduce it to a group of my co-workers. I think there might have been a bit of panther stuck in the spray nozzle because a very potent spray was emitted. Unfortunately, a woman in accounting with an acute brain injury believed it to smell like a derivative of oil and others became upset in the hysteria. Someone even exclaimed that there was a &#x27;fire&#x27;. I was then prompted by my superiors and the local fire department to be washed of the scent before I reentered the building. After about a half hour under a fire hose, I was let back in. Later in the day, on assignment, I was out of the office and a young woman approached me. She asked if what I was wearing was &#x27;Sex Panther&#x27;. Even under a fire hose for a half hour, the smell was barely doused. Seeing the excitement teeming in her eyes I couldn&#x27;t respond with words, so I gave her a playful growl in agreement. Needless to say we ended up &#x27;exchanging numbers&#x27; a few times in my work van, as well as in the parking lot bathrooms. Give it a try, 60% of the time - it works every time.</li>
            <li> It was really funny seeing my cousin open it but the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the box did not roar</li>
            <li> Everyone liked my Cologne, all ages.</li>
            <li> Smells like a used diaper filled with Indian food.</li>
            <li> I paid 70$ to get this an it does not growl:(</li>
            <li> Got this as a Christmas gift to my boyfriend as a joke. It smells amazing though, a lot better than what I was expecting!</li>
            <li> Makes for an awesome gift! It actually smells pretty nice - a clean and musky smell. The original packaging I received was damaged but the seller immediately sent me a new box, so I appreciate that.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne with the expectation that it was made with bits of real panther. To my bewilderment there were no bits of panther! I am highly disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Was an awesome gift. My boyfriend loved it. It&#x27;s hilarious but also actually smells amazing. I almost wanted to keep it for myself -_-</li>
            <li> Studies show that 60% of the time this cologne works 100% of the time. I beg to differ. It burns your nostrils and smells like Bigfoot&#x27;s dick.</li>
