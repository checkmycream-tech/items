            <li> It&#x27;s a really beautiful piece. The only problem I had was that the bar was too short for my piercing. Its a pretty tight fit so I don&#x27;t wear it often. Reccomended for people with smaller or tighter pierces.</li>
            <li> Cute belly ring, super big heart but I loved it.</li>
            <li> I love this belly ring, it hasn&#x27;t caused me any problems just yet I&#x27;ve had it in for  3 days now. The only problem I had was getting the ball off to put it on. but its fine now :)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to repierce. Belly!!</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t expecting my belly button ring till April 28th(arrival date). And I got it march 31st!!!  fasttttt shipping!  Of course it&#x27;s not as shiny, has to do with the lighting of the picture.  but it&#x27;s very nice and I recommend.</li>
            <li> Came in early shiny blah blah it was broken and a piece of crap would not recommend sorry not sorry the only good thing didn&#x27;t pay a lot for it</li>
            <li> It infected my piercing and I had to take it out.</li>
            <li> Broke after wearing it for a week. The navel ring I had before this new one lasted 6 yrs.</li>
            <li> Excellent, Item was delivered very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful just as described.</li>
            <li> Great !!! Stays in place and hasn&#x27;t broken</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months ago it lasted up to three months without changing color but then all of a sudden it started to rust and turn green and my belly button got infected, but I just took it out and clean it and it was fine after that. I wouldn&#x27;t be putting it back in anymore but it&#x27;s cute to have for maybe a month</li>
            <li> I cleaned and sterilized it, wore if for a day, and now I have an infection. BE CAREFUL.</li>
            <li> Looks great!! The diamond is in their tight and I have no worries of it falling out. It&#x27;s true to size, not to small.</li>

            <li> I really like this belly ring and the quality is very good. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little too long on me as I&#x27;m very petite at 5&#x27;0 feet and it&#x27;s a little long for me (I also thinking my piercing could have been pierced shorter). Overall, I would recommend this as it&#x27;s super cute.</li>
            <li> It broke the day I got itüò¨üòí</li>
