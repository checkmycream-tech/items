            <li>It has a very light clean scent so that it can be used by either gender.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I use it every day because it is not too greasy and feels really light on your skin, but it moisturizes and make your skin feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It has a light citrus scent</li>
            <li>I have used it for 2 months with the really really clean cleanser</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing special about this lotion.</li>
            <li>So, I thought it would be a good lotion for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Soaks in to the skin really fast!!  </li>
            <li>A very nice lotion that goes on and sinks in quickly and leaves the skin feeling very soft yet not greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a satisfied AminoGenesis customer for the past seven years and their Cocoon Lotion is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>I like some of the other AminoGenesis products too, but Cocoon will always be my favorite!</li>
            <li>My entire body feels so relaxed while this cream is making me feel and look better.</li>
            <li>I had irritations on first use, so I had to stop using it.  </li>
            <li>Love it and use it daily.</li>
            <li>It absorbed completely into my skin and didn&#x27;t leave a shiny film.  </li>
            <li>Helps with really chapped hands.  </li>
            <li>Moisture didn&#x27;t last all day even for a light body cream.</li>
            <li>If you have really dry skin, or get red bumps on your arms, this stuff is amazing for it.</li>
            <li>Less than most pricey lotions on the market.</li>
            <li>The Cocoon left my skin really smooth and soft</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for the value.</li>
            <li>but only this one is absorbed instantly, is not greasy, and makes your skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks much better after a few applications.</li>
            <li>This is their new AminoGenesis Cocoon Lotion, new packaging, new fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within the first week of using the Cocoon lotion I noticed a BIG change in my hands</li>
            <li>say it&#x27;s the same as the original, just a different fragrance.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin keeps getting smoother,even,less wrinkled,and the sagging along my jaw line has completely firmed up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only lotion that really cures my skin problems.</li>
            <li>Nice leaves skin soft, I&#x27;d like the price to be a little less for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different over the counter product and prescription lotions for this with very little change.  </li>
            <li>The problem is that an 8-ounce bottle doesn&#x27;t last long if you use it as a body lotion after your shower; therefore making this product pretty pricey.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend this product because the cost is too high compared to other lotions which give me the same results.</li>
            <li>My arms do not have those tiny little, almost invisible, bumps anymore, and feel much smoother and softer.  </li>

            <li> This stuff does not burn when you put it on right after you save, it keeps the dry flakeys away as long as u use it everyday religiously.</li>
            <li> but when I compared it with other lotions at half the price I believe it doesn&#x27;t really fall into the</li>
            <li> It truly works wonders for dry skin, the amino acids are essential and you can literally feel it penetrating the epidermis.</li>
            <li> I will be buying another bottle when this one is out, but it will last a long time since only a little is needed.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy at all and leaves the skin moist but dry.  </li>
            <li> It also takes ten years off of your age after only using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> I bought this AminoGenesis Cocoon Lotion because I have VERY dry skin</li>
            <li> I spent my money on this product.</li>
            <li> it was ins center.</li>
            <li> I am not exaggerating it looks firm and younger.</li>
            <li> The lotion has ingredients other lotions do not, including oxygen.  </li>
            <li> Yep this is the one I was talking about in my other review.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, I think there are other lotions out there that work just as well for less money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Just an average lotion.</li>
            <li> I also add a little coconut/emu oil with the Cocoon as well.  </li>
            <li> I little worried about organic and inorganic compounds used in lotion however.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thin lotion and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It cost $25 online, but I use a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> Not too thick or thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> It is not the worst in the world a little lemony.</li>
            <li> For over 20 years parts of my hands and feet crack, bleed, flake and are very painful.  </li>
            <li> but it has healed my horrible skin</li>

            <li> Fast shipping great product</li>
            <li> This is one of the best AminoGenesis products.  It absorbed completely into my skin and didn&#x27;t leave a shiny film.  The Cocoon left my skin really smooth and soft - I know that sounds like a commercial, but this lotion is terrific.  I like some of the other AminoGenesis products too, but Cocoon will always be my favorite!</li>
            <li> Best lotion on the earth!!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product because the cost is too high compared to other lotions which give me the same results. I purchased 3 bottles for gifts and one bottle for myself because of a Television Show which recommended it.  I&#x27;m sorry I spent my money on this product.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the oil I love it. Thank you for the oil I love it. Thank you Ilove it.</li>
            <li> I, too, came to this product by watching the tv show, &#x27;The Doctors.&#x27;  They said it is used on patients taking radiation treatment, and helps heal their skin.  So, I thought it would be a good lotion for my dry skin.  It cost $25 online, but I use a very small amount.  I do not put it all over, just on my face and arms.  I noticed a definite improvement in the texture of my skin after about a month of use.  My arms do not have those tiny little, almost invisible, bumps anymore, and feel much smoother and softer.  I believe it has helped my face feel smoother, too.  The lotion has ingredients other lotions do not, including oxygen.  It is not greasy at all and leaves the skin moist but dry.  I will be buying another bottle when this one is out, but it will last a long time since only a little is needed.  It&#x27;s a very thin lotion and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this AminoGenesis Cocoon Lotion because I have VERY dry skin and it was a product that was recommended on the TV show \\&quot;The Doctors\\&quot;. I have to say that the lotion is nice; it is not \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feeling on your skin which is a plus. It has a very light clean scent so that it can be used by either gender. The problem is that an 8-ounce bottle doesn&#x27;t last long if you use it as a body lotion after your shower; therefore making this product pretty pricey. In my opinion, I think there are other lotions out there that work just as well for less money. That&#x27;s the reason for only 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Nice leaves skin soft, I&#x27;d like the price to be a little less for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> Soaks in to the skin really fast!!  No oily slippery fingers after applied.  Helps with really chapped hands.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion is good but when I compared it with other lotions at half the price I believe it doesn&#x27;t really fall into the you get what you pay for category. It&#x27;s nice goes on smooth not sticky just a wee bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Wonderful...my skin feels like silk....so hydrating</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing special about this lotion. It doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy but instead youre left smelling like you just applied bug spray or furniture polish. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Now they’re newer and better than ever! Not too thick or thin. My entire body feels so relaxed while this cream is making me feel and look better. I highly recommend for the value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a satisfied AminoGenesis customer for the past seven years and their Cocoon Lotion is absolutely amazing.  It truly works wonders for dry skin, the amino acids are essential and you can literally feel it penetrating the epidermis. I use Cocoon predominantly on my face and hands, if I run out of it I will only use organic coconut oil or emu oil.  I also add a little coconut/emu oil with the Cocoon as well.  I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin silky smooth. I little worried about organic and inorganic compounds used in lotion however. Will continue to use for now.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible.  I have tried many lotions, creams, etc. but only this one is absorbed instantly, is not greasy, and makes your skin feel soft and smooth.  It also takes ten years off of your age after only using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m alergenicn and I can use this around my eyes, it&#x27;s soothing and not oily. Tops on my must have list.</li>
            <li> Love Aminogenises products</li>
            <li> It was ok.  Just an average lotion.</li>
            <li> I had irritations on first use, so I had to stop using it.  Not for my skin; Amazon wouldn&#x27;t refund nor would AminoGenesis.  I advise you to only buy if you have used it before.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  It is not greasy and leaves your skin very smooth.  My skin looks much better after a few applications.</li>
            <li> Yep this is the one I was talking about in my other review. This is the original and the best. When I ordered this again I received the white bottle labeled the same but didn&#x27;t actually give the same results. Moisture didn&#x27;t last all day even for a light body cream.</li>
            <li> If you have really dry skin, or get red bumps on your arms, this stuff is amazing for it. I use it every day because it is not too greasy and feels really light on your skin, but it moisturizes and make your skin feel silky smooth. Definitely recommend to all my friends!</li>
            <li> For over 20 years parts of my hands and feet crack, bleed, flake and are very painful.  I have tried many different over the counter product and prescription lotions for this with very little change.  Within the first week of using the Cocoon lotion I noticed a BIG change in my hands so I started using it on my feet and they too have improved.</li>
            <li> I have faith that this is indeed miracle cream. Less than most pricey lotions on the market.</li>
            <li> My wife asked me to buy some of this stuff for her because she ran out of it.  When I saw the price, I just about had a stroke. I figured that it must contain gold, platinum and maybe some diamond particles as an exfoliant. My wife looks about a hundred years younger than I do. So maybe there&#x27;s something to this stuff. She says that it works. If you saw her, you&#x27;d probably agree.</li>
            <li> Really a great product. The only reason I would only give it  four stars is I rush it was ins center. It is not the worst in the world a little lemony. It us as a guy I just would have liked it even better without fragrance.  It is what it says</li>
            <li> A very nice lotion that goes on and sinks in quickly and leaves the skin feeling very soft yet not greasy.</li>
            <li> Nothing stops aging unless you have a lot of money to go to plastic surgeon.  This stuff does not burn when you put it on right after you save, it keeps the dry flakeys away as long as u use it everyday religiously.</li>
            <li> I use this as my morning and night face and neck lotion. It balances my combination skin and heals acne over time.  I have used it for 2 months with the really really clean cleanser and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin keeps getting smoother,even,less wrinkled,and the sagging along my jaw line has completely firmed up. I am not exaggerating it looks firm and younger. It also has prevented the corse hairs I used to get under my chin. It has a light citrus scent so I have to avoid my eye area but it has healed my horrible skin so I don&#x27;t mind. It is not greasy and makes skin more moisturized over time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Really Great stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin moisturized.I swim several times&lt;br /&gt;a week at the Y. Its not greasy .it helps soothe itching .</li>
            <li> Love it...Love it...Love it...!</li>
            <li> This lotion is like a miracle drug. It&#x27;s the only lotion that really cures my skin problems. Thank you aminogenesis</li>
            <li> Love it and use it daily.</li>
            <li> This is their new AminoGenesis Cocoon Lotion, new packaging, new fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;They say it&#x27;s the same as the original, just a different fragrance.  I liked the original better.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the original fragrance and the lotion felt silkier.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing I can do about the change, except adapt.</li>
