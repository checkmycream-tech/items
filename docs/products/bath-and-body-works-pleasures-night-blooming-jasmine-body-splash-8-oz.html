            <li>I love this fragrance and I love the body splash concept</li>
            <li>Ok I use to LOVE this fragrance when it was carried at the store.</li>
            <li>I love this product and bath and body works no longer makes it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It is so nice to find scents and products that are no longer being sold by the original source.  </li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This body splash has a pleasant pure jasmine scent.</li>
            <li>I wish this was still available in the stores.  </li>
            <li>I get a lot of men approaching me wanting to know what I am wearing and telling me how great I smell.</li>
            <li>I am searching for something comparable, and more reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>But it is very, very concentrated!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how they can discontinue such a popular item.  </li>
            <li>The fresh scent stays with you and isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I used it in my car and it made it smell so fresh.</li>
            <li>I got this right away, along with the Shower Gel and Body Lotion.  </li>
            <li>It is a beautiful smell, but if I had to order again I would order a different scent that is the regular price, apparently this is discontinued and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s more $.</li>
            <li>Love the fresh smell and it last al day.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure this fragrance will be no different.</li>
            <li>Thanks for shipping a quality product in a speedy response time!</li>
            <li>I refuse to pay such an inflated price, even though I do love this scent.  </li>
            <li>exactly like real bushes of fragrant  Night Blooming Jasmines</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the 2nd product I&#x27;ve tried and my favorite by far.  </li>
            <li>i am glad BBW changed their bottles though, the old bottles leak a ton and i have lost entire bottles that way.</li>
            <li>We were both surprised that the product is exactly as displayed and described.</li>
            <li>This was what I&#x27;ve been looking for -- something that actually smells very much like night blooming jasmine.</li>
            <li>Its femenine and soft, everybody likes the way I smell.</li>
            <li>I would live to purchase more, but unable to find it.</li>
            <li>It was probably old and sat in the heat too long or something!</li>

            <li> Not strong and not weak.</li>
            <li> I nearly broke down in tears at the store!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> i mean really?????</li>
            <li> Even Ebay is asking that much if not more!</li>
            <li> Just because it&#x27;s discontinued doesn&#x27;t mean the product is new.</li>
            <li> I was saving a little bit bought long ago, just to use in the summer.  </li>
            <li> I love this and am disappointed it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use very small amounts and spray it on a wet skin just after a shower.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive scent receptors and this is the one that doesn&#x27;t have that annoying scent that makes me want to gag.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Bath &amp; Body has discontinued it.</li>
            <li> I had smelled this on a customer at work, when I asked her about it she was sad because she said the Bath and Body had discontinued making it, however she told the name</li>
            <li> I tried ordering it later from another website and it smelled HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> that price is just plain stupid</li>
            <li> too bad it&#x27;s discountinued</li>
            <li> Too bad that it seems this fragrance has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Too bad Bath and Body has discontinued it.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> I could never get it at the store which is so disappointing!</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> and I was so disappointed when it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

            <li> I could never get it at the store which is so disappointing! So when I saw it here I bought it immediately! It smells really nice. Not strong and not weak. Just perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had people ask me what perfume I was wearing. I&#x27;ve had a lot of compliments about this body spray. I absolutely love it! I heard they&#x27;re discontinuing it in the store. I nearly broke down in tears at the store! I have very sensitive scent receptors and this is the one that doesn&#x27;t have that annoying scent that makes me want to gag.</li>
            <li> Really pleased with this item. Buying through Amazon.com is always enjoyable. I love Bath and Body Works products and I&#x27;m sure this fragrance will be no different.</li>

            <li> Wife loves it and would order it again. She is very satisfied with the fragrance. We were both surprised that the product is exactly as displayed and described. Thanks for shipping a quality product in a speedy response time!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Night Blooming Jasmine body splash. It has a very pleasant smell and I use it every day. Great product.</li>

It is so nice to find scents and products that are no longer being sold by the original source.  I got this right away, along with the Shower Gel and Body Lotion.  It&#x27;s a triple pleasure!</li>
            <li> I have used this body spray for years.  It&#x27;s the only scent I wear, and it is discontinued by Bath and Body Works.  I don&#x27;t know how they can discontinue such a popular item.  The price has soared from $10 a bottle to $50 and upwards.  I refuse to pay such an inflated price, even though I do love this scent.  I am searching for something comparable, and more reasonably priced.  What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> This was always my favorite scent and I was so disappointed when it was discontinued. Thrilled I found it again.</li>
            <li> I love this and am disappointed it was discontinued. I paid a lot for my last one!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and I love the body splash concept, it isn&#x27;t as in your face as au de cologne.  Unfortunately Bath &amp; Body has discontinued it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time. A lot of people have been complementing its fragrance.Too bad Bath and Body has discontinued it.</li>
            <li> I had smelled this on a customer at work, when I asked her about it she was sad because she said the Bath and Body had discontinued making it, however she told the name and I found some !! It is a light, clean fragrance, I like it, I would buy more, and recommend it !!!</li>
            <li> Ok I use to LOVE this fragrance when it was carried at the store.When I received it it smelled &amp;#34;AWFUL&amp;#34; like tanning bed burnt skin! It was probably old and sat in the heat too long or something! I tried ordering it later from another website and it smelled HORRIBLE! Ladies,I would recommend you wait till Bath&amp; Body Works brings it back to there stores.Please do not waste your money!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and liked it and this is the reason for ordering it again.  The fresh scent stays with you and isn&#x27;t overpowering.  I like bath and body works products and this one I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Eighty dollars for this? Really? No way! Too bad. This splash is amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this product and bath and body works no longer makes it. I would live to purchase more, but unable to find it.</li>
            <li> Love the fresh smell and it last al day. Its femenine and soft, everybody likes the way I smell. I recomend it.</li>
            <li> to ask $60 for a bottle of body splash worth $18 is outragious!!!!! Please don&#x27;t buy this. Amazon should be ashamed that this is on its Website.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite. I used it in my car and it made it smell so fresh. But to ask $60 you are out of your mind! Even Ebay is asking that much if not more! Just because it&#x27;s discontinued doesn&#x27;t mean the product is new. After sitting for a while the alcohol in it tends to take over. So there&#x27;s no guarantee of what it will smell like. Very disappointing. Thinking about buying the plant just to have the smell around.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite body spray for the spring! i am glad BBW changed their bottles though, the old bottles leak a ton and i have lost entire bottles that way.</li>
            <li> I wish this was still available in the stores.  But, thrilled to get it at all.  I get a lot of men approaching me wanting to know what I am wearing and telling me how great I smell.</li>
