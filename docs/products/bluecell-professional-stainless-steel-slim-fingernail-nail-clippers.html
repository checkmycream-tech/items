            <li>Very nice and compact.  </li>
            <li>The first pair have always done a wonderful job trimming my nails and the cutters line up perfectly inline cheaper cutters that I refuse to use now.</li>

            <li>These clippers are great, well made sharp and the perfect size for my pocket.</li>
            <li>Nice and compact, but I&#x27;ve used better clippers.</li>
            <li>These clippers are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I already love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did;  they seem plenty strong and durable to carry around with me and use as needed.</li>
            <li>Very Surprised They are GREAT</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it WORKS on the nails on my fingers and thumbs.</li>
            <li>Perfect for fingernails and small toes, I have to work a bit on my big toes, but otherwise flawless.</li>
            <li>Fits into an Altoids tin or slips easily into pockets.</li>
            <li>That, coupled with these clippers being nice and sharp has made clipping my fingernails a much easier task to manage, I&#x27;m very happy that I bought these.</li>
            <li>these are pure class!!!</li>
            <li>Work fine.  </li>
            <li>simple, easy, and are great as an EDC in your pockets</li>
            <li>the cheap ones my wife keeps just don&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li>Study, well made; but light.</li>
            <li>Light weight and compact.</li>
            <li>Was not disappointed one bit.</li>
            <li>once in awhile you find something really cool,...</li>
            <li>But not a bad product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clips</li>
            <li>Super slim and great for travel in that they wont snag on anything in your bag - they lock in the closed position.</li>
            <li>Overall, very satisfied though.</li>
            <li>This is way smaller than the one I own.</li>
            <li>The strength of these clippers is just right</li>
            <li>They are compact, effective, and I think they will hold up for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is funny closing it up.</li>
            <li>Better to just go to the local drug store where you can see the size you want.</li>
            <li>This Lil pair tho goes straight into the survival gear.</li>
            <li>Love the closed mode so nothing catches on the blades.</li>
            <li>Very sharp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>fast shipping , the slim feature really helps control of nail cut</li>
            <li>Very fun to open and close</li>
            <li>This Bluecell clipper is surprisingly small and super light.  </li>
            <li>With these I have a nice flat, wide space to hold on to, which makes a world of difference.</li>
            <li>either.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;d probably be good enough to cut a baby&#x27;s or small child&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They expand from their storage mode which is definitely the weak point as far as long-term reliability goes but the approach they took is beautiful simplicity.</li>
            <li>Great little finger nail clipper, saves a lot of room in Altoid tin where I carry little things like this.</li>
            <li>They are the first non-drug-store-cheap pair I&#x27;ve owned and I will never go back.  </li>
            <li>Obviously not as thick as the Tweezerman and definitely not as heavy either,</li>
            <li>wife loves it fit in purse with little room</li>
            <li>These are actually sharp and are so tiny, they store easily for travel.  </li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;ve got thick nails, but I&#x27;ve owned many clippers over the years and some worked and</li>
            <li>It is a little small but does a good job.  </li>
            <li>This little thing has got to be the coolest little pair of clippers I will probably own.</li>
            <li>I still have them and find them to be very sharp and useful problem is everyone in the house loves to use them.</li>
            <li>They take a lot more pressure to clip nails and are smaller than the usual clippers you would grab at the local store.</li>
            <li>I later bought the DragonPad 12 Piece Nail Care Personal Manicure &amp; Pedicure Set, Travel &amp; Grooming Kit for less than $6 with free shipping.</li>
            <li>Cuts really close so be careful.</li>
            <li>My nails are tough enough that I frequently use them as screwdrivers and a cheap set of clippers leaves them jagged or with tethers.</li>
            <li>This is a small nail clipper but is powerful..</li>
            <li>Cool little gadget, kinda smaller than expected.</li>
            <li>super cool and very thin!</li>

            <li> super cool and very thin!</li>
            <li> Really cool looking, and very well built, though unfortunately its jaws don&#x27;t open wide enough to get to cut my nails properly, and I don&#x27;t have massive hands</li>
            <li> So I decided to buy myself a new pair and keep them hidden.</li>
            <li> Very flat, low profile in my pocket.</li>
            <li> Such a clever little tool!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take me long to figure out how to open it up</li>
            <li> Mine is 3.5 inches long.</li>
            <li> I am curious to know how long they will last.</li>
            <li> Still sharp enough to cut but need to pinch harder.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra few dollars and get the Victorinox or TweezarMan brand long clippers.</li>
            <li> I typically purchase the basic ones from a drug store, which are</li>
            <li> Looks cool, and the opening mechanism is neat, but it cuts nails VERY poorly.</li>
            <li> The lever on this one pops up and stays in place when you use the clippers, then folds down flat when you are done.</li>
            <li> granted I do expect it to be a little larger.</li>
            <li> I have only had them a few months, and though there is no sign of wear or degradation</li>
            <li> Extremely well designed.</li>
            <li> I looked at the expensive versions but thought I&#x27;d try this first.  </li>
            <li> I think they will last at least as long as the typical design.</li>
            <li> VERY sharp.</li>
            <li> A little over price...</li>
            <li> With my disability, using your average nail clippers was getting to be difficult, I don&#x27;t have the same coordination in my hands that I used to.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small, I&#x27;ll give them that, but they wouldn&#x27;t cut my nails.</li>
            <li> Too small for my use.</li>
            <li> No more fighting with the lever to keep it from spinning when you press it.</li>
            <li> Takes a minute to figure out how to get it open, but it&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t difficult.</li>
            <li> This is not for toe nails, while seems it can do the job, it is to small to cut...</li>
            <li> Half of the &#x27;jaw&#x27; is irregular, so that the two cutting edges don&#x27;t meet.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

            <li> My fingernails did not need clipping but I wanted to try it out.  It is a little small but does a good job.  It takes 3 clips across my thumb nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lost my fingernail clipper that I have had for years and the cheap ones my wife keeps just don&#x27;t do the job.  My nails are tough enough that I frequently use them as screwdrivers and a cheap set of clippers leaves them jagged or with tethers.</li>

            <li> great design. I would definitely buy it again</li>
            <li> Bought a pair of these over a decade ago when I was stationed in Germany. I still have them and find them to be very sharp and useful problem is everyone in the house loves to use them. So every time I need them I must hunt for them. So I decided to buy myself a new pair and keep them hidden. The first pair have always done a wonderful job trimming my nails and the cutters line up perfectly inline cheaper cutters that I refuse to use now.</li>

            <li> Tried these on out, n a whim. Was not disappointed one bit. Hope they can make a set for toe nails, granted I do expect it to be a little larger. This Lil pair tho goes straight into the survival gear.</li>
            <li> Such a clever little tool! Fits into an Altoids tin or slips easily into pockets. Love the closed mode so nothing catches on the blades.</li>

            <li> goodproduct. wife loves it fit in purse with little room</li>
            <li> Extremely well designed. Fit perfectly in a 5-pocket. Very sharp.&lt;br /&gt;These are some of the best nail cutters I&#x27;ve ever bought. I typically purchase the basic ones from a drug store, which are sub-par.&lt;br /&gt;The folding functionality is great!

            <li> They&#x27;re small, I&#x27;ll give them that, but they wouldn&#x27;t cut my nails. I know I&#x27;ve got thick nails, but I&#x27;ve owned many clippers over the years and some worked and some didn&#x27;t. I had to return these, they just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This is way smaller than the one I own. Mine is 3.5 inches long. This one is 2.5 inches. Disappointed. Too small for my use. Better to just go to the local drug store where you can see the size you want. I was fooled. Still sharp enough to cut but need to pinch harder. Plan to give away as gifts for CHILDREN.  I later bought the DragonPad 12 Piece Nail Care Personal Manicure &amp; Pedicure Set, Travel &amp; Grooming Kit for less than $6 with free shipping. Look it up here at Amazon.com.</li>

            <li> This is a small nail clipper but is powerful.. I like it</li>
            <li> I got these clippers alongside the Tweezerman 3013-P.  I wanted one for my travel bag and one for at home.  This Bluecell clipper is surprisingly small and super light.  Obviously not as thick as the Tweezerman and definitely not as heavy either, but that&#x27;s the reason why I bought both!  It didn&#x27;t take me long to figure out how to open it up and it&#x27;s really simple to close back together.  This little thing has got to be the coolest little pair of clippers I will probably own.</li>
            <li> These are great.  I looked at the expensive versions but thought I&#x27;d try this first.  I&#x27;m so glad I did;  they seem plenty strong and durable to carry around with me and use as needed.</li>
            <li> Quite the nifty gadget.  Great for travel.  Work fine.  Takes a minute to figure out how to get it open, but it&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t difficult.</li>
            <li> They are compact, effective, and I think they will hold up for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They expand from their storage mode which is definitely the weak point as far as long-term reliability goes but the approach they took is beautiful simplicity. I think they will last at least as long as the typical design.</li>

            <li> A little over price... But not a bad product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clips finger nails with ease. I bought it to keep in my pocket so I can get paid at work to clip my nails.</li>
            <li> Light weight and compact. I already love this. Perfect for fingernails and small toes, I have to work a bit on my big toes, but otherwise flawless. Very fun to open and close, a great design. It is great for backpacking, car camping and train trips.</li>
            <li> Nice, it has a good construction. This is not for toe nails, while seems it can do the job, it is to small to cut...</li>
