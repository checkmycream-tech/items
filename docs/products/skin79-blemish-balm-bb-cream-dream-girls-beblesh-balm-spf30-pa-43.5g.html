            <li>I would recommend the VIP Gold by Skin79 if you are looking for a great full coverage BB with excellent sun protection.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t good for coverage</li>
            <li>and I feel good knowing my skin is protected.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good deal on primer, this BB cream is for you.</li>
            <li>For people like me with combination-oily and fair skin- these are NOT qualities I want in a BB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It gives your skin a great fresh glow- not shimmer or sparkle, just a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>About 15 mins after application it has melted and blended with the skin leaving a very clean and bright complexion that looks almost makeup free... if you get a quality product that is.</li>
            <li>79 Dream Girls BB Cream is a 5 star, Grade A++, and one of the best products I use in my daily routine..nder 40 with combination or oily skin and a fair or light skin complexion</li>
            <li>It does feel nice and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>I love the fact it has SPF in it as well.</li>
            <li>79 Dream Girls BB Cream is a 5 star, Grade A++, and one of the best products I use in my daily routine..</li>
            <li>But I like it :)</li>
            <li>By itself it doesn&#x27;t provide a lot of coverage, but paired with a mineral powder, the results are phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the product itself, and just as pleased with the price :)</li>

            <li>I also love how it has SPF 30.</li>
            <li>It also smells amazing, very fresh...</li>
            <li>I chose this BB Cream because it says it helps with oil control and is great for sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>This product also doubles as a great primer under powder, when combined, tends to give a nice even coverage without looking cakey or strange.</li>
            <li>When I run out I think I&#x27;m going to try other bb creams, but if I can&#x27;t seen to find one I like best, I&#x27;ll buy this one again.</li>
            <li>It has a smooth texture, and goes on the skin easy.</li>
            <li>all work and seem just fine until you compare to brands like Skin 79.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>I love BB cream, gives enough cover to even out my fair skin tone.</li>
            <li>Skin79 is the queen bee of BB creams and Dream Girls is one of my all-time favorites in their line of high quality, highly effective</li>
            <li>Not as good as the super pink BB cream but its pretty good too.</li>
            <li>fully sealed, in their original packaging, wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>As a 22 year old, with massive amounts of freckles and sun spots I have been looking for the perfect coverage and concealing makeup.</li>
            <li>but it works really well for my skin as I prefer very light coverage.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel really nice and soft when I put it on.</li>
            <li>For someone who is looking for a full coverage BB, this is not it.</li>
            <li>totally going to try more!</li>
            <li>So I wonder what exactly IS the difference?!</li>
            <li>The scent is light, almost citris, but really un-noticable once the product is on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin looking fresh.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell, and when I take it off I can tell it has helped my skin, as my skin is soft and glowing upon removal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cheaper BB cream manufacturers that you find in the local grocery store or Walgreens (the &#x27;easy breezy beautiful&#x27;, fruity, or &#x27;maybe it&#x27;s&#x27; that other brand)</li>
            <li>This Beblesh Balm barely provides any coverage and does not even out my skin tone as far as I can see, although it does make for a good (and economical) primer.</li>
            <li>Only issue I have with it is that it&#x27;s a very light coverage, and I still have to wear concealer with it.</li>
            <li>This was my first BB cream experience, and I am unsure whether I will come back for more.</li>
            <li>although that was the first time</li>
            <li>first skin79 product.</li>

            <li>The only positive I can say is that my skin did feel smooth when i used it.</li>
            <li>If used alone, it looks like your not wearing any make-up but can diminish the imperfections in the skin (not big pimples, just fine veins, etc.)</li>
            <li>The special formula leaves a matte/satin finish that never looks greasy or shiny and will last you ALL DAY LONG (especially if you add a light dusting of your favorite quality and non-imitation pure mineral finishing powder and and even lighter dusting of bronzing blush over your cheekbones, nose, chin, and</li>
            <li>It tends to get very oily in the summer/spring and drier in the winter, and since I saw this was for &#x27;juniors with troublesome skin&#x27;</li>
            <li>and it really did not cover my acne or acne marks.</li>
            <li>I myself am 17 and have really been looking for a product designed for my age group.</li>
            <li>I do not use this product on my whole face.</li>
            <li>I wanted a very lightweight bb cream</li>
            <li>From what I have tried, they are all very greasy and cause pimples and blemishes, partially because they contain oil and many are not anti-comedogenic.</li>
            <li>There are other Skin79 products that do the job better than this.</li>
            <li>open the pacakge, so excited.</li>
            <li>The coverage is very very light and the color to dark for me.</li>
            <li>Does a decent job for those days were</li>
            <li>Worth the price, and will last you about 3-5 months if you use sparingly.</li>
            <li>The brand new bright and smoothed skin surface shows minimal pores, reduced redness, and after a short time of regular use, no breakout.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this, I knew right off the bat it would deliver relatively low coverage.</li>
            <li>then the old one I had, also it&#x27;s much more watery and the coverage isn&#x27;t nearly as good :(</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very watery and sheer, barely even covering up any blemishes, no matter how much I put on.</li>
            <li>so she could have sunscreen, a little moisturizer and light coverage for her breakouts.</li>

            <li>It did make my skin looks nicer and soft</li>
            <li>If you are looking to replace your foundation, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular product, although I suppose it might be worth a shot, since this did not even cause my extra sensitive skin to break out or dry up.</li>
            <li>So far I kinda like this bb cream.</li>
            <li>this seller offers it at an affordable price</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you that want a sheer BB, you&#x27;ll really like this.</li>
            <li>I tend to where foundation on a daily basis, but really like to use this in the summer (because of the SPF)</li>
            <li>I got this for my 13 year old -</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and it feels very light.</li>
            <li>they ALL have exactly the same ingredients in the same order.</li>
            <li>Will purchase again if the Hot Pink BB Cream doesn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
            <li>It definitely didnt live up to its claims.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, but I have had no issues with breaking out from wearing this daily.</li>
            <li>I have yet to witness any long-term benefits as well, although I suppose that may become apparent with prolonged use of the product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this BB Cream together with the Hot Pink BB Cream from the same Korean brand.</li>
            <li>use this in the summer, when I&#x27;m active rather than sunscreen (which causes me to break out like WHOA, haha)</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for younger girls, around 11 or 12 that feel left out in the makeup game, as the coverage is light and natural and provides sun protection.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need to try the Intense Classic or the Hot Pink bb creams, but this one was a fail for me.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was playing around and saw an ad about BB creams. I did a lot of research to find a kind of BB creams that would suit me and I picked this. It did make my skin looks nicer and soft but it wasn&#x27;t good for coverage (I am a teenager and this product said it was designed for juniors)</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product. I bought it, because my skin is troublesome. It tends to get very oily in the summer/spring and drier in the winter, and since I saw this was for &#x27;juniors with troublesome skin&#x27; I decided to try it. It has a smooth texture, and goes on the skin easy. A little goes a long way, and it feels very light. If used alone, it looks like your not wearing any make-up but can diminish the imperfections in the skin (not big pimples, just fine veins, etc.) I love the fact it has SPF in it as well. The scent is light, almost citris, but really un-noticable once the product is on.&lt;br /&gt;I use this in the summer, when I&#x27;m active rather than sunscreen (which causes me to break out like WHOA, haha) and I feel good knowing my skin is protected. This product also doubles as a great primer under powder, when combined, tends to give a nice even coverage without looking cakey or strange.</li>
            <li> I bought this BB cream for a friend, she said me that it works, she is happy with this product. Based in her experience I recommended this cream.</li>
            <li> This was my first BB cream experience, and I am unsure whether I will come back for more. This Beblesh Balm barely provides any coverage and does not even out my skin tone as far as I can see, although it does make for a good (and economical) primer. I have yet to witness any long-term benefits as well, although I suppose that may become apparent with prolonged use of the product. If you are looking for a good deal on primer, this BB cream is for you. If you are looking to replace your foundation, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular product, although I suppose it might be worth a shot, since this did not even cause my extra sensitive skin to break out or dry up.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin looking fresh. My face looks shiny but not oily. I read a review online on YouTube. It does smell soapy but, it didn&#x27;t bother me at all. I like the soapy smell. Don&#x27;t worry it will not make you sneeze like perfume does. It goes away after application.</li>
            <li> It seems like a tinted sunscreen. The coverage is very very light and the color to dark for me. If your skin is medium in color with few flaws it will work really well for summer with some oil absorption to tone down the sheen. But if you want any coverage at all it probably won&#x27;t work well for you.</li>
            <li> I know this product is for teens (I should&#x27;ve read lol) but it works really well for my skin as I prefer very light coverage. Does a decent job for those days were you don&#x27;t want to wear makeup but want your skin to be a bit evened out and of course, protected from the sun. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll order again but I love Skin 79 a lot and the packaging is so beautiful!</li>
            <li> I purchased this BB Cream together with the Hot Pink BB Cream from the same Korean brand. If you are in your teens and have combination skin this BB Cream is perfect for you. I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and it has worked wonders on me. It controls the sebum on your skin so you won&#x27;t have to be reapplying your makeup over and over again. Will purchase again if the Hot Pink BB Cream doesn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
            <li> I love BB cream, gives enough cover to even out my fair skin tone. About 15 mins after application it has melted and blended with the skin leaving a very clean and bright complexion that looks almost makeup free... if you get a quality product that is. Skin79 is the queen bee of BB creams and Dream Girls is one of my all-time favorites in their line of high quality, highly effective BBs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cheaper BB cream manufacturers that you find in the local grocery store or Walgreens (the &#x27;easy breezy beautiful&#x27;, fruity, or &#x27;maybe it&#x27;s&#x27; that other brand) all work and seem just fine until you compare to brands like Skin 79. These cheaper versions are almost all the wrong tone and are nearly impossible to match. Way too gray, not sun kissed but orange, or somewhat sickly and yellowish. They leaving you looking a lifeless, plastic, even jaundice-stricken. They are too thick and go on like oil paint, or too thin an sweat off with the smallest amount of humidity. From what I have tried, they are all very greasy and cause pimples and blemishes, partially because they contain oil and many are not anti-comedogenic.For people like me with combination-oily and fair skin- these are NOT qualities I want in a BB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dream Girls has solved that for me. The neutrally fair, naturally warm, peach-beige color and powder unfused BB blends perfectly into the skin. The brand new bright and smoothed skin surface shows minimal pores, reduced redness, and after a short time of regular use, no breakout. The special formula leaves a matte/satin finish that never looks greasy or shiny and will last you ALL DAY LONG (especially if you add a light dusting of your favorite quality and non-imitation pure mineral finishing powder and and even lighter dusting of bronzing blush over your cheekbones, nose, chin, and temples).And it all washes completely away with a mild cleanser at the end of the day. No clogged pores. No greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone under 40 with combination or oily skin and a fair or light skin complexion (oh yeah, no need to wear sunscreen anymore, this stuff is a 30spf broad spectrum sunscreen) and I would still recommend it to anyone with a light to medium, or even golden complexion, especially if you have the savvy to add a small amount of a darker BB or even your favourite liquid foundation in a darker shade so you can mix and match to a color that will blend ant match your tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin 79 Dream Girls BB Cream is a 5 star, Grade A++, and one of the best products I use in my daily routine..nder 40 with combination or oily skin and a fair or light skin complexion (oh yeah, no need to wear sunscreen anymore, this stuff is a 30spf broad spectrum sunscreen) and I would still recommend it to anyone with a light to medium, or even golden complexion, especially if you have the savvy to add a small amount of a darker BB or even your favourite liquid foundation in a darker shade so you can mix and match to a color that will blend ant match your tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin 79 Dream Girls BB Cream is a 5 star, Grade A++, and one of the best products I use in my daily routine..</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product I have acne and it did not do anything for my acne and it really did not cover my acne or acne marks. There are other Skin79 products that do the job better than this.</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected. I myself am 17 and have really been looking for a product designed for my age group. This product was supposed to be non oily and help but when I apply it, it&#x27;s just way too shiny and actually feels like it slides on my skin. It&#x27;s very watery and sheer, barely even covering up any blemishes, no matter how much I put on. Will not buy again and do not recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and does good things for the skin but there&#x27;s like no coverage. It&#x27;s more of a moisturizer or sun screen! But I like it :)</li>
            <li> As a 22 year old, with massive amounts of freckles and sun spots I have been looking for the perfect coverage and concealing makeup. I have to say that this does the trick. I do not use this product on my whole face. I just put a few dabs under the eyes and mix along with my regular daily cover up.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! By itself it doesn&#x27;t provide a lot of coverage, but paired with a mineral powder, the results are phenomenal. I have very sensitive skin, but I have had no issues with breaking out from wearing this daily. I like that it mattifies without looking caked on. I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the product itself, and just as pleased with the price :)</li>
            <li> Not as good as the super pink BB cream but its pretty good too. Evens out skin and gives you a good finish. Worth the price, and will last you about 3-5 months if you use sparingly.</li>
            <li> ok im 13. this stuff says for juniors, so perfect! ok i will step by step tell you how i fist used this. open the pacakge, so excited. read instuctions on the inside of the box. ( u rip the box open and u see instuctions) used it how it says. looked gray undertone. put it all over, and a few minutes later it ajusts to your skin, and i notice that it looks like the redness is covered up. i used this over my neutrogena visibly even daily moisturizer with spf 30 this stuff also has spf 30 and pa ++ watever that means:/ i love it. although that was the first time and i hope it will be awesome and the product will last a long time. first skin79 product. totally going to try more!</li>
            <li> So far I kinda like this bb cream. My skin hasn&#x27;t been as oily as it has with other brands i&#x27;ve tried. Only issue I have with it is that it&#x27;s a very light coverage, and I still have to wear concealer with it. When I run out I think I&#x27;m going to try other bb creams, but if I can&#x27;t seen to find one I like best, I&#x27;ll buy this one again.</li>
            <li> i love this BB cream. in my opinion its the best one out there for light coverage. this seller offers it at an affordable price so i snatched up 2 and i could not be more pleased at the condition they arrived in. fully sealed, in their original packaging, wrapped in bubble wrap. it also came with a couple free samples which was a nice suprise! love it...so happy!!!</li>
            <li> it seems darker on me then the old one I had, also it&#x27;s much more watery and the coverage isn&#x27;t nearly as good :(</li>
            <li> With this BB cream, it is what it is... meaning it&#x27;s similar to American BB Creams in the sense that it has very sheer coverage. This will NOT cover ANYTHING... move on from this if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you that want a sheer BB, you&#x27;ll really like this. It gives your skin a great fresh glow- not shimmer or sparkle, just a healthy glow. It also smells amazing, very fresh... if you&#x27;re worried about it smelling, the smell fades after awhile. This makes my skin feel really nice and soft when I put it on. I tend to where foundation on a daily basis, but really like to use this in the summer (because of the SPF) and when I want something light and natural on my face.</li>
            <li> I like this BB cream and I am not a &#x27;junior&#x27; as it suggests as the typical user! I am over 50 with mild acne and lots of brown spots, this product is working well so far! When I read ingredients for the 4 different BB creams I ordered- they ALL have exactly the same ingredients in the same order. Odd? So I wonder what exactly IS the difference?!</li>
            <li> I got this for my 13 year old - I wanted a very lightweight bb cream so she could have sunscreen, a little moisturizer and light coverage for her breakouts. She does not wear makeup - just this cream. So it is perfect if you are looking for a sunscreen with light, light coverage. It does feel nice and goes on easily.</li>
            <li> I have oily acne prone skin. I have been to a dermatologist and have cleared up my acne with medications. I chose this BB Cream because it says it helps with oil control and is great for sensitive acne prone skin. I also love how it has SPF 30. BUT when i used this product it gave no coverage and it made me oily. It definitely didnt live up to its claims. Maybe I need to try the Intense Classic or the Hot Pink bb creams, but this one was a fail for me. The only positive I can say is that my skin did feel smooth when i used it.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this, I knew right off the bat it would deliver relatively low coverage. I use it as a primer, and it works wonderfully as such and ensures an even application of my other BBs. For someone who is looking for a full coverage BB, this is not it. I would recommend the VIP Gold by Skin79 if you are looking for a great full coverage BB with excellent sun protection. I would recommend this for younger girls, around 11 or 12 that feel left out in the makeup game, as the coverage is light and natural and provides sun protection. I absolutely love the smell, and when I take it off I can tell it has helped my skin, as my skin is soft and glowing upon removal. I love Skin79 products and this one is no different!</li>
