    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Everyone who sees me comments on my flawless complexion.</li>
            <li>Both of these make my skin look great!</li>
            <li>Diet is the best way to improve your skin.</li>
            <li>Wonderful.</li>
            <li>If you already have oily skin, it may not be best for you.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful..... for me.  </li>
            <li>It may be the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my face</li>
            <li>The day cream with SPF and the Creme de Serum are both awesome</li>
            <li>I have been using the day and night regiments for about 3 weeks now and my face is flawless.</li>
            <li>and i absolutely loved it!!!  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say its the best or works wonders</li>
            <li>my skin is the best it&#x27;s been.</li>
            <li>so my advice would be to give it a chance because if you have results like I did, you will be very happy.</li>
            <li>i told them the problem, they then tried to sell me more product to combat this !!!</li>
            <li>AND WE WANT TO LOOK BEAUTIFUL</li>
            <li>Buy a juicer, incorporate veggies in your diet by hiding the taste with fruit and you will be beautiful inside and out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had beautiful skin</li>
            <li>lol.     </li>
            <li>I order it and is working for me greatly...</li>
            <li>Great marketing though, I will give them that.</li>
            <li>This product line has been great for me.  </li>
            <li>Also, a test of whether a product makes a difference or if it is working well-- is if someone says to you &amp;#34;your face looks great</li>
            <li>We had great difficulty canceling this order &amp; it ended up costing us shipment both ways.  </li>
            <li>they suck you in with this great offer then after you give all your infomation</li>
            <li>Maybe not, maybe these products are greatly helping Cindy look the way she does, but</li>
            <li>So for me all experience with the product &amp; its representatives have been great.</li>
            <li>and the reason I changed my mind, once i got online and read reviews, no one was really happy with the product in terms of getting rid of wrinkles and smoothing out the skin.</li>
            <li>I have used the masque with great results.</li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>Both of the products I purchased, The Meaningful Beatuy Trial Kit &amp; Wen Trail Kit I have found to be wonderful.  </li>
            <li>my skin is absolutely flawless, my pores are not even visible, and I get so many comments on how my skin just glows.</li>
            <li>The serum is awesome also, it isn&#x27;t oily like most moisturizers can be...</li>
            <li>but Meaningful Beauty IS THE BEST...</li>
            <li>Really good product.</li>
            <li>,IF IF IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE,IT PROBALLY ISN&#x60;T</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my Mom who has been looking for a good skin care regime.  </li>
            <li>so I am good.</li>
            <li>Also, some people just have good skin genes, and anything will work for them.</li>
            <li>and I thought because of the star endorsements this product must be good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually so good about researching products and reviews online before I buy anything.  </li>
            <li>Might be good for someone who isn&#x27;t prone to breakouts</li>
            <li>but I fortunely have had nothing but good experiences with it.</li>
            <li>But the good news was they cancelled my sub.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, the best products are the night creme and the rich moisture masque.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased.  </li>
            <li>To make the price even more, they will send a bottle of vitamins (that will not be requested) and proceed to charge your card $98.82!  </li>
            <li>and I see Cindy Crawford and she talks about what a miracle product Meaningful Beauty is--really?!</li>
            <li>Also, the products didn&#x27;t show any better results than the over-the-counter products I was already using and they are alot cheaper!</li>
            <li>I love these products!  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;you smell nice, mommy...\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Time</li>
            <li>I kind of like the fact that I dont have to worry about running out</li>
            <li>Lets see what Cindy looks like now, and proof, she uses her own product.</li>
            <li>Cindy Crawford should be ashamed of herself for associating herself with these kind of actions.......</li>
            <li>The absolute best advice I can give is to NEVER order anything from the toll-free number on the infomercial.</li>
            <li>Cindy Crawford may be a nice business woman.</li>
            <li>It did make my skin feel nice, no breakouts (and I do have acne-prone skin.)</li>
            <li>got a nice person who said she had cancelled my order.</li>
            <li>because I liked the product.</li>
            <li>I called the customer care line once to ask about customizing my kit and the lady was pleasantly kind plus helpful.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly liked the product &amp; even though I do feel it is alittle over priced</li>
            <li>Good cosmetics work, but this is over priced, and the customer service at Meaningful Beauty is virtually non-existent</li>
            <li>The neck cream is not as effective as what I was using.</li>
            <li>But to be fair, I should have read more or researched more before I made an online order.</li>
            <li>The masque felt great and washed right off with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best thing so far, is the anti-wrinkle liquid in capsules.</li>
            <li>Products are fair, nothing special.</li>
            <li>My experience was good and my refund came through right away!  </li>
            <li>But for those of you who really do want beautiful radiant skin, stop buying these &amp;#34;quick fix&amp;#34; scam creams.</li>
            <li>My experience was just fine!</li>
            <li>so wanted to share my positive experience, although the product &amp;#34;promises&amp;#34; great results</li>
            <li>and I simply love them.  </li>
            <li>love the mask and night fluide</li>
            <li>I bought this product but not from Amizon and its OK.</li>
            <li>The Glowing Serum feel FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it has helped with anti-aging issues, but friends mentioned that I seem more confident during the times I am using the system.</li>
            <li>Now before I go more into it, I was 24 when I started using it and</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really think it was that great, until I continued to use</li>
            <li>At night, I wash all my makeup off, repeat the process but use the Meaningful beauty night cream, and I go to bed.</li>
            <li>The face wash does nothing, might as well be using water and the rest of the products aren&#x27;t any better.</li>
            <li>I was told I had to call customer service where they wanted to talk to me about the benefits of the product, the flexibility of shipments and more BS.  </li>
            <li>I love the product ...</li>
            <li>u just have to give it more time so that your face gets used to it</li>
            <li>I purchased 1st shipment and products were ok.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use everything they have just the creme de serum mostly and the antioxidant day cream.</li>
            <li>Plenty of water,  healthy eating, and healthy living.  </li>
            <li>Also many women have hormone issues,</li>
            <li>I purchased Meaningful Beauty through Guthy Renker, not Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I received this explanation when I questioned the charges from Meaningful Beauty.</li>
            <li>Thinking it would get better</li>
            <li>I will stick to otc and save many many $$</li>
            <li>I received my latest package of 7 products for 150 bucks and the packaging and pamphlet stated you could customize order</li>
            <li>Okay people, here is the deal.</li>
            <li>However, her product Meaningful Beauty?</li>
            <li>Until they change those practices, I wouldn&#x27;t touch Meaningful Beauty with a 10 ft pole.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Meaningful Beauty about five months ago.</li>
            <li>Try itâ€¦but really use it day and night, if you want to witness great results.</li>
            <li>The cleanser was just  &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;, I can find a better one, and the day creme SPF</li>
            <li>A lot of cheaper products work better.</li>
            <li>yet I&#x27;m still getting bills on top of bills.</li>
            <li>Its been almost a month since everything has been cancelled and cleared and even though my husband nor myself has an account with meaningful beauty</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M GLAD THAT MY MORTGAGE COMPANY DID NOT DECIDE TO &amp;#34;ACCELERATE&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>THE POST OFFICE SAID THEY SEND BACK SO MANY OF THESE ITEMS THAT THEY THINK THE GOV&#x27;T NEEDS TO INTERVENE!!!!!!</li>
            <li>There are many options out there that are paraben-free and</li>
            <li>I called to order a Meaningful Beauty kit</li>
            <li>So, I call the customer service line to make sure that my online order was just a one-time order for one kit.  </li>
            <li>and I may LOVE it, but</li>
            <li>for those of you who think you have whiteheads caused by Meaningful Beauty products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;DO NOT - I REPEAT - DO NOT sign up for any Meaningful Beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What ever you do make sure you realize that you will be set up AND charged for shipping and auto delivery</li>
            <li>I just ordered the toner and am waiting to try it, however I&#x27;m sure I will like it as well.</li>
            <li>I started using the meaningful beauty products a week ago</li>
            <li>Meaningful Beauty does not seem to do this.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to find this on the store shelves.</li>
            <li>I would and have told many people to try this out.</li>
            <li>DO NOT order this product unless you are 100% sure you want it and are going to keep it.</li>
            <li>I have been using meaningful beauty for about 1 week.  </li>
            <li>I love all their products except their face wash.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Meaningful Beauty for two months now, and here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
            <li>The day cream has better consistency, but doesn&#x27;t seem to work better than what I used before.</li>
            <li>I use it before I go to bed on weekends to give it more time to \\&quot;work\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t have many)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d advise those of you who want to know if you&#x27;ll get a return on your investment to wait until more people report results.</li>
            <li>received so many compliments on my complexion during the time I was using it.  </li>
            <li>Might as well spend money on drug store products and get better result.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>The infomercial is so convincing.</li>
            <li>Cindy Crawford sounds more like she took a bite out of a lying sack of s</li>
            <li>and my face looked more hyrdated.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get rid of wrinkles with creams or serums, maybe skin tone will look better, but cosmetic surgery removes wrinkles, not creams.  </li>
            <li>Creme Serum was OK but the rest of the line was like spreading crisco on my face (which I could have done for pennies on the dollar)</li>
            <li>I have used all of them and just ordered more.</li>
            <li>love the neck and chest cream too.</li>
            <li>I will continue using Meaningful Beauty for years to come.</li>
            <li>and there are many days I don&#x27;t put makeup on.</li>
            <li>Person was pleasant said she could not tell exactly when it would ship, but she gave me a &amp;#34;within 10 days&amp;#34; timeframe.  </li>
            <li>When I ordered my first kitâ€¦I saw NOTHING about this being on automatic shipment!!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li>just wanted to say the main products work great for me.  </li>
            <li>It feels very clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>The magic melon juice or whatever it is, might be helping Cindy Crawford, but I suspect her beauty comes more from good genes, a healthy lifestyle, and maybe a nip tuck doctor or some clever photoshopping.  </li>
            <li>I have to deduce that the stuff was working, because I noticed a significant difference when I stopped!</li>
            <li>You know those products that you read about which make some amazing claims regarding what they&#x27;ll do for you, and with great skepticism you buy the product, and then are pleasantly surprised to find the claims are true?  </li>
            <li>Better read the fine print.</li>
            <li>AND IN DECEMBER, AT THE TIME WHEN YOUR MONEY IS MOST IMPORTANT</li>
            <li>I so irritated I wanted to return the special offer unopened!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find such a great deal on the television, that I quickly purchased it because I had been waiting to find a good deal like this.  </li>
            <li>I have tried lots of facial moisturizers and I am happy with meaningful beauty.  </li>
            <li>STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST WORKING WITH THIS COMPANY IN MY EXPERIENCE.</li>
            <li>I ordered the full sized products of meaningful beauty in november 2013.</li>
            <li>I use the exfoliating scrub and it works fine with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>eyebrows are fine) to break off and/or fall out.  </li>
            <li>Fine.</li>
            <li>Take away the fine print.</li>
            <li>When you order the 5 piece trial, before you receive it &amp; see all the fine print, your credit card will be billed for the 1st of 3 installments of over $43 each for a continuous supply.  </li>
            <li>I used it for a month and saw no reduction or softening of my fine lines.</li>
            <li>When used consistently, my fine lines are diminished and my skin tone is more even, allowing me to look great with minimal make up coverage.  </li>
            <li>Huge hassle.</li>
            <li>I saw this package deal on tv for really cheap, so I decided to buy it.</li>
            <li>While I really liked this product and have been using it for over 6 months, the pricing set up is really deceiving.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Meaningful Beauty and was not unhappy with the cleanser.  </li>
            <li>and there would be free shipping.</li>
            <li>BUT, since you also receive a free &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34; of vitamins, those vitamins come in a separate shipping.</li>
            <li>This is NOT the way to do business if you want happy customers and low returns.</li>
            <li>i really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap, but best results from &amp;#34;over the counter&amp;#34; products that I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li>Each kit is advertised at $39.99 for a 30 day supply and also includes some free trial products.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is gentle, yet removes oil, makeup and dirt effectively.  </li>
            <li>My skin is really smooth</li>
            <li>but it did make my skin feel really smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>Go to the local drug store and spend a fraction of the cost on Aveeno and be happy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, not recommending these products, save your money and try a good loofa followed by some vaseline if you want soft skin.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with these products that I can&#x27;t say enough about how good they are and how well I like them.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the hype is about this product, nothing special and there was no noticeable difference on my face of fine wrinkles or lines.</li>
            <li>AS RICH AS</li>
            <li>I started using this product, and at first, like many of you</li>
            <li>i am interested to try more of the products that were not in my set.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about ordering my starter kit that I also ordered one for my grandmother to try.</li>
            <li>So glad I read the reviews first</li>
            <li>Parabens are known cancer-causing agents and will not be absorbed into this skin!  </li>
            <li>Hey, Cindy Crawford endorses it, other celebrities were raving about how wonderful it is, and it was pretty affordable, so</li>
            <li>I have now paid $200 for something I originally wanted a $40 supply of.  </li>
            <li>Worth the shot!</li>
            <li>It is not bad at all, made my skin smooth</li>
            <li>The Pore Refining Toner and the Skin Softening Cleanser leave my skin clean, but not irritated.</li>
            <li>I had the UPS tracking number, confirmed delivery receipt via UPS online, but that wasn&#x27;t good enough...</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin but have never gotten a rash or anything but amazing results.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for anyone who has skin that is normal to dry.  </li>
            <li>I specifically ordered a one time special for 39.99.  </li>
            <li>I certainly need the help more than she does, and that&#x27;s not happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I signed up for the Meaningful Beauty starter kit, excited to try a new product and hopefully have some help with fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more of the products very soon.  </li>
            <li>TRUE.</li>
            <li>As I understand it, if you DO manage to get  a credit (and we haven&#x27;t yet), it&#x27;s not for the full amount, because they deduct &amp;#34;shipping and handling.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Meaningful Beauty</li>
            <li>My regular moisturizer is just as good...</li>
            <li>two days later I get a cheery note in my email saying my shipment is on its way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Meaningful Beauty products for a while now, and while they haven&#x27;t harmed my skin, I&#x27;m not seeing much benefit either.  </li>
            <li>I tried MB, and so far have really liked the results.</li>
            <li>I use the cleanser in conjunction with my clarisonic to get a good deep cleanse.</li>
            <li>A trip to the dermatologist landed me with a histamine shot and a $200 prescription for medicated cream to cure a full blown allergic reaction to the melon extract.</li>
            <li>Its not &#x27;&#x27;bad&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li>None of it was great, and it is extremely over priced.</li>
            <li>because so many people have reported having problems, I am guessing they have allergy to the main ingredient in this product being the mellon extract.       </li>
            <li>This is a scam worthy of the Nigerian underground.  </li>
            <li>before this product I used Jafra wich was working wonderfully great for about 4 years but all of the sudden it was not my skin is very sesitive and meaningfull beauty</li>
            <li>The mask drys quickly.</li>
            <li>All you need to look beautiful is a little nutrition.</li>
            <li>and I totally credit my using the Meaningful Beauty products for that!  </li>
            <li>- really!?!?)</li>
            <li>I read many, many reviews and only one was positive.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of it because it has too many different things to put on day and night</li>
            <li>Overall you are better getting a different system it seems good for the price</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every dime.</li>
            <li>felt with my own personal results</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have tried many products out there from over-the-counter to department store brands and none compare to these products.  </li>
            <li>and I rarely ever have a pimple.</li>
            <li>Not a company that you should buy direct from, however if you get product separate from a contract on Amazon you may have better luck.</li>
            <li>Then comes in another 30 days the full sized product that they charge your card EVERY MONTH from the time you get the samples until they send you a NEW DELIVERY in 30 days (\\&quot;free gift\\&quot; charged to your credit card).</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d give it a try, right?</li>
            <li>I would still not feel clean and want to wash my face with a real cleanser.      </li>
            <li>I have fairly good skin for a 50 year old (not too much older than Cindy Crawford)...but the issue of believing nonsence that after so many weeks the skin becomes different in a positive way.</li>
            <li>If you want smooth silky skin I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Use Retin A and a good exfoliator on dark spots, takes some time</li>
            <li>The product or customer no service, didn&#x27;t know the original trial was an excuse to send more at higher price.</li>
            <li>As for our purchases we will return to our local cosmetic store, which as I noted provide products that are really just as effective.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very soft and smooth and never breaks me out.</li>
            <li>My skin bounced back so quickly and the fine lines I was so upset about were soothed away.  </li>
            <li>Please be sure to try this on another part of your body prior to putting it on your face.  </li>
            <li>It is very oily, and a week after I started using it, I started to get rashes all over my face and neck!</li>
            <li>You need to either order more often (extra cost) or customize your  order, which will also cost more than if you actually got the amount of product that was advertised in the first place as the replenishment supply.  </li>
            <li>I just really like this system!</li>
            <li>love the facial wash.</li>
            <li>Again, good product but be fully aware of what you are actually paying $150 for one box of product that barely lasts 2 months.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not even remotely interested.</li>
            <li>First you order a trial package based on Cindy&#x27;s and Valerie&#x27;s  word.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t see much change in my wrinkles, I have to say my rosacea is under control!</li>
            <li>but I always go back to Meaningful beauty, so</li>
            <li>Top and bottom... totally gone!  </li>
            <li>too many bottles and steps to keep a daily routine going.</li>
            <li>The company promised $39.95 a month, but that the first shipment would contain a 90-day supply.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;The first installment includes the shipping and handling charges along with any applicable taxes.</li>
            <li>Infomercial was VERY misleading!  </li>
            <li>That is the ONLY way you can be sure you will not have to deal with Guthy Renker&#x27;s horrendous customer service.</li>
            <li>When I called to cancel, they said that Meaningful Beauty should have told me this was a separate order to be cancelled, and that they will send me a return label for my shipment, but won&#x27;t refund me until they receive the vitamins back..</li>
            <li>Maybe its because i belong to many monthly memberships that it was obvious to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the products and feel younger.  </li>
            <li>(because sure enough if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, it won&#x27;t for me)</li>
            <li>something I should&#x27;ve done in the first place.</li>
            <li>sure enough</li>
            <li>Just be aware that if you ever order this product online you are signing yourself up for monthly charges and also they cannot ever cancel an order once it has been processed.</li>
            <li>I feel many people have different skin types thus</li>
            <li>i can tell exactly where i applied the product.</li>
            <li>After calling to correct this issue, ie..cancel the second shipment; we realized that the folks at Meaningful Beauty were just not going to help us out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Either way, if you try this product, and find that you break out, please realize it is most likely a temporary fixture.</li>
            <li>I love the way the facial cleanser cleans my face.</li>
            <li>After using Meaningful Beauty for a few days, my face broke out with huge, itchy bumps.</li>
            <li>My skin is young and soft using meaningful beauty.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference using the product for a few weeks and leading into months, I even started using a different product which I love, I still have full bottles of the meaningful beauty products somewhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin looked very dewy and moisturized, at first.</li>
            <li>I know many women my age or younger that look years older because lack of skin care.  </li>
            <li>The meaningful beauty system is the same as you can get with any high end drug store cosmetic.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the light fragrance, as does my little one when we snuggle...</li>
            <li>I ran out of them and my skin really took a beating.  </li>
            <li>I have literally never written a review before for anything in my whole life, but I just had to for this.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth a try - but stay clear of the \\&quot;glowing serum\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Thanks to the reviews</li>
            <li>THIS IS PROMISING THINGS TO WOMEN OF (OUR) AGE</li>
            <li>I am a fifty year old elementary principal.  </li>
            <li>but really you should avoid this one like the plague.  </li>
            <li>VIA SNAIL MAIL (A LEGAL DOCUMENT</li>
            <li>I think that states how misleading this product really is.  </li>
            <li>very seldom write any product reviews</li>
            <li>I got the shaft for the last &amp;#34;payment&amp;#34; and feel free as a bird to get off with that.  </li>
            <li>After 2 days I noticed under my eyes had rasied bumps and were really itchy then on day 3 I noticed a severe rash all over my chest.  </li>
            <li>Next comes a \\&quot;free gift\\&quot; (68.00 billed to your credit card).</li>
            <li>i said, i overall really enjoy this product and i purchased the 90 day set.</li>
            <li>Fast forward three months</li>
            <li>The ads and pics are also very deceiving.</li>
            <li>she started talking fast</li>
            <li>She said that she used it years ago but that nothing really stood out in her mind about it.  </li>
            <li>Very deceitful upfront, don&#x27;t you think?  </li>
            <li>I am on the verge of seeking legal recourse.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve already begun seeing very favorable results.</li>
            <li>This isnt as much a review, as it is a warning about the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Company is very sneaky and does not tell you.  </li>
            <li>This morning I was getting ready for work</li>
            <li>I was tired and the two of them looked great and energetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really should be called &amp;#34;Meaningless Rip Off&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>No one, I mean no one looks good without taking tje time and effort to do so.</li>
            <li>In the morning, I use the glowing serum, the other serum and the antiodixent facial moisturizer, along with the decollate&#x27; and I am good to go.</li>
            <li>That may be good for dry skin or dry parts of the country, but it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>It did give me a small pore-clog on rare occasions, not for sure because I could even attribute this to hormones.</li>
            <li>My skin actually feels smooth, which is a new concept for me.</li>
            <li>I am 54 and after using it for a short while (way before they decided to ship a full size order)</li>
            <li>The night cream is heavier than most and not easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>I cancelled my order  and there was no problem cancelling (make sure you write down the date you ordered</li>
            <li>Once I realized I was signing up for monthly charges of $40 and would receive a new shipment every 90 days, I decided this was not for me!  </li>
            <li>and I have more apparent fine lines, and my skin seems dull.</li>
            <li>I am a previous customer of Meaningful Beauty</li>
            <li>My skin looks older than it did before I started.  </li>
            <li>It has kept my skin soft, smooth, and younger feeling.  </li>
            <li>It absolutely BLOWS MY MIND to believe that these teeny tiny kits are worth $120.00 each.</li>
            <li>I had to stop using them briefly while overseas in a very hot climate.  </li>
            <li>Cost versus quality-too high with zero results.</li>
            <li>Agent was very pushy and wanted to send other products for free</li>
            <li>My skin is insanely sensitive to certain cleansers if they are drying.</li>
            <li>A little more affordable than some out there.</li>
            <li>The facewash is the same as Cetaphil, and the day time moisturizer is the same as Aveeno&#x27;s Positively Ageless with SPF (which is a great product for far less than $24 a bottle!).  </li>
            <li>I love the fact it doesn&#x27;t lather up, because that&#x27;s just harsh soap that would ry out your skin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, you will be ripped off with and if like me it will take a lot of time to get your face and skin healthy again.</li>
            <li>I Don&#x27;t  normally write reviews.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews.  </li>
            <li>Right eye started having red dryness underneath like a burn.</li>
            <li>I just started at a new school when I turned 50</li>
            <li>I was charged for the vitamins of $32.74 for a new shipment and didn&#x27;t realize it had been sent until I looked at my credit card bill..</li>
            <li>When they order new product, send it after taking their credit card information.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow I wasn&#x27;t supposed to receive a new 3 month supply shipment until February 2014.</li>
            <li>I did that with Wen hair products and I live Wen but just buy it as I need it.</li>
            <li>; unless of course you are a new customer.</li>
            <li>I started breaking out with huge red pimples under the skin along with white heads.  </li>
            <li>but I have noticed how young my skin looks now that I&#x27;m getting older.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li>I mean really I should have known better.</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY products in the past, including Skinceuticals, Philosophy, Clinique, on and on</li>
            <li>The 90 day supply that follows the initial 30 day supply is only 2 to 2.5 times the amount of the original supposed 30 day supply, instead of 3 times the amount.  </li>
            <li>I am apparently in the minority, but I really like this system.</li>
            <li>*. Do not go near this company!</li>
            <li>b/c on the Meaningful Beauty website there are all kinds of claims that you can cancel at any time if you&#x27;re not satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Ok, first of all, NO ONE reads the entire small print of the terms and agreement.  </li>
            <li>First time I used the am routine my face was red and looked like I had a sunburn on my face.  </li>
            <li>I am sure the next thing that will happen is they will charge me next month and said because it took 4 to 6 wweeks, i didn&#x27;t return the product within the 30 day money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It arrived and I did not accept it, their problem for sending a second order in the first place after I HAD already cancelled.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so mad right now!!!!!</li>
            <li>i normally have oily skin and this has really helped clear out my pores and make them smaller (WHICH NEVER HAPPENS)</li>
            <li>No major drastic changes when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>All facial cleansers dry out my face really bad, but the meaningful beauty cleanser it great.  </li>
            <li>I had even sent them a before/after photo with the results quite clearly showing.</li>
            <li>I argued with the sales rep for 10 min who was clearly reading off a script.</li>
            <li>Every bill I&#x27;ve received they&#x27;ve had to clear because its their mistake</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s over $24, and they said they can&#x27;t clear it up.</li>
            <li>My chest has not looked this clear in years.</li>
            <li>My skin became really swollen, red and sore.  </li>
            <li>It makes my ultra-sensitive, 38 year old skin feel hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>They wanted to know what products I use to keep my skin looking so young and without any wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>After much arguing and NO cooperation from the customer service rep, I talked to a supervisor who finally promised he would refund - let&#x27;s see.</li>
            <li>Also wash your face with a natural soap (coconut, goat milk, etc.)</li>
            <li>have taken 3 payments from my Master card account so far</li>
            <li>I dont use the scrub night and day because I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Buried deep in some verbage on the product is what they really charge you not what you see up front.  </li>
            <li>I am 55 years old</li>
            <li>If you really want to try this product, order it online from Amazon or another 3rd party vendor.</li>
            <li>no where near deceitful like people are saying.</li>
            <li>old skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder wrinkle smoothing capsules, lifting eye creme, and glowing serum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 22 year old who thought I would take preventative measures against aging skin with this product line.</li>
            <li>, I will definitely not waste any money on it.</li>
            <li>I noticed many negative reviews here</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any adverse reactions and I have tried everything excpet the &amp;#34;Peel&amp;#34; so far.</li>
            <li>We ended up having to cancel completely out of the program, and after returning a shipment they made by mistake we are are yet waiting on them to credit our account.</li>
            <li>I have had no trouble with this at all.</li>
            <li>thinking i had developed an allergy but nothing helped.</li>
            <li>and then it basically became a red and very obvious rash on my laugh line.</li>
            <li>I purchased it directly from Meaningful Beauty / Guthy-Renker and tried it for a few months and finally decided it wasn&#x27;t working</li>
            <li>You have to spend your own money to send the stuff back - and getting credit is slow and agonizing.  </li>
            <li>I CALLED THE TEXAS ATTY GENERAL!!!</li>
            <li>I was not aware as I did not read the fine print and ended up with an $80 charge a month later.  </li>
            <li>The Deep Cleansing Masque leaves pores looking smaller right after I use it-</li>
            <li>I was thinking I was getting a great deal -WRONG!</li>
            <li>I found that a little went a long way for me because of that so the product lasted longer than 30 days :)</li>
            <li>So basically you are lured in by a decent product, expecting to continue with the same supply amounts as advertised, but do not receive that advertised amount.</li>
            <li>You will have to put in your phone number, your zip code, and I advise pressing 2 because if you try to put in your account number, it won&#x27;t be accepted and there is no way to get back to the main menu.  </li>
            <li>If I do it twice a day I actually seem to have decent nails.</li>
            <li>While I was pleased with the products overall, the poor service and practices of this company over shadow any positive product they may offer.  </li>
            <li>20&lt;br /&gt;is a little greasy for me, but not bad</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t believe me about how bad their returns process is...call their toll-free sales number (given on the infomercial) and count how fast they answer and pleasantly try to pitch you to buy (then hang up).  </li>
            <li>my skin was back to normal.  </li>
            <li>We had used these products for about a year, and called to add a few items to our existing automatic shipments; however the company treated this as a full new order and began double shipments...</li>
            <li>Shame, on Cindy Crawford for endorsing this product and scamming so many people out of their hard earned money, only to benefit herself.  </li>
            <li>Yes, that was me, up in the middle of the night, a new baby and making an order for a television product.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s strange is this is the first and only product to have ever done this to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THEY MUST KNOW WHEN PEOPLE GENERALLY HAVE HAD ENOUGH AND WHEN THEY NORMALLY CANCEL.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a miracle cure of course, but me skin is clear, soft, glowing and younger looking.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, but this was worth my time if it brings attention to others about the way these people handle your money.</li>
            <li>I was up very early preparing to travel the day I saw the commercial w/ Valerie Bertinelli and Pablo de Cote.</li>
            <li>Sounds like a major flop.</li>
            <li>I will say that I did break out a little after I first started using it, but it cleared up in a couple of days, and now my skin is nearly void of blemishes.</li>
            <li>The product that is sent out lasts for barely a month if that.  </li>
            <li>I procrastinated on one kit and they wouldn&#x27;t let me send it back saying it was too old--</li>
            <li>but when I turned 26 things changed and I developed red irritated skin on my cheeks and my skin with acne.</li>
            <li>More upsetting was that when I applied my eye make up I had spots when my eye lashes were broken.</li>
            <li>I know how that can be as I have allergy to some type of natural skin care such as honey, oat and egg white.</li>
            <li>I have always had a problem with really dry skin, especially rough patches on my face, and no matter how many times I put lotion on my face, the rough patches never went away.</li>
            <li>Four days after I began using the products I developed such deep cystic acne that I&#x27;ve been seeing my dermatologist once a week, and it&#x27;s still there!</li>
            <li>and now i am on the telephone with HSBC Master card to cancel any further payments which is proving a nightmare also as there customer service is worse than Meaningful Beautys</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and even the most expensive products that were hypoallergenic</li>
            <li>I have every intention of continuing to use these products and no other for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li>I have not had any major outbreaks in the entire year that I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li>You will only know when the shipment shows up at your door because this will happen before you receive your statement - you receive no other notification.  </li>
            <li>, I know I don&#x27;t need to use eye cream and all that stuff, but the way I see it, is that you are never too young to start preserving your skin, and taking care of your skin for the long run.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s not excuse for them to lie.</li>
            <li>It is very light and not like a lot of the heavily perfumed products I have used in the past.    </li>
            <li>The melon serum stinks but is perhaps the most decent of all.</li>
            <li>After 30 mins and much wrangling i have had to cancel my Master card account and close it down to cancel these damned payments that are going out of my account, ridiculous.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 51 years old, brunette ... and have tried many different brands throughout the years, NONE with the horrific results that Meaningful Beauty caused.  </li>
            <li>I have used other high end products</li>
            <li>Nobody in their right mind would/should spend $120.00 for 5 small bottles of facial products.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product because I figured I had nothing to loose and within a month my skin started to clear up</li>
            <li>It has little exfoliating beads in it and it scrubbed my face gently during application.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that is a good thing or bad.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Everyone who sees me comments on my flawless complexion.</li>
            <li> Both of these make my skin look great!</li>
            <li> Diet is the best way to improve your skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful.</li>
            <li> If you already have oily skin, it may not be best for you.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful..... for me.  </li>
            <li> It may be the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my face</li>
            <li> The day cream with SPF and the Creme de Serum are both awesome</li>
            <li> I have been using the day and night regiments for about 3 weeks now and my face is flawless.</li>
            <li> and i absolutely loved it!!!  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say its the best or works wonders</li>
            <li> my skin is the best it&#x27;s been.</li>
            <li> so my advice would be to give it a chance because if you have results like I did, you will be very happy.</li>
            <li> i told them the problem, they then tried to sell me more product to combat this !!!</li>
            <li> AND WE WANT TO LOOK BEAUTIFUL</li>
            <li> Buy a juicer, incorporate veggies in your diet by hiding the taste with fruit and you will be beautiful inside and out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had beautiful skin</li>
            <li> lol.     </li>
            <li> I order it and is working for me greatly...</li>
            <li> Great marketing though, I will give them that.</li>
            <li> This product line has been great for me.  </li>
            <li> Also, a test of whether a product makes a difference or if it is working well-- is if someone says to you &amp;#34;your face looks great</li>
            <li> We had great difficulty canceling this order &amp; it ended up costing us shipment both ways.  </li>
            <li> they suck you in with this great offer then after you give all your infomation</li>
            <li> Maybe not, maybe these products are greatly helping Cindy look the way she does, but</li>
            <li> So for me all experience with the product &amp; its representatives have been great.</li>
            <li> and the reason I changed my mind, once i got online and read reviews, no one was really happy with the product in terms of getting rid of wrinkles and smoothing out the skin.</li>
            <li> I have used the masque with great results.</li>
            <li> Lol.</li>
            <li> Both of the products I purchased, The Meaningful Beatuy Trial Kit &amp; Wen Trail Kit I have found to be wonderful.  </li>
            <li> my skin is absolutely flawless, my pores are not even visible, and I get so many comments on how my skin just glows.</li>
            <li> The serum is awesome also, it isn&#x27;t oily like most moisturizers can be...</li>
            <li> but Meaningful Beauty IS THE BEST...</li>
            <li> Really good product.</li>
            <li> ,IF IF IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE,IT PROBALLY ISN&#x60;T</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my Mom who has been looking for a good skin care regime.  </li>
            <li> so I am good.</li>
            <li> Also, some people just have good skin genes, and anything will work for them.</li>
            <li> and I thought because of the star endorsements this product must be good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually so good about researching products and reviews online before I buy anything.  </li>
            <li> Might be good for someone who isn&#x27;t prone to breakouts</li>
            <li> but I fortunely have had nothing but good experiences with it.</li>
            <li> But the good news was they cancelled my sub.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the best products are the night creme and the rich moisture masque.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased.  </li>
            <li> To make the price even more, they will send a bottle of vitamins (that will not be requested) and proceed to charge your card $98.82!  </li>
            <li> and I see Cindy Crawford and she talks about what a miracle product Meaningful Beauty is--really?!</li>
            <li> Also, the products didn&#x27;t show any better results than the over-the-counter products I was already using and they are alot cheaper!</li>
            <li> I love these products!  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;you smell nice, mommy...\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Time</li>
            <li> I kind of like the fact that I dont have to worry about running out</li>
            <li> Lets see what Cindy looks like now, and proof, she uses her own product.</li>
            <li> Cindy Crawford should be ashamed of herself for associating herself with these kind of actions.......</li>
            <li> The absolute best advice I can give is to NEVER order anything from the toll-free number on the infomercial.</li>
            <li> Cindy Crawford may be a nice business woman.</li>
            <li> It did make my skin feel nice, no breakouts (and I do have acne-prone skin.)</li>
            <li> got a nice person who said she had cancelled my order.</li>
            <li> because I liked the product.</li>
            <li> I called the customer care line once to ask about customizing my kit and the lady was pleasantly kind plus helpful.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly liked the product &amp; even though I do feel it is alittle over priced</li>
            <li> Good cosmetics work, but this is over priced, and the customer service at Meaningful Beauty is virtually non-existent</li>
            <li> The neck cream is not as effective as what I was using.</li>
            <li> But to be fair, I should have read more or researched more before I made an online order.</li>
            <li> The masque felt great and washed right off with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The best thing so far, is the anti-wrinkle liquid in capsules.</li>
            <li> Products are fair, nothing special.</li>
            <li> My experience was good and my refund came through right away!  </li>
            <li> But for those of you who really do want beautiful radiant skin, stop buying these &amp;#34;quick fix&amp;#34; scam creams.</li>
            <li> My experience was just fine!</li>
            <li> so wanted to share my positive experience, although the product &amp;#34;promises&amp;#34; great results</li>
            <li> and I simply love them.  </li>
            <li> love the mask and night fluide</li>
            <li> I bought this product but not from Amizon and its OK.</li>
            <li> The Glowing Serum feel FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it has helped with anti-aging issues, but friends mentioned that I seem more confident during the times I am using the system.</li>
            <li> Now before I go more into it, I was 24 when I started using it and</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really think it was that great, until I continued to use</li>
            <li> At night, I wash all my makeup off, repeat the process but use the Meaningful beauty night cream, and I go to bed.</li>
            <li> The face wash does nothing, might as well be using water and the rest of the products aren&#x27;t any better.</li>
            <li> I was told I had to call customer service where they wanted to talk to me about the benefits of the product, the flexibility of shipments and more BS.  </li>
            <li> I love the product ...</li>
            <li> u just have to give it more time so that your face gets used to it</li>
            <li> I purchased 1st shipment and products were ok.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use everything they have just the creme de serum mostly and the antioxidant day cream.</li>
            <li> Plenty of water,  healthy eating, and healthy living.  </li>
            <li> Also many women have hormone issues,</li>
            <li> I purchased Meaningful Beauty through Guthy Renker, not Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I received this explanation when I questioned the charges from Meaningful Beauty.</li>
            <li> Thinking it would get better</li>
            <li> I will stick to otc and save many many $$</li>
            <li> I received my latest package of 7 products for 150 bucks and the packaging and pamphlet stated you could customize order</li>
            <li> Okay people, here is the deal.</li>
            <li> However, her product Meaningful Beauty?</li>
            <li> Until they change those practices, I wouldn&#x27;t touch Meaningful Beauty with a 10 ft pole.  </li>
            <li> I ordered Meaningful Beauty about five months ago.</li>
            <li> Try itâ€¦but really use it day and night, if you want to witness great results.</li>
            <li> The cleanser was just  &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;, I can find a better one, and the day creme SPF</li>
            <li> A lot of cheaper products work better.</li>
            <li> yet I&#x27;m still getting bills on top of bills.</li>
            <li> Its been almost a month since everything has been cancelled and cleared and even though my husband nor myself has an account with meaningful beauty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M GLAD THAT MY MORTGAGE COMPANY DID NOT DECIDE TO &amp;#34;ACCELERATE&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> THE POST OFFICE SAID THEY SEND BACK SO MANY OF THESE ITEMS THAT THEY THINK THE GOV&#x27;T NEEDS TO INTERVENE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> There are many options out there that are paraben-free and</li>
            <li> I called to order a Meaningful Beauty kit</li>
            <li> So, I call the customer service line to make sure that my online order was just a one-time order for one kit.  </li>
            <li> and I may LOVE it, but</li>
            <li> for those of you who think you have whiteheads caused by Meaningful Beauty products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;DO NOT - I REPEAT - DO NOT sign up for any Meaningful Beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What ever you do make sure you realize that you will be set up AND charged for shipping and auto delivery</li>
            <li> I just ordered the toner and am waiting to try it, however I&#x27;m sure I will like it as well.</li>
            <li> I started using the meaningful beauty products a week ago</li>
            <li> Meaningful Beauty does not seem to do this.</li>
            <li> I am pleased to find this on the store shelves.</li>
            <li> I would and have told many people to try this out.</li>
            <li> DO NOT order this product unless you are 100% sure you want it and are going to keep it.</li>
            <li> I have been using meaningful beauty for about 1 week.  </li>
            <li> I love all their products except their face wash.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Meaningful Beauty for two months now, and here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
            <li> The day cream has better consistency, but doesn&#x27;t seem to work better than what I used before.</li>
            <li> I use it before I go to bed on weekends to give it more time to \\&quot;work\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t have many)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d advise those of you who want to know if you&#x27;ll get a return on your investment to wait until more people report results.</li>
            <li> received so many compliments on my complexion during the time I was using it.  </li>
            <li> Might as well spend money on drug store products and get better result.</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> The infomercial is so convincing.</li>
            <li> Cindy Crawford sounds more like she took a bite out of a lying sack of s</li>
            <li> and my face looked more hyrdated.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get rid of wrinkles with creams or serums, maybe skin tone will look better, but cosmetic surgery removes wrinkles, not creams.  </li>
            <li> Creme Serum was OK but the rest of the line was like spreading crisco on my face (which I could have done for pennies on the dollar)</li>
            <li> I have used all of them and just ordered more.</li>
            <li> love the neck and chest cream too.</li>
            <li> I will continue using Meaningful Beauty for years to come.</li>
            <li> and there are many days I don&#x27;t put makeup on.</li>
            <li> Person was pleasant said she could not tell exactly when it would ship, but she gave me a &amp;#34;within 10 days&amp;#34; timeframe.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered my first kitâ€¦I saw NOTHING about this being on automatic shipment!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li> just wanted to say the main products work great for me.  </li>
            <li> It feels very clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> The magic melon juice or whatever it is, might be helping Cindy Crawford, but I suspect her beauty comes more from good genes, a healthy lifestyle, and maybe a nip tuck doctor or some clever photoshopping.  </li>
            <li> I have to deduce that the stuff was working, because I noticed a significant difference when I stopped!</li>
            <li> You know those products that you read about which make some amazing claims regarding what they&#x27;ll do for you, and with great skepticism you buy the product, and then are pleasantly surprised to find the claims are true?  </li>
            <li> Better read the fine print.</li>
            <li> AND IN DECEMBER, AT THE TIME WHEN YOUR MONEY IS MOST IMPORTANT</li>
            <li> I so irritated I wanted to return the special offer unopened!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find such a great deal on the television, that I quickly purchased it because I had been waiting to find a good deal like this.  </li>
            <li> I have tried lots of facial moisturizers and I am happy with meaningful beauty.  </li>
            <li> STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST WORKING WITH THIS COMPANY IN MY EXPERIENCE.</li>
            <li> I ordered the full sized products of meaningful beauty in november 2013.</li>
            <li> I use the exfoliating scrub and it works fine with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> eyebrows are fine) to break off and/or fall out.  </li>
            <li> Fine.</li>
            <li> Take away the fine print.</li>
            <li> When you order the 5 piece trial, before you receive it &amp; see all the fine print, your credit card will be billed for the 1st of 3 installments of over $43 each for a continuous supply.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a month and saw no reduction or softening of my fine lines.</li>
            <li> When used consistently, my fine lines are diminished and my skin tone is more even, allowing me to look great with minimal make up coverage.  </li>
            <li> Huge hassle.</li>
            <li> I saw this package deal on tv for really cheap, so I decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> While I really liked this product and have been using it for over 6 months, the pricing set up is really deceiving.  </li>
            <li> I ordered Meaningful Beauty and was not unhappy with the cleanser.  </li>
            <li> and there would be free shipping.</li>
            <li> BUT, since you also receive a free &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34; of vitamins, those vitamins come in a separate shipping.</li>
            <li> This is NOT the way to do business if you want happy customers and low returns.</li>
            <li> i really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, but best results from &amp;#34;over the counter&amp;#34; products that I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li> Each kit is advertised at $39.99 for a 30 day supply and also includes some free trial products.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is gentle, yet removes oil, makeup and dirt effectively.  </li>
            <li> My skin is really smooth</li>
            <li> but it did make my skin feel really smooth and supple.</li>
            <li> Go to the local drug store and spend a fraction of the cost on Aveeno and be happy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, not recommending these products, save your money and try a good loofa followed by some vaseline if you want soft skin.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with these products that I can&#x27;t say enough about how good they are and how well I like them.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the hype is about this product, nothing special and there was no noticeable difference on my face of fine wrinkles or lines.</li>
            <li> AS RICH AS</li>
            <li> I started using this product, and at first, like many of you</li>
            <li> i am interested to try more of the products that were not in my set.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about ordering my starter kit that I also ordered one for my grandmother to try.</li>
            <li> So glad I read the reviews first</li>
            <li> Parabens are known cancer-causing agents and will not be absorbed into this skin!  </li>
            <li> Hey, Cindy Crawford endorses it, other celebrities were raving about how wonderful it is, and it was pretty affordable, so</li>
            <li> I have now paid $200 for something I originally wanted a $40 supply of.  </li>
            <li> Worth the shot!</li>
            <li> It is not bad at all, made my skin smooth</li>
            <li> The Pore Refining Toner and the Skin Softening Cleanser leave my skin clean, but not irritated.</li>
            <li> I had the UPS tracking number, confirmed delivery receipt via UPS online, but that wasn&#x27;t good enough...</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin but have never gotten a rash or anything but amazing results.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for anyone who has skin that is normal to dry.  </li>
            <li> I specifically ordered a one time special for 39.99.  </li>
            <li> I certainly need the help more than she does, and that&#x27;s not happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I signed up for the Meaningful Beauty starter kit, excited to try a new product and hopefully have some help with fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying more of the products very soon.  </li>
            <li> TRUE.</li>
            <li> As I understand it, if you DO manage to get  a credit (and we haven&#x27;t yet), it&#x27;s not for the full amount, because they deduct &amp;#34;shipping and handling.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Meaningful Beauty</li>
            <li> My regular moisturizer is just as good...</li>
            <li> two days later I get a cheery note in my email saying my shipment is on its way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Meaningful Beauty products for a while now, and while they haven&#x27;t harmed my skin, I&#x27;m not seeing much benefit either.  </li>
            <li> I tried MB, and so far have really liked the results.</li>
            <li> I use the cleanser in conjunction with my clarisonic to get a good deep cleanse.</li>
            <li> A trip to the dermatologist landed me with a histamine shot and a $200 prescription for medicated cream to cure a full blown allergic reaction to the melon extract.</li>
            <li> Its not &#x27;&#x27;bad&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> None of it was great, and it is extremely over priced.</li>
            <li> because so many people have reported having problems, I am guessing they have allergy to the main ingredient in this product being the mellon extract.       </li>
            <li> This is a scam worthy of the Nigerian underground.  </li>
            <li> before this product I used Jafra wich was working wonderfully great for about 4 years but all of the sudden it was not my skin is very sesitive and meaningfull beauty</li>
            <li> The mask drys quickly.</li>
            <li> All you need to look beautiful is a little nutrition.</li>
            <li> and I totally credit my using the Meaningful Beauty products for that!  </li>
            <li> - really!?!?)</li>
            <li> I read many, many reviews and only one was positive.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of it because it has too many different things to put on day and night</li>
            <li> Overall you are better getting a different system it seems good for the price</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth every dime.</li>
            <li> felt with my own personal results</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have tried many products out there from over-the-counter to department store brands and none compare to these products.  </li>
            <li> and I rarely ever have a pimple.</li>
            <li> Not a company that you should buy direct from, however if you get product separate from a contract on Amazon you may have better luck.</li>
            <li> Then comes in another 30 days the full sized product that they charge your card EVERY MONTH from the time you get the samples until they send you a NEW DELIVERY in 30 days (\\&quot;free gift\\&quot; charged to your credit card).</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give it a try, right?</li>
            <li> I would still not feel clean and want to wash my face with a real cleanser.      </li>
            <li> I have fairly good skin for a 50 year old (not too much older than Cindy Crawford)...but the issue of believing nonsence that after so many weeks the skin becomes different in a positive way.</li>
            <li> If you want smooth silky skin I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Use Retin A and a good exfoliator on dark spots, takes some time</li>
            <li> The product or customer no service, didn&#x27;t know the original trial was an excuse to send more at higher price.</li>
            <li> As for our purchases we will return to our local cosmetic store, which as I noted provide products that are really just as effective.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very soft and smooth and never breaks me out.</li>
            <li> My skin bounced back so quickly and the fine lines I was so upset about were soothed away.  </li>
            <li> Please be sure to try this on another part of your body prior to putting it on your face.  </li>
            <li> It is very oily, and a week after I started using it, I started to get rashes all over my face and neck!</li>
            <li> You need to either order more often (extra cost) or customize your  order, which will also cost more than if you actually got the amount of product that was advertised in the first place as the replenishment supply.  </li>
            <li> I just really like this system!</li>
            <li> love the facial wash.</li>
            <li> Again, good product but be fully aware of what you are actually paying $150 for one box of product that barely lasts 2 months.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not even remotely interested.</li>
            <li> First you order a trial package based on Cindy&#x27;s and Valerie&#x27;s  word.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t see much change in my wrinkles, I have to say my rosacea is under control!</li>
            <li> but I always go back to Meaningful beauty, so</li>
            <li> Top and bottom... totally gone!  </li>
            <li> too many bottles and steps to keep a daily routine going.</li>
            <li> The company promised $39.95 a month, but that the first shipment would contain a 90-day supply.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The first installment includes the shipping and handling charges along with any applicable taxes.</li>
            <li> Infomercial was VERY misleading!  </li>
            <li> That is the ONLY way you can be sure you will not have to deal with Guthy Renker&#x27;s horrendous customer service.</li>
            <li> When I called to cancel, they said that Meaningful Beauty should have told me this was a separate order to be cancelled, and that they will send me a return label for my shipment, but won&#x27;t refund me until they receive the vitamins back..</li>
            <li> Maybe its because i belong to many monthly memberships that it was obvious to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the products and feel younger.  </li>
            <li> (because sure enough if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, it won&#x27;t for me)</li>
            <li> something I should&#x27;ve done in the first place.</li>
            <li> sure enough</li>
            <li> Just be aware that if you ever order this product online you are signing yourself up for monthly charges and also they cannot ever cancel an order once it has been processed.</li>
            <li> I feel many people have different skin types thus</li>
            <li> i can tell exactly where i applied the product.</li>
            <li> After calling to correct this issue, ie..cancel the second shipment; we realized that the folks at Meaningful Beauty were just not going to help us out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Either way, if you try this product, and find that you break out, please realize it is most likely a temporary fixture.</li>
            <li> I love the way the facial cleanser cleans my face.</li>
            <li> After using Meaningful Beauty for a few days, my face broke out with huge, itchy bumps.</li>
            <li> My skin is young and soft using meaningful beauty.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference using the product for a few weeks and leading into months, I even started using a different product which I love, I still have full bottles of the meaningful beauty products somewhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin looked very dewy and moisturized, at first.</li>
            <li> I know many women my age or younger that look years older because lack of skin care.  </li>
            <li> The meaningful beauty system is the same as you can get with any high end drug store cosmetic.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the light fragrance, as does my little one when we snuggle...</li>
            <li> I ran out of them and my skin really took a beating.  </li>
            <li> I have literally never written a review before for anything in my whole life, but I just had to for this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth a try - but stay clear of the \\&quot;glowing serum\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Thanks to the reviews</li>
            <li> THIS IS PROMISING THINGS TO WOMEN OF (OUR) AGE</li>
            <li> I am a fifty year old elementary principal.  </li>
            <li> but really you should avoid this one like the plague.  </li>
            <li> VIA SNAIL MAIL (A LEGAL DOCUMENT</li>
            <li> I think that states how misleading this product really is.  </li>
            <li> very seldom write any product reviews</li>
            <li> I got the shaft for the last &amp;#34;payment&amp;#34; and feel free as a bird to get off with that.  </li>
            <li> After 2 days I noticed under my eyes had rasied bumps and were really itchy then on day 3 I noticed a severe rash all over my chest.  </li>
            <li> Next comes a \\&quot;free gift\\&quot; (68.00 billed to your credit card).</li>
            <li> i said, i overall really enjoy this product and i purchased the 90 day set.</li>
            <li> Fast forward three months</li>
            <li> The ads and pics are also very deceiving.</li>
            <li> she started talking fast</li>
            <li> She said that she used it years ago but that nothing really stood out in her mind about it.  </li>
            <li> Very deceitful upfront, don&#x27;t you think?  </li>
            <li> I am on the verge of seeking legal recourse.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;ve already begun seeing very favorable results.</li>
            <li> This isnt as much a review, as it is a warning about the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Company is very sneaky and does not tell you.  </li>
            <li> This morning I was getting ready for work</li>
            <li> I was tired and the two of them looked great and energetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really should be called &amp;#34;Meaningless Rip Off&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> No one, I mean no one looks good without taking tje time and effort to do so.</li>
            <li> In the morning, I use the glowing serum, the other serum and the antiodixent facial moisturizer, along with the decollate&#x27; and I am good to go.</li>
            <li> That may be good for dry skin or dry parts of the country, but it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> It did give me a small pore-clog on rare occasions, not for sure because I could even attribute this to hormones.</li>
            <li> My skin actually feels smooth, which is a new concept for me.</li>
            <li> I am 54 and after using it for a short while (way before they decided to ship a full size order)</li>
            <li> The night cream is heavier than most and not easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> I cancelled my order  and there was no problem cancelling (make sure you write down the date you ordered</li>
            <li> Once I realized I was signing up for monthly charges of $40 and would receive a new shipment every 90 days, I decided this was not for me!  </li>
            <li> and I have more apparent fine lines, and my skin seems dull.</li>
            <li> I am a previous customer of Meaningful Beauty</li>
            <li> My skin looks older than it did before I started.  </li>
            <li> It has kept my skin soft, smooth, and younger feeling.  </li>
            <li> It absolutely BLOWS MY MIND to believe that these teeny tiny kits are worth $120.00 each.</li>
            <li> I had to stop using them briefly while overseas in a very hot climate.  </li>
            <li> Cost versus quality-too high with zero results.</li>
            <li> Agent was very pushy and wanted to send other products for free</li>
            <li> My skin is insanely sensitive to certain cleansers if they are drying.</li>
            <li> A little more affordable than some out there.</li>
            <li> The facewash is the same as Cetaphil, and the day time moisturizer is the same as Aveeno&#x27;s Positively Ageless with SPF (which is a great product for far less than $24 a bottle!).  </li>
            <li> I love the fact it doesn&#x27;t lather up, because that&#x27;s just harsh soap that would ry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, you will be ripped off with and if like me it will take a lot of time to get your face and skin healthy again.</li>
            <li> I Don&#x27;t  normally write reviews.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews.  </li>
            <li> Right eye started having red dryness underneath like a burn.</li>
            <li> I just started at a new school when I turned 50</li>
            <li> I was charged for the vitamins of $32.74 for a new shipment and didn&#x27;t realize it had been sent until I looked at my credit card bill..</li>
            <li> When they order new product, send it after taking their credit card information.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow I wasn&#x27;t supposed to receive a new 3 month supply shipment until February 2014.</li>
            <li> I did that with Wen hair products and I live Wen but just buy it as I need it.</li>
            <li> ; unless of course you are a new customer.</li>
            <li> I started breaking out with huge red pimples under the skin along with white heads.  </li>
            <li> but I have noticed how young my skin looks now that I&#x27;m getting older.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> I mean really I should have known better.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY products in the past, including Skinceuticals, Philosophy, Clinique, on and on</li>
            <li> The 90 day supply that follows the initial 30 day supply is only 2 to 2.5 times the amount of the original supposed 30 day supply, instead of 3 times the amount.  </li>
            <li> I am apparently in the minority, but I really like this system.</li>
            <li> *. Do not go near this company!</li>
            <li> b/c on the Meaningful Beauty website there are all kinds of claims that you can cancel at any time if you&#x27;re not satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Ok, first of all, NO ONE reads the entire small print of the terms and agreement.  </li>
            <li> First time I used the am routine my face was red and looked like I had a sunburn on my face.  </li>
            <li> I am sure the next thing that will happen is they will charge me next month and said because it took 4 to 6 wweeks, i didn&#x27;t return the product within the 30 day money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It arrived and I did not accept it, their problem for sending a second order in the first place after I HAD already cancelled.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so mad right now!!!!!</li>
            <li> i normally have oily skin and this has really helped clear out my pores and make them smaller (WHICH NEVER HAPPENS)</li>
            <li> No major drastic changes when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> All facial cleansers dry out my face really bad, but the meaningful beauty cleanser it great.  </li>
            <li> I had even sent them a before/after photo with the results quite clearly showing.</li>
            <li> I argued with the sales rep for 10 min who was clearly reading off a script.</li>
            <li> Every bill I&#x27;ve received they&#x27;ve had to clear because its their mistake</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s over $24, and they said they can&#x27;t clear it up.</li>
            <li> My chest has not looked this clear in years.</li>
            <li> My skin became really swollen, red and sore.  </li>
            <li> It makes my ultra-sensitive, 38 year old skin feel hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> They wanted to know what products I use to keep my skin looking so young and without any wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> After much arguing and NO cooperation from the customer service rep, I talked to a supervisor who finally promised he would refund - let&#x27;s see.</li>
            <li> Also wash your face with a natural soap (coconut, goat milk, etc.)</li>
            <li> have taken 3 payments from my Master card account so far</li>
            <li> I dont use the scrub night and day because I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Buried deep in some verbage on the product is what they really charge you not what you see up front.  </li>
            <li> I am 55 years old</li>
            <li> If you really want to try this product, order it online from Amazon or another 3rd party vendor.</li>
            <li> no where near deceitful like people are saying.</li>
            <li> old skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder wrinkle smoothing capsules, lifting eye creme, and glowing serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 22 year old who thought I would take preventative measures against aging skin with this product line.</li>
            <li> , I will definitely not waste any money on it.</li>
            <li> I noticed many negative reviews here</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any adverse reactions and I have tried everything excpet the &amp;#34;Peel&amp;#34; so far.</li>
            <li> We ended up having to cancel completely out of the program, and after returning a shipment they made by mistake we are are yet waiting on them to credit our account.</li>
            <li> I have had no trouble with this at all.</li>
            <li> thinking i had developed an allergy but nothing helped.</li>
            <li> and then it basically became a red and very obvious rash on my laugh line.</li>
            <li> I purchased it directly from Meaningful Beauty / Guthy-Renker and tried it for a few months and finally decided it wasn&#x27;t working</li>
            <li> You have to spend your own money to send the stuff back - and getting credit is slow and agonizing.  </li>
            <li> I CALLED THE TEXAS ATTY GENERAL!!!</li>
            <li> I was not aware as I did not read the fine print and ended up with an $80 charge a month later.  </li>
            <li> The Deep Cleansing Masque leaves pores looking smaller right after I use it-</li>
            <li> I was thinking I was getting a great deal -WRONG!</li>
            <li> I found that a little went a long way for me because of that so the product lasted longer than 30 days :)</li>
            <li> So basically you are lured in by a decent product, expecting to continue with the same supply amounts as advertised, but do not receive that advertised amount.</li>
            <li> You will have to put in your phone number, your zip code, and I advise pressing 2 because if you try to put in your account number, it won&#x27;t be accepted and there is no way to get back to the main menu.  </li>
            <li> If I do it twice a day I actually seem to have decent nails.</li>
            <li> While I was pleased with the products overall, the poor service and practices of this company over shadow any positive product they may offer.  </li>
            <li> 20&lt;br /&gt;is a little greasy for me, but not bad</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t believe me about how bad their returns process is...call their toll-free sales number (given on the infomercial) and count how fast they answer and pleasantly try to pitch you to buy (then hang up).  </li>
            <li> my skin was back to normal.  </li>
            <li> We had used these products for about a year, and called to add a few items to our existing automatic shipments; however the company treated this as a full new order and began double shipments...</li>
            <li> Shame, on Cindy Crawford for endorsing this product and scamming so many people out of their hard earned money, only to benefit herself.  </li>
            <li> Yes, that was me, up in the middle of the night, a new baby and making an order for a television product.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s strange is this is the first and only product to have ever done this to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THEY MUST KNOW WHEN PEOPLE GENERALLY HAVE HAD ENOUGH AND WHEN THEY NORMALLY CANCEL.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a miracle cure of course, but me skin is clear, soft, glowing and younger looking.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, but this was worth my time if it brings attention to others about the way these people handle your money.</li>
            <li> I was up very early preparing to travel the day I saw the commercial w/ Valerie Bertinelli and Pablo de Cote.</li>
            <li> Sounds like a major flop.</li>
            <li> I will say that I did break out a little after I first started using it, but it cleared up in a couple of days, and now my skin is nearly void of blemishes.</li>
            <li> The product that is sent out lasts for barely a month if that.  </li>
            <li> I procrastinated on one kit and they wouldn&#x27;t let me send it back saying it was too old--</li>
            <li> but when I turned 26 things changed and I developed red irritated skin on my cheeks and my skin with acne.</li>
            <li> More upsetting was that when I applied my eye make up I had spots when my eye lashes were broken.</li>
            <li> I know how that can be as I have allergy to some type of natural skin care such as honey, oat and egg white.</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with really dry skin, especially rough patches on my face, and no matter how many times I put lotion on my face, the rough patches never went away.</li>
            <li> Four days after I began using the products I developed such deep cystic acne that I&#x27;ve been seeing my dermatologist once a week, and it&#x27;s still there!</li>
            <li> and now i am on the telephone with HSBC Master card to cancel any further payments which is proving a nightmare also as there customer service is worse than Meaningful Beautys</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and even the most expensive products that were hypoallergenic</li>
            <li> I have every intention of continuing to use these products and no other for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> I have not had any major outbreaks in the entire year that I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li> You will only know when the shipment shows up at your door because this will happen before you receive your statement - you receive no other notification.  </li>
            <li> , I know I don&#x27;t need to use eye cream and all that stuff, but the way I see it, is that you are never too young to start preserving your skin, and taking care of your skin for the long run.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s not excuse for them to lie.</li>
            <li> It is very light and not like a lot of the heavily perfumed products I have used in the past.    </li>
            <li> The melon serum stinks but is perhaps the most decent of all.</li>
            <li> After 30 mins and much wrangling i have had to cancel my Master card account and close it down to cancel these damned payments that are going out of my account, ridiculous.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 years old, brunette ... and have tried many different brands throughout the years, NONE with the horrific results that Meaningful Beauty caused.  </li>
            <li> I have used other high end products</li>
            <li> Nobody in their right mind would/should spend $120.00 for 5 small bottles of facial products.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product because I figured I had nothing to loose and within a month my skin started to clear up</li>
            <li> It has little exfoliating beads in it and it scrubbed my face gently during application.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that is a good thing or bad.</li>
            <li> I do not have extremely sensitive skin or anything, but I will break out if something is harsh or pore clogging, BUT THIS first started off as a little redness/dryness, which I thought was just my skin acting up</li>
            <li> I live in a very harsh climate and clearly this skin care range isn&#x27;t meant for these weather conditions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not to mention the customer service lady was rude and a smart ass!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so runny, and it leaves you feeling a little oily afterwards, and I am not an oily/greasy person normally.  </li>
            <li> Other regimes, left my skin feeling sticky and gooey, or dry, but this leaves it soft and moist.</li>
            <li> She got her first in late December.  </li>
            <li> Of course, if I have been using another system, there is a \\&quot;transition\\&quot; period where I might have a couple breakouts, but they don&#x27;t last long.     </li>
            <li> Returns are a months long, several lengthy phone-call process where you will be put through the ringer and then still may not get your refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been watching the Meaningful Beauty infomercials for months now, and in a weak moment I called a few days ago to place my order.  </li>
            <li> Cindy Crawford for selling such a s****y product (excuse my language, but that is how upset I am!).</li>
            <li> The after using Both eyes started swelling, and were red and dry like they were burned.</li>
            <li> In fact, I switched back to my old stuff for a few days because I was developing lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I used it for several months--purchased every single product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various other masks and creams but my daily routine is the cleanser, SPF day cream &amp; Creme de Serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry many other people are having problems with it</li>
            <li> I got a bill stating notice of pending bad debt, yet this is my first bill of this amount and my first bill since they cleared the last one.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin, and I can feel it working on the trouble spots.  </li>
            <li> Like another reviewer mentioned, I also have always had long eyelashes, but noticed they were breaking off and around one eye</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t matter how long I was a customer</li>
            <li> THEN call their refunds/return phone number and see how long it takes waiting on hold, transfers</li>
            <li> I keep healthy,inside and out, and I feel like it&#x27;s aged me way back.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take 4-6 weeks for them to receive a package in the mail, so why will it take them so long to refund my money???</li>
            <li> expected just that - the same package on auto-delivery once a month until I canceled.</li>
            <li> I had a few spots on my face that I didn&#x27;t like and they have almost gone away completely.</li>
            <li> The following installment is charged approximately 28 days from the first installment and will include the remaining balance.</li>
            <li> I find some drugstore brands are better products and much less expensive.</li>
            <li> Next time I will do my due diligence so that I don&#x27;t fall for this sort of scam again.</li>
            <li> As with the other reviews, my experience was the same.</li>
            <li> I dont doubt that many people had a bad experience with these products because I&#x27;ve had the same misfortune with other products out there, they just simply didn&#x27;t work for me...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any serious improvements in my skin</li>
            <li> Also, my face is really dry in the winter.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry skin....do not buy this product.  </li>
            <li> so called back, more painful phone tree nonsense-</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so dry.  </li>
            <li> I never have acne, I never have dry skin</li>
            <li> I do not normally shop from infomercials</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin, as a matter of fact I have never had a reaction to any skin care products in the past...</li>
            <li> I actually bought the meaningful beauty starter kit at Sephora (thanks to a horrible suggestion by an employee).</li>
            <li> It removes ALL of my makeup, down to the last bit, I don&#x27;t even need to use toner anymore.</li>
            <li> While I was on the phone with the operator (who, by the way, barely spoke English), I started asking some hard questions.  </li>
            <li> Pores are smaller, less blackheads, softened lines and softer skin.</li>
            <li> This product is a bit oily but if you have very dry skin you may like that.  </li>
            <li> I am beyond frustrated with Meaningful Beauty&#x27;s customer service.</li>
            <li> Once I called and the customer service rep was rude and didn&#x27;t want to help, I guess she recognized my voice from so many calls before, and when I explained that I needed the fake account that was in my husband&#x27;s name to be cancelled, she told me she couldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I wanted to post this review because i was surprised by all of the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Besides the unappealing esthetic appearance of a rash it was very itchy and after I used the face wash</li>
            <li> Prior to this line, I had trouble finding skin care that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin -</li>
            <li> The company refunded my money, but they could not recover the the time spent 4 days hiding in my house because of the way I looked.</li>
            <li> YOU WOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF PITY ON THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE A RISK TO BUY A PRODUCT</li>
            <li> After trying the stuff the cleanser was to rough on my skin, and I broke out in a rash.  </li>
            <li> but this farce really chapped me.  </li>
            <li> so be careful</li>
            <li> I used it until the the melon serum was empty, which took about 8 weeks. .</li>
            <li> and she said no, the order had not yet been charged so no real cancellation needed to be processed.</li>
            <li> A few minutes later I texted a friend of mine to ask her if she had ever used  this product before and what she thought of it.  </li>
            <li> Saw absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> No thanks Dr. Melon.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no difference in skin.  </li>
            <li> Then, when I called to inquire and cancel, I was treated like a money-management idiot AND even though I checked to be sure it was cancelled, they were still taking money from my account three months later!  </li>
            <li> I see many other people have had bad experiences with this product.</li>
            <li> All highly poisonous and caustic.</li>
            <li> As the days went on I realized my redness was during into extreme dryness</li>
            <li> I have oily skin that is prone to break outs and redness and there are TONS of other products that I have tried that have exacerbated the problem</li>
            <li> I am so sad to see so many negative reviews about this skin care line!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any plastic surgery or other treatments just MB.</li>
            <li> Unlike other companies from whom I&#x27;ve purchased online, this one muddles the payment plan up front, ensuring you don&#x27;t get a rebate or refund when you try to return it after it as destroyed your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like she doesn&#x27;t have enough money she has to go into business with shady outfit.</li>
            <li> product itself was no better than grocery store Olay and such.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of other skin care products on the market to use.</li>
            <li> so I can dispute if I have issues like some of the other reviews I read.</li>
            <li> Put your phone on speaker and do other work because it takes about 20 minutes to get through.  </li>
            <li> It was not any better than my former product, but the WORST thing was, I was starting to get double-billed.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any adverse side effects, like some other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I am pissed and extremely unhappy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always been complimented on my long eye lashes and in less that a week the are half the length.</li>
            <li> Please be very careful what you put on your face.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and a week later my entire face had broken out into a rash.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the introductory kit with bonus gifts for $49.95 from an infomercial I saw late one night which I was charged for and received as expected, but to my dismay I was also charged an additional $49.95 for the next 2 months for products I didn&#x27;t order or receive!</li>
            <li> They actually count on people getting tired and simply giving up.  </li>
            <li> why not, right?</li>
            <li> , more holds only to get someone who is rude and will make you feel stupid for returning the product while explaining the 1,546,678 steps it will require for you to get your refund.</li>
            <li> Not worth th risk or the hassel.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it at any price.</li>
            <li> Is it possible to give a negative rating?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sad part is I really did like some of the products</li>
            <li> Totally not worth what you pay for it.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money or hassle of dealing with the company.</li>
            <li> I think this is a horrible company and would not recommend buying anything from them - even if the product was good, which it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It comes down to what will work for you.</li>
            <li> The quality is less than an average product you can buy at CVS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for over a year and a half</li>
            <li> When you use the automatic shipments it is convenient and costs less.</li>
            <li> There are no quick fixes.</li>
            <li> After reading these reviews I finally know it is the Meaningful Beauty products that are creating horrific reactions.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a few days, and am still dealing with the dry, flaky skin it left behind.</li>
            <li> what a mess.</li>
            <li> I always had thick long eyelashes...</li>
            <li> but without making my skin feel tight.</li>
            <li> products made my skin dull and dry.</li>
            <li> angry and pissed that i have to now go out and find a new credit card company also.</li>
            <li> So i am at least a $ 157.34 out of pocket and still have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It is not worth the risk!</li>
            <li> I wear little make up, but have some visible sun damage.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I should have known that  Cindy Crawford is no more trustworthy than any other tv</li>
            <li> The eye cream did burn for a few days which was odd but after a few days that stopped, don&#x27;t know why.  </li>
            <li> But she said the main thing is that it is VERY difficult to cancel an order and to be careful b/c they may start billing me monthly for this product.  </li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin, so I of course analyzed the ingredients in each and every product I was using, however there was nothing that seemed excessively harsh or anything that I was allergic to (unless they failed to list inactive ingredients).    </li>
            <li> Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> and I stopped using all within a few weeks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> My skin felt dried up and pimples began to show.</li>
            <li> please, it is a waste of money and</li>
            <li> but my face feels softer and I dont have the uneven redness I did.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t waste money again..</li>
            <li> and I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I was in my 20s then stopped for a few years because I couldn&#x27;t afford it.  </li>
            <li> Waste of $$...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen the other negative comments.  </li>
            <li> ;  As soon as I receive it, look at ingredients and there it is, plain as day.  </li>
            <li> and I have broken out in Ache all over my face which is not normal for me.</li>
            <li> I am currently trying to cancel my order and so far it has been impossible!</li>
            <li> Hard cysts get trapped under the skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but felt so compelled to share my experience with others.  </li>
            <li> As I said, I don&#x27;t look 10 years younger, and I do think it&#x27;s a bit expensive, but to have my rosacea controlled</li>
            <li> Since I never use 3 of the products I usually give them away</li>
            <li> Thought I would give it a try and was not impressed at all, wasn&#x27;t enough in the shipment to start seeing any difference...</li>
            <li> I am sorry I had to stop, but I am coming back!!!</li>
            <li> I usually break out but had no issues with this.</li>
            <li> Sadly it didn&#x27;t make the wrinkles go away like a teen.</li>
            <li> It is no better or worse than any other.  </li>
            <li> The bottles have a very narrow capacity for any amount of product and are sent out every 90 days.  </li>
            <li> Really guys, this stuff stinks!</li>
            <li> according to my dermatologist he says that when using a new product people are prone to break outs and is not necesarily bad</li>
            <li> , I will keep my hard earned money.</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of negative reviews</li>
            <li> According to the reviews om this product, it sucks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> Stay away from these awful cheap products.</li>
            <li> seriously why would you pay over $60 for this kit when you can get it from the website for $29.95 plus shipping.  </li>
            <li> I NEVER authorized this and am livid that they sent me something I didn&#x27;t ask for at a price I am not comfortable spending for such a crap product.  </li>
            <li> seriously?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Guthy Renker has gotten ridiculous to deal with.</li>
            <li> /&gt; The product made me break out on my neck and face and dried my skin out so badly that i had to use other moisturizer products to combat this.</li>
            <li> I wish I could buy one item at a time, as I am not good about using the night cream.  </li>
            <li> if so, well that&#x27;s not fair.</li>
            <li> False advertising to say the least.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical using this product due to all the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Firstly, this stuff smells disgusting!</li>
            <li> You will be sorry if you get involved with these shady company.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only is the product very disappointing - they will charge your account REPEATEDLY even after you cancel.</li>
            <li> The rough patches would get irritated, and then they&#x27;d get so bad where they&#x27;d flake and sometimes bleed.</li>
            <li> Toss up what is worse.</li>
            <li> and it just kept getting worse.  </li>
            <li> , my skin looks worse.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this just made it worse.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit annoyed- and started looking up reviews on the company-</li>
            <li> I read about poor customer service, not great product, etc.</li>
            <li> I found over the counter products make my skin too thin</li>
            <li> Now my face is broken out with a rash.</li>
            <li> It is so thin, I would go to wash my face with it</li>
            <li> I am 30 now and between 26 and 28 my skin progressively got worse</li>
            <li> This is false advertising at its finest.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it works wonders!</li>
            <li> now I have not seen dramatic results yet</li>
            <li> However, unfortunately it appears to be common practice for them to not refund and try to make you jump through hoops when you return it!</li>
            <li> The customer service is HORRIBLE, the trouble you will get to cancel then have to re-cancel is not WORTH IT</li>
            <li> The day moisturizer dried my skin so badly it stung, and the cleanser didn&#x27;t cleanse at all.</li>
            <li> A few days after the fact I decided to research it on the internet and read all the bad reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> But wow this is an awful product line.</li>
            <li> I am so sad that this product doesn&#x27;t work for you guys, because it is a God send for me, I tell everyone and everyone who will listen to me about it.</li>
            <li> So I watched the silly ad on tv, ordered the kit.</li>
            <li> But needless to say I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I makes me angry every time I change the channel</li>
            <li> These products are absolutely horrible and if you could prove to me that Cindy actually uses this poo than I will eat bulls Balls for one week!</li>
            <li> They continued to bill me despite cancellation and were extremely difficult with respect to reversing the charges on my credit card.  </li>
            <li> I just blindly trusted our friend, Cindy.  </li>
            <li> I called back having to face the horrible phone tree again and this time a person was SOOOOO apologetic- since it had shipped</li>
            <li> So, to recap, the infomercials tell you that you can have the system for $39.95, but what they fail to tell you  is that you HAVE to be a club member to get it at that rate.  </li>
            <li> The sad thing is, I haven&#x27;t even tried the product.  </li>
            <li> I gave Cindy the benefit of the doubt, but her products have terrible ingredients and are not up to the standard she portrays them to be.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;The items were very poorly annotated.  </li>
            <li> The glowing serum smells like rotten fruit and the moisturizer was also very thin.</li>
            <li> I have to agree that this beuty care stinks.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that people said it didn&#x27;t work, they really hated it, had bad reactions to it and then alot of trouble canceling their contracts and receiving refunds.</li>
            <li> This garbage made me break out like crazy.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am returning this crap.</li>
            <li> I see that a lot of people had reported having bad results</li>
            <li> Bad, bad products.</li>
            <li> JUST USE MY BAD EXPERIENCES AS A LEARNING TOOL.</li>
            <li> I was frightened when I read all the bad reviews that the company was not cooperative in refunding their money.  </li>
            <li> I do not know what all the bad reviews are about this product I have been using this for four years, am almost 57</li>
            <li> I was told to bad</li>
            <li> Their customer service is as bad as their product.</li>
            <li> It is bad news.</li>
            <li> my skin looks really bad.</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t work, that wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, but it caused a rash and itching.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m feel badly for everyone who has ordered this.</li>
            <li> The prices on here is CRAZY!  </li>
            <li> I looked like I had chicken pox!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I hate to admit this</li>
            <li> I have to say though I tried then Wen hair care system and hated it.</li>
            <li> Also got a very bad rash on my neck and lower part of my face.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed,</li>
            <li> I saw no difference, and it made my face look awful.</li>
            <li> Terrible service!!</li>
            <li> It was terrible and I immediately stopped using all of the products.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  </li>
            <li> It was a beyond horrible experience.</li>
            <li> The product made me break out horribly.</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT OR GET SUCKED INTO THIS HORRIBLE COMPANY.</li>
            <li> The product was terrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> Oh and did I mention what an awful company Guthy Renker is...</li>
            <li> Terrible!!!!</li>
            <li> Scam and rip off with terrible customer service.</li>
            <li> The glowing serum is the worst.</li>
            <li> WRONG!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Worthless  garbage!</li>
            <li> Terrible product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for over a year and a half and I simply love them.  I had to stop using them briefly while overseas in a very hot climate.  I ran out of them and my skin really took a beating.  Once I was home, I immediately reordered and started using them religiously.  My skin bounced back so quickly and the fine lines I was so upset about were soothed away.  I get compliments all the time about my skin and I totally credit my using the Meaningful Beauty products for that!  I have every intention of continuing to use these products and no other for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> Yes, that was me, up in the middle of the night, a new baby and making an order for a television product.  Very pleased.  Enjoy the light fragrance, as does my little one when we snuggle...she says: \\&quot;you smell nice, mommy...\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Time to re-order and think I&#x27;ll go through Amazon instead of the TV..&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, and I can feel it working on the trouble spots.  love the mask and night fluide the best.&lt;br /&gt;ciao for now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and a week later my entire face had broken out into a rash.  It&#x27;s been two weeks and the rash is just starting to disappear.  Please be sure to try this on another part of your body prior to putting it on your face.  Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS! I saw this package deal on tv for really cheap, so I decided to buy it. Firstly, this stuff smells disgusting! It smells like an expired cantaloupe from the 1950s. Really guys, this stuff stinks! It is very oily, and a week after I started using it, I started to get rashes all over my face and neck! After a day, my rashes became zits, and I had about 20 whiteheads on my face! AND I&#x27;M 39!!!! Needless to say, I am returning this crap. I saw no difference, and it made my face look awful. I was on hold for 25 minutes when I called to ask about returning this. Terrible service!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product.  However, after using it for just a week realized that the product was causing me to break out in a red rash all over my face.  Besides the unappealing esthetic appearance of a rash it was very itchy and after I used the face wash I would still not feel clean and want to wash my face with a real cleanser.      I do have sensitive skin, so I of course analyzed the ingredients in each and every product I was using, however there was nothing that seemed excessively harsh or anything that I was allergic to (unless they failed to list inactive ingredients).    Hope this helps in your decision.</li>
            <li> I have literally never written a review before for anything in my whole life, but I just had to for this. I actually bought the meaningful beauty starter kit at Sephora (thanks to a horrible suggestion by an employee). I do not have extremely sensitive skin or anything, but I will break out if something is harsh or pore clogging, BUT THIS first started off as a little redness/dryness, which I thought was just my skin acting up and so I continued to use the wash, moisturizer, glowing serum and whatever else was in the kit. As the days went on I realized my redness was during into extreme dryness and then it basically became a red and very obvious rash on my laugh line. It was terrible and I immediately stopped using all of the products. Once I stopped it took a week for the redness and dryness to cease, but thank God it did. Shame on you Cindy Crawford for selling such a s****y product (excuse my language, but that is how upset I am!).</li>
            <li> The prices on here is CRAZY!  seriously why would you pay over $60 for this kit when you can get it from the website for $29.95 plus shipping.  I bought this product but not from Amizon and its OK. I see that a lot of people had reported having bad results but I have not had any such problems. I didn&#x27;t really see any serious improvements in my skin but then again I always get carded, I am just using it to prevent future damage lol.     I hate to admit this but I am 34 and my pore size is practically invisible and I think its because I use this product to maintain it, plus I don&#x27;t liquid make up.    I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the smell either, because so many people have reported having problems, I am guessing they have allergy to the main ingredient in this product being the mellon extract.       I know how that can be as I have allergy to some type of natural skin care such as honey, oat and egg white. Can&#x27;t put that stuff on my skin I will brake out in tiny red bumps all over and this would happen within mins of using.    If you brake out I would suggest using \\&quot;Olivera plant,\\&quot; NOT THE CREAM or any thing manufactured... I use the actual plant but that&#x27;s just me.  I apply it every 10 mins and by the end of day 2 my skin was back to normal.  This product is a bit oily but if you have very dry skin you may like that.  I found that a little went a long way for me because of that so the product lasted longer than 30 days :)</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of negative reviews so I wanted to share some info.  I am 41- starting using this line when I was 35.  Prior to this line, I had trouble finding skin care that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin - I have very sensitive acne-prone skin.  I no longer have those issues.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s an allergy to the ingredients the others are complaining about - just wanted to say the main products work great for me.  Every day I use the cleanser, day cream with SPF and night repair cream.  I don&#x27;t use the eye cream - I just don&#x27;t like putting cream on my eyes.  The glowing serum gave me a red, allergic reaction so I think that might be the product that is causing the problem for people. I use the exfoliating scrub and it works fine with no irritation.  I haven&#x27;t tried some of the newer products including the moisture capsules and toner.    I have tried MANY products in the past, including Skinceuticals, Philosophy, Clinique, on and on and I stopped using all within a few weeks becuase they caused irritation on my skin and I continued to break out on occasion.  These 3 products never gave me any irritation or \\&quot;start tup\\&quot; redness.  It made my skin immediatley feel hydrated and nourised.    I do not normally shop from infomercials - thought I would give it a try because nothing else had worked for me. I had prior acne discoloration/scars that went away and my skin looks much younger than my age.  If you have similar issues it&#x27;s worth a try - but stay clear of the \\&quot;glowing serum\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Really good product. A little more affordable than some out there. It did give me a small pore-clog on rare occasions, not for sure because I could even attribute this to hormones. I may use this again.</li>
            <li> Both of the products I purchased, The Meaningful Beatuy Trial Kit &amp; Wen Trail Kit I have found to be wonderful.  I plan on buying more of the products very soon.  Delivery also occured in about 5 days without difficulty.  Will definitely order again through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  Also got a very bad rash on my neck and lower part of my face.  My skin became really swollen, red and sore.  It is not worth the risk!</li>
            <li> I order these products a couple years ago and I am writing a comment after all this time because I cannot believe these products are still on t.v. I used the product before bedtime and the next morning, I totally looked like a monster. My face and eyes were so swollen. It was a beyond horrible experience. The company refunded my money, but they could not recover the the time spent 4 days hiding in my house because of the way I looked. Bad, bad products. Please be very careful what you put on your face. I am rating the product a 1 only because you cannot register your comment without a number attached.</li>
            <li> I was finally going to purchase this product but after reading the reviews, I decided against it.  Not worth th risk or the hassel.  Thanks to the reviews, I will keep my hard earned money.</li>
            <li> I have to agree that this beuty care stinks. I was lured into it by the fact is it excreted from some sort of fruit that preserved cantilope or melons. I have fairly good skin for a 50 year old (not too much older than Cindy Crawford)...but the issue of believing nonsence that after so many weeks the skin becomes different in a positive way.Well I gave it a try and guess what?  A couple weeks later my fiance asked me if I was using it \\&quot;yet\\&quot;! I just grinned to myself and again just like I wrote about the WEN hair products,IF IF IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE,IT PROBALLY ISN&#x60;T TRUE. I CINDY CRAWFORD FOR ADVERTIZING A PRODUCT THAT IS NONSENCE.I FEEL AS RICH AS YOU ARE YOU WOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF PITY ON THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE A RISK TO BUY A PRODUCT WE PROBALLY CANNOT AFFORD DURING THIS RECESSION. WOMEN ARE ALL THE SAME AND WE WANT TO LOOK BEAUTIFUL ALSO.I KNEW I WOULD NEVER GET MY MONEY BACK BY THIS OR THE WEN HAIR PRODUCTS.I JUST USE MY BAD EXPERIENCES AS A LEARNING TOOL. AGAIN I LOST MY RESPECT FOR YOU CINDY crawford!ps...THIS IS NOT ACTING WHAT YOU DO THIS IS PROMISING THINGS TO WOMEN OF (OUR) AGE THAT IS UNTRUE!</li>
            <li> The product is advertised as an initial 30 day supply, followed by a 90 day supply.  The 90 day supply that follows the initial 30 day supply is only 2 to 2.5 times the amount of the original supposed 30 day supply, instead of 3 times the amount.  You need to either order more often (extra cost) or customize your  order, which will also cost more than if you actually got the amount of product that was advertised in the first place as the replenishment supply.  So basically you are lured in by a decent product, expecting to continue with the same supply amounts as advertised, but do not receive that advertised amount.</li>
            <li> I am apparently in the minority, but I really like this system. It makes my ultra-sensitive, 38 year old skin feel hydrated and soft. The Pore Refining Toner and the Skin Softening Cleanser leave my skin clean, but not irritated. The Deep Cleansing Masque leaves pores looking smaller right after I use it-but without making my skin feel tight. The Glowing Serum feel FANTASTIC! I didn&#x27;t like the auto-ship feature because after 3 months, I ended up with a surplus of the Lifting Eye Creme and the Firming Neck and Chest Creme.     I don&#x27;t know if it has helped with anti-aging issues, but friends mentioned that I seem more confident during the times I am using the system. I think it comes from not worring about whether my concealer is working or if my forehead is flaking.    I have oily skin that is prone to break outs and redness and there are TONS of other products that I have tried that have exacerbated the problem and I don&#x27;t have an issue with these products. Of course, if I have been using another system, there is a \\&quot;transition\\&quot; period where I might have a couple breakouts, but they don&#x27;t last long.     Finally, I like the smell. It is very light and not like a lot of the heavily perfumed products I have used in the past.    I just really like this system!</li>
            <li> I am so sad to see so many negative reviews about this skin care line! I have been using this brand for 4 years, and I have reordered it over and over again because it is the only thing I trust. Now before I go more into it, I was 24 when I started using it and yada yada ya, I know I don&#x27;t need to use eye cream and all that stuff, but the way I see it, is that you are never too young to start preserving your skin, and taking care of your skin for the long run. I have always had a problem with really dry skin, especially rough patches on my face, and no matter how many times I put lotion on my face, the rough patches never went away. The rough patches would get irritated, and then they&#x27;d get so bad where they&#x27;d flake and sometimes bleed. I started using this product, and at first, like many of you I didn&#x27;t really think it was that great, until I continued to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the facial wash. I love the fact it doesn&#x27;t lather up, because that&#x27;s just harsh soap that would ry out your skin. It removes ALL of my makeup, down to the last bit, I don&#x27;t even need to use toner anymore. Afterwards I use the eye lifting cream, and eye enhancing cream. In the morning, I use the glowing serum, the other serum and the antiodixent facial moisturizer, along with the decollate&#x27; and I am good to go. At night, I wash all my makeup off, repeat the process but use the Meaningful beauty night cream, and I go to bed. my skin is absolutely flawless, my pores are not even visible, and I get so many comments on how my skin just glows. I am so sad that this product doesn&#x27;t work for you guys, because it is a God send for me, I tell everyone and everyone who will listen to me about it.</li>
            <li> I am a fifty year old elementary principal.  I just started at a new school when I turned 50 - my staff did not believe that I was 50.  They wanted to know what products I use to keep my skin looking so young and without any wrinkles.  My husband is a believer too!  I had him start using the eye creme and within one week there was a visible change in the wrinkles around his eyes.  We wish they had a line for men.  I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but felt so compelled to share my experience with others.  When you use the automatic shipments it is convenient and costs less.</li>
            <li> After getting the product to try, I cancelled being in the monthly shipments, only it never got cancelled.  I can&#x27;t believe Cindy Crawford backs this skin line.  She must have a different product that actually does what it says.  After trying the stuff the cleanser was to rough on my skin, and I broke out in a rash.  The masque did the same.  The day creme didn&#x27;t make me break out but it&#x27;s so runny, and it leaves you feeling a little oily afterwards, and I am not an oily/greasy person normally.  Overall you are better getting a different system it seems good for the price but really you should avoid this one like the plague.  The customer service is HORRIBLE, the trouble you will get to cancel then have to re-cancel is not WORTH IT AT ALL!</li>
            <li> While I really liked this product and have been using it for over 6 months, the pricing set up is really deceiving.  I thought that they were sending one box for $39.99, however they send one box everything three months and charge you 39.99 plus S&amp;H About $50 per month.  Again, good product but be fully aware of what you are actually paying $150 for one box of product that barely lasts 2 months.</li>
            <li> So I watched the silly ad on tv, ordered the kit. Thought I&#x27;d give it a try, right? Oh my gosh. About a minute after using the face wash my face started to get these tiny red bumps. I had a severe allergic reaction to this stuff. What&#x27;s strange is this is the first and only product to have ever done this to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use these products. You&#x27;ve been warned!!</li>
            <li> The face wash does nothing, might as well be using water and the rest of the products aren&#x27;t any better. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The product made me break out horribly. I purchased it directly from Meaningful Beauty / Guthy-Renker and tried it for a few months and finally decided it wasn&#x27;t working so I sent the third shipment back to them. However, unfortunately it appears to be common practice for them to not refund and try to make you jump through hoops when you return it! I was told it would take 4 - 6 weeks for the credit. In the meantime they continued charging me. After 6 weeks and no credit I called back and they claimed they never received my return shipment - after doing some research this appears to be their standard! I had the UPS tracking number, confirmed delivery receipt via UPS online, but that wasn&#x27;t good enough...they said they had to send me an affidavit VIA SNAIL MAIL (A LEGAL DOCUMENT THEY CANNOT EMAIL - really!?!?) and in order to get credit I would have to sign and return it. Obviously they are just hoping that the customer will give up. After much arguing and NO cooperation from the customer service rep, I talked to a supervisor who finally promised he would refund - let&#x27;s see. I think this is a horrible company and would not recommend buying anything from them - even if the product was good, which it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> According to the reviews om this product, it sucks. So I&#x27;m not even remotely interested. But for those of you who really do want beautiful radiant skin, stop buying these &amp;#34;quick fix&amp;#34; scam creams. All you need to look beautiful is a little nutrition. Buy a juicer, incorporate veggies in your diet by hiding the taste with fruit and you will be beautiful inside and out. No one, I mean no one looks good without taking tje time and effort to do so. There are no quick fixes. Also wash your face with a natural soap (coconut, goat milk, etc.) And combine 1 tablespoon coconut oil, 2 drops tea tree oil, 3 drops lavendar oil (essential oil) and apply to you face daily. Seriously, it works wonders!</li>
            <li> This is a scam worthy of the Nigerian underground.  First you order a trial package based on Cindy&#x27;s and Valerie&#x27;s  word. Then you find that you&#x27;ve unknowingly enrolled for a perpetual standing order that involves receiving unwanted shipments every three months. The price ($128.84 each shipment!) is automatically charged to you in 3 installments.  You have to spend your own money to send the stuff back - and getting credit is slow and agonizing.  As I understand it, if you DO manage to get  a credit (and we haven&#x27;t yet), it&#x27;s not for the full amount, because they deduct &amp;#34;shipping and handling.&amp;#34;  Mind you that&#x27;s &amp;#34;shipping and handling&amp;#34; for a package you never asked for!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my Mom who has been looking for a good skin care regime.  I saw an infomercal on it and was sucked in.  I bought the monthly supply.  She got her first in late December.  She never saw a difference in her skin but wanted to stick with it.  She got a shipment in January (I had signed up for a monthly shipment)  Well, when I went to cancel, they took forever to e-mail me back and then instead of cancelling over the phone I was told I had to call customer service where they wanted to talk to me about the benefits of the product, the flexibility of shipments and more BS.  I called and was told that in January they had shipped a three month supply and charged me $150.  I NEVER authorized this and am livid that they sent me something I didn&#x27;t ask for at a price I am not comfortable spending for such a crap product.  DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT OR GET SUCKED INTO THIS HORRIBLE COMPANY.</li>
            <li> The product was terrible. My skin felt dried up and pimples began to show. Not only that but before I could call to cancel they had charged me $43.95 saying I had agreed to another 30-day supply when I hadn&#x27;t. Well today I received an email about my cancellation and now they say I owe an additional $131.82. Come on people! Get it together. Of course I called and now I have to wait for them to send the product that I didn&#x27;t order so that I can return it to them. To me this is a scam. Watch out ladies, they are after your money! I hope I get mine back. But needless to say I won&#x27;t buy this product again. They assured me they no longer have my credit card info. But I don&#x27;t trust that either.</li>
            <li> While I was pleased with the products overall, the poor service and practices of this company over shadow any positive product they may offer.  While the initial shipment is inexpensive, any further shipments take over two weeks to arrive and come at a much larger price.  Especially if you happen to change or add an item.  To make the price even more, they will send a bottle of vitamins (that will not be requested) and proceed to charge your card $98.82!  For a bottle of vitamins!!!  And they will continue to send them and charge you if you do not cancel within short window of time regardless if you want them or not.  I have been charged hundreds of dollars for these products whether I requested them or not and whether I returned them or not.  While disputing the charges and trying to work out credits and payments made, they turned me over to a collection agency after assuring me that credits would be given.  Credits were not given and my credit was affected as a result.  After all was said and done, I ended up paying for products that I had returned just to get it off of my credit report.  I DO NOT RECCOMEND GIVING THIS COMPANY ANY OF  YOUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION OR EVEN DEALING WITH THEM IN ANY WAY!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this system for a year now.  Although I don&#x27;t see much change in my wrinkles, I have to say my rosacea is under control! I have not had any major outbreaks in the entire year that I&#x27;ve been using it.  I&#x27;ve seen the other negative comments.  I have not had any of those results.  As I said, I don&#x27;t look 10 years younger, and I do think it&#x27;s a bit expensive, but to have my rosacea controlled it&#x27;s worth every dime.</li>
            <li> I purchased these skin care products in December 2013. Received a tiny amount of product in tiny bottles and it was supposed to last me 3 months !&lt;br /&gt; The product made me break out on my neck and face and dried my skin out so badly that i had to use other moisturizer products to combat this. I live in a very harsh climate and clearly this skin care range isn&#x27;t meant for these weather conditions.&lt;br /&gt; When i called the company back before my 60 day trial was over i told them the problem, they then tried to sell me more product to combat this !!! Quite arrogant customer service. I told her i wanted a refund and she said to send it back which would cost me $8 canadian, it ended up costing me $17. I sent these items back and have heard nothing since , that was 17th January 2014.&lt;br /&gt;They have taken 3 payments from my Master card account so far and now i am on the telephone with HSBC Master card to cancel any further payments which is proving a nightmare also as there customer service is worse than Meaningful Beautys is.&lt;br /&gt; After 30 mins and much wrangling i have had to cancel my Master card account and close it down to cancel these damned payments that are going out of my account, ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt; Never again will i buy from a TV advert. So i am at least a $ 157.34 out of pocket and still have dry skin.  Do not buy this product please, it is a waste of money and the chemicals in it are quite disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;Very angry and pissed that i have to now go out and find a new credit card company also. What a joke.</li>
            <li> I order it and is working for me greatly... I love the product ... before this product I used Jafra wich was working wonderfully great for about 4 years but all of the sudden it was not my skin is very sesitive and meaningfull beauty did not cause any break outs... according to my dermatologist he says that when using a new product people are prone to break outs and is not necesarily bad it means the product is actually working u just have to give it more time so that your face gets used to it</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical using this product due to all the negative reviews. I have used it for a week now I have not seen dramatic results yet but my face feels softer and I dont have the uneven redness I did. I dont use the scrub night and day because I do have sensitive skin but overall I like the product.</li>
            <li> I have tried olay cleansers neutrogena, you name it I have tried it. All facial cleansers dry out my face really bad, but the meaningful beauty cleanser it great.  The serum is awesome also, it isn&#x27;t oily like most moisturizers can be...I have tried lots of facial moisturizers and I am happy with meaningful beauty.  I kind of like the fact that I dont have to worry about running out because, they deliver it when ever you need it</li>
            <li> I was frightened when I read all the bad reviews that the company was not cooperative in refunding their money.  I hadn&#x27;t read them prior to ordering.  Well, after using the product for the required time, I decided I didn&#x27;t want to keep it/continue using it, especially if I was going to have a problem getting my refund.  My experience was just fine! Perhaps the company changed their policy since the reviews I read here.  My experience was good and my refund came through right away!  Remember to keep your tracking number, though, if you return your product.  (I didn&#x27;t need it because I called them and they said they had received my package; I didn&#x27;t need to use the tracking number.) Gloria</li>
            <li> After reading these reviews I finally know it is the Meaningful Beauty products that are creating horrific reactions. I purchased 1st shipment and products were ok. Stopped using for awhile. Like another reviewer mentioned, I also have always had long eyelashes, but noticed they were breaking off and around one eye almost gone. Started using products again. Right eye started having red dryness underneath like a burn. The after using Both eyes started swelling, and were red and dry like they were burned. I look like I&#x27;ve been punched in the face. Horrible product. I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to a skin care product before. I wouldn&#x27;t give one star, but you have to.</li>
            <li> I ordered Meaningful Beauty and was not unhappy with the cleanser.  I paid for three months upfront.  I&lt;br /&gt;received a box of items, that I thought was for one month.  I used them liberally, for one week, and called to&lt;br /&gt;tell them which items that I wanted to keep.  I was told that the box I had received was the three month supply.&lt;br /&gt;If I had paid one month, I would have received the same boxâ€¦&lt;br /&gt;The items were very poorly annotated.  I needed glasses to read which pump to use.  I cancelled my order, and&lt;br /&gt;will not pay again.  diane</li>
            <li> I do not know what all the bad reviews are about this product I have been using this for four years, am almost 57 and I have no wrinkles whatsoever! Everyone who sees me comments on my flawless complexion. I have used other high end products but I always go back to Meaningful beauty, so I don&#x27;t understand negative reviews.  If you want smooth silky skin I highly recommend this product. I don&#x27;t even use everything they have just the creme de serum mostly and the antioxidant day cream. If you don&#x27;t believe me look at my picture on Facebook. I haven&#x27;t had any plastic surgery or other treatments just MB. I hope you have the same results!</li>
            <li> I makes me angry every time I change the channel and I see Cindy Crawford and she talks about what a miracle product Meaningful Beauty is--really?! These products are absolutely horrible and if you could prove to me that Cindy actually uses this poo than I will eat bulls Balls for one week! Of course this will not happen so I am good. Oh and did I mention what an awful company Guthy Renker is...they take your credit card and charge it each month and it does not stop until you block them from your credit card company. Great marketing though, I will give them that.</li>
            <li> I started using this product line about one year ago.  I wear little make up, but have some visible sun damage.  Also, my face is really dry in the winter.  This product line has been great for me.  When used consistently, my fine lines are diminished and my skin tone is more even, allowing me to look great with minimal make up coverage.  In my opinion, the best products are the night creme and the rich moisture masque.  Both of these make my skin look great!</li>
            <li> I used this product for a few days, and am still dealing with the dry, flaky skin it left behind. The day moisturizer dried my skin so badly it stung, and the cleanser didn&#x27;t cleanse at all. Like others have mentioned, trying to return or discontinue it is a rigamarole. Unlike other companies from whom I&#x27;ve purchased online, this one muddles the payment plan up front, ensuring you don&#x27;t get a rebate or refund when you try to return it after it as destroyed your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boo!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 years old, brunette ... and have tried many different brands throughout the years, NONE with the horrific results that Meaningful Beauty caused.  I always had thick long eyelashes... so I was using this project regime for skin care.  After 3 short days of using the cleanser, serum and eye cream... MY EYELASHES ALL BROKE OFF!  I am not kidding.  Top and bottom... totally gone!  This product is the only thing I had been doing different.  I called the company, they got the numbers off the tubes from me and refunded my money (but not the shipping/handling!).  I had even sent them a before/after photo with the results quite clearly showing. NO EYELASHES.  How do you recover from that?  (Plenty of protein drinks and now I&#x27;m trying Latisse, which is proving helpful).  But they should take this line of products off the market till they discover what ingredient is causing hairs (eyelashes only... eyebrows are fine) to break off and/or fall out.  All this happened in 3 days time.</li>
            <li> products made my skin dull and dry. too many bottles and steps to keep a daily routine going.</li>
            <li> I am currently trying to cancel my order and so far it has been impossible! After using Meaningful Beauty for a few days, my face broke out with huge, itchy bumps. I looked like I had chicken pox! Some of the bumps have left scars. I can&#x27;t believe Cindy, Valerie, and Debra endorse this product! Terrible!!!!</li>
            <li> The commercial shows pictures of Cindy C when she was much younger.  I think that states how misleading this product really is.  Lets see what Cindy looks like now, and proof, she uses her own product. Also, some people just have good skin genes, and anything will work for them. Diet is the best way to improve your skin. Plenty of water,  healthy eating, and healthy living.  Also many women have hormone issues, as I do, so get your hormones balanced, and skip Cindy&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> do yourself a big favor and don&#x27;t get involved up with these people, they charge your card even when you cancel future shipments. Trying to work with their customer service is like verbal warfare. they misrepresent themselves. Their webpage states a price of 39.95 I saw on my checking account they put another charge through, UNAUTHORIZED. When I called they said I agreed to a 3 month trial...NOT! They are unwilling to change it so I called my bank and told them this was an UNAUTHORIZED CHARGE and not to pay.You will be sorry if you get involved with these shady company. Cindy Crawford should be ashamed of herself for associating herself with these kind of actions.......like she doesn&#x27;t have enough money she has to go into business with shady outfit. UGH&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should have a rating for NO STARS,</li>
            <li> Cost versus quality-too high with zero results. Tried to cancel and it took 90 days and 3 months of additional charges. What a scam. Cindy Crawford should not have her name associated with this product. What a shame-life is too short!</li>
            <li> Deceptive advertising.  I specifically ordered a one time special for 39.99.  Instead, I was enrolled in a &amp;#34;membership.&amp;#34;  I called to cancel and was told after some dodging around that I could cancel and return the product but that my credit card would be charged for the order and it would take 4-6 weeks to get a refund and that I would have to postage to return the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have known that  Cindy Crawford is no more trustworthy than any other tv scammer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself was no better than grocery store Olay and such.</li>
            <li> I purchased Meaningful Beauty through Guthy Renker, not Amazon.  However, I would recommend not spending your money on this product.  I was so excited to find such a great deal on the television, that I quickly purchased it because I had been waiting to find a good deal like this.  The company promised $39.95 a month, but that the first shipment would contain a 90-day supply.  What they do not tell the customers is that the 90-day supply is 1 bottle of face wash, 1 bottle of moisturizer, etc.  Nobody in their right mind would/should spend $120.00 for 5 small bottles of facial products.  I was so disappointed.  The facewash is the same as Cetaphil, and the day time moisturizer is the same as Aveeno&#x27;s Positively Ageless with SPF (which is a great product for far less than $24 a bottle!).  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this product at all.  None of it was great, and it is extremely over priced.</li>
            <li> Should have read the reviews before we ordered. Toss up what is worse. The product or customer no service, didn&#x27;t know the original trial was an excuse to send more at higher price. Never explained at time. Not worth it at any price. Huge hassle.</li>
            <li> Is it possible to give a negative rating?&lt;br /&gt;I very seldom write any product reviews but this farce really chapped me.  Watch out your are not getting what you see.  Buried deep in some verbage on the product is what they really charge you not what you see up front.  The product that is sent out lasts for barely a month if that.  The bottles have a very narrow capacity for any amount of product and are sent out every 90 days.  No shipping charges...that is bull too! I was thought I was paying $39.95 and would pay month for replacements.  I received this explanation when I questioned the charges from Meaningful Beauty. &amp;#34;The first installment includes the shipping and handling charges along with any applicable taxes. The following installment is charged approximately 28 days from the first installment and will include the remaining balance. Shipment Total: $ 131.82 1st Payment: March 21,2014 $ 43.94, 2nd Payment: April 18,2014 $ 43.94, 3rd Payment: May 16,2014 $ 43.94 , Balance: $ 43.94&amp;#34;  I got the shaft for the last &amp;#34;payment&amp;#34; and feel free as a bird to get off with that.  Cindy Crawford and all of you &amp;#34;stars&amp;#34; that promote this deception shame on you....I have lost all respect.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about a month.  I started breaking out with huge red pimples under the skin along with white heads.  Thinking it would get better I continued using the product and it just kept getting worse.  I contacted the company and they were like oh well.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, you will be ripped off with and if like me it will take a lot of time to get your face and skin healthy again.</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old and I thought because of the star endorsements this product must be good.  My skin looks older than it did before I started.  If you have dry skin....do not buy this product.  It does not nourish your skin and it makes it even drier.  Thanks to Meaningful Beauty, my skin looks worse.</li>
            <li> I used this faitlfully 2x a day for 3 months and saw NO DIFFERENCE............I will stick to otc and save many many $$</li>
            <li> Infomercial was VERY misleading!  I ordered the introductory kit with bonus gifts for $49.95 from an infomercial I saw late one night which I was charged for and received as expected, but to my dismay I was also charged an additional $49.95 for the next 2 months for products I didn&#x27;t order or receive! Also, the products didn&#x27;t show any better results than the over-the-counter products I was already using and they are alot cheaper!</li>
            <li> Scam and rip off with terrible customer service. I have been customer for years. I get billed quarterly. I received my latest package of 7 products for 150 bucks and the packaging and pamphlet stated you could customize order and there would be free shipping. Since I never use 3 of the products I usually give them away I decided to take advantage of this offer and get the products I use. I called and was told there would be an additional charge to do so. There was no indication of that anywhere. I argued with the sales rep for 10 min who was clearly reading off a script. I finally asked to speak to a manager.  After a 10 minute hold I got one. I explained I was not adding to my order I was swapping products for ones I use I was told to bad it didn&#x27;t matter how long I was a customer there was no way to do that and I would have to pay ala cart for every product in there now instead of the packaged deal. False advertising to say the least. I cancelled my account with them on the spot. There are plenty of other skin care products on the market to use. Cindy Crawford should be embarrassed by the way this company is run and by the scams they are trying to run on its customers. Sad part is I really did like some of the products oh well I guess I will start to like another skin care line now</li>
            <li> After using this product and not getting any results, I attempted to cancel.  It took two attempts to do so.  They continued to bill me despite cancellation and were extremely difficult with respect to reversing the charges on my credit card.  Their customer service is as bad as their product.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin, as a matter of fact I have never had a reaction to any skin care products in the past...ever and I am 39.  After 2 days I noticed under my eyes had rasied bumps and were really itchy then on day 3 I noticed a severe rash all over my chest.  I stopped using it immediately and the rash is beginnging to go away. I don&#x27;t plan to try and return the products I received as I only paid $30 but I am trying to cancel the future orders...WIll see how that goes.  Either way its on my AMEX so I can dispute if I have issues like some of the other reviews I read.</li>
            <li> The absolute best advice I can give is to NEVER order anything from the toll-free number on the infomercial. If you really want to try this product, order it online from Amazon or another 3rd party vendor. That is the ONLY way you can be sure you will not have to deal with Guthy Renker&#x27;s horrendous customer service. Your credit card WILL be charged monthly (even if you explicitly tell them NOT to when ordering. They will lie when you&#x27;re on the phone and then deny it when you call back later after they&#x27;ve billed you for the next month). Returns are a months long, several lengthy phone-call process where you will be put through the ringer and then still may not get your refund. They actually count on people getting tired and simply giving up.  If you don&#x27;t believe me about how bad their returns process is...call their toll-free sales number (given on the infomercial) and count how fast they answer and pleasantly try to pitch you to buy (then hang up).  THEN call their refunds/return phone number and see how long it takes waiting on hold, transfers, more holds only to get someone who is rude and will make you feel stupid for returning the product while explaining the 1,546,678 steps it will require for you to get your refund.</li>
            <li> I tried their 30 day supply. I don&#x27;t know what the hype is about this product, nothing special and there was no noticeable difference on my face of fine wrinkles or lines. My regular moisturizer is just as good... Also, a test of whether a product makes a difference or if it is working well-- is if someone says to you &amp;#34;your face looks great, what are you using?&amp;#34;..nope, that never happened!!!  I cancelled my order  and there was no problem cancelling (make sure you write down the date you ordered so you can cancel within 30 days if you want)-- BUT, since you also receive a free &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34; of vitamins, those vitamins come in a separate shipping. You MUST cancel the vitamin order separately if you no longer want that shipment. I was charged for the vitamins of $32.74 for a new shipment and didn&#x27;t realize it had been sent until I looked at my credit card bill..I think this is deceptive marketing and I do not remember reading anything within my 30 day supply of products that I would have to make 2 separate cancellations if I want to cancel my order. When I called to cancel, they said that Meaningful Beauty should have told me this was a separate order to be cancelled, and that they will send me a return label for my shipment, but won&#x27;t refund me until they receive the vitamins back..hassle....so be careful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been watching the Meaningful Beauty infomercials for months now, and in a weak moment I called a few days ago to place my order.  I&#x27;m usually so good about researching products and reviews online before I buy anything.  I just blindly trusted our friend, Cindy.  While I was on the phone with the operator (who, by the way, barely spoke English), I started asking some hard questions.  This was AFTER I had given her my credit card information.  Once I realized I was signing up for monthly charges of $40 and would receive a new shipment every 90 days, I decided this was not for me!  I told her to not process the order.  I did not want it and could not afford the ongoing fee.  I am worried now that since they have my credit card information they will go ahead and charge it anyway.  I&#x27;m going to call my bank and see what I can do to protect myself.  Next time I will do my due diligence so that I don&#x27;t fall for this sort of scam again.</li>
            <li> Okay people, here is the deal. Cindy Crawford may be a nice business woman. However, her product Meaningful Beauty? Better read the fine print. Because it is a scam company. You order samples? Fine. Wonderful. Next comes a \\&quot;free gift\\&quot; (68.00 billed to your credit card). Then comes in another 30 days the full sized product that they charge your card EVERY MONTH from the time you get the samples until they send you a NEW DELIVERY in 30 days (\\&quot;free gift\\&quot; charged to your credit card). Now, I am in retail sales and customer service. This is NOT the way to do business if you want happy customers and low returns. Take away the fine print. Make the billing for the samples. When they order new product, send it after taking their credit card information. This is not customer care.  It is a scam and greedy.  Oh!  If you want to return the product?  Do it that day - write refused on it.  There are two billing department numbers.  One for the vitamins.  1-800-813-3826.  Put your phone on speaker and do other work because it takes about 20 minutes to get through.  Use a land line.  This is the number for the product:  1-800-927-0047.  You will have to put in your phone number, your zip code, and I advise pressing 2 because if you try to put in your account number, it won&#x27;t be accepted and there is no way to get back to the main menu.  Once you have a customer representative.  They will tell you that you will be billed for the shipping.  $32.00 for product you \\&quot;agreed to by ordering on-line\\&quot;.  See that paragraph?  It signs you up for an intrusive billing process that is EVERY MONTH.  Hang onto your wallets or take my advice and go to your local representative for a different company.  Until they change those practices, I wouldn&#x27;t touch Meaningful Beauty with a 10 ft pole.  Because of this.  The product itself?  It is no better or worse than any other.  I and my husband have noticed no difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months now and i like it. i normally have oily skin and this has really helped clear out my pores and make them smaller (WHICH NEVER HAPPENS) i really enjoy this product. i signed up for it through their actual website and it said MULTIPLE times that this was a monthly membership, no where near deceitful like people are saying. Maybe its because i belong to many monthly memberships that it was obvious to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like i said, i overall really enjoy this product and i purchased the 90 day set. i am interested to try more of the products that were not in my set.</li>
            <li> I ordered Meaningful Beauty about five months ago. It did make my skin feel nice, no breakouts (and I do have acne-prone skin.) I used it until the the melon serum was empty, which took about 8 weeks. . Fast forward three months and I have more apparent fine lines, and my skin seems dull. I have to deduce that the stuff was working, because I noticed a significant difference when I stopped! The on-line ordering, membership- joining negatives aside- I would definitely give this product another try. This time, I&#x27;m buying in-store with no strings attached...</li>
            <li> I am in my 60&#x27;s and have used MB for about five years, now.  It has kept my skin soft, smooth, and younger feeling.  I shared it with my sister, who has different complexion, and it made her break out.  It is perfect for anyone who has skin that is normal to dry.  If you already have oily skin, it may not be best for you.&lt;br /&gt;  I love the products and feel younger.  When people see me, they cannot believe I am in my 60&#x27;s.  Try itâ€¦but really use it day and night, if you want to witness great results.</li>
            <li> After several years of watching the infomercials on this skin care product line, I found myself on the phone placing an order for their introductory offer.  A few days after the fact I decided to research it on the internet and read all the bad reviews on Amazon. So, of course I started kicking myself, why did I fall for this?  I am a ( retired) licensed esthetician and should know better!&lt;br /&gt;Well, package came, and truth be told, after a month of using the products, It has made an improvement in my 52 yr. old skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder wrinkle smoothing capsules, lifting eye creme, and glowing serum. It&#x27;s not cheap, but best results from &amp;#34;over the counter&amp;#34; products that I&#x27;ve purchased.  The cleanser was just  &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;, I can find a better one, and the day creme SPF 20&lt;br /&gt;is a little greasy for me, but not bad, I may reorder it also.&lt;br /&gt;I felt with my own personal results (because sure enough if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, it won&#x27;t for me) I needed to post this.</li>
            <li> What a ripoff.  Commercial said $39.95 but when I called it was $49.95 for 3 months.  It was misrepresented.  Lady I ordered from said I would receive a supply every 30 days and it would be $49.95.  You get one supply (the initial order) and then my account was charged $49.95 for 3 consecutive months.  Product doesn&#x27;t work that well.  I have oily skin and this just made it worse.  Totally not worth what you pay for it.  A lot of cheaper products work better.</li>
            <li> Shame on you Cindy Crawford.  This product is a hoax.  I called and verified multiple times that I would pay 39.95 for the first month and cancel within 30 days if not completely satisfied.  I would then pay a 3 month fee of $119.85 for a 3 month supply after that.  My confirmation email arrived stating that I was being charged the 3 month rate of $119.85 for 3 months and the one month charge of 39.95 was not even mentioned.  This is a scam to charge your credit card and attempt to get away with it.  Do not fall into their trap./</li>
            <li> I Don&#x27;t  normally write reviews. But wow this is an awful product line. The quality is less than an average product you can buy at CVS. The melon serum stinks but is perhaps the most decent of all. The ads and pics are also very deceiving. The product sizes are only somewhat bigger than a travel size. The glowing serum is the worst. I actually threw it in the trash after just one use. Save your money. Stay away from these awful cheap products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 22 year old who thought I would take preventative measures against aging skin with this product line. I was so excited about ordering my starter kit that I also ordered one for my grandmother to try. Each kit is advertised at $39.99 for a 30 day supply and also includes some free trial products. I was thinking I was getting a great deal -WRONG! Upon arriving I pulled out the invoice sheet and noticed that I was on &amp;#34;automatic replenishment&amp;#34; which continues to send 90 day supplies for $39.99 per month, again, x2 for me because I ordered two kits. When I called customer service about the mix up, they informed me that I already had a balance on my account- a total of $240.00 When I asked to cancel the account, they let me know that canceling my account would not cancel my payments so now I have to send back the products and hope that they refund me accordingly. It absolutely BLOWS MY MIND to believe that these teeny tiny kits are worth $120.00 each. This is false advertising at its finest.</li>
            <li> Thought I would give it a try and was not impressed at all, wasn&#x27;t enough in the shipment to start seeing any difference...Wouldn&#x27;t waste money again..</li>
            <li> I ordered the full sized products of meaningful beauty in november 2013. I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference using the product for a few weeks and leading into months, I even started using a different product which I love, I still have full bottles of the meaningful beauty products somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow I wasn&#x27;t supposed to receive a new 3 month supply shipment until February 2014. Yet I received a bill in December for payment of another 3 month supply of products. Not only did I receive a bill for products I&#x27;m not supposed to be getting but I received a second bill with a different account number and then there was a third bill created in my husband&#x27;s name! So here I am being charged for 1 extra account and now they added my husband. When I called customer service and asked about the extra account they told me that the accounts were created because I started ordering the products and then changed my mind to use my card instead of my husband&#x27;s so it still kept his information in the system and created an account in his name, for some reason it just duplicated my information and created 2 accounts in my name. There were 3 account and only 1 shipment received.&lt;br /&gt;Another time I called I was told I ordered vitamins, which I never did and if I did why didn&#x27;t I receive them. I was sent an affidavit to sign and return because of a shipment that was supposedly sent to me and I never received, this was 2 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;So I would think that if that is what happened and they&#x27;ve figured it out, that I shouldn&#x27;t have to call every couple of weeks to find out why I&#x27;m still receiving bills. Every bill I&#x27;ve received they&#x27;ve had to clear because its their mistake yet I&#x27;m still getting bills on top of bills. (Thank God I changed my card or else all this money would&#x27;ve been coming out of my account).&lt;br /&gt;Now I got a bill stating notice of pending bad debt, yet this is my first bill of this amount and my first bill since they cleared the last one. I am beyond frustrated with Meaningful Beauty&#x27;s customer service. Once I called and the customer service rep was rude and didn&#x27;t want to help, I guess she recognized my voice from so many calls before, and when I explained that I needed the fake account that was in my husband&#x27;s name to be cancelled, she told me she couldn&#x27;t and I would have to call back and get it done...ummm...seriously? Now I have to call them again! Its been almost a month since everything has been cancelled and cleared and even though my husband nor myself has an account with meaningful beauty I of course just received another bill.</li>
            <li> I planned on trying this and wanted to see if I could get it through Amazon so I wouldn&#x27;t have to sign up for auto-delivery. I did that with Wen hair products and I live Wen but just buy it as I need it. So glad I read the reviews first, I will definitely not waste any money on it. I read many, many reviews and only one was positive. It wasn&#x27;t that people said it didn&#x27;t work, they really hated it, had bad reactions to it and then alot of trouble canceling their contracts and receiving refunds. Thank you Amazon for having these review blogs!</li>
            <li> When you order the 5 piece trial, before you receive it &amp; see all the fine print, your credit card will be billed for the 1st of 3 installments of over $43 each for a continuous supply.  You will only know when the shipment shows up at your door because this will happen before you receive your statement - you receive no other notification.  The charge for the introductory offer &amp; the charge for the 1st continuous supply showed up on the same credit card statement.  When you contact them they tell you that it is shown on the tv commercial &amp; on the website (our order was placed by phone).  We had great difficulty canceling this order &amp; it ended up costing us shipment both ways.  I so irritated I wanted to return the special offer unopened!</li>
            <li> customer service is garbage...i just hung up on the lady,im starting to think its a scam cause they suck you in with this great offer then after you give all your infomation they try to make you pay 3 months! im like im only getting as a gift for someone .Can u believe she tried to sneak charge my card? she started talking fast then she tried to hang up on me i almost cursed her out! i promise if im wrongfully charged im getting a lawyer to sue! this is a scam!</li>
            <li> Do not get sucked into buying this product.  It was not any better than my former product, but the WORST thing was, I was starting to get double-billed.  I would get billed and charged twice in the same month.  Then, when I called to inquire and cancel, I was treated like a money-management idiot AND even though I checked to be sure it was cancelled, they were still taking money from my account three months later!  DO NOT GET INVOLVED with this business!  It is bad news.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS....I am 54 and after using it for a short while (way before they decided to ship a full size order) my skin looks really bad. I keep healthy,inside and out, and I feel like it&#x27;s aged me way back. Tried to cancel, but ended up having to close my bank account to stop them from taking money from me. Then they had the nerve to send me a collection notice...PLEASE!</li>
            <li> I ordered a starter kit on March 26th, 2014. The verbage on my order said it would ship within 24-48 hours. When April arrived and still no sign of the product, I tried to look up shipping info on my order confirmation. All it said was &amp;#34;back order&amp;#34;- no guess as to when the product would arrive.  I called customer service and after an excruciating series of missteps, finally got a person.  Person was pleasant said she could not tell exactly when it would ship, but she gave me a &amp;#34;within 10 days&amp;#34; timeframe.  I was a bit annoyed- and started looking up reviews on the company- something I should&#x27;ve done in the first place. I read about poor customer service, not great product, etc. so called back, more painful phone tree nonsense- got a nice person who said she had cancelled my order. I asked if I would get a confirmation email and she said no, the order had not yet been charged so no real cancellation needed to be processed. Should&#x27;ve argued- sure enough two days later I get a cheery note in my email saying my shipment is on its way. I called back having to face the horrible phone tree again and this time a person was SOOOOO apologetic- since it had shipped already there was nothing she could do- I should return the product and within 4-6 weeks should. see a refund. #$%$^&amp;*()(%#$@@%^&amp;&amp;&amp;*&amp;*. Do not go near this company!</li>
            <li> GUTHY RENKER WAS TO TAKE &amp;#34;0-N-E&amp;#34; PAYMENT A MONTH FOR THIS PRODUCT FROM MY ACCOUNT AND IN DECEMBER, AT THE TIME WHEN YOUR MONEY IS MOST IMPORTANT THEY DREW ONE PAYMENT AND 2 WEEKS LATER THEY BILLED MY BANK FOR A SECOND TIME.  WHEN I CALLED THEY SAID &#x27;WE ACCELERATED THE SHIPMENT&amp;#34;.  THEY MUST KNOW WHEN PEOPLE GENERALLY HAVE HAD ENOUGH AND WHEN THEY NORMALLY CANCEL. I&#x27;M GLAD THAT MY MORTGAGE COMPANY DID NOT DECIDE TO &amp;#34;ACCELERATE&amp;#34; MY PAYMENTS.  WHO DO THEY THINK THEY ARE??????  THEY ONLY HAD AUTHORIZATION TO TAKE ONE PAYMENT A MONTH FOR THIS PRODUCT.  I GUESS CINDY CRAWFORD WAS SHORT OF CASH FOR CHRISTMAS!!!!!!  WHEN I SAID CANCEL THEY SAID I WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO SHIP THE PRODUCT BACK.  WE DISPUTED FOR 3 MONTHS AND THEY ENDED UP WITH THE PRODUCT AND MY MONEY!!!!!  IF YOU DO NOT OPEN OR TOUCH THE PRODUCT I FOUND OUT YOU CAN SEND IT BACK &amp;#34;REFUSED&amp;#34;.  THE POST OFFICE SAID THEY SEND BACK SO MANY OF THESE ITEMS THAT THEY THINK THE GOV&#x27;T NEEDS TO INTERVENE!!!!!! I CALLED THE TEXAS ATTY GENERAL!!!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful..... for me.  It isn&#x27;t a miracle cure of course, but me skin is clear, soft, glowing and younger looking.  My only issue is having to purchase the items as a monthly package.  I wish I could buy one item at a time, as I am not good about using the night cream.  I have not had any adverse side effects, like some other reviewers.</li>
            <li> You know those products that you read about which make some amazing claims regarding what they&#x27;ll do for you, and with great skepticism you buy the product, and then are pleasantly surprised to find the claims are true?  Well, this isn&#x27;t one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Meaningful Beauty products for a while now, and while they haven&#x27;t harmed my skin, I&#x27;m not seeing much benefit either.  The magic melon juice or whatever it is, might be helping Cindy Crawford, but I suspect her beauty comes more from good genes, a healthy lifestyle, and maybe a nip tuck doctor or some clever photoshopping.  Maybe not, maybe these products are greatly helping Cindy look the way she does, but if so, well that&#x27;s not fair. I certainly need the help more than she does, and that&#x27;s not happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, not recommending these products, save your money and try a good loofa followed by some vaseline if you want soft skin.</li>
            <li> I will not be using this product because I was lied to when asked if it contained parabens.  They said &#x27;NO, it does not.&amp;#34;  As soon as I receive it, look at ingredients and there it is, plain as day.  Parabens are known cancer-causing agents and will not be absorbed into this skin!  There are many options out there that are paraben-free and there&#x27;s not excuse for them to lie.</li>
            <li> I called to order a Meaningful Beauty kit one morning b/c I wanted to try this skin care system out.  Hey, Cindy Crawford endorses it, other celebrities were raving about how wonderful it is, and it was pretty affordable, so why not, right? WRONG!!!!!!  A few minutes later I texted a friend of mine to ask her if she had ever used  this product before and what she thought of it.  She said that she used it years ago but that nothing really stood out in her mind about it.  But she said the main thing is that it is VERY difficult to cancel an order and to be careful b/c they may start billing me monthly for this product.  I was taken back b/c on the Meaningful Beauty website there are all kinds of claims that you can cancel at any time if you&#x27;re not satisfied.  So, I call the customer service line to make sure that my online order was just a one-time order for one kit.  She explained to me that ordering online was signing me up for a club membership and that my credit card would be billed monthly. She even told me that before I submitted my order I was told about the charges by clicking on the &amp;#34;terms &amp; agreement&amp;#34; box. Ok, first of all, NO ONE reads the entire small print of the terms and agreement.  The only thing I read was that I agreed to let them charge my credit card for the payment and that&#x27;s it.  But to be fair, I should have read more or researched more before I made an online order.So, to recap, the infomercials tell you that you can have the system for $39.95, but what they fail to tell you  is that you HAVE to be a club member to get it at that rate.  And to be a club member you have to sign up for monthly kits. Very deceitful upfront, don&#x27;t you think?  Then, the customer service lady tells me that if I would have simply called to place my order instead of ordering online, then I could have purchased the ONE kit and not been charged monthly. (Not to mention that the price for ONE kit was now $59.00 and not $39.95) I asked if I could go ahead and cancel my order and she said that I would have to wait 24 hours to do that. (remember this is like 45 min to an hour later after ordering that I try to cancel). So, I call the next morning to cancel and after telling the lady multiple times that I wanted to cancel, she finally let me cancel the membership, but said she couldn&#x27;t cancel the order for the kit.  Is that why they told me to call back after 24 hours, so that the order would be fully processed and I couldn&#x27;t cancel the order?!?!  What a scam!  Now, I can&#x27;t cancel the initial order b/c they say it has already been processed and shipped (within 24 hours), but they say that it will take 4-6 weeks for me to get a refund for the returned package???  It doesn&#x27;t take 4-6 weeks for them to receive a package in the mail, so why will it take them so long to refund my money??? Just be aware that if you ever order this product online you are signing yourself up for monthly charges and also they cannot ever cancel an order once it has been processed. You will have to wait months to get your money back, if you get it back at all. I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, but this was worth my time if it brings attention to others about the way these people handle your money. The sad thing is, I haven&#x27;t even tried the product.  It may be the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my face and I may LOVE it, but b/c of the deceitfulness of the company, I don&#x27;t want it anymore!  They should call it &amp;#34;Deceitful Beauty&amp;#34; instead.</li>
            <li> for those of you who think you have whiteheads caused by Meaningful Beauty products.  It is not  it is Milia and it has to be removed by a dermatologist.  Hard cysts get trapped under the skin.  I have never had such a problem or never had acne or any problem with my skin except that I am aging.  I was hoping this would help.  It has caused such a big problem.  I can&#x27;t even believe it.</li>
            <li> My skin looked very dewy and moisturized, at first. Four days after I began using the products I developed such deep cystic acne that I&#x27;ve been seeing my dermatologist once a week, and it&#x27;s still there! I&#x27;m being put on antibiotics for it tomorrow. I gave Cindy the benefit of the doubt, but her products have terrible ingredients and are not up to the standard she portrays them to be. Very disappointed,</li>
            <li> As with the other reviews, my experience was the same.Ordered a $90.95 package and canceled 2 months in immediately, because i have read all the reviews on pissedconsumer . com and i knew they scam people but my mom wanted these creams!! so what could i do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected just that - the same package on auto-delivery once a month until I canceled. Not so! Their explanation was that I signed up for a $300 package that was parsed out in $90.95 shipments until fulfilled. I have been charged HUNDREDS of dollars after the cancellation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT - I REPEAT - DO NOT sign up for any Meaningful Beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is the product very disappointing - they will charge your account REPEATEDLY even after you cancel.I am on the verge of seeking legal recourse.</li>
            <li> What ever you do make sure you realize that you will be set up AND charged for shipping and auto delivery no matter what you think you are signing up for.&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t think that customer service will do anything for you because you would be wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Sad because I liked the product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have tried many products out there from over-the-counter to department store brands and none compare to these products.  It leaves my skin very soft and smooth and never breaks me out. I love these products!  The cleanser is gentle, yet removes oil, makeup and dirt effectively.  The day cream with SPF and the Creme de Serum are both awesome and I use them everyday. I just ordered the toner and am waiting to try it, however I&#x27;m sure I will like it as well. I&#x27;ve used various other masks and creams but my daily routine is the cleanser, SPF day cream &amp; Creme de Serum. I do understand that everyone&#x27;s skin is different and I dont doubt that many people had a bad experience with these products because I&#x27;ve had the same misfortune with other products out there, they just simply didn&#x27;t work for me... but Meaningful Beauty IS THE BEST... TO ME!</li>
            <li> I started using the meaningful beauty products a week ago &amp; I&#x27;ve already begun seeing very favorable results. I noticed many negative reviews here so wanted to share my positive experience, although the product &amp;#34;promises&amp;#34; great results I feel many people have different skin types thus not every product out there will work for every person. I called the customer care line once to ask about customizing my kit and the lady was pleasantly kind plus helpful. Yes you should know what you&#x27;re getting into when purchasing something but if you read the website you will be informed if not it&#x27;s on you not the company. So for me all experience with the product &amp; its representatives have been great. It comes down to what will work for you.</li>
            <li> I found over the counter products make my skin too thin and I get skin tares.Esp. on my chin.Meaningful Beauty does not seem to do this. I am pleased to find this on the store shelves. I like using it on my nails and cuticles. If I do it twice a day I actually seem to have decent nails.I use the night cream.</li>
            <li> I started using this about 2.5 years ago. No major drastic changes when I first started using it. It did take about 3 weeks for me to notice the difference. Now the lines I have around my eyes and mouth are not as noticeable as they used to be. My skin is really smooth and I rarely ever have a pimple. I would and have told many people to try this out. My mother also uses it and she loves it also.</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t work, that wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, but it caused a rash and itching. Worthless  garbage! Save your money and buy OTC Olay or a similar product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and used 5 days. First time I used the am routine my face was red and looked like I had a sunburn on my face.  After the second day using the neck cream my neck and chest area have a red rash all over i can tell exactly where i applied the product. Now my face is broken out with a rash. I  Called today and cancelled my order and reported this breakout to the customer service. Do not use this product.</li>
            <li> DO NOT order this product unless you are 100% sure you want it and are going to keep it. I ordered this product and changed my mind the very same day, called to cancel and refused to do so, said they had to go through the process and ship it out and charge me. I said I would be returning it, so cancel the payments and future shipments. I returned the product and was charged AGAIN this month and told it is a 4-6 week process to return things. I am sure the next thing that will happen is they will charge me next month and said because it took 4 to 6 wweeks, i didn&#x27;t return the product within the 30 day money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;Also it cost me $20 to ship it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guthy Renker has gotten ridiculous to deal with. I am pissed and extremely unhappy.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the reason I changed my mind, once i got online and read reviews, no one was really happy with the product in terms of getting rid of wrinkles and smoothing out the skin. I mean really I should have known better. just look at Cindy&#x27;s face it doesn&#x27;t even look the same you can tell she has totally botoxed, used fillers etc.,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Made me break out beyond acceptable. Will not use again.  Might be good for someone who isn&#x27;t prone to breakouts</li>
            <li> I see many other people have had bad experiences with this product. I did try it &amp; I have to say I did have no breakouts or redness. I think the product worked for me. It made my face look revitialized,refresh,vibrant &amp; gave me a glow. I thoroughly liked the product &amp; even though I do feel it is alittle over priced I do think it works for me anyway. I&#x27;m sorry many other people are having problems with it but I fortunely have had nothing but good experiences with it.</li>
            <li> This company did not deliver product to me but billed me.  I called and told them and they apologized and said my bill was cleared. Then I got a bill, reminded them, then sent me a bill again, reminded them, sent me a bill with collection notice. Disputed. Called and said they had no record. I asked to be speak with a supervisor and then was put in a wait list with music for an agent then a generic vm. It&#x27;s over $24, and they said they can&#x27;t clear it up. Just sending me to collections.  Products are fair, nothing special. STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST WORKING WITH THIS COMPANY IN MY EXPERIENCE.</li>
            <li> This isnt as much a review, as it is a warning about the ingredients. They contain antifreeze, parabens, lye, and petroleum products. All highly poisonous and caustic. No wonder everyone is breaking out in a rash.</li>
            <li> I signed up for the Meaningful Beauty starter kit, excited to try a new product and hopefully have some help with fine lines around my eyes. I got the product a week or so later and started using it immediately. The face wash might as well be water. It is so thin, I would go to wash my face with it and it just ran off my hand. The glowing serum smells like rotten fruit and the moisturizer was also very thin. I used it for a month and saw no reduction or softening of my fine lines. I find some drugstore brands are better products and much less expensive. They automatically charged my card $48 for the next month. I refused it and then called to cancel the next one. Not worth the money or hassle of dealing with the company.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this!!!!  When you purchase a $40 supply of this you end up automatically signing up for a three month supply that will automatically be billed to your credit card the following month unless you call to cancel.  I was not aware as I did not read the fine print and ended up with an $80 charge a month later.  When I called to inquire I told them to cancel any further billing and they agreed.  What they did not tell me was that the next month I would be billed again, and when I called back they mentioned that they spread the 3 month supply payment over a 3 month period and that I was going to be billed, yet again the following month. The problem with that is that since we agreed to the charge last month, we opened the product and could not return it. I have now paid $200 for something I originally wanted a $40 supply of.  Company is very sneaky and does not tell you.  I lost all the respect I once had for Cindy.</li>
            <li> I tried MB, and so far have really liked the results. I like the way it makes my skin feel. Other regimes, left my skin feeling sticky and gooey, or dry, but this leaves it soft and moist. I haven&#x27;t had any adverse reactions and I have tried everything excpet the &amp;#34;Peel&amp;#34; so far. I use the cleanser in conjunction with my clarisonic to get a good deep cleanse. I don&#x27;t like the autoshipment and was just looking to see if I could manage shipments online when I saw the reviews in Amazon and thought I should chime in. My skin is kinda of sensitve and I have had no issues (not even with the glow serum.) I like the way my skin looks and feels. Worth the shot!</li>
            <li> As I am aging, I decided to give this a try.  I used it for several months--purchased every single product.  My skin has never felt so dry.  I do like the melon serum but that is all.  Plus now, I received another shipment and I canceled months ago.  I even double checked to see that I was canceled.  I no longer have my info so now I will need to try to contact them and send this kit back.  I procrastinated on one kit and they wouldn&#x27;t let me send it back saying it was too old--even tho it had never been opened.  Save your money ladies!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews.  I have been using meaningful beauty for about 1 week.  This morning I was getting ready for work and I have broken out in Ache all over my face which is not normal for me. More upsetting was that when I applied my eye make up I had spots when my eye lashes were broken. I have always been complimented on my long eye lashes and in less that a week the are half the length. I did not put 2 and 2 together until I read that others have had this problem as well</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I was in my 20s then stopped for a few years because I couldn&#x27;t afford it.  Now I won&#x27;t use anything else.  I love all their products except their face wash.  Its not &#x27;&#x27;bad&#x27;&#x27; I just want to spend my money on the anti aging skin care.  I am 34 and I have no wrinkles yet.  I know many women my age or younger that look years older because lack of skin care.  I am not a vain person but I have noticed how young my skin looks now that I&#x27;m getting older.  My skin is young and soft using meaningful beauty.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! I have been using the day and night regiments for about 3 weeks now and my face is flawless. Pores are smaller, less blackheads, softened lines and softer skin. Such a noticeable difference!</li>
            <li> The meaningful beauty system is the same as you can get with any high end drug store cosmetic. Good cosmetics work, but this is over priced, and the customer service at Meaningful Beauty is virtually non-existent; unless of course you are a new customer. We had used these products for about a year, and called to add a few items to our existing automatic shipments; however the company treated this as a full new order and began double shipments...what a mess. After calling to correct this issue, ie..cancel the second shipment; we realized that the folks at Meaningful Beauty were just not going to help us out. We ended up having to cancel completely out of the program, and after returning a shipment they made by mistake we are are yet waiting on them to credit our account. The charge of course is immediate, the correction from my understanding takes 6-8 weeks. Not a company that you should buy direct from, however if you get product separate from a contract on Amazon you may have better luck. As for our purchases we will return to our local cosmetic store, which as I noted provide products that are really just as effective.</li>
            <li> Have mixed thoughts about this product line. I was up very early preparing to travel the day I saw the commercial w/ Valerie Bertinelli and Pablo de Cote. Probably should have had another cup of coffee before I called in my order. I was tired and the two of them looked great and energetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve used Meaningful Beauty for two months now, and here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve noticed. The glow serum gave my skin an oily sheen. That may be good for dry skin or dry parts of the country, but it wasn&#x27;t for me. The mask drys quickly. I don&#x27;t know if that is a good thing or bad. The night cream is heavier than most and not easily absorbed. Your eyes will sting if you get some on your lashes. The day cream has better consistency, but doesn&#x27;t seem to work better than what I used before. In fact, I switched back to my old stuff for a few days because I was developing lines on my forehead. The neck cream is not as effective as what I was using. I&#x27;m still waiting for results on the eye lifting cream, and have started applying it elsewhere just to see if I can get it to show me a visible difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The best thing so far, is the anti-wrinkle liquid in capsules. I use it before I go to bed on weekends to give it more time to \\&quot;work\\&quot;. I can&#x27;t say it did anything for my wrinkles, (I don&#x27;t have many) but it did make my skin feel really smooth and supple. I&#x27;m going to use the product line for another month to give it chance to do what it supposed to do. I&#x27;d advise those of you who want to know if you&#x27;ll get a return on your investment to wait until more people report results.</li>
            <li> I am a previous customer of Meaningful Beauty and i absolutely loved it!!!  I used the products continuously for about 5 years. Then, I had some financial difficulties and stopped the order.&lt;br /&gt;I received so many compliments on my complexion during the time I was using it.  I am sorry I had to stop, but I am coming back!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered a kit online for 59.95 because I wanted to try it out.  I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of it because it has too many different things to put on day and night and I wasn&#x27;t seeing any results. Next thing I know I get another kit in the mail a month later and get charged for it. When I ordered my first kitâ€¦I saw NOTHING about this being on automatic shipment!!! So when I called customer service to cancel I was told that I still owe $90. I asked how is that possible if I&#x27;m canceling my account? They told me because the shipment I just received is a 3 month supplyâ€¦they charge me in 3 month increments.  SUCH BS!!! I&#x27;m so mad right now!!!!! Not to mention the customer service lady was rude and a smart ass! DON&#x27;T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Tried this after watching infomercial. Saw absolutely no results. Might as well spend money on drug store products and get better result. Cindy Crawford should be ashamed of herself. Wonder what they paid her to say she uses this product. No way do I believe it!</li>
            <li> My grandmother gave me a kit as a gift, and I have been using it for several weeks now. My skin is insanely sensitive to certain cleansers if they are drying. I have had no trouble with this at all. My skin actually feels smooth, which is a new concept for me. I will say that I did break out a little after I first started using it, but it cleared up in a couple of days, and now my skin is nearly void of blemishes. Some of these products have hyaluronic acid which is a alpha hydroxy, which does cause cause blemishes until your skin gets used to it. I will note, I am not allergic to melons. If you have an allergy to Melons, you may not want to use these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, if you try this product, and find that you break out, please realize it is most likely a temporary fixture.</li>
            <li> Shame, on Cindy Crawford for endorsing this product and scamming so many people out of their hard earned money, only to benefit herself.  Glad I didn&#x27;t order and will never ever believe anything Cindy Crawford endorses!</li>
            <li> I have never purchased this product. I was considering it...until I read these reviews! Oh my. Sounds like a major flop. The infomercial is so convincing. I will NOT be ordering this after what I have read. Cindy Crawford sounds more like she took a bite out of a lying sack of s*** melon. I have acne and wrinkles now. I don&#x27;t need a rash and psoriasis to accompany it. I&#x27;m feel badly for everyone who has ordered this. Truly. No thanks Dr. Melon. I&#x27;ll pass.</li>
            <li> It is not bad at all, made my skin smooth and I noticed my pores looked smaller and my face looked more hyrdated. I usually break out but had no issues with this. The eye cream did burn for a few days which was odd but after a few days that stopped, don&#x27;t know why.  I had to use it for over a month to see results though on my skin, I see smoother skin but I can&#x27;t say its the best or works wonders, I would however use again with another line of skin care.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.  Absolutely no difference in skin.  Eye;lift cream? No way it works.  Just another celebrity trying to make $$ .  Use Retin A and a good exfoliator on dark spots, takes some time but it does work. You can&#x27;t get rid of wrinkles with creams or serums, maybe skin tone will look better, but cosmetic surgery removes wrinkles, not creams.  Waste of $$...when I tried to cancel was told the order already was shipped ( it wasn&#x27;t) and I would need to return it myself and no credit for shipping.  It arrived and I did not accept it, their problem for sending a second order in the first place after I HAD already cancelled.  Agent was very pushy and wanted to send other products for free, no thank you</li>
            <li> It really should be called &amp;#34;Meaningless Rip Off&amp;#34;. Go look at the reviews for Aveeno&#x27;s skin care line. Go to the local drug store and spend a fraction of the cost on Aveeno and be happy. This garbage made me break out like crazy. I wanted to like it, I tried to like it. Creme Serum was OK but the rest of the line was like spreading crisco on my face (which I could have done for pennies on the dollar) If you are going to get bedazzled over a celebrity&#x27;s skin, look at Jennifer Anniston. Aveeno cleared my face up after this stuff. And I am a fifty + post menopausal and I broke out like a teenager. Sadly it didn&#x27;t make the wrinkles go away like a teen. Don&#x27;t do it!</li>
            <li> I received these products about 6 weeks ago. I have used all of them and just ordered more. I have very sensitive skin but have never gotten a rash or anything but amazing results. I had a few spots on my face that I didn&#x27;t like and they have almost gone away completely. I love the way the facial cleanser cleans my face. It feels very clean afterwards. I have used the masque with great results. It has little exfoliating beads in it and it scrubbed my face gently during application. The masque felt great and washed right off with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the neck and chest cream too. My chest has not looked this clear in years. I am so pleased with these products that I can&#x27;t say enough about how good they are and how well I like them.  I will continue using Meaningful Beauty for years to come.</li>
            <li> I tried MB 5 years ago. After 3 days I woke up to find giant red patches akin all over my face. Felt like I was being burned with an iron. A trip to the dermatologist landed me with a histamine shot and a $200 prescription for medicated cream to cure a full blown allergic reaction to the melon extract. But the good news was they cancelled my sub. No hassle. But I had a doctor backing me up too. Lol.</li>
            <li> I wanted to post this review because i was surprised by all of the negative reviews. I did a lot of researching and reading up on this product before I purchased it but decided to take a chance. I&#x27;ve always had beautiful skin but when I turned 26 things changed and I developed red irritated skin on my cheeks and my skin with acne. I am 30 now and between 26 and 28 my skin progressively got worse and I have no idea why. I changed all of my make up, shampoo, face care products etc. thinking i had developed an allergy but nothing helped. I have extremely sensitive skin and even the most expensive products that were hypoallergenic didn&#x27;t work. I tried this product because I figured I had nothing to loose and within a month my skin started to clear up and now at 30 I have been using it for about 2 years and my skin is the best it&#x27;s been. I never have acne, I never have dry skin and there are many days I don&#x27;t put makeup on. I guess everyone reacts differently to products so my advice would be to give it a chance because if you have results like I did, you will be very happy. I have to say though I tried then Wen hair care system and hated it. So there you go.</li>
