            <li>I saw on the Today show on NBC quite some time ago that this moisturizer is as good at the leading salon products</li>
            <li>It is good for skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many moisturizers and many brands, and this is one of the best.</li>

            <li>Great product; love the applicator.</li>
            <li>she is much more happy with the Regenerist line that any others.  </li>

            <li>love this creamy lotion that relieves the tightness of my skin!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>And, I love the smell!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an Oil of Olay user for many, many years (learned from my grandmother who had beautiful skin at 90), and have just begun trying the Regenerist products.  </li>
            <li>The scent is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have tried others but returned to this one because of the creaminess and light feeling and it makes my skin feel great.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to try and hydrate my skin( I have Psoriasis) and its amazing how it helps hydrate my skin.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, but this moisturizer is amazing.</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t have one wrinkle , they do amazing products...</li>
            <li>i do not wear face makeup and this leaves my skin looking great and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great under my light makeup.</li>
            <li>I think we all should be honest about our review so we can help others.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice moisturizer</li>
            <li>Great product - best price after searching the entire internet!  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li>I could immediately notice my face looking brighter and my skin feeling nicely moisturized.</li>
            <li>Many people keep saying how good my skin looks</li>
            <li>The texture is nice.</li>
            <li>she is happy with her looks, it adds confidence and makes life more enjoyable for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one really works, amazing!!!</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I am seeing the results....</li>
            <li>I love Olay products and again this is one more great one.  </li>
            <li>I often get compliments asking what kind of cream I use.  </li>
            <li>it goes nicely under my make up too</li>
            <li>I honestly and truly see a difference in my skin</li>
            <li>This also has a really pleasant scent, although it&#x27;s a bit strong until you get used to it.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>It will have your makeup stay on all day which is great, but for oily-skinned people like me, it will make your face oily quickly if put under foundation.</li>
            <li>This goes on easily and feels good.</li>
            <li>maybe not that much anti-aging, but it does a dang good job at keeping my wife happy and that makes me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is excellent - very soft on my skin.</li>
            <li>Rich with nice fragrance!</li>
            <li>The more you use it the more it starts melting years off!</li>
            <li>I tried this one and found that it has a nice texture that is easily absorbed and feels very nice, But it has a very strong perfume that I find unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, it&#x27;s a cheaply made  product with fillers that aren&#x27;t good for your skin.</li>
            <li>but sure is nice to not have alot of winkles...</li>
            <li>Old formula was the best there was!  </li>
            <li>This product is great and easily absorbed by skin.</li>
            <li>This is the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li>quite enjoy the &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish of this product after application, and this works very nice if you need to put more layers on top of that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!</li>
            <li>When I first applied the cream, my skin felt great - velvety and well-protected.  </li>
            <li>On their website Olay says the cream will improve the look of fine lines in just 10 minutes!</li>
            <li>I like it better than the Age Defying line.</li>
            <li>However, I came back with this one because I realized this moisturizer was the best!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t reorder ok product</li>
            <li>The feel of you skin even better.</li>
            <li>I order 2 at a time to make sure I always have some on hand,</li>
            <li>I would love to have it replaced.  </li>
            <li>I use to love this.  </li>
            <li>and I have been the most satisfied with the texture and results from Oil of Olay Regenerist Cream.</li>
            <li>it was ok</li>
            <li>:) I guess the guy who moisturizes makes up for the woman who doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, after using Olay Perfecting Cream, for just one month I&#x27;ve received so many compliments from friends and strangers on how \\&quot;radiant\\&quot; and \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; my skin is.</li>
            <li>I love Olay products.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It felt smoother and more moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Had never used it, but decided to try it, LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with this order.</li>
            <li>and I always had problems to find an appropriate cream.</li>
            <li>Some moisturizers sit on top of the skin and leave you shiny.</li>
            <li>The fragrance can be overwhelming to some people, but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is still my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Much better.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many a serum, potion, lotion, cream...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff...</li>
            <li>I love this cream because it does not leave your face greasy.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I found that this one had a much better effect.</li>
            <li>It was ok, but i wanted to try somehting that brightenes and freshens my face</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for 2 months now and I am totally satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this daily for a year now and my skin looks great!  </li>
            <li>It works as it should; no miracles come this cheaply!</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and light also.</li>
            <li>I love Olay -</li>
            <li>Love, love, love.</li>
            <li>To see the results I have to use it more.</li>

            <li>I love any of the Olay products.  </li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love anything Olay.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if this will produce great results but the product smells nice and is not heavy.</li>

            <li>Fast delivery, great product.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any skincare product, but I sure have to this one.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND WILL REORDER AGAIN AND AGAIN.  </li>

            <li>it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and the density of the moisturizer, and it&#x27;s not oily.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion I use it every morning and night</li>
            <li>and I have never been more horrifed.</li>
            <li>Mostly when I woke up in the morning.</li>
            <li>I was not wearing makeup on top of it, so it had to be the cream.  </li>
            <li>wish Olay would drop that ingredient because otherwise I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love, love the Regenerist line</li>
            <li>I also love the way you just press the top and the lotion/cream comes out....</li>
            <li>in that way almost works as a primer and makes makeup-less faces look better  :)</li>
            <li>so have avoided this type of product that seemed to be more chemical-based.  </li>
            <li>I love it on my skin.</li>
            <li>This product is too fragrant and too many ingredients I cannot pronounce.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have too many</li>
            <li>if you happen to order from them, just make sure their products have a safety seal on the lids.</li>
            <li>this again is a lovely product for my wifes moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for a moisturizer but doesn&#x27;t do anything to help with wrinkles</li>
            <li>love it for years now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many moisturizers but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Better then some moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>(and I use it from time to time as well) and we both love it.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love this product ...  </li>
            <li>but my lovely bride likes it.  </li>
            <li>Price is better on Amazon than anyplace else</li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>Use it sparingly and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely, too.</li>
            <li>I used to love this product, but the formula change does not work for me.</li>
            <li>My favorite night time cream</li>
            <li>You gotta love Olay products.</li>
            <li>I always love Oil of Olay</li>
            <li>But I love, love, love the way my face feels after putting it on.</li>
            <li>I was a bit worried when I bought this the first time that it would break me out (as most moisturizers do), but surprisingly, it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Light weight and suitable for night and day.</li>
            <li>For 93, she looks pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>Definitely wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Olay, please bring back the original!!!!</li>
            <li>More importantly, as I have tried tons of products, it has reduced my under eye circles.</li>
            <li>At first, I was delighted with how smooth and moisturized my skin was.</li>
            <li>I love that it makes my skin feel silky smooth not oily.</li>
            <li>I get its becoming drier.  </li>
            <li>If you love smooth skin</li>
            <li>She looks younger and more beautiful than you can imagine.  </li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have paid full price for it!  </li>
            <li>Easy to order using prime</li>
            <li>Great lotion and leaves my face feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am tossing this product immediately and strongly recommend that you do NOT buy it under any circumstances.</li>
            <li>The perfume in this product was so strong that I had to return it.  </li>
            <li>First of all the smell is too strong, nice but too strong for the face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased, it really does work.</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me - I tried it and was delighted - nice thick cream that goes in well, is not oily and does not shine, but FEELS good in the skin.  </li>
            <li>I sure wish I&#x27;d read these reviews before I purchased the cream, although because my skin is not sensitive I probably would have felt that my skin wouldn&#x27;t have the break-out reactions experienced by others.  </li>
            <li>My fine lines started to diminish the day after I started using this, and my skin feels hydrated.</li>
            <li>I was specifically looking for something like this and this works out just fine.</li>
            <li>If fragrances don&#x27;t irritate your skin, you may be fine, but I&#x27;d look at purchasing another product if you&#x27;re prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>Softens fine lines and truly nourishes skin.</li>
            <li>it;s super hydrating, not greasy and love the skin</li>
            <li>Even the mild scent is pleasing!</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a more economical product and something I could easily purchase at a drug store if needed.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m a senior, so I enjoy using it for fine line correction and eye makeup removal.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, soaks in quickly, and seems to be working well!</li>
            <li>The product felt wonderful on my face and neck, but I noticed it smelled a little &amp;#34;too&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This is the second time I am purchasing this type of cream, the first was very good hydrating and effective but this one is very very perfumed and it is in fact drying out the skin.</li>
            <li>It is light to the touch.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I am not as happy with that product and am switching back to this one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and works well without ever giving that \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feeling.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for people who are starting to realize their skin is looking not quite as it once did and want to do something about it.</li>
            <li>- I wear it when I go to the gym as I feel it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>What a great commercial that would be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A light moisture and does the job</li>
            <li>so I use it primarily for that, rather than anti-aging.</li>
            <li>Screw on lid would be much more convent and economical (for the customer).</li>
            <li>Moisturizes your skin and makes it smooth.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re young-get a life &amp; enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to friends as it was light</li>
            <li>About the “Advanced Anti-Aging” part, there are peptides in it to speed up the production of collagen.</li>
            <li>and it would go on smooth and</li>
            <li>wish they have this product in fragrance free form as well</li>
            <li>so I buy the fragrance free style.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, and lasts through my day.  </li>
            <li>It provides a smooth surface on which to apply my foundation.  </li>
            <li>I was very nicely surprised to see how good Olay Regenerist is for my complexion.</li>
            <li>I do like this product but can not say \\&quot;I love it\\&quot; because I am constantly looking for a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied ,my face got even worse,went to Ulta ,starting using dermalogica , very Happy!</li>
            <li>Good product, but you can spend the same amount of money and buy a better moisturizer that&#x27;s non comedogenic and has an SPF.</li>
            <li>Also, love the dispenser -- dispenses just the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry</li>
            <li>It is a very nice basic moisturizer</li>
            <li>I am only happy that I did not pay full price.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly allowing for easy application of mineral foundation.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the skin feeling very soft without feeling greasy and seems to smooth out the skin nicely.</li>
            <li>It is worth a try!</li>
            <li>The texture is unique and it is not sticky or oily on my skin.</li>
            <li>I thought it was just a variation of the original one and kept looking for the original but can&#x27;t find it anymore.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been waiting for this package to arrive and was so excited to find it at my front door.  </li>
            <li>Softens with a rich deepness to it and renews skin surface.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more expensive lotions and creams on my face, but I really love this one the best.  </li>
            <li>There was a significant difference in weight when holding them in each hand.....</li>
            <li>Try this new one at your own risk.</li>
            <li>For the money and the quality, this is by far the best facial cream yet!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>This was nothing special.</li>
            <li>I find myself returning to the tried and true products which have stood the test of time.  </li>
            <li>It also helps to use a good facial cleanser, (Olay&#x27;s Regenerist line has one), and a toner to restore the skin&#x27;s pH balance.</li>
            <li>A good toner, (again, Olay has one), will remove any residual oil and cleanser from facial skin.</li>
            <li>Good facial moisturerizer year around</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t afford to buy $50.00 moisturizers; I am a retired 68 year old senior living on restricted budget; however I do care to look nice.  </li>
            <li>The most important thing for anyone to be aware of when first trying this product is that you have to be patient for results.</li>
            <li>I have used this wonderful moisturizer for years and never had a complaint.</li>
            <li>I researched all of the skin creams available at the big box retailer that is the only shopping option in this town, and this one had the best reviews, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>and there is a tremendous improvement in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>Oil of Olay Total Effects and Regenerist facial moisturizers are the best!</li>
            <li>Received quickly and painless purchasing at my desk.  </li>
            <li>Love the cream, love the dispenser, but don&#x27;t love how little cream is in the jar.</li>
            <li>I found a new favorite.  </li>
            <li>and I never had a problem, but this new version has more fragrance and is thicker, and</li>
            <li>Now im back at it and already love the results!  </li>
            <li>It really works!!  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t even look real!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, all previous reviews are probably for the old and awesome formula.  </li>
            <li>I bought it specifically to moisturize my dry skin and all I got was a strong face perfume (it has a very strong smell).</li>
            <li>Love it, quick ship and works better than the other Olay products I have bought.</li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing, my skin show improvement the very next morning after using it.</li>
            <li>Face is very silky smooth after use.</li>
            <li>Helps with the laugh lines, etc.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it work but it smells so nicely too.  </li>
            <li>and I fell my skin more soft.  </li>
            <li>Forever Young :)</li>
            <li>Not greasy feeling, economical to use.  </li>
            <li>cream is okay as far as moisturizers</li>
            <li>should get the Golden Cocoon Award.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s no avoiding that it works much better than the all natural products I&#x27;ve used for years.  </li>
            <li>It is such a nice weight moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I stuck with it anyway, mostly because I ran out of all of my other creams and did not have the funds to purchaes more.</li>
            <li>very strong cream for mature skin , not for under make up as it will break it up fast..</li>
            <li>i noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>Right away putting it on you can see a difference</li>
            <li>Renew Daily Regenerating Moisture Cream, which I don&#x27;t think really improves my skin&#x27;s appearance but does hydrate well and makes my skin very comfortable!</li>
            <li>skin tone are more even, more moist and less oily.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product, it works tremendously well and keeps me looking younger!!!</li>
            <li>Now, I have tried using Olay Regenerist and it proves to be better than Total Effects.  </li>
            <li>For a decade and a half I loved it.  </li>
            <li>and the price was great, but the last one I bought was different.  </li>
            <li>I have never used Olay products before, and am thrilled to find these results at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Its rich, non-greasy formula instantly softens the look of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Amino-peptide plus</li>
            <li>Its rich, non-greasy formula instantly softens the look of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Amino-peptide plus</li>
            <li>Soaks in, good product, small amount comes out when you push the top, so no waste or contamination.</li>
            <li>My mother like it very much.</li>
            <li>Either bring back the original fragrance, or do a fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I used this for many years and loved it, but they changed the formula in 2013 and this new and improved version made my face hot, dry, red and irritated after three days of use.</li>
            <li>a little spensivebut i love this products let my skim soff and my husband love to thanks&#x27;</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer, especially at this price.  </li>
            <li>After having read about it in Consumer&#x27;s Report, I tried Olay&#x27;s Regenerist Perfecting Cream for the first time.  </li>
            <li>and they both keep my face smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>and the price is better then the actual store prices</li>
            <li>I gotten better results from cheaper &amp; lesser known-name products.</li>
            <li>Olay Regenerist deep hydration regenerating cream facial moisturizer really works great on my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m 33 and my skin isn&#x27;t exactly what it used to be</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and tried this one out first.  </li>
            <li>It always leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>A SMOOTHER, MORE YOUTHFUL LOOKING FACE, AND AMAZON FOR MAKING IT POSSIBLE!!</li>
            <li>I have been using it since it first came out.</li>
            <li>That might be thanks to Olay!</li>
            <li>recently tried &amp;#34;Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream&amp;#34; and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for over 3 months, maybe the skin start getting use to it, so it doesn&#x27;t show big difference any more.</li>
            <li>It is not the true product I normally get in the store.</li>
            <li>Love it and just purchased 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll also reduce the formation of lines over time, if you use it consistently.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others, some way more expensive, but have found that Olay does a better job at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Olay!</li>
            <li>Thinking the cause couldn&#x27;t possibly be Olay, I used it two more times, each time exacerbating the problem.  </li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>That was my first clue that it was working(1-2 months into using it</li>
            <li>I could see a difference within the first week.</li>
            <li>I have used Olay Regeneris products for several years and been pleased.</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m back to the Regenerist Night Recovery treatment, which is a much better choice for me.</li>
            <li>Had purchased this cream from the grocery store several times and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>I took a break from using this product and could really see a difference in my skin!  </li>
            <li>I have been using this since it first came out and swear by it.</li>
            <li>I used to love this face moisturizer, in fact, it was my only go-to.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Aunt Martha!</li>
            <li>It gives good moisture without being too heavy.</li>
            <li>I have the dry skin type, so this soft cream is very suitable for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick but absorbs pretty quickly and leaves my skin feeling good.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;regeneration&amp;#34; of new skin constantly is what makes it effective.</li>
            <li>This works great on my dry skin, I use it 1-2 times daily.</li>
            <li>, did not irritate my sensitive skin, was non-greasy, did not cause break-outs, didn&#x27;t have a strong scent and worked very well under make-up.</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal customer for years, but now will have to find a new mousturizer.</li>
            <li>I have used many facial products including very pricey products and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>I would touch my face during the day and think how smooth and soft it felt, unusually so.  </li>
            <li>This product was touted to be such a superior facial cream.  </li>
            <li>As good as more expensive products</li>
            <li>My skin is dry and flaky in my T-zone (forehead, nose)in the winter, and this lotion penetrates deeply with just the right thickness to absorb quickly and be effective.</li>
            <li>I switched to this product after positive reviews on the Olay Regenerist line.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much for a product that helps!</li>
            <li>Seems to be ok as long as it stays below my cheek bone.  </li>
            <li>The description did say the BOX could have some minor cosmetic details.. which it surely did.....</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that after using this for a full month that an age spot that I had under my eye is almost completely faded.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I tried the Regenerist Advanced Deep Hydration Cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Within 48 hours, my skin began looking more normal with only a bit of lingering redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used it for 3 days only, just so strong</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other stuff, including male-targeted moisturizers as well as other, shall we say, non-male targeted ones, but this particular one has worked, by far, the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works....</li>
            <li>It goes on really silky</li>
            <li>I also use the Regenereist eye lifting serum and it really does lift the eye area.</li>
            <li>This product did not feel very moisturizing, but it made me break out.</li>
            <li>I settled on this product, when I couldn&#x27;t find a cheap Jojoba or Vit E. Oil at a local drug store.</li>
            <li>really well how much you want to use.&lt;br /&gt;The system of the dispenser protect the cream of not being contaminated, because it never expose the cream to the contact of the hand or air.</li>
            <li>Burned my face,under one eye is very red,skin on side of my face is peeling away to another layer.</li>
            <li>I can feel the intense hydration without it being oily or watery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really am looking 4ward 2 getting b4 or just when I need it again.</li>
            <li>She applies it every day, and the cost is also reasonable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I really like this face cream.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>My face feel fresh and soft.</li>
            <li>so this really scared me.</li>
            <li>Who knows where it has been or how much was used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended by a very picky skin care product user!!&lt;br /&gt;JANAal anti-aging power of moisture fused with vitamins and antioxidants.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended by a very picky skin care product user!!&lt;br /&gt;JANA</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really itch</li>
            <li>and I used to have acne and very oily complexion.</li>
            <li>The cream has a much stronger fragrance and seems to leave a coating on my skin.  </li>
            <li>, I really thought I could be with Oil of Olay</li>
            <li>Alas, I&#x27;ll continue my search for a great lotion.</li>
            <li>I just opened today, the bottle was empty, after pumping many time</li>
            <li>She had lost over 25 pounds since living with us, and much of the hanging skin under her chin is gone.</li>
            <li>It really made a difference in a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>I read a dermatologist recommend trying Olay as they spend much $$$ on research so deliver quality products.  </li>
            <li>but it really works.</li>
            <li>I really like the way the cream is dispensed.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>Real product.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>perfumed, which I could do without, but the product works very well.</li>
            <li>It really hydrates well.</li>
            <li>BUT MUCH CHEAPER.  </li>
            <li>I really like the consistency.</li>
            <li>It ads so much moisture to your skin/face without looking shiny.  </li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to incorporate the whole regenerist line into my routine.</li>
            <li>I am very disatisified with this product.  </li>
            <li>This was very lightweight and nongreasy.</li>
            <li>I just put it in the cabinet straight out of the box when my subscribe and save shipment gets here, so I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li>Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>I really like the way this makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>So, I have to be very mindful of where I apply it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for year and it has really made a difference.  </li>
            <li>and I really like how these feels on my face</li>
            <li>I like it so much.</li>
            <li>Does a great job moisturizing, but leaves traces behind, which turn into itsy bitsy crumbs when applying my makeup with the sponge.</li>
            <li>moisturizer hydrates very well.&lt;br /&gt;-Smells</li>
            <li>This is fantastic and makes the skin look lighter/bright and younger...</li>
            <li>but I really REALLY like it.  </li>
            <li>After 3 coats of this I still had skin so flaky it was very visible.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I still love Olay, but I would say you should be careful with this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>Have only used for about a week;  no miracles so far, :),</li>
            <li>For many years I used another brand for my skin, I have dry skin and the older</li>
            <li>Much better than a lot of the really expensive creams that do not feel nearly as nice.</li>
            <li>I went back to my Nature&#x27;s Gate herbal moisturizer which seems to work better than anything I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>love the pre-measured dispenser top, and that this does not have an SPF (I find them irritating) or fragrance.</li>
            <li>The cream is very nice, the skin is very delicate, the texture of the skin smoother.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t cause acne or blemishes to form, so for that I&#x27;m grateful as many other products do.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I feel it sits on top of my skin longer than the other one does</li>
            <li>It is a nice, creamy, rich moisturizer, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>My face has been a bit more active on the break outs</li>
            <li>My skin is a lot more evenly toned, brighter looking, and the dark circles under my eyes are lightening.</li>
            <li>This is better than nothing, but only as a good moisturizer and an expensive one at that, but as for wrinkles and blemishes.....</li>
            <li>This is my new moisture cream!</li>
            <li>Ths works so well on my dry skin and the price was really good compared to every other place I checked.</li>
            <li>I use it as night cream and wake up with soft and smooth skin after only 2-3 days of use.</li>
            <li>I use this product regularly, bt nt always able 2 get out 2 buy local.</li>
            <li>I have canceled my subscription and will be checking the shelves in stores to see if I can find any of the older product.  </li>
            <li>It is not to heavy and is gentle on the face - My face already feels better.</li>
            <li>Great basic skin cream that appears to do no harm on sensitive skin - moisturizers without an oil slick</li>
            <li>still highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Every prodduct Olay makes gets high marks up against the products that are twice the price.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for all.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin &amp; only have an occasional pimple, but after a week of using this, my face is full of intense breakouts that professionals cannot calm.</li>
            <li>I am a long-time user of the all natural type of moisturizers (like Kiss your face, Jasons, pure aloe, etc)</li>
            <li>You will see a big difference after the first use!</li>
            <li>It leaves the rough skin smooth any hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Keeps your skin soft, doesn&#x27;t do much for wrinkles</li>
            <li>It is very creamy and has a soft sent.  </li>
            <li>I am sad because it was a great cream</li>
            <li>I have to try it a few more times and see the results.</li>
            <li>The Regenerist in the round bottle that depenses from the top.</li>
            <li>I used it for a few days and didn&#x27;t notice any hydration more than normal.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about trying this new lotion because my skin has been a bit dry.</li>
            <li>I do notice that it makes my face a bit more pale when I put it on</li>
            <li>i use it sometimes for the night , also for my top hand , it make wonder overnight , if you have a very dry skin with some deep lines , it is for you..</li>
            <li>I got a free sample somewhere or other</li>
            <li>This is a nice, hydrating moisturizer, but the jar design doesn&#x27;t work you to see how little product is actually inside.  </li>
            <li>I mistakenly understood that this product was a new, never opened bottle...</li>
            <li>On the packaging of this one it says new and improved formula.</li>
            <li>Being new to Olay I thought I would try a number of products to find what works for my skin.</li>
            <li>I saw the label: New Formula.  </li>
            <li>And I have two bottles of these new formula that I hate...sigh.</li>
            <li>If you live alone, just have it gift packaged - they&#x27;ll never know it&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li>The description said it was NEW</li>
            <li>I am not convinced it is a good foundation under make up because it seems that my make up does not stay on as well as it did with my previous (and more expensive) moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re my age, try a product with a less strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>And my skin looks and feels so very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive with a tendency to rosacea</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very sensitive to scent and can&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling and looking very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin which gets a lot of redness with products.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t absorb as well as before, and tends to sit on the top of my skin to the point that it creates almost a film which gets gummy when I apply make up (and I use very little make up).</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, skip this cream!</li>
            <li>You will be HAPPILY surprised with the results, give it a try!</li>
            <li>This is no small feat.</li>
            <li>so I did a search for it and was pleasantly surprised to find it!  </li>
            <li>I am 60 yrs old and have no noticeable wrinkles !</li>
            <li>The morning after I applied the product for the first time, my face was very red.</li>
            <li>I have even been using Olay Touch of Sun daily moisturizer for months with no ill effects.</li>
            <li>It is worth trying and the price is reasonable compared to other products.</li>
            <li>Never really had any pimples present until I used this product more frequently.</li>
            <li>been using this product for a number of years, and it leaves my face feeling so soft!  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve never spent so much on lotion before, esp.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and I can use this lotion twice a day with no oily spots or breakouts!</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, just a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Despite &amp;#34;wanting&amp;#34; to go back to my more expensive natural creams, I like this better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin smooth and wrinkles less noticeable</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and smoothly, no oily or greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>Made my skin appear more oilly the an normal and felt thick.</li>
            <li>but its like all other moisturizer i guess nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>I ended up trashing a full bottle due to breakout and a bit of a rash developing on my cheek.</li>
            <li>Thankfully I only had to be out in public for the morning because this afternoon my foundation is so patchy and looks like it flaking off, while still looking super greasy.</li>
            <li>I really prefer the old formula, this new one doesn&#x27;t have that same silky feel on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30s and wanted to start using something for anti-aging and wrinkle control, and I have incredibly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>One pump is usually enough for my whole face.</li>
            <li>After applying it at night, I awoke to soft, glowing skin.</li>
            <li>Before, I was using Olay Total Effects for years because my face loves the product so much.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t work well on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I know this works for others but not for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>, he looks like he&#x27;s in his early 30&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 34 years old, and I have been using skin care products since I was 16 ranging from Lancome, Clinique, Guinot, Clarins and Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li>The pictures here are of the old product, old formula.</li>
            <li>I wear it at night and my skin wakes up soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I am a frequent customer of Amazon</li>
            <li>Now I am 47, and I still look young.</li>
            <li>I suggest you do a patch test for a couple days before putting it completely on your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This fast-absorbing deep regenerating cream really does hydrate one&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>Two weeks I&#x27;ve been searching for the old formula without luck.  </li>
            <li>I bought this moisturizer for my 93 year old mother.</li>
            <li>, I would prefer a jar and not this pumping action.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft.  </li>
            <li>My skin has improved so much during the last two weeks.</li>
            <li>Keep my face young looking and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft all the time.</li>
            <li>I also need something that will work that doesn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft.</li>
            <li>It goes on silky smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>And within a week or so of starting to use it, my skin felt so much softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li>This is the product sloughing off old skin.</li>
            <li>and I am usually sensitive to perfumes; this one does not seem to bother me</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and supple~  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and use hypoallergenic</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the whole Olay Regenerist line for the last 10 years or so.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m frequently mistaken for 53, instead of the 63 that I am.  </li>
            <li>I like the scent of it (it is NOT unscented) and the texture is soft.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive, be warned.</li>
            <li>Would you believe this was recommended to me by my 95 year old aunt, who has used it forever and still has skin that glows?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not to mention amazon&#x27;s price thus far has been the cheapest I have found it (unless you can come across a coupon somewhere).</li>
            <li>Going back to my Estee Lauder Day Wear which is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I was delighted to find it so inexpensive on Amazon.</li>
            <li>At first I was only using the exfoliating cleanser with this moisturizer, but that turned out to be too much for my skin as it was getting dry, so I now rotate between the \\&quot;micro-purifying\\&quot; cleanser and the exfoliating one.</li>
            <li>Thick and creamy, very rich.</li>
            <li>Not only does it hydrate deeply, it&#x27;s made my skin look better in other ways, as well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super oily but dry and flaky at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I called the company and they are sending me coupons for $26 worth of their other products, which I do also use.</li>
            <li>She was very overweight when she came to live with us and had a lot of loose skin under her chin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comparable to the ridiculously priced department store brands at a much better price.</li>
            <li>Now that I am getting older, I have moved on to the next level in hydration.  </li>
            <li>Rated #1 with consumer reports above all the high priced lotions &amp; potions</li>
            <li>I tried many other brands but kept coming back to Olay - because I have really dry skin.</li>
            <li>after the first use you can experience rolling of your skin down, as it remove the death cells and help regenerate new one faster , using Olay for over 20 years</li>
            <li>apparently something I&#x27;m too sensitive for.</li>
            <li>However my most recent purchase has been a completely different experience,  The outside packaging looks the same, but there are minor changes to the bottle.  </li>
            <li>This package came in pretty rough condition.</li>
            <li>at first I thought that I had just purchased another run of the mill, empty promises, face cream.</li>
            <li>Do make sure to use a mirror though, if you miss rubbing any in completely you get thick white streaks.</li>
            <li>Have been using regenerist products for a very long time however, this product caused a rash on my cheeks and an intense burning feeling.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have especially sensitive skin, but it is dry.</li>
            <li>This Advanced Anti-Aging Deep moisture coats my skin with a silicone like layer, which after a few minutes starts peeling off and looks like I have eraser dust allover my face.  </li>
            <li>It does not absorb and sits on top, leaving a filmy and somewhat sticky white residue on my skin that slowly clumped up and felt like it peeled away over the course of the day.  </li>
            <li>If I were more vain, I would have been sending my husband on an emergency run to the drug store, but I just hate to pay drug store prices after so many years of subscribe and save on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I used it two weeks, and suddenly nothing more came out of the strange little pump.  </li>
            <li>I use the Regenerist cleansers as well, and I haven&#x27;t had any major acne breakouts since then.</li>
            <li>I use no other cream.</li>
            <li>Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Sunscreen SPF15 Olay Regenerist helps regenerate your skin&#x27;s appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Niacinamide</li>
            <li>Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Sunscreen SPF15 Olay Regenerist helps regenerate your skin&#x27;s appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Niacinamide</li>
            <li>Sure enough my entire face and neck were covered with little red bumps.</li>
            <li>go.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is not very pleasant but fortunately dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again?</li>
            <li>It is now super greasy and scented and putting make-up on top of this this morning was almost impossible.</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;m a little bit of a special case with my crazily sensitive, flaky dry, eczema-inflamed  skin</li>
            <li>Astringents, which are generally alcohol-based, tighten the skin and pores and remove oil.</li>
            <li>This noticeably reduces them and just generally firms my skin.  </li>
            <li>so far i cant write much only been using for 2 weeks continue.</li>
            <li>Recently my 24 year old son took me out for coffee</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and found that this product was the only one that worked for me.  </li>
            <li>I just cut the bottle open and spatula it into an old moisturizer jar that I&#x27;ve cleaned out.</li>
            <li>I was using Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>I like it so far - only using it a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>I took some Claritin and quit using the cream, my skin was pretty much back to normal after a few days.</li>
            <li>Withing minutes your skin feels so soft and the tiny lines look softer!  </li>
            <li>ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li>I barely use concealer</li>
            <li>I love to share my secret:</li>
            <li>I have super dark blue, very hollow/sunken-in circles that, even with cover up, are still dark and shadowed because they are sunk in.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, so I am very careful with new products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one that seems to really work and combat my dry skin.</li>
            <li>The things I don&#x27;t like are how expensive it is and not that impressed with the weird pump up design, if you get too much, you can&#x27;t put the pricey stuff back.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for anyone with very dry skin at any age.  </li>
            <li>I have NEVER had sensitive skin and have tried well over 100 different skin care creams, serums and treatments in the last 15 or so years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Olay products all my adult life and was skeptical on paying more for a \\&quot;regenerating\\&quot; product.  </li>
            <li>It sinks in as fast as an expensive moisturizer, and it has a very light fragrance.</li>
            <li>But now I can see dramatic differences, my reddish spots disapeared, my dark circles are much lighter, the fine lines around my eyes are smoothing out, my lumpy forehead that I was beginning to dispise is soft and youthfull again, and the scaly dryness from living in Colorado is gone.</li>
            <li>The cap, the dispenser, and ugh, there is so much product left when you think it&#x27;s empty!</li>
            <li>So glad I read all the other negative reviews before attempting to use this.  </li>
            <li>I live in New England where the harsh winters wreck havoc on our skins.</li>
            <li>A few weeks after a milestone birthday this winter, my previously oily acne prone skin became dry , flaky and I noticed a very fine line on my left cheek.</li>
            <li>I am 30yo, and have mildly dry, but not problematic or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have long nails and was tired of scooping cream out of a jar only to end up with most of it under my finger nail.  </li>
            <li>So far, this one is working, especially since the air is so dry, with the heat on.  </li>
            <li>After about a month&#x27;s consistent use, I noticed my cheeks became increasingly reddened and rough but thought that was due to</li>
            <li>I am in my early 50&#x27;s and have always had very dry skin, so it&#x27;s tricky to find a moisturizer that works for me to the point where I only use night creams.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m starting to see the little lines and wrinkles that no woman wants to see.  </li>
            <li>Since I first started buying, they changed from the original light Olay fragrance to a terrible perfume and unfortunately, I&#x27;m so sad to not be able to wear it because of &#x27;scent&#x27;sitivity.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am 56 with very fair skin and somewhere along the way lost my &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Microgenerist serum and cream are both excellent and my skin looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li> and it still didn&#x27;t work as good as Olay Regenerist!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall good product and experience!</li>
            <li> and I have always loved it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay products for over 20 years and my skin is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Beautifully Regenerates Skin&#x27;s Appearance.</li>
            <li> Beautifully Regenerates Skin&#x27;s Appearance.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, GOOD CARE OF SELLER.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> This product is great for hydrating my skin during the day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I have great non-sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> it works great.</li>
            <li> My skin is visibly smoother, softer and looks great.</li>
            <li> But By using oil of olay every day and sometimes twice a day my skin looks great..</li>
            <li> The way the cream comes out of the bottle is also great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for about 9 months now, and am happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I use this all the time, make your face feel great.</li>
            <li> I learned that one doesn&#x27;t need to spend $100.+ to get a great result.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes and works great on my acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is great.</li>
            <li> I used Estee Lauder for 15 years with great results but tried Olay Regenerist on the advice of a friend.  </li>
            <li> Why did they change a perfectly great product?  </li>
            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> I think the Regenerist is a great product.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely great lotion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still happy.</li>
            <li> great on face and lips</li>

            <li> I was looking for something good and found in a drugstore.</li>

            <li> Good cream, it cover well my face, the dispenser control</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that I can&#x27;t see any difference except for the great savings in using the Oil of Olay product.</li>
            <li> It is always a challenge to find a good skin product.  </li>
            <li> Who knows but it makes my skin feel good.</li>

            <li> This is now the brand I will use at a fairly good price.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion and works nicely.</li>
            <li> I hope they come out with their fragrance-free version soon as it is a superior product otherwise.</li>
            <li> I had been using it for 9 months and absolutely loved it</li>
            <li> I have never had a blemish problem and just about any product was good.  </li>
            <li> I decided to get it for her because of the good price and product.  </li>
            <li> It also helps my foundation/bb cream go on smoothly and flawlessly.</li>
            <li> When I apply this, I feel like I am doing something GOOD for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have always had good skin--</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for day and night.  </li>
            <li> This product is a good buy when compared to the pricier products on the market.  </li>
            <li> I saw on the Today show on NBC quite some time ago that this moisturizer is as good at the leading salon products</li>
            <li> It is good for skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many moisturizers and many brands, and this is one of the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the original for years and just loved, loved, loved it!</li>
            <li> product is great, but most of product was in lid instead of container.  </li>
            <li> I use it alone or with makeup, and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Great product; love the applicator.</li>
            <li> she is much more happy with the Regenerist line that any others.  </li>
            <li> That turned out to be a good thing for me because after 2 weeks I started to see an amazing difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the outcome of using these products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> simply nice cream... make bright your skin...but leaving wrinkles)...</li>

            <li> I love the Regenerist line of Olay!</li>
            <li> Lovely creamy rich texture that feels wonderful in the skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love the Olay Regenerist line!</li>
            <li> and it will surely pay off!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Just love it!</li>
            <li> love this creamy lotion that relieves the tightness of my skin!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> And, I love the smell!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an Oil of Olay user for many, many years (learned from my grandmother who had beautiful skin at 90), and have just begun trying the Regenerist products.  </li>
            <li> The scent is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have tried others but returned to this one because of the creaminess and light feeling and it makes my skin feel great.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to try and hydrate my skin( I have Psoriasis) and its amazing how it helps hydrate my skin.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, but this moisturizer is amazing.</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t have one wrinkle , they do amazing products...</li>
            <li> i do not wear face makeup and this leaves my skin looking great and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great under my light makeup.</li>
            <li> I think we all should be honest about our review so we can help others.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice moisturizer</li>
            <li> Great product - best price after searching the entire internet!  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> I could immediately notice my face looking brighter and my skin feeling nicely moisturized.</li>
            <li> Many people keep saying how good my skin looks</li>
            <li> The texture is nice.</li>
            <li> she is happy with her looks, it adds confidence and makes life more enjoyable for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one really works, amazing!!!</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say I am seeing the results....</li>
            <li> I love Olay products and again this is one more great one.  </li>
            <li> I often get compliments asking what kind of cream I use.  </li>
            <li> it goes nicely under my make up too</li>
            <li> I honestly and truly see a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> This also has a really pleasant scent, although it&#x27;s a bit strong until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> It will have your makeup stay on all day which is great, but for oily-skinned people like me, it will make your face oily quickly if put under foundation.</li>
            <li> This goes on easily and feels good.</li>
            <li> maybe not that much anti-aging, but it does a dang good job at keeping my wife happy and that makes me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is excellent - very soft on my skin.</li>
            <li> Rich with nice fragrance!</li>
            <li> The more you use it the more it starts melting years off!</li>
            <li> I tried this one and found that it has a nice texture that is easily absorbed and feels very nice, But it has a very strong perfume that I find unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, it&#x27;s a cheaply made  product with fillers that aren&#x27;t good for your skin.</li>
            <li> but sure is nice to not have alot of winkles...</li>
            <li> Old formula was the best there was!  </li>
            <li> This product is great and easily absorbed by skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li> quite enjoy the &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish of this product after application, and this works very nice if you need to put more layers on top of that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> When I first applied the cream, my skin felt great - velvety and well-protected.  </li>
            <li> On their website Olay says the cream will improve the look of fine lines in just 10 minutes!</li>
            <li> I like it better than the Age Defying line.</li>
            <li> However, I came back with this one because I realized this moisturizer was the best!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t reorder ok product</li>
            <li> The feel of you skin even better.</li>
            <li> I order 2 at a time to make sure I always have some on hand,</li>
            <li> I would love to have it replaced.  </li>
            <li> I use to love this.  </li>
            <li> and I have been the most satisfied with the texture and results from Oil of Olay Regenerist Cream.</li>
            <li> it was ok</li>
            <li> :) I guess the guy who moisturizes makes up for the woman who doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, after using Olay Perfecting Cream, for just one month I&#x27;ve received so many compliments from friends and strangers on how \\&quot;radiant\\&quot; and \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; my skin is.</li>
            <li> I love Olay products.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It felt smoother and more moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Had never used it, but decided to try it, LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with this order.</li>
            <li> and I always had problems to find an appropriate cream.</li>
            <li> Some moisturizers sit on top of the skin and leave you shiny.</li>
            <li> The fragrance can be overwhelming to some people, but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is still my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Much better.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many a serum, potion, lotion, cream...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...</li>
            <li> I love this cream because it does not leave your face greasy.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and I found that this one had a much better effect.</li>
            <li> It was ok, but i wanted to try somehting that brightenes and freshens my face</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for 2 months now and I am totally satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for a year now and my skin looks great!  </li>
            <li> It works as it should; no miracles come this cheaply!</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and light also.</li>
            <li> I love Olay -</li>
            <li> Love, love, love.</li>
            <li> To see the results I have to use it more.</li>
            <li> I love all the products that Olay has.</li>
            <li> I love any of the Olay products.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I finish the latest skin moisturizer I am using.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love anything Olay.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this will produce great results but the product smells nice and is not heavy.</li>
            <li> Nice texture and lightly fragranced.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great product.</li>
            <li> Love the way this cream smooths over the face - will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any skincare product, but I sure have to this one.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND WILL REORDER AGAIN AND AGAIN.  </li>
            <li> but i love the olay skin care line</li>
            <li> Great value, really like this product.  </li>
            <li> love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much better value</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li> I go without make up more often now.</li>
            <li> I used it for years but not any more.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and the density of the moisturizer, and it&#x27;s not oily.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion I use it every morning and night</li>
            <li> and I have never been more horrifed.</li>
            <li> Mostly when I woke up in the morning.</li>
            <li> I was not wearing makeup on top of it, so it had to be the cream.  </li>
            <li> wish Olay would drop that ingredient because otherwise I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love, love the Regenerist line</li>
            <li> I also love the way you just press the top and the lotion/cream comes out....</li>
            <li> in that way almost works as a primer and makes makeup-less faces look better  :)</li>
            <li> so have avoided this type of product that seemed to be more chemical-based.  </li>
            <li> I love it on my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is too fragrant and too many ingredients I cannot pronounce.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have too many</li>
            <li> if you happen to order from them, just make sure their products have a safety seal on the lids.</li>
            <li> this again is a lovely product for my wifes moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for a moisturizer but doesn&#x27;t do anything to help with wrinkles</li>
            <li> love it for years now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many moisturizers but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Better then some moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> (and I use it from time to time as well) and we both love it.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this product ...  </li>
            <li> but my lovely bride likes it.  </li>
            <li> Price is better on Amazon than anyplace else</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  </li>
            <li> Use it sparingly and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> It smells lovely, too.</li>
            <li> I used to love this product, but the formula change does not work for me.</li>
            <li> My favorite night time cream</li>
            <li> You gotta love Olay products.</li>
            <li> I always love Oil of Olay</li>
            <li> But I love, love, love the way my face feels after putting it on.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried when I bought this the first time that it would break me out (as most moisturizers do), but surprisingly, it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Light weight and suitable for night and day.</li>
            <li> For 93, she looks pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> Definitely wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Olay, please bring back the original!!!!</li>
            <li> More importantly, as I have tried tons of products, it has reduced my under eye circles.</li>
            <li> At first, I was delighted with how smooth and moisturized my skin was.</li>
            <li> I love that it makes my skin feel silky smooth not oily.</li>
            <li> I get its becoming drier.  </li>
            <li> If you love smooth skin</li>
            <li> She looks younger and more beautiful than you can imagine.  </li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have paid full price for it!  </li>
            <li> Easy to order using prime</li>
            <li> Great lotion and leaves my face feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am tossing this product immediately and strongly recommend that you do NOT buy it under any circumstances.</li>
            <li> The perfume in this product was so strong that I had to return it.  </li>
            <li> First of all the smell is too strong, nice but too strong for the face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased, it really does work.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me - I tried it and was delighted - nice thick cream that goes in well, is not oily and does not shine, but FEELS good in the skin.  </li>
            <li> I sure wish I&#x27;d read these reviews before I purchased the cream, although because my skin is not sensitive I probably would have felt that my skin wouldn&#x27;t have the break-out reactions experienced by others.  </li>
            <li> My fine lines started to diminish the day after I started using this, and my skin feels hydrated.</li>
            <li> I was specifically looking for something like this and this works out just fine.</li>
            <li> If fragrances don&#x27;t irritate your skin, you may be fine, but I&#x27;d look at purchasing another product if you&#x27;re prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> Softens fine lines and truly nourishes skin.</li>
            <li> it;s super hydrating, not greasy and love the skin</li>
            <li> Even the mild scent is pleasing!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a more economical product and something I could easily purchase at a drug store if needed.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m a senior, so I enjoy using it for fine line correction and eye makeup removal.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, soaks in quickly, and seems to be working well!</li>
            <li> The product felt wonderful on my face and neck, but I noticed it smelled a little &amp;#34;too&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is the second time I am purchasing this type of cream, the first was very good hydrating and effective but this one is very very perfumed and it is in fact drying out the skin.</li>
            <li> It is light to the touch.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I am not as happy with that product and am switching back to this one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and works well without ever giving that \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feeling.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product for people who are starting to realize their skin is looking not quite as it once did and want to do something about it.</li>
            <li> - I wear it when I go to the gym as I feel it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li> What a great commercial that would be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A light moisture and does the job</li>
            <li> so I use it primarily for that, rather than anti-aging.</li>
            <li> Screw on lid would be much more convent and economical (for the customer).</li>
            <li> Moisturizes your skin and makes it smooth.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re young-get a life &amp; enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to friends as it was light</li>
            <li> About the “Advanced Anti-Aging” part, there are peptides in it to speed up the production of collagen.</li>
            <li> and it would go on smooth and</li>
            <li> wish they have this product in fragrance free form as well</li>
            <li> so I buy the fragrance free style.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, and lasts through my day.  </li>
            <li> It provides a smooth surface on which to apply my foundation.  </li>
            <li> I was very nicely surprised to see how good Olay Regenerist is for my complexion.</li>
            <li> I do like this product but can not say \\&quot;I love it\\&quot; because I am constantly looking for a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied ,my face got even worse,went to Ulta ,starting using dermalogica , very Happy!</li>
            <li> Good product, but you can spend the same amount of money and buy a better moisturizer that&#x27;s non comedogenic and has an SPF.</li>
            <li> Also, love the dispenser -- dispenses just the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry</li>
            <li> It is a very nice basic moisturizer</li>
            <li> I am only happy that I did not pay full price.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly allowing for easy application of mineral foundation.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the skin feeling very soft without feeling greasy and seems to smooth out the skin nicely.</li>
            <li> It is worth a try!</li>
            <li> The texture is unique and it is not sticky or oily on my skin.</li>
            <li> I thought it was just a variation of the original one and kept looking for the original but can&#x27;t find it anymore.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been waiting for this package to arrive and was so excited to find it at my front door.  </li>
            <li> Softens with a rich deepness to it and renews skin surface.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive lotions and creams on my face, but I really love this one the best.  </li>
            <li> There was a significant difference in weight when holding them in each hand.....</li>
            <li> Try this new one at your own risk.</li>
            <li> For the money and the quality, this is by far the best facial cream yet!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> This was nothing special.</li>
            <li> I find myself returning to the tried and true products which have stood the test of time.  </li>
            <li> It also helps to use a good facial cleanser, (Olay&#x27;s Regenerist line has one), and a toner to restore the skin&#x27;s pH balance.</li>
            <li> A good toner, (again, Olay has one), will remove any residual oil and cleanser from facial skin.</li>
            <li> Good facial moisturerizer year around</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford to buy $50.00 moisturizers; I am a retired 68 year old senior living on restricted budget; however I do care to look nice.  </li>
            <li> The most important thing for anyone to be aware of when first trying this product is that you have to be patient for results.</li>
            <li> I have used this wonderful moisturizer for years and never had a complaint.</li>
            <li> I researched all of the skin creams available at the big box retailer that is the only shopping option in this town, and this one had the best reviews, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> and there is a tremendous improvement in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> Oil of Olay Total Effects and Regenerist facial moisturizers are the best!</li>
            <li> Received quickly and painless purchasing at my desk.  </li>
            <li> Love the cream, love the dispenser, but don&#x27;t love how little cream is in the jar.</li>
            <li> I found a new favorite.  </li>
            <li> and I never had a problem, but this new version has more fragrance and is thicker, and</li>
            <li> Now im back at it and already love the results!  </li>
            <li> It really works!!  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even look real!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, all previous reviews are probably for the old and awesome formula.  </li>
            <li> I bought it specifically to moisturize my dry skin and all I got was a strong face perfume (it has a very strong smell).</li>
            <li> Love it, quick ship and works better than the other Olay products I have bought.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing, my skin show improvement the very next morning after using it.</li>
            <li> Face is very silky smooth after use.</li>
            <li> Helps with the laugh lines, etc.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it work but it smells so nicely too.  </li>
            <li> and I fell my skin more soft.  </li>
            <li> Forever Young :)</li>
            <li> Not greasy feeling, economical to use.  </li>
            <li> cream is okay as far as moisturizers</li>
            <li> should get the Golden Cocoon Award.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no avoiding that it works much better than the all natural products I&#x27;ve used for years.  </li>
            <li> It is such a nice weight moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I stuck with it anyway, mostly because I ran out of all of my other creams and did not have the funds to purchaes more.</li>
            <li> very strong cream for mature skin , not for under make up as it will break it up fast..</li>
            <li> i noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> Right away putting it on you can see a difference</li>
            <li> Renew Daily Regenerating Moisture Cream, which I don&#x27;t think really improves my skin&#x27;s appearance but does hydrate well and makes my skin very comfortable!</li>
            <li> skin tone are more even, more moist and less oily.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product, it works tremendously well and keeps me looking younger!!!</li>
            <li> Now, I have tried using Olay Regenerist and it proves to be better than Total Effects.  </li>
            <li> For a decade and a half I loved it.  </li>
            <li> and the price was great, but the last one I bought was different.  </li>
            <li> I have never used Olay products before, and am thrilled to find these results at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Its rich, non-greasy formula instantly softens the look of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Amino-peptide plus</li>
            <li> Its rich, non-greasy formula instantly softens the look of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Amino-peptide plus</li>
            <li> Soaks in, good product, small amount comes out when you push the top, so no waste or contamination.</li>
            <li> My mother like it very much.</li>
            <li> Either bring back the original fragrance, or do a fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I used this for many years and loved it, but they changed the formula in 2013 and this new and improved version made my face hot, dry, red and irritated after three days of use.</li>
            <li> a little spensivebut i love this products let my skim soff and my husband love to thanks&#x27;</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer, especially at this price.  </li>
            <li> After having read about it in Consumer&#x27;s Report, I tried Olay&#x27;s Regenerist Perfecting Cream for the first time.  </li>
            <li> and they both keep my face smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> and the price is better then the actual store prices</li>
            <li> I gotten better results from cheaper &amp; lesser known-name products.</li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist deep hydration regenerating cream facial moisturizer really works great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m 33 and my skin isn&#x27;t exactly what it used to be</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and tried this one out first.  </li>
            <li> It always leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> A SMOOTHER, MORE YOUTHFUL LOOKING FACE, AND AMAZON FOR MAKING IT POSSIBLE!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it since it first came out.</li>
            <li> That might be thanks to Olay!</li>
            <li> recently tried &amp;#34;Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream&amp;#34; and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over 3 months, maybe the skin start getting use to it, so it doesn&#x27;t show big difference any more.</li>
            <li> It is not the true product I normally get in the store.</li>
            <li> Love it and just purchased 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll also reduce the formation of lines over time, if you use it consistently.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many others, some way more expensive, but have found that Olay does a better job at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Olay!</li>
            <li> Thinking the cause couldn&#x27;t possibly be Olay, I used it two more times, each time exacerbating the problem.  </li>
            <li> THANKS!</li>
            <li> That was my first clue that it was working(1-2 months into using it</li>
            <li> I could see a difference within the first week.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay Regeneris products for several years and been pleased.</li>
            <li> and it makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m back to the Regenerist Night Recovery treatment, which is a much better choice for me.</li>
            <li> Had purchased this cream from the grocery store several times and fell in love.  </li>
            <li> I took a break from using this product and could really see a difference in my skin!  </li>
            <li> I have been using this since it first came out and swear by it.</li>
            <li> I used to love this face moisturizer, in fact, it was my only go-to.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Aunt Martha!</li>
            <li> It gives good moisture without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have the dry skin type, so this soft cream is very suitable for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick but absorbs pretty quickly and leaves my skin feeling good.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;regeneration&amp;#34; of new skin constantly is what makes it effective.</li>
            <li> This works great on my dry skin, I use it 1-2 times daily.</li>
            <li> , did not irritate my sensitive skin, was non-greasy, did not cause break-outs, didn&#x27;t have a strong scent and worked very well under make-up.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal customer for years, but now will have to find a new mousturizer.</li>
            <li> I have used many facial products including very pricey products and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I would touch my face during the day and think how smooth and soft it felt, unusually so.  </li>
            <li> This product was touted to be such a superior facial cream.  </li>
            <li> As good as more expensive products</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and flaky in my T-zone (forehead, nose)in the winter, and this lotion penetrates deeply with just the right thickness to absorb quickly and be effective.</li>
            <li> I switched to this product after positive reviews on the Olay Regenerist line.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much for a product that helps!</li>
            <li> Seems to be ok as long as it stays below my cheek bone.  </li>
            <li> The description did say the BOX could have some minor cosmetic details.. which it surely did.....</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that after using this for a full month that an age spot that I had under my eye is almost completely faded.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I tried the Regenerist Advanced Deep Hydration Cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Within 48 hours, my skin began looking more normal with only a bit of lingering redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used it for 3 days only, just so strong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other stuff, including male-targeted moisturizers as well as other, shall we say, non-male targeted ones, but this particular one has worked, by far, the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works....</li>
            <li> It goes on really silky</li>
            <li> I also use the Regenereist eye lifting serum and it really does lift the eye area.</li>
            <li> This product did not feel very moisturizing, but it made me break out.</li>
            <li> I settled on this product, when I couldn&#x27;t find a cheap Jojoba or Vit E. Oil at a local drug store.</li>
            <li> really well how much you want to use.&lt;br /&gt;The system of the dispenser protect the cream of not being contaminated, because it never expose the cream to the contact of the hand or air.</li>
            <li> Burned my face,under one eye is very red,skin on side of my face is peeling away to another layer.</li>
            <li> I can feel the intense hydration without it being oily or watery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really am looking 4ward 2 getting b4 or just when I need it again.</li>
            <li> She applies it every day, and the cost is also reasonable.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I really like this face cream.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My face feel fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> so this really scared me.</li>
            <li> Who knows where it has been or how much was used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended by a very picky skin care product user!!&lt;br /&gt;JANAal anti-aging power of moisture fused with vitamins and antioxidants.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended by a very picky skin care product user!!&lt;br /&gt;JANA</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really itch</li>
            <li> and I used to have acne and very oily complexion.</li>
            <li> The cream has a much stronger fragrance and seems to leave a coating on my skin.  </li>
            <li> , I really thought I could be with Oil of Olay</li>
            <li> Alas, I&#x27;ll continue my search for a great lotion.</li>
            <li> I just opened today, the bottle was empty, after pumping many time</li>
            <li> She had lost over 25 pounds since living with us, and much of the hanging skin under her chin is gone.</li>
            <li> It really made a difference in a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> I read a dermatologist recommend trying Olay as they spend much $$$ on research so deliver quality products.  </li>
            <li> but it really works.</li>
            <li> I really like the way the cream is dispensed.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Real product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> perfumed, which I could do without, but the product works very well.</li>
            <li> It really hydrates well.</li>
            <li> BUT MUCH CHEAPER.  </li>
            <li> I really like the consistency.</li>
            <li> It ads so much moisture to your skin/face without looking shiny.  </li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to incorporate the whole regenerist line into my routine.</li>
            <li> I am very disatisified with this product.  </li>
            <li> This was very lightweight and nongreasy.</li>
            <li> I just put it in the cabinet straight out of the box when my subscribe and save shipment gets here, so I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I really like the way this makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> So, I have to be very mindful of where I apply it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for year and it has really made a difference.  </li>
            <li> and I really like how these feels on my face</li>
            <li> I like it so much.</li>
            <li> Does a great job moisturizing, but leaves traces behind, which turn into itsy bitsy crumbs when applying my makeup with the sponge.</li>
            <li> moisturizer hydrates very well.&lt;br /&gt;-Smells</li>
            <li> This is fantastic and makes the skin look lighter/bright and younger...</li>
            <li> but I really REALLY like it.  </li>
            <li> After 3 coats of this I still had skin so flaky it was very visible.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I still love Olay, but I would say you should be careful with this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> Have only used for about a week;  no miracles so far, :),</li>
            <li> For many years I used another brand for my skin, I have dry skin and the older</li>
            <li> Much better than a lot of the really expensive creams that do not feel nearly as nice.</li>
            <li> I went back to my Nature&#x27;s Gate herbal moisturizer which seems to work better than anything I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> love the pre-measured dispenser top, and that this does not have an SPF (I find them irritating) or fragrance.</li>
            <li> The cream is very nice, the skin is very delicate, the texture of the skin smoother.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t cause acne or blemishes to form, so for that I&#x27;m grateful as many other products do.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I feel it sits on top of my skin longer than the other one does</li>
            <li> It is a nice, creamy, rich moisturizer, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My face has been a bit more active on the break outs</li>
            <li> My skin is a lot more evenly toned, brighter looking, and the dark circles under my eyes are lightening.</li>
            <li> This is better than nothing, but only as a good moisturizer and an expensive one at that, but as for wrinkles and blemishes.....</li>
            <li> This is my new moisture cream!</li>
            <li> Ths works so well on my dry skin and the price was really good compared to every other place I checked.</li>
            <li> I use it as night cream and wake up with soft and smooth skin after only 2-3 days of use.</li>
            <li> I use this product regularly, bt nt always able 2 get out 2 buy local.</li>
            <li> I have canceled my subscription and will be checking the shelves in stores to see if I can find any of the older product.  </li>
            <li> It is not to heavy and is gentle on the face - My face already feels better.</li>
            <li> Great basic skin cream that appears to do no harm on sensitive skin - moisturizers without an oil slick</li>
            <li> still highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Every prodduct Olay makes gets high marks up against the products that are twice the price.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for all.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin &amp; only have an occasional pimple, but after a week of using this, my face is full of intense breakouts that professionals cannot calm.</li>
            <li> I am a long-time user of the all natural type of moisturizers (like Kiss your face, Jasons, pure aloe, etc)</li>
            <li> You will see a big difference after the first use!</li>
            <li> It leaves the rough skin smooth any hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Keeps your skin soft, doesn&#x27;t do much for wrinkles</li>
            <li> It is very creamy and has a soft sent.  </li>
            <li> I am sad because it was a great cream</li>
            <li> I have to try it a few more times and see the results.</li>
            <li> The Regenerist in the round bottle that depenses from the top.</li>
            <li> I used it for a few days and didn&#x27;t notice any hydration more than normal.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about trying this new lotion because my skin has been a bit dry.</li>
            <li> I do notice that it makes my face a bit more pale when I put it on</li>
            <li> i use it sometimes for the night , also for my top hand , it make wonder overnight , if you have a very dry skin with some deep lines , it is for you..</li>
            <li> I got a free sample somewhere or other</li>
            <li> This is a nice, hydrating moisturizer, but the jar design doesn&#x27;t work you to see how little product is actually inside.  </li>
            <li> I mistakenly understood that this product was a new, never opened bottle...</li>
            <li> On the packaging of this one it says new and improved formula.</li>
            <li> Being new to Olay I thought I would try a number of products to find what works for my skin.</li>
            <li> I saw the label: New Formula.  </li>
            <li> And I have two bottles of these new formula that I hate...sigh.</li>
            <li> If you live alone, just have it gift packaged - they&#x27;ll never know it&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li> The description said it was NEW</li>
            <li> I am not convinced it is a good foundation under make up because it seems that my make up does not stay on as well as it did with my previous (and more expensive) moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re my age, try a product with a less strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> And my skin looks and feels so very soft.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive with a tendency to rosacea</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very sensitive to scent and can&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling and looking very soft.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin which gets a lot of redness with products.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb as well as before, and tends to sit on the top of my skin to the point that it creates almost a film which gets gummy when I apply make up (and I use very little make up).</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, skip this cream!</li>
            <li> You will be HAPPILY surprised with the results, give it a try!</li>
            <li> This is no small feat.</li>
            <li> so I did a search for it and was pleasantly surprised to find it!  </li>
            <li> I am 60 yrs old and have no noticeable wrinkles !</li>
            <li> The morning after I applied the product for the first time, my face was very red.</li>
            <li> I have even been using Olay Touch of Sun daily moisturizer for months with no ill effects.</li>
            <li> It is worth trying and the price is reasonable compared to other products.</li>
            <li> Never really had any pimples present until I used this product more frequently.</li>
            <li> been using this product for a number of years, and it leaves my face feeling so soft!  </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve never spent so much on lotion before, esp.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and I can use this lotion twice a day with no oily spots or breakouts!</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, just a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Despite &amp;#34;wanting&amp;#34; to go back to my more expensive natural creams, I like this better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin smooth and wrinkles less noticeable</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and smoothly, no oily or greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> Made my skin appear more oilly the an normal and felt thick.</li>
            <li> but its like all other moisturizer i guess nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> I ended up trashing a full bottle due to breakout and a bit of a rash developing on my cheek.</li>
            <li> Thankfully I only had to be out in public for the morning because this afternoon my foundation is so patchy and looks like it flaking off, while still looking super greasy.</li>
            <li> I really prefer the old formula, this new one doesn&#x27;t have that same silky feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30s and wanted to start using something for anti-aging and wrinkle control, and I have incredibly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> One pump is usually enough for my whole face.</li>
            <li> After applying it at night, I awoke to soft, glowing skin.</li>
            <li> Before, I was using Olay Total Effects for years because my face loves the product so much.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t work well on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I know this works for others but not for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> , he looks like he&#x27;s in his early 30&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 years old, and I have been using skin care products since I was 16 ranging from Lancome, Clinique, Guinot, Clarins and Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li> The pictures here are of the old product, old formula.</li>
            <li> I wear it at night and my skin wakes up soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I am a frequent customer of Amazon</li>
            <li> Now I am 47, and I still look young.</li>
            <li> I suggest you do a patch test for a couple days before putting it completely on your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This fast-absorbing deep regenerating cream really does hydrate one&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Two weeks I&#x27;ve been searching for the old formula without luck.  </li>
            <li> I bought this moisturizer for my 93 year old mother.</li>
            <li> , I would prefer a jar and not this pumping action.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft.  </li>
            <li> My skin has improved so much during the last two weeks.</li>
            <li> Keep my face young looking and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft all the time.</li>
            <li> I also need something that will work that doesn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> It goes on silky smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> And within a week or so of starting to use it, my skin felt so much softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li> This is the product sloughing off old skin.</li>
            <li> and I am usually sensitive to perfumes; this one does not seem to bother me</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and supple~  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and use hypoallergenic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the whole Olay Regenerist line for the last 10 years or so.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m frequently mistaken for 53, instead of the 63 that I am.  </li>
            <li> I like the scent of it (it is NOT unscented) and the texture is soft.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive, be warned.</li>
            <li> Would you believe this was recommended to me by my 95 year old aunt, who has used it forever and still has skin that glows?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not to mention amazon&#x27;s price thus far has been the cheapest I have found it (unless you can come across a coupon somewhere).</li>
            <li> Going back to my Estee Lauder Day Wear which is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was delighted to find it so inexpensive on Amazon.</li>
            <li> At first I was only using the exfoliating cleanser with this moisturizer, but that turned out to be too much for my skin as it was getting dry, so I now rotate between the \\&quot;micro-purifying\\&quot; cleanser and the exfoliating one.</li>
            <li> Thick and creamy, very rich.</li>
            <li> Not only does it hydrate deeply, it&#x27;s made my skin look better in other ways, as well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super oily but dry and flaky at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I called the company and they are sending me coupons for $26 worth of their other products, which I do also use.</li>
            <li> She was very overweight when she came to live with us and had a lot of loose skin under her chin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comparable to the ridiculously priced department store brands at a much better price.</li>
            <li> Now that I am getting older, I have moved on to the next level in hydration.  </li>
            <li> Rated #1 with consumer reports above all the high priced lotions &amp; potions</li>
            <li> I tried many other brands but kept coming back to Olay - because I have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> after the first use you can experience rolling of your skin down, as it remove the death cells and help regenerate new one faster , using Olay for over 20 years</li>
            <li> apparently something I&#x27;m too sensitive for.</li>
            <li> However my most recent purchase has been a completely different experience,  The outside packaging looks the same, but there are minor changes to the bottle.  </li>
            <li> This package came in pretty rough condition.</li>
            <li> at first I thought that I had just purchased another run of the mill, empty promises, face cream.</li>
            <li> Do make sure to use a mirror though, if you miss rubbing any in completely you get thick white streaks.</li>
            <li> Have been using regenerist products for a very long time however, this product caused a rash on my cheeks and an intense burning feeling.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have especially sensitive skin, but it is dry.</li>
            <li> This Advanced Anti-Aging Deep moisture coats my skin with a silicone like layer, which after a few minutes starts peeling off and looks like I have eraser dust allover my face.  </li>
            <li> It does not absorb and sits on top, leaving a filmy and somewhat sticky white residue on my skin that slowly clumped up and felt like it peeled away over the course of the day.  </li>
            <li> If I were more vain, I would have been sending my husband on an emergency run to the drug store, but I just hate to pay drug store prices after so many years of subscribe and save on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I used it two weeks, and suddenly nothing more came out of the strange little pump.  </li>
            <li> I use the Regenerist cleansers as well, and I haven&#x27;t had any major acne breakouts since then.</li>
            <li> I use no other cream.</li>
            <li> Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Sunscreen SPF15 Olay Regenerist helps regenerate your skin&#x27;s appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Niacinamide</li>
            <li> Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Sunscreen SPF15 Olay Regenerist helps regenerate your skin&#x27;s appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Niacinamide</li>
            <li> Sure enough my entire face and neck were covered with little red bumps.</li>
            <li> go.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is not very pleasant but fortunately dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again?</li>
            <li> It is now super greasy and scented and putting make-up on top of this this morning was almost impossible.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m a little bit of a special case with my crazily sensitive, flaky dry, eczema-inflamed  skin</li>
            <li> Astringents, which are generally alcohol-based, tighten the skin and pores and remove oil.</li>
            <li> This noticeably reduces them and just generally firms my skin.  </li>
            <li> so far i cant write much only been using for 2 weeks continue.</li>
            <li> Recently my 24 year old son took me out for coffee</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and found that this product was the only one that worked for me.  </li>
            <li> I just cut the bottle open and spatula it into an old moisturizer jar that I&#x27;ve cleaned out.</li>
            <li> I was using Bare Minerals</li>
            <li> I like it so far - only using it a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> I took some Claritin and quit using the cream, my skin was pretty much back to normal after a few days.</li>
            <li> Withing minutes your skin feels so soft and the tiny lines look softer!  </li>
            <li> ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li> I barely use concealer</li>
            <li> I love to share my secret:</li>
            <li> I have super dark blue, very hollow/sunken-in circles that, even with cover up, are still dark and shadowed because they are sunk in.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, so I am very careful with new products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one that seems to really work and combat my dry skin.</li>
            <li> The things I don&#x27;t like are how expensive it is and not that impressed with the weird pump up design, if you get too much, you can&#x27;t put the pricey stuff back.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for anyone with very dry skin at any age.  </li>
            <li> I have NEVER had sensitive skin and have tried well over 100 different skin care creams, serums and treatments in the last 15 or so years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay products all my adult life and was skeptical on paying more for a \\&quot;regenerating\\&quot; product.  </li>
            <li> It sinks in as fast as an expensive moisturizer, and it has a very light fragrance.</li>
            <li> But now I can see dramatic differences, my reddish spots disapeared, my dark circles are much lighter, the fine lines around my eyes are smoothing out, my lumpy forehead that I was beginning to dispise is soft and youthfull again, and the scaly dryness from living in Colorado is gone.</li>
            <li> The cap, the dispenser, and ugh, there is so much product left when you think it&#x27;s empty!</li>
            <li> So glad I read all the other negative reviews before attempting to use this.  </li>
            <li> I live in New England where the harsh winters wreck havoc on our skins.</li>
            <li> A few weeks after a milestone birthday this winter, my previously oily acne prone skin became dry , flaky and I noticed a very fine line on my left cheek.</li>
            <li> I am 30yo, and have mildly dry, but not problematic or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have long nails and was tired of scooping cream out of a jar only to end up with most of it under my finger nail.  </li>
            <li> So far, this one is working, especially since the air is so dry, with the heat on.  </li>
            <li> After about a month&#x27;s consistent use, I noticed my cheeks became increasingly reddened and rough but thought that was due to</li>
            <li> I am in my early 50&#x27;s and have always had very dry skin, so it&#x27;s tricky to find a moisturizer that works for me to the point where I only use night creams.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m starting to see the little lines and wrinkles that no woman wants to see.  </li>
            <li> Since I first started buying, they changed from the original light Olay fragrance to a terrible perfume and unfortunately, I&#x27;m so sad to not be able to wear it because of &#x27;scent&#x27;sitivity.  </li>
            <li> The sensitive may be a tad richer, but other  than that I find them to be equally moisturizing and soothing.  </li>
            <li> i looked at them carefully and also realized THIS one was much lighter than the other one, along with No seal on it.....</li>
            <li> This may be due to my sensitive acne prone skin, but that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my having been ill for about a week and lapsing on regular skin care as well as our having had unusually dry weather for most of the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this product to anyone who feels like giving up on their skin, just give it a few weeks</li>
            <li> New formula is a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I took Benadryl but not sure if it really worked.</li>
            <li> I am now into perhaps my third jar even though it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Although it can be pricey, these products do last a long time.</li>
            <li> My bottle last so long</li>
            <li> But, I bought this in desperation when I was in my tiny hometown over the holidays, with no natural stores in sight.</li>
            <li> I have been using this amazing lotion for the past year, and had been unable to purchase it on a regular basis at the stores where I regularly shop.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and luxurious whereas other products I&#x27;ve used either made my skin feel dry or no difference.</li>
            <li> I try other more expensive products and I go back to Olay.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well and when my skin feels extra dry</li>
            <li> With multiple health problems contributing to my dry skin this is the only product I have come across that relieves the dry skin and thus the itching that can come from the dryness.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have horribly dry skin, and am always looking for a facial moisturizer to help it out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having read similar reports in these reviews, I eventually realized that it was this stuff that was making my skin rough, red and pebbly-textured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so desperate to believe the consumer reports that I carried it with me and kept on re-applying more</li>
            <li> I was reviewing this product online for long and decided to use this.  </li>
            <li> I figured they spent a lot of money on advertising to get people to believe that their products actually worked.  </li>
            <li> My upper lip even swelled in the center.</li>
            <li> She has been wanting the Olay Regenerist for a long time, but would not spend the money to get it for herself.  </li>
            <li> Olay has been around for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Within two days I had red bumps, some little white heads, and a blotchy complexion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Olay products without ending up with such severe reaction.</li>
            <li> Instead the first usage of this product left me with an angry, itchy rash on several areas of my face.  </li>
            <li> I see a lot of other people having the same issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a very long time</li>
            <li> BUT, he hates feeling dry and he moisturizes.</li>
            <li> just started accutane and my skin is now extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and it leaves my face feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> All people having an extremely dry skin should resort to these 2 Olay creams.</li>
            <li> any1 w/ dry skin or combination skin should use this product...dnt hisitate</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with extremely dry skin this winter and had hoped that this well-reviewed product would help alleviate my problem.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> My face is always dry</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> have extremely dry skin, and nothing has worked until I began using the two Olay products she swears by from Olay.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin was SO DRY</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this product a few years ago &amp;#34;by mistake&amp;#34; and haven&#x27;t looked back.  </li>
            <li> Together, with a few other of their Regenerist products, and WOW!</li>
            <li> Who knows what they put in this stuff, but I highly encourage folks to avoid it - or at least test it out before purchasing.</li>
            <li> The winter was very harsh where I live in the south of france and my skin was very dry and peeled on some parts of my face.</li>
            <li> but this somehow has never once given me a single pimple.</li>
            <li> I have been an Oil of Olay user for decades, I&#x27;m 61, and with very dry skin in last few years I tried this just recently.</li>
            <li> the only time I spent outdoors was two minutes to get to and from my car!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent countless dollars on products that never worked fast enough for me or that I got bored with or that noone seemed to notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of spending big $&#x27;s on other products and really wanted to like the Regenerist product line</li>
            <li> I have used it on her every night for the last year and a half, and the chin is disappearing in addition to wrinkles on her face.</li>
            <li> I would prefer paying less for a simple jar with screw cap.</li>
            <li> My skin looks smoother and younger (I&#x27;m 37) and I even feel it has made my pores less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I also have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> you get a bit of rosacea (not too bad, but more than just dry skin), this product will help.  </li>
            <li> This has plumped up the skin below my eyes, and, in addition to getting rid of much of the wrinkling, it has made it easier to put cover-up on the remaining discoloration, as it has taken away at least half of the sunken in look and the darkness.</li>
            <li> However, I notice that after I use it in the mornings, my face is dry again a few hours later.</li>
            <li> But if you have dry skin year round like me, I definitely recommend you to try it!</li>
            <li> But  by 10 my skin would feel tight, look flaky and show white patches .Yet</li>
            <li> back to my old standby and far less expensive Cetaphil cleanser and lotion.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little.  </li>
            <li> The next day I had little bumps covering my neck, forehead and temples.</li>
            <li> I have tiny little bumps all over my face-- cheeks, forehead, nose, chin--</li>
            <li> I used to tan at least 4 days a week for four years while I was a college cheerleader, so my face had cheer lines as well as early aging from exposure.  </li>
            <li> This is such a waste of product.  </li>
            <li> It got absorbed immediately and had a faint fragrance.</li>
            <li> Fresheners work similarly to astringents by tightening the skin, but they are made of ingredients like caffeine and green tea instead of alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful which one you purchase.</li>
            <li> After two days of use, my face was broken out so much that I looked like I had hit puberty overnight.</li>
            <li> Pink in color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This morning, 6 days later, my face felt like it was completely dried out and scabbed over.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You guys, after just three weeks, only two of them with the product, I flaked off a piece of dried skin and it was an age spot.</li>
            <li> I have used more expensive creams in the past, but have decided they&#x27;re not worth it compared to this product.</li>
            <li> This relatively new Olay formula, with a brightening complex, fades the look of dark spots, age spots, sun spots and discoloration.</li>
            <li> But all in all, I really do like this product, and while I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic change in my wrinkles, since it doesn&#x27;t break me out, I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Day two still the same, a little less burn.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> This product is terrible - the scent is much too strong for a product that is used on the face.  </li>
            <li> It also lasts all day for me without my skin ending up feeling tight and dry by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I guess A waste of 20.00  never again,just wonder how long it will take until its all gone?</li>
            <li> I have begun to explore the Olay skin care products as the moisturizers and facial cleansers I usually use</li>
            <li> Although some of this is due to the weight loss, I believe this cream has helped.</li>
            <li> Realized it is due to this regenerating hydrating moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> Then I proceeded to squeeze a small amount of the lotion and realized that it&#x27;s greasier than I last remember.  </li>
            <li> I swear the other day I mistook my wife for a teenager she looked so</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are other regenerist products that did&#x27;nt work and broke me out.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product, unlike other products, this one seems to sink in and make my skin glow.</li>
            <li> I use it with their Pro X scrub and small white brush that spins.</li>
            <li> You only get a small amount for the price.</li>
            <li> but it makes my skin feel softer than the other one does and isn&#x27;t quite as heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed 1 of the bottles had a seal over the dispensing hole and the other did not....</li>
            <li> for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and need something heavy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a crunchy hippie, so I normally shy away from drugstore products, or anything that isn&#x27;t simple and natural.</li>
            <li> Above is the decription of the container.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find sometimes.</li>
            <li> This product is often hard to find in the local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> use this at night and couple it with Olay Total Effects Moisturizing Vitamin Complex,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least ten years on my combination skin.</li>
            <li> I look at least five years younger</li>
            <li> B3 Complex penetrates deep into the skins surface to wake up tired-looking skin.</li>
            <li> B3 Complex penetrates deep into the skins surface to wake up tired-looking skin.</li>
            <li> I was used to avoid gazing in the mirror at my tierd looking skin and dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rate this product as average.</li>
            <li> and I received this recently from Amazon and it was thick, smelly and made my face breakout as it clogged my pores.</li>
            <li> When I touch my face it feels rough and uneven and I am self conscience about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it on subscribe and save for as long as Amazon&#x27;s had the service and then, one day, I open a new pack from my horde and it was a greasy, yucky mess that immediately started pilling on my face - nasty, dark curls of oily grossness that constantly need to be brushed away.  </li>
            <li> Nearly $40 down the drain.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure I will be looking anymore as long as this keeps working!  </li>
            <li> The packaging also makes it awkward to get out the right amount of product.</li>
            <li> Previously I would have given it a 5.  </li>
            <li> My wrinkles are much less noticable.</li>
            <li> I pay less for it on Amazon than in the stores.</li>
            <li> However, please note that one&#x27;s skin will not show improvement unless used regularly for at least a  few months.</li>
            <li> I would recommend putting on the cream while the skin is slightly moist - not wet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend putting on the cream while the skin is slightly moist - not wet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wrinkles less noticeable.</li>
            <li> This bottle also lasts quite a while, my mom goes through about one of these every 2 to 2 and a half months</li>
            <li> Too expensive foy such short use.</li>
            <li> It relieves the tight, pulling feeling of the skin on my face.</li>
            <li> i managed to get a little spot to do my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even saw dark spot lighten!  </li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;The way it is dispensed is a little bit peculiar, but I have grown fond of that as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Product has also caused me to break out a little bit.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> I just wish the pro x products were a little be cheaper.</li>
            <li> a few little pimples here</li>
            <li> I thought it might be something else, but I quit using it for a few days, and my skin cleared up.</li>
            <li> While the Regenerist line is not really one of those, I think it has proven itself, for me at least.  </li>
            <li> Green Tea.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Green Tea.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And yes, I use a few &amp;#34;Oil of O&#x27;Lady&amp;#34; products -</li>
            <li> Not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> Not light.</li>
            <li> A mainstay in my everyday routine.  </li>
            <li> wife uses it everyday.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be irritating my skin or clogging my pores in these short few hours</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this four stars is because the container is nearly impossible to disassemble, so when you can&#x27;t pump anymore, it&#x27;s very hard to open it and scoop out the last remaining dregs...</li>
            <li> purchased this product because I&#x27;m a pale girl that loves the sun.</li>
            <li> It looks radiant and breaks out less-- something that is high praise, considering how troubled by skin has always been!</li>
            <li> Not cool Olay!</li>
            <li> After the 4th day I started breaking out pretty badly and had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I feel like for the first time I have bad skin and feel like I have to put on a lot of foundation to cover it up.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m on a desperate search for a new face cream.  </li>
            <li> Thick, but not super greasy, it feels almost velvety.</li>
            <li> MY face is sensitive and dry and it is difficult to find a product that isn&#x27;t too greasy,too smelly,or too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Also, the texture is a little too thick for my taste.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past &amp; do like it...</li>
            <li> After a couple days of use, I had small bumps all over my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;First time buying from the seller, not sure where the problem started</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of facial moisturizers over the years, expensive and drug store brands.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the Oil of Olay Age Defying Day Lotion with sunscreen</li>
            <li> Not sure about getting rid of wrinkles</li>
            <li> No more redness on my nose and chin.  </li>
            <li> It took less than a minute to realize this is a total fake!</li>
            <li> Hard to explain</li>
            <li> The packaging and the container cannot be recycled, either (at least not in my community), so I also detracted for that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tip:&lt;br /&gt;I have never liked the packaging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indications&lt;br /&gt;Amino-Peptide Complex.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indications&lt;br /&gt;Amino-Peptide Complex.</li>
            <li> This is my one complaint about Olay products.  </li>
            <li> At least that is what happened to me.</li>
            <li> This is a thick moisturizing creme.  </li>
            <li> It comes on thick and chalky and did not leave my skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Thick like body butter.  </li>
            <li> I tried various creams (some very expensive like Chanel)</li>
            <li> With the cold weather my skin is very dry and this creme helps me out a lot.  </li>
            <li> After a little while my face was all broken out!</li>
            <li> That said I have been using Olay Regenerist night cream, mico-scuplting cream and serum for a month now and am just figuring out that it is the probable cause of my recent bad skin issues.</li>
            <li> It seems whenever I buy face care products I always try something different because nothing I buy ever seems to make an impression (unless its a bad one).</li>
            <li> Not a good sign for something going on my face.</li>
            <li> I am desperately looking for a cream for my dry skin , for now I am using Olive oil!!.</li>
            <li> After a few days, you get dramatic results!</li>
            <li> In the mean time, my makeup reduces the appearance of the bumps, but I can feel them!  </li>
            <li> So I look at the packaging and looked at the logo, the logo is totally different than what&#x27;s on the product I just recieved, which leads me to conclude that this has got to be a fake!!</li>
            <li> and it has taken away that tired, drawn look.  </li>
            <li> POOR as always.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate having to dig out cream in a jar with my fingers not knowing if I&#x27;ve left any germs in the remaining cream.  </li>
            <li> The horrible smell and quality of the lotion is not even close to the quality that I have been purchasing from the REAL Olay line.....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get it anywhere close to my eyes, but 2 minutes after using it, my eyes started to itch, burn and swell so badly that I had to take an antihistamine and put ice cubes on my eyes to get the irritation &amp; swelling to go down.  </li>
            <li> I agree, this new formula is terrible!</li>
            <li> The new formula is terrible.</li>
            <li> It has made a dramatic difference in the clarity and radiance of my skin.</li>
            <li> No winkles around the eyes on hardly any on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Not afraid to look my age</li>
            <li> Even looked a little dirty!  </li>
            <li> I use a Clarsonic &amp; take care of my skin , but sadly the Olay Regen isn&#x27;t working for me.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I have a manly man of a boyfriend.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about Olay products.  </li>
            <li> They recently changed the formula, now I&#x27;m having a horrible reaction to it.  </li>
            <li> (sadly aveeno just moistened but did nothing else).</li>
            <li> have become way too expensive, and friends have literally raved about Olay skin care</li>
            <li> but it was too expensive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a layer of filth on my face that makes my sad skin dryer and dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad</li>
            <li> cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never have to stare at a greasy face or caked up makeup like a lousy product would do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to share my experience with the company and then throw this expensive cream in the trash.</li>
            <li> I prefer it over Clinique, which is&lt;br /&gt;super expensive.</li>
            <li> wary.</li>
            <li> Not excellent packaging.  </li>
            <li> No need to spend lots of money on the expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> BUT - the Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating cream is HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Not impressed, Olay.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can’t testify to any of that.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> No more expensive Lancome for me!!</li>
            <li> then Mary Kay expensive products that they have forced their customer base to one expensive product - instead of lower priced options.</li>
            <li> I have tried the very expensive creams to the not so expensive.</li>
            <li> I quit using this 4 days ago yet my skin is still raw and looks terrible.</li>
            <li> It feels coarser and not as moist and worse, they put in perfume!!</li>
            <li> This product is a fake!  </li>
            <li> I am just amazed that their Regenerist line works as well as the very expensive skin products in illuminating the face, fading spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No foundation liquid or powder can be applied over it without streaking badly.  </li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> I am 42 and people are shocked they think I am 30.</li>
            <li> May need to return to the pricey product. :(</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> extremely disappointed:(</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> It did not feel at all moisturizing and was very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> hate the container.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always broke out, even from very expensive creams!</li>
            <li> I hated it.</li>
            <li> Why would Olay do this stupid thing?!</li>
            <li> It looked horrible like I have problem skin.</li>
            <li> Smells awful and feels sticky.</li>
            <li> I look terrible and feel awful.</li>
            <li> Have tried an awful lot of night and day moisturers.  </li>
            <li> Horrible since the formula changed this year.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product because it does not do any hydration at all!!</li>
            <li> and there that are always hormonal, but since using this stuff my skin is the worst it has ever been.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> New formula is a huge disappointment. It&#x27;s now a moisturizer instead of hydrating cream as it shows you in this picture. I used the cream for years and years and I received this recently from Amazon and it was thick, smelly and made my face breakout as it clogged my pores. Stay away! I will never buy it again unless they change the formula back. You get what you pay for, it&#x27;s a cheaply made  product with fillers that aren&#x27;t good for your skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I am now into perhaps my third jar even though it lasts a long time. It really works....</li>
            <li> Smells good, non-greasy, handy applicator.  Love this moisturizer, especially at this price.  I like it better than the Age Defying line.</li>
            <li> I saw results immediately when I started using this.  I&#x27;ve been an Oil of Olay user for many, many years (learned from my grandmother who had beautiful skin at 90), and have just begun trying the Regenerist products.  This makes my skin feel like velvet!  It goes on easily and smoothly, no oily or greasy feel.  And my skin looks and feels so very soft.  Helps with the laugh lines, etc.  Will definitely continue to use this.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t make my face oily afterwards, absorbs so well into my skin. I used this for couple months and wanted to try to use different moisturizer from Olay Regenerist line. However, I came back with this one because I realized this moisturizer was the best!</li>
            <li> I switched to this product after positive reviews on the Olay Regenerist line.  I wanted to try a more economical product and something I could easily purchase at a drug store if needed.  This product is great for hydrating my skin during the day.  I have dry skin and need something heavy but that can be used under make up.  I am not convinced it is a good foundation under make up because it seems that my make up does not stay on as well as it did with my previous (and more expensive) moisturizer.  I have to try it a few more times and see the results.</li>
            <li> I found a new favorite.  I&#x27;ve used Olay products all my adult life and was skeptical on paying more for a \\&quot;regenerating\\&quot; product.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t regenerate (don&#x27;t know that yet), it is the nicest face cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  It goes on really silky and I can feel the difference after putting it on.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t reorder ok product</li>
            <li> LOVE this! The scent is amazing. The feel of you skin even better. Not too greasy...perfect! I will be purchasing this one again for sure!</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30s and wanted to start using something for anti-aging and wrinkle control, and I have incredibly sensitive skin. I was a bit worried when I bought this the first time that it would break me out (as most moisturizers do), but surprisingly, it didn&#x27;t. It is a nice, creamy, rich moisturizer, so a little goes a long way. One pump is usually enough for my whole face. I use the Regenerist cleansers as well, and I haven&#x27;t had any major acne breakouts since then. At first I was only using the exfoliating cleanser with this moisturizer, but that turned out to be too much for my skin as it was getting dry, so I now rotate between the \\&quot;micro-purifying\\&quot; cleanser and the exfoliating one. This also has a really pleasant scent, although it&#x27;s a bit strong until you get used to it. The only reason I am giving this four stars is because the container is nearly impossible to disassemble, so when you can&#x27;t pump anymore, it&#x27;s very hard to open it and scoop out the last remaining dregs...there actually isn&#x27;t that much left inside, but still...every drop counts when it comes to semi-expensive facial products. The packaging and the container cannot be recycled, either (at least not in my community), so I also detracted for that. But all in all, I really do like this product, and while I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic change in my wrinkles, since it doesn&#x27;t break me out, I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> After having read about it in Consumer&#x27;s Report, I tried Olay&#x27;s Regenerist Perfecting Cream for the first time.  After applying it at night, I awoke to soft, glowing skin. I can&#x27;t believe that I wasted so much money on chemical creams that actually made my skin feel drier.  I also use the Regenereist eye lifting serum and it really does lift the eye area.</li>
            <li> I have used many facial products including very pricey products and this is one of my favorites. It makes my skin feel soft and luxurious whereas other products I&#x27;ve used either made my skin feel dry or no difference. I have also noticed that after using this for a full month that an age spot that I had under my eye is almost completely faded.</li>
            <li> I use it as night cream and wake up with soft and smooth skin after only 2-3 days of use.</li>
            <li> I have not seen the effects yet.  But I am hopeful.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I used this product and didn&#x27;t do my research!  I research EVERYTHING before buying and just figured I&#x27;d save about $20 by getting this cream... I now have a red bumpy rash all over my jawline and neck and I have great non-sensitive skin.  It is starting to itch, what the heck do they put in this stuff?  I thought (similar to another&#x27;s review) that the bumps in the beginning were just part of the regeneration process.. but they won&#x27;t go away.  I am tossing this product immediately and strongly recommend that you do NOT buy it under any circumstances.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have especially sensitive skin, but it is dry. This product did not feel very moisturizing, but it made me break out. I thought it might be something else, but I quit using it for a few days, and my skin cleared up. Then when I tried it again, I immediately had another breakout. If you have sensitive skin, skip this cream!</li>
            <li> This is excellent - very soft on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used face creams in all price levels from 200.00 to this cream, believe it or not this hydrates the best. Definitely wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer for either daytime or night.  It gives good moisture without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> Best ever! I&#x27;ve paid over $100.00 for LANCÔME and it still didn&#x27;t work as good as Olay Regenerist!</li>
            <li> I like this product, it keeps my skin moisturized without looking or feeling oily. The fragrance is light and pleasant. I apply a dime-size amount to my face once a day, so for me, a 1.7 ounce lasts me about five months.</li>
            <li> Have been using regenerist products for a very long time however, this product caused a rash on my cheeks and an intense burning feeling.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years and it works well. It moisturizes my face and neck all day. It is light to the touch.</li>
            <li> I use the Olay Regenerist Anti-aging night resurfacing elixir at night and it is a relatively inexpensive anti-aging mousturizer.  During the day I use Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration regenerating cream and they both keep my face smooth and soft.  I used to use Este Lauder but now prefer Oil of  Olay.</li>
            <li> Before, I was using Olay Total Effects for years because my face loves the product so much.  Now, I have tried using Olay Regenerist and it proves to be better than Total Effects.  It really moisturizes my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy my face. Love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin &amp; only have an occasional pimple, but after a week of using this, my face is full of intense breakouts that professionals cannot calm. I quit using this 4 days ago yet my skin is still raw and looks terrible. I use a Clarsonic &amp; take care of my skin , but sadly the Olay Regen isn&#x27;t working for me.  I was hoping something with peptides would be  beneficial. Still looking for  organic products with anti aging derivatives. Anyone know of a well received cream? Was using La Mer before this. May need to return to the pricey product. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay products for over 20 years and my skin is beautiful. If you read consumer report rankings of facial creams, Olay always comes out on top over the extravagant, expensive creams. For under $20.00 dollars Olay is the best bargain out there!</li>
            <li> good product.  hate the container.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this product a few years ago &amp;#34;by mistake&amp;#34; and haven&#x27;t looked back.  I have tried others but returned to this one because of the creaminess and light feeling and it makes my skin feel great.  I order 2 at a time to make sure I always have some on hand,</li>
            <li> This product is terrible - the scent is much too strong for a product that is used on the face.  I didn&#x27;t get it anywhere close to my eyes, but 2 minutes after using it, my eyes started to itch, burn and swell so badly that I had to take an antihistamine and put ice cubes on my eyes to get the irritation &amp; swelling to go down.  I am going to call Olay to get my money back.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of this product for awhile now, so I thought I would leave a review. I started buying Olay products after it was recommended to me after a facial I had in Los Angeles. I was looking for something good and found in a drugstore. Although it can be pricey, these products do last a long time. One bottle lasts me between 2 and 3 months. It is moisturizing without being oily. It is worth a try!</li>
            <li> This is a thick moisturizing creme.  It leaves the rough skin smooth any hydrated.  It only takes a little.  With the cold weather my skin is very dry and this creme helps me out a lot.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I use no other cream. This is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!...it;s super hydrating, not greasy and love the skin absorbs it!!</li>
            <li> product is great, but most of product was in lid instead of container.  I would love to have it replaced.  This is such a waste of product.  thank you</li>
            <li> its a wonderful product. it works great. the  shipping came in on time too. and the price is better then the actual store prices</li>
            <li> I bought this when a airline lost my luggage on the way to Kodiak, AK. I settled on this product, when I couldn&#x27;t find a cheap Jojoba or Vit E. Oil at a local drug store. I used it at night only, since it doesn&#x27;t include SPF. It seemed to be hydrating without being oily. I kept using it for a week at night, even after finding my luggage. I ended up trashing a full bottle due to breakout and a bit of a rash developing on my cheek. Back to Jojoba and La Posay Roche.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This just reinforces why I never buy drugstore products.</li>
            <li> I was reviewing this product online for long and decided to use this.  but its like all other moisturizer i guess nothing special about it. so far i cant write much only been using for 2 weeks continue. I think we all should be honest about our review so we can help others.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin. I have tried the very expensive creams to the not so expensive. I also have very dry skin.  This product does the trick. My skin is visibly smoother, softer and looks great. I have been using olay for about 7 years now. I am 42 and people are shocked they think I am 30. I use Oil of Olay and stay out of the sun. Recently my 24 year old son took me out for coffee and I was mistaken for his girlfriend. TEE HEE he is mortified and I am elated.  This cream is a godsend!</li>
            <li> I use to love this.  Now they have some &amp;#34;new and improved formula&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s not as creamy and smells different.  I did have this on subscription delivery but I&#x27;ll be taking it off.  Not cool Olay!</li>
            <li> For the money and the quality, this is by far the best facial cream yet! I have tried everything from Estee Lauder, Clinique to Clarins and I have been the most satisfied with the texture and results from Oil of Olay Regenerist Cream. Even the mild scent is pleasing! You will be HAPPILY surprised with the results, give it a try!</li>
            <li> The holy grail of moisturizers. It leaves your skin glowing. I am acne prone and cannot even dream of putting moisturizer on my face without immediately breaking out but this somehow has never once given me a single pimple. Best to put on at night. It will have your makeup stay on all day which is great, but for oily-skinned people like me, it will make your face oily quickly if put under foundation.</li>
            <li> Good cream, it cover well my face, the dispenser control really well how much you want to use.&lt;br /&gt;The system of the dispenser protect the cream of not being contaminated, because it never expose the cream to the contact of the hand or air.</li>
            <li> it was ok it didn&#x27;t deep hydrate..I gotten better results from cheaper &amp; lesser known-name products.</li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist deep hydration regenerating cream facial moisturizer really works great on my skin. I would recommend it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Burned my face,under one eye is very red,skin on side of my face is peeling away to another layer. Used it for 3 days only, just so strong I guess A waste of 20.00  never again,just wonder how long it will take until its all gone?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of spending big $&#x27;s on other products and really wanted to like the Regenerist product line but it doesn&#x27;t work well on my sensitive skin.  Leaves my skin blotchy and it didn&#x27;t even feel like I applied any mosturizer to my skin after applying this cream and the serum.  That is something given how humid it has been here in the Midwest.  I know this works for others but not for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I used to use Orlane and then switched to Oil of Olay products and I can honestly say that I can&#x27;t see any difference except for the great savings in using the Oil of Olay product. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I find myself returning to the tried and true products which have stood the test of time.  While the Regenerist line is not really one of those, I think it has proven itself, for me at least.  I have dire skin issues since I have been battling Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL) for several years/. It is always a challenge to find a good skin product.  This is a really nice moisturizer and I find litlle difference between the regular version  and the &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; version.  The sensitive may be a tad richer, but other  than that I find them to be equally moisturizing and soothing.  It absorbs well and when my skin feels extra dry I will use it during the day without looking oily.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I have a manly man of a boyfriend. He&#x27;s the shop foreman at a car dealership and he&#x27;s definitely a guy&#x27;s guy. BUT, he hates feeling dry and he moisturizes. Eye cream, too. Perhaps this is why, even though we&#x27;re 10 days apart, I look like a cradle robber. :) I guess the guy who moisturizes makes up for the woman who doesn&#x27;t. No one can believe he&#x27;s 43, he looks like he&#x27;s in his early 30&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw, he calls this &amp;#34;Oil of O&#x27;lady.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is one of the best moisturizers I have ever tried.  My skin is dry and flaky in my T-zone (forehead, nose)in the winter, and this lotion penetrates deeply with just the right thickness to absorb quickly and be effective.</li>
            <li> The best on the market. Although Olay products keep going up I&#x27;m in on this one,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now and LOVE it! I can feel the intense hydration without it being oily or watery.</li>
            <li> I sure wish I&#x27;d read these reviews before I purchased the cream, although because my skin is not sensitive I probably would have felt that my skin wouldn&#x27;t have the break-out reactions experienced by others.  When I first applied the cream, my skin felt great - velvety and well-protected.  Within 15 minutes, however, my face began to itch.  Within two days I had red bumps, some little white heads, and a blotchy complexion.  I discontinued use two days ago and my skin is beginning to recover.  Who knows what they put in this stuff, but I highly encourage folks to avoid it - or at least test it out before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 years old, and I have been using skin care products since I was 16 ranging from Lancome, Clinique, Guinot, Clarins and Estee Lauder. I&#x27;ve spent countless dollars on products that never worked fast enough for me or that I got bored with or that noone seemed to notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after using Olay Perfecting Cream, for just one month I&#x27;ve received so many compliments from friends and strangers on how \\&quot;radiant\\&quot; and \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; my skin is. I love to share my secret: Olay Regenerist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Perfecting Cream at night over the Daily Regenerating Serum and for the day I use the Regenerating Serum follwed by the Enhancing Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take it from someone who has tried everything and give Olay Regenerist a try!</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin soft, doesn&#x27;t do much for wrinkles</li>
            <li> Great product - best price after searching the entire internet!  Look no further.....this product is for you!!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> Love it, quick ship and works better than the other Olay products I have bought. This is my new moisture cream!</li>
            <li> I use this product regularly, bt nt always able 2 get out 2 buy local. I&#x27;m really am looking 4ward 2 getting b4 or just when I need it again. Great offer! And that duznt even count the lesser price--BONUS!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Does it make me look younger? Who knows but it makes my skin feel good. I love Olay products. I buy them here when they are on sale.</li>
            <li> Its Olay and good as always, speedy delivlery</li>
            <li> Love this product. I am pushing 70 and had an in ground pool for 35 years. You can imagine what sun damage I COULD have. But By using oil of olay every day and sometimes twice a day my skin looks great..No winkles around the eyes on hardly any on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Not afraid to look my age but sure is nice to not have alot of winkles...</li>
            <li> Now that I am getting older, I have moved on to the next level in hydration.  Still using Olay products, but buy this for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Olay is quite good for this product and my wife loves it. She applies it every day, and the cost is also reasonable.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about Olay products.  I figured they spent a lot of money on advertising to get people to believe that their products actually worked.  But I&#x27;m 33 and my skin isn&#x27;t exactly what it used to be so I went in search of some miracle creams.  I read all the reviews and tried this one out first.  Within a week I felt a noticeable difference in my skin.  It felt smoother and more moisturized.  After two weeks I swore I started seeing a difference.  I figured maybe all Olay products are like this so I tried the Olay Total Effects Night Firming Cream for Face and Neck, 1.7-Fluid Ounce next.  I am not as happy with that product and am switching back to this one.  The way the cream comes out of the bottle is also great.  I have long nails and was tired of scooping cream out of a jar only to end up with most of it under my finger nail.  I&#x27;ve signed up for the subscribe and save with this product, delivering every two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this at night and couple it with Olay Total Effects Moisturizing Vitamin Complex, 1.7-Fluid Ounce during the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for about 9 months now, and am happy with it.  It&#x27;s light and works well without ever giving that \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feeling.  I use it alone or with makeup, and am very pleased.  I just wish that it had some SPF protection.</li>
            <li> Had never used it, but decided to try it, LOVE IT</li>
            <li> After using this cream for several days, my skin feels softer and looks smoother.  It is very creamy and has a soft sent.  I have been pleased with this order.I will be ordering this cream again.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time, make your face feel great.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive with a tendency to rosacea and I always had problems to find an appropriate cream. I was very nicely surprised to see how good Olay Regenerist is for my complexion. I&#x27;m using it twice a day and there is a tremendous improvement in the appearance of my skin. I truly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Light weight and suitable for night and day.</li>
            <li> Previously I would have given it a 5.  I&#x27;ve used this product for a very long time and I was the envy of all my friends.  I have sensitive skin and found that this product was the only one that worked for me.  They recently changed the formula, now I&#x27;m having a horrible reaction to it.  Burning eyes and my skin started to shed.  Middle of the day it looked like i had a bunch of white tissue fibers on my face.  I&#x27;ve used it for 2 days and i need to send it back.  Please change the formula back!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and what is displayed is not what you get.  The pictures here are of the old product, old formula.</li>
            <li> My fine lines started to diminish the day after I started using this, and my skin feels hydrated. I&#x27;m very pleased, it really does work.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try and hydrate my skin( I have Psoriasis) and its amazing how it helps hydrate my skin.</li>
            <li> Formerly known as Olay&#x27;s Perfecting cream. I&#x27;ve been using this for at least ten years on my combination skin. I think I&#x27;ve gone through about 20 bottles. It sinks in as fast as an expensive moisturizer, and it has a very light fragrance. Some moisturizers sit on top of the skin and leave you shiny. This one won&#x27;t do that. It always leaves my skin soft and smooth. The fragrance can be overwhelming to some people, but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started accutane and my skin is now extremely dry. This is still my favorite moisturizer. When I ran out of my [[ASIN:B003T4OL72 Physiodermie - Oily Skin Cream - 50ml]], I bought Neutrogena, Cetaphil, and Aveeno because my local drugstore did not have Olay in stock. None of those moisturizers measure up to this one. This is my gold standard drugstore moisturizer. Will repurchase over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:&lt;br /&gt;I have never liked the packaging. The cap, the dispenser, and ugh, there is so much product left when you think it&#x27;s empty! I just cut the bottle open and spatula it into an old moisturizer jar that I&#x27;ve cleaned out. Much better.</li>
            <li> wonderful, I can feel it working.  Rated #1 with consumer reports above all the high priced lotions &amp; potions</li>
            <li> I started using this in combination with their night recovery cream. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I look at least five years younger and it has taken away that tired, drawn look.  My skin is softer and brighter.  My wrinkles are much less noticable. More importantly, as I have tried tons of products, it has reduced my under eye circles. This is no small feat. I have super dark blue, very hollow/sunken-in circles that, even with cover up, are still dark and shadowed because they are sunk in. This has plumped up the skin below my eyes, and, in addition to getting rid of much of the wrinkling, it has made it easier to put cover-up on the remaining discoloration, as it has taken away at least half of the sunken in look and the darkness. Really a big difference in only a week of using these products. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 8 years now and i still cant find a better cream than this! I wear it at night and my skin wakes up soft and hydrated. I absolutely love it. The smell is also very nice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many a serum, potion, lotion, cream... every over the counter fit-it on the market and none have had the wonderful effect that this has had!  I know, Iknow... there are those out there who say the effect is fleeting, but I&#x27;ve yet to see it.</li>
            <li> I really like this face cream. The texture is unique and it is not sticky or oily on my skin. I have dry skin and it leaves my face feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> I am elated to have found this product on Amazon and especially to be able to acquire it as part of the subscription program!  I have been using this amazing lotion for the past year, and had been unable to purchase it on a regular basis at the stores where I regularly shop.  I am a frequent customer of Amazon so I did a search for it and was pleasantly surprised to find it!  This cream is one of the BEST I have ever used and I intend to keep it as part of my daily beauty program!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it! The subscription program just sweetens the \\&quot;deal\\&quot; for me!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU OLAY FOR GIVING ME A SMOOTHER, MORE YOUTHFUL LOOKING FACE, AND AMAZON FOR MAKING IT POSSIBLE!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...I wish it came in larger sizes! I have been using it since it first came out. No more expensive Lancome for me!!</li>
            <li> I started using Olay product at the age of 18. Now I am 47, and I still look young. I love this cream because it does not leave your face greasy. My face feel fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and I love it. Not only does it work but it smells so nicely too.  I pay less for it on Amazon than in the stores.</li>
            <li> Always like the Olay Regenerist product line and recommend it. It&#x27;s comparable to the ridiculously priced department store brands at a much better price.</li>
            <li> With multiple health problems contributing to my dry skin this is the only product I have come across that relieves the dry skin and thus the itching that can come from the dryness. This is a treasure among the bundle of those that did not work! Thanks so much for a product that helps!</li>
            <li> I was really excited about trying this new lotion because my skin has been a bit dry. I&#x27;ve used other Olay products without ending up with such severe reaction. First of all the smell is too strong, nice but too strong for the face. It feels as if you&#x27;re putting perfume on your face, yuck. One day after I started using this I ended up wtih multiple tiny bumps(milia/clogged pores) around my chin. The next day my face broke out in larger zits. These didn&#x27;t have white heads, they were just red raised bumps that looked like small/medium sized bumps. My face burned and itched because of these bumps..I have really good skin so this really scared me. It looked horrible like I have problem skin. I took Benadryl but not sure if it really worked. Its been two weeks and they&#x27;re still there. Tiny bumps are gone but breakout on my cheeks is still there. I used glycolic acid products to accelerate exfoliation and I think that&#x27;s working a bit.  I suggest you do a patch test for a couple days before putting it completely on your skin.</li>
            <li> The winter was very harsh where I live in the south of france and my skin was very dry and peeled on some parts of my face. I tried various creams (some very expensive like Chanel) and I found that this one had a much better effect. It is an excellent product just like the \\&quot;Olay Micro sculpting cream\\&quot;. All people having an extremely dry skin should resort to these 2 Olay creams. I am 30 but I have been told repeatedly that I look much younger recently. That might be thanks to Olay!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a daytime face cream, after my aveeno radiance face lotion got over. It was ok, but i wanted to try somehting that brightenes and freshens my face (sadly aveeno just moistened but did nothing else). I got this today and decided to use it on my face for the night. I could immediately notice my face looking brighter and my skin feeling nicely moisturized. It got absorbed immediately and had a faint fragrance. I am planning on using this with a sunblock in the daytime and as a night cream at night. Will update the results. If I do not develop my side effects, will continue to use this as my moisturizer for face.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly understood that this product was a new, never opened bottle...some product was coming from under the sticky tab on the top! What a disappointment!  I have used this product in the past &amp; do like it...however, since it had been opened prior to me...I disposed of it! Who knows where it has been or how much was used.</li>
            <li> I have begun to explore the Olay skin care products as the moisturizers and facial cleansers I usually use have become way too expensive, and friends have literally raved about Olay skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried &amp;#34;Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream&amp;#34; and the results are amazing. I learned that one doesn&#x27;t need to spend $100.+ to get a great result. However, please note that one&#x27;s skin will not show improvement unless used regularly for at least a  few months. It also helps to use a good facial cleanser, (Olay&#x27;s Regenerist line has one), and a toner to restore the skin&#x27;s pH balance. A good toner, (again, Olay has one), will remove any residual oil and cleanser from facial skin. Please believe me, I am not a &amp;#34;shill&amp;#34; for Olay. I am just amazed that their Regenerist line works as well as the very expensive skin products in illuminating the face, fading spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An FYI...Traditional toners consist of moisturizers, oils and extracts that help soothe your skin. Astringents, which are generally alcohol-based, tighten the skin and pores and remove oil. Fresheners work similarly to astringents by tightening the skin, but they are made of ingredients like caffeine and green tea instead of alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fast-absorbing deep regenerating cream really does hydrate one&#x27;s skin. I have been using this cream for 2 months now and I am totally satisfied with the results. This relatively new Olay formula, with a brightening complex, fades the look of dark spots, age spots, sun spots and discoloration. My skin is a lot more evenly toned, brighter looking, and the dark circles under my eyes are lightening. This is not my imagination - I have received compliments, My skin has the same &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; that it did with the more expensive products I used before....and at one third the cost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream facial moisturizer DOES hydrate the skin, providing the total anti-aging power of moisture fused with vitamins and antioxidants. It is color-free, fragrance-free, oil-free, fast-absorbing, dermatologically tested, and non-comedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores). Its rich, non-greasy formula instantly softens the look of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Amino-peptide plus B3 Complex penetrates deep into the skins surface to wake up tired-looking skin. I would recommend putting on the cream while the skin is slightly moist - not wet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer comes in a one 1.7 fl. oz. pump bottle. Use twice daily, after cleansing and toning your facial skin, in the morning and before bed.

            <li> I have used Olay Regenerist Perfecting Cream for over a year now. It leaves the skin feeling very soft without feeling greasy and seems to smooth out the skin nicely. It does not have spf protection so for daytime I use a lighter moisturizer with spf over it before applying my foundation. At night it&#x27;s all you need.</li>
            <li> I started using this product on Thursday morning and loved it. I bought the starter kit with the cleanser, moisturizer and eye cream. The product goes on nicely and smells great. I am 28 and have a lot of wrinkles around my eyes. I was using Bare Minerals but it was too expensive so I thought I would try this. I woke up Saturday morning and my face felt all bumpy. Sure enough my entire face and neck were covered with little red bumps. Disappointed. I hope I can get my $ back. : (</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is a great price! I had it in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing, my skin show improvement the very next morning after using it. skin tone are more even, more moist and less oily. Many people keep saying how good my skin looks which were never happen before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have been using it for over 3 months, maybe the skin start getting use to it, so it doesn&#x27;t show big difference any more. maybe I should change it for something else for a short period of time to compare what would be different. still highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product from Amazon, but I wish I would&#x27;ve so I wouldn&#x27;t have paid full price for it!  After a couple days of use, I had small bumps all over my face and they started to itch/burn around my jaw line!  Silly as I may be, I&#x27;m still using it to see if this is the \\&quot;regeneration process\\&quot; or something and will get better with time.  In the mean time, my makeup reduces the appearance of the bumps, but I can feel them!  They don&#x27;t really itch/burn anymore, maybe I&#x27;m just used to them...  I will probably be going back to Garnier Nutritioniste Skin Renew Daily Regenerating Moisture Cream, which I don&#x27;t think really improves my skin&#x27;s appearance but does hydrate well and makes my skin very comfortable!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I am purchasing this type of cream, the first was very good hydrating and effective but this one is very very perfumed and it is in fact drying out the skin. On the packaging of this one it says new and improved formula. Be careful which one you purchase.</li>
            <li> This goes on easily and feels good. Can be applied beneath makeup and doesn&#x27;t make you look greasy. Have put on automatic shipments.</li>
            <li> Being new to Olay I thought I would try a number of products to find what works for my skin. Microgenerist serum and cream are both excellent and my skin looks and feels great.  This Advanced Anti-Aging Deep moisture coats my skin with a silicone like layer, which after a few minutes starts peeling off and looks like I have eraser dust allover my face.  No foundation liquid or powder can be applied over it without streaking badly.  It is going in the trash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for a year now and my skin looks great!  I&#x27;m 35 so I&#x27;m starting to see the little lines and wrinkles that no woman wants to see.  This noticeably reduces them and just generally firms my skin.  Before I had the beginnings of a double chin from chin sag but not anymore, my jawline is back where it&#x27;s supposed to be!  This is a great product for people who are starting to realize their skin is looking not quite as it once did and want to do something about it.</li>
            <li> ...but I&#x27;m very sensitive to scent and can&#x27;t use it.  This is my one complaint about Olay products.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes and works great on my acne-prone skin. Treats acne when used with the warming mini peel. My skin feels like silk.</li>
            <li> Thjhis is the best moisturizer I have ever used and it is sooo afordable. Easy to order using prime and I have it within a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I tried this because of a beauty article I read.  I like it. I don&#x27;t find it to oily and I used to have acne and very oily complexion. Now I&#x27;m a senior, so I enjoy using it for fine line correction and eye makeup removal. It works as it should; no miracles come this cheaply!</li>
            <li> Well I still don&#x27;t look like Cindy Crawford lol..good stuff though.</li>
            <li> This is a knock off. It is not the true product I normally get in the store. Please refund my money</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and loved it.  However my most recent purchase has been a completely different experience,  The outside packaging looks the same, but there are minor changes to the bottle.  The cream has a much stronger fragrance and seems to leave a coating on my skin.  I have always used this under my make-up, but you can&#x27;t do that with this.  I have canceled my subscription and will be checking the shelves in stores to see if I can find any of the older product.  PLEASE CHANGE THE FORMULA BACK - THIS USED TO BE A GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist products have been dependable for years. Just started using the Deep Hydration Cream. Love it and just purchased 2nd bottle. Love the cream, love the dispenser, but don&#x27;t love how little cream is in the jar.</li>
            <li> 15 years I&#x27;ve been using and loving this face cream! I know I&#x27;m a little bit of a special case with my crazily sensitive, flaky dry, eczema-inflamed  skin but this worked! For a decade and a half I loved it.  I&#x27;ve had it on subscribe and save for as long as Amazon&#x27;s had the service and then, one day, I open a new pack from my horde and it was a greasy, yucky mess that immediately started pilling on my face - nasty, dark curls of oily grossness that constantly need to be brushed away.  It&#x27;s like a layer of filth on my face that makes my sad skin dryer and dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw the label: New Formula.  Why?!?!?! Old formula was the best there was!  Two weeks I&#x27;ve been searching for the old formula without luck.  Now I&#x27;m on a desperate search for a new face cream.  I&#x27;m so sad, I really thought I could be with Oil of Olay forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, all previous reviews are probably for the old and awesome formula.  Try this new one at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have horribly dry skin, and am always looking for a facial moisturizer to help it out. I picked this one because of the &amp;#34;deep hydration&amp;#34;. The texture is nice. Thick, but not super greasy, it feels almost velvety. The smell is nice and light also. However, I notice that after I use it in the mornings, my face is dry again a few hours later. The packaging also makes it awkward to get out the right amount of product. Alas, I&#x27;ll continue my search for a great lotion.</li>
            <li> I love the Regenerist line of Olay! My skin feels great once I put it on and I swear it helps my skin look great. I always  get compliments on my skin, so I&#x27;ll keep using this product!</li>
            <li> I just opened today, the bottle was empty, after pumping many time i managed to get a little spot to do my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time buying from the seller, not sure where the problem started but i will be avoiding this seller from here on.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice cream.  Non greasy and instantly brightens skin.  I even saw dark spot lighten!  A keeper!!</li>
            <li> Oil of Olay Total Effects and Regenerist facial moisturizers are the best! Rich with nice fragrance! They work great for my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this moisturizer for my 93 year old mother. She was very overweight when she came to live with us and had a lot of loose skin under her chin. She had lost over 25 pounds since living with us, and much of the hanging skin under her chin is gone. Although some of this is due to the weight loss, I believe this cream has helped. I have used it on her every night for the last year and a half, and the chin is disappearing in addition to wrinkles on her face. For 93, she looks pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> I agree, this new formula is terrible! It feels coarser and not as moist and worse, they put in perfume!! I thought it was just a variation of the original one and kept looking for the original but can&#x27;t find it anymore. OMG, I don&#x27;t know what to do! I&#x27;ve been using the original for years and just loved, loved, loved it! Why would Olay do this stupid thing?! And I have two bottles of these new formula that I hate...sigh.</li>
            <li> Bought a bunch of Olay skin products and have been using this hydrating deep moisturizer.  I would touch my face during the day and think how smooth and soft it felt, unusually so.  Realized it is due to this regenerating hydrating moisturizers.  It really made a difference in a couple of days.  I had forgotten I put it on the night before.  It seems to produce the results which more expensive products promise and don&#x27;t always deliver on.  I read a dermatologist recommend trying Olay as they spend much $$$ on research so deliver quality products.  This suits my budget.  Like the scent, too.</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m a guy.  And yes, I use a few &amp;#34;Oil of O&#x27;Lady&amp;#34; products - because they work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get a bit of rosacea (not too bad, but more than just dry skin), this product will help.  Use it every day, after every shower, and you WILL see results.  It&#x27;ll also reduce the formation of lines over time, if you use it consistently.  I&#x27;ve tried other stuff, including male-targeted moisturizers as well as other, shall we say, non-male targeted ones, but this particular one has worked, by far, the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, guys - try it!  If you live alone, just have it gift packaged - they&#x27;ll never know it&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li> Good facial moisturerizer year around</li>
            <li> I do like this product but can not say \\&quot;I love it\\&quot; because I am constantly looking for a good moisturizer.  MY face is sensitive and dry and it is difficult to find a product that isn&#x27;t too greasy,too smelly,or too expensive.  I can&#x27;t afford to buy $50.00 moisturizers; I am a retired 68 year old senior living on restricted budget; however I do care to look nice.  I do not like the dispenser, I would prefer a jar and not this pumping action.</li>
            <li> ive been using this product for 5 months its the best damn hydration ever , not just that it also heals scars from acne it takes months to see results but it really works. any1 w/ dry skin or combination skin should use this product...dnt hisitate</li>
            <li> Lovely creamy rich texture that feels wonderful in the skin.</li>
            <li> I love Olay - I try other more expensive products and I go back to Olay.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Makes my skin look great.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product.  It made my face sticky. UGH</li>
            <li> I like it so far - only using it a couple of weeks but I like the richness of it yet it isn&#x27;t oily when applied. I really like the way the cream is dispensed. Very nice!</li>
            <li> The new formula is terrible. Smells awful and feels sticky. Olay, please bring back the original!!!!</li>
            <li> Great basic skin cream that appears to do no harm on sensitive skin - moisturizers without an oil slick</li>
            <li> I have used the Olay line of products for some time.  I&#x27;ve tried many others, some way more expensive, but have found that Olay does a better job at a fraction of the cost.  I&#x27;m pushing 50 and people can&#x27;t believe how great my skin looks!  Thanks Olay!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love. Face is very silky smooth after use.</li>
            <li> This product was touted to be such a superior facial cream.  After using it, my skin did not look or feel any&lt;br /&gt;different than before.  It did not feel at all moisturizing and was very disappointing.  It&#x27;s fragrance was&lt;br /&gt;abysmal.  I am only happy that I did not pay full price.</li>
            <li> I really prefer the old formula, this new one doesn&#x27;t have that same silky feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and I start using this product for a week.  I hope to see changes in my skin soon. The price is good and I fell my skin more soft.  To see the results I have to use it more.</li>
            <li> Every prodduct Olay makes gets high marks up against the products that are twice the price. I love all the products that Olay has.</li>
            <li> I love any of the Olay products.  This was the first time I tried the Regenerist Advanced Deep Hydration Cream.&lt;br /&gt;I am 72y.o. and find that using this product makes my skin so youthful. I use it before bed and in the morning&lt;br /&gt;love the feel and softness of my skin.  Another great product by Olay.  Signed,  Forever Young :)</li>
            <li> Real product. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> Great product; love the applicator. Use is all the time.</li>
            <li> This is the first time ordering this product online as I usually purchase it at Target.  So I&#x27;ve been waiting for this package to arrive and was so excited to find it at my front door.  Well, I go to open the package and notice that some of the moisturize spilled out.  I go to and pull off the sticker and took a wiff and it was WAY TOO perfumey...for me...Strike 1!!  Then I proceeded to squeeze a small amount of the lotion and realized that it&#x27;s greasier than I last remember.  Strike 2!  So I look at the packaging and looked at the logo, the logo is totally different than what&#x27;s on the product I just recieved, which leads me to conclude that this has got to be a fake!! The one I purchase from Target has the OLAY registered trademark (and so does the picture for this product).  The bottle that I have is not what I was expecting.  There is now way I&#x27;m using this on my face.  So glad I read all the other negative reviews before attempting to use this.  My only regret is not reading them before I placed the order...</li>
            <li> So I always know what to bring her when I visit.  Maybe I will even try it soon!  As soon as I finish the latest skin moisturizer I am using.</li>
            <li> I used this product for two days and I woke up to a swollen, bumpy, burning skin. Day two still the same, a little less burn. I will never use anything like this again or anything from this company. I look terrible and feel awful.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Received quickly and painless purchasing at my desk.  No parking!  Love it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product - I wear it when I go to the gym as I feel it&#x27;s light and my skin can breath (or sweat rather!) with it on . . .</li>
            <li> I swear the other day I mistook my wife for a teenager she looked so young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok maybe not that much anti-aging, but it does a dang good job at keeping my wife happy and that makes me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she is happy with her looks, it adds confidence and makes life more enjoyable for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend the money people and make yourself happy with a good hydration cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never have to stare at a greasy face or caked up makeup like a lousy product would do.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, but this moisturizer is amazing. I wear it at night and in the morning before putting on make-up. It smells good and feels good.</li>
            <li> I love anything Olay. I like the way the lotion is dispensed. I&#x27;ve found that all Olay products are designed to get every last drop out of the container.</li>
            <li> very strong cream for mature skin , not for under make up as it will break it up fast.. i use it sometimes for the night , also for my top hand , it make wonder overnight , if you have a very dry skin with some deep lines , it is for you.. after the first use you can experience rolling of your skin down, as it remove the death cells and help regenerate new one faster , using Olay for over 20 years and i don&#x27;t have one wrinkle , they do amazing products...</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this will produce great results but the product smells nice and is not heavy.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with extremely dry skin this winter and had hoped that this well-reviewed product would help alleviate my problem.  Instead the first usage of this product left me with an angry, itchy rash on several areas of my face.  Thinking the cause couldn&#x27;t possibly be Olay, I used it two more times, each time exacerbating the problem.  What a waste of time and money!  I&#x27;m going to share my experience with the company and then throw this expensive cream in the trash.</li>
            <li> The best cream ever! This one really works, amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Nice texture and lightly fragranced.  Leaves skin soft.  Have only used for about a week;  no miracles so far, :), but I like the product.</li>
            <li> Product recommended for me &amp; can&#x27;t wait to try it?</li>
            <li> It does its job at keeping my face skin moist while not clogging the pores. I was specifically looking for something like this and this works out just fine. I do notice that it makes my face a bit more pale when I put it on so keep that in mind whether you want that or not.</li>
            <li> As ALWAYS in this country. We pay tons for what they say will happen, and nothing or ALMOST nothing is what we get. This is better than nothing, but only as a good moisturizer and an expensive one at that, but as for wrinkles and blemishes.....POOR as always.&lt;br /&gt;It just amazes me that we must spend a billion dollars on these products for wrinkles and NONE of them do anything that you can see without a microscope.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m one of the fools that pay my money to find one also and never ask for my money back though they do NOTHING for wrinkles!! NOTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t cause acne or blemishes to form, so for that I&#x27;m grateful as many other products do.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Not the same product I had before. I scanned the one I had before everything looks the same but the product was different. I hated it. Made my skin appear more oilly the an normal and felt thick.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s great for my extremely dry skin. I prefer it over Clinique, which is&lt;br /&gt;super expensive. Keeps my skin moisturized, and lives up to its claims. It is a little&lt;br /&gt;heavily perfumed, which I could do without, but the product works very well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great product.</li>
            <li> Love the way this cream smooths over the face - will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for several years now.  I am 60 yrs old and have no noticeable wrinkles ! It really hydrates well.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my skin</li>
            <li> I have the dry skin type, so this soft cream is very suitable for me. Especially I loved the package with doser. Very good moisturizer! I would like to buy another products from this line.</li>
            <li> At first, I was delighted with how smooth and moisturized my skin was. I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any skincare product, but I sure have to this one. After about a month&#x27;s consistent use, I noticed my cheeks became increasingly reddened and rough but thought that was due to my having been ill for about a week and lapsing on regular skin care as well as our having had unusually dry weather for most of the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having read similar reports in these reviews, I eventually realized that it was this stuff that was making my skin rough, red and pebbly-textured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went back to my old standby and far less expensive Cetaphil cleanser and lotion. Within 48 hours, my skin began looking more normal with only a bit of lingering redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be wary. A patch test may not produce an immediate reaction. One wouldn&#x27;t have for me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND WILL REORDER AGAIN AND AGAIN.  IT WORKS LIKE I WANT IT TO.  KEEP IT UP OLAY AND AMAZON WHERE I CAN BUT MUCH CHEAPER.  THANKS!</li>
            <li> great price just received today but i love the olay skin care line so im sure itll be very effective</li>
            <li> This was a great price. The saying goes, you get what you pay for. This package came in pretty rough condition. Even looked a little dirty!  The bottle was backwards in the packaging. Well I used it. After a little while my face was all broken out! I&#x27;ve used this for years, I still do. I threw this stuff out!!! Whether this was counterfeit or tampered with, I don&#x27;t know. DON&#x27;T buy this! Buy it at the store!!</li>
            <li> I really like the consistency. My skin has improved so much during the last two weeks. Good bargain price. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The product felt wonderful on my face and neck, but I noticed it smelled a little &amp;#34;too&amp;#34; good. After two days of use, my face was broken out so much that I looked like I had hit puberty overnight. If fragrances don&#x27;t irritate your skin, you may be fine, but I&#x27;d look at purchasing another product if you&#x27;re prone to breakouts. I took some Claritin and quit using the cream, my skin was pretty much back to normal after a few days. I have some latent irritation, though, on my neck.</li>
            <li> Great value, really like this product.  Not greasy feeling, economical to use.  Keep my face young looking and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> The perfume in this product was so strong that I had to return it.  My eyes were watering!  if Olay would make a version without perfume, I would try it again.</li>
            <li> The Regenerist in the round bottle that depenses from the top.Pink in color.&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It mosturizes! My husband touches my face and says it feels silky and velvety. That was my first clue that it was working(1-2 months into using it daily)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It won&#x27;t break you out. I have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)The smell is amazing!! It reminds me of a spa(luxury feeling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) The cost. My bottle last so long and you should see me breaking it apart to get every drop when the bottles almost gone! What a great commercial that would be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other regenerist products that did&#x27;nt work and broke me out. Above is the decription of the container.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find sometimes.I think the secrets out! he,he.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer. It makes my skin soft all the time.</li>
            <li> A light moisture and does the job, the fragrance is pleasant. a good moisturizer under makeup.  The price is a lot cheaper than the same product in the store.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!! I could see a difference within the first week. Used to use Mary Kay products, but switched to Olay when my rep moved. I will continue to use this - seems to do the trick!</li>
            <li> I used to be a Mary Kay user until they discontinued the regular moisturizer. I tried many other brands but kept coming back to Olay - because I have really dry skin. It&#x27;s a much better value then Mary Kay expensive products that they have forced their customer base to one expensive product - instead of lower priced options. I also need something that will work that doesn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin. This is now the brand I will use at a fairly good price.</li>
            <li> I love this product.It ads so much moisture to your skin/face without looking shiny.  Withing minutes your skin feels so soft and the tiny lines look softer!  I&#x27;ve used this a week or longer and I can honestly say I am seeing the results....even in the deeper wrinkles on the upper lip and at eye point.  I will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> My skin is finally happy.  I really like this moisturizer.  It goes on smoothly, soaks in quickly, and seems to be working well!</li>
            <li> Have tried an awful lot of night and day moisturers.  So far, this one is working, especially since the air is so dry, with the heat on.  Would recommend this product, unlike other products, this one seems to sink in and make my skin glow.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin so I use it primarily for that, rather than anti-aging. My t-zone still needs help even using it, but I like it.</li>
            <li> I use this every night since I received it. My skin looks so much better. Faded age spots. Wrinkles less noticeable. Skin feels soft. I go without make up more often now.</li>
            <li> Horrible since the formula changed this year. I used it for years but not any more. It&#x27;s like paste now and it has an odor. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied ,my face got even worse,went to Ulta ,starting using dermalogica , very Happy!</li>
            <li> Smooths out the wrinkles.  Softens your lines.  A great product that I have bought for years.  I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and I meet alot of strangers in my job each day.  They think I am in my 30&#x27;s.  A great product</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Not excellent packaging.  No way one can use all the cream (deliberate design?).  Screw on lid would be much more convent and economical (for the customer).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of facial moisturizers over the years, expensive and drug store brands.  This is my favorite.  I am in my early 50&#x27;s and have always had very dry skin, so it&#x27;s tricky to find a moisturizer that works for me to the point where I only use night creams.  But this one is great!  It goes on silky smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.  It absorbs quickly allowing for easy application of mineral foundation.  It also lasts all day for me without my skin ending up feeling tight and dry by the end of the day.  And within a week or so of starting to use it, my skin felt so much softer and smoother.  I highly recommend for anyone with very dry skin at any age.  LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Thick and creamy, very rich.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years and people tell me I look 10 years younger. I have noticed that when I STOP using it for awhile, then use it again, I get flaky skin for a couple days. This is the product sloughing off old skin. This &amp;#34;regeneration&amp;#34; of new skin constantly is what makes it effective. Also it isn&#x27;t greasy!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t do without this cream. It&#x27;s perfect: non-greasy; absorbent, makes your skin feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> This works great on my dry skin, I use it 1-2 times daily. It&#x27;s thick but absorbs pretty quickly and leaves my skin feeling good. Do make sure to use a mirror though, if you miss rubbing any in completely you get thick white streaks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many moisturizers and many brands, and this is one of the best. Softens fine lines and truly nourishes skin. I saw a difference within one week.</li>
            <li> I use only Olay to keep my wrinkles in line.  Even my dermatologist recommends Olay.  No need to spend lots of money on the expensive brands.  Olay works as well as they do.</li>
            <li> Very nice, its for a friend and she is much more happy with the Regenerist line that any others.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> A very good moisturizer, use it at night and in the morning my face is very smooth.</li>
            <li> For now,  I will give it a two. The morning after I applied the product for the first time, my face was very red. Like my face was sun burned. I continued to use it every day,  thinking it was working it&#x27;s magic. This morning, 6 days later, my face felt like it was completely dried out and scabbed over. Like I got a chemical peel. Is this how it is supposed to work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update!! Changing the stars! It&#x27;s getting two more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for a week, I gave my face a break for a week then started again; using it once a day in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product because I&#x27;m a pale girl that loves the sun. I am 34 and I&#x27;m starting to get those big brown age spots on my face and it&#x27;s super oily but dry and flaky at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You guys, after just three weeks, only two of them with the product, I flaked off a piece of dried skin and it was an age spot. This stuff works!! My face has been a bit more active on the break outs but I figure it&#x27;s my skin adjusting to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try. I think I&#x27;m going to incorporate the whole regenerist line into my routine.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay Regeneris products for several years and been pleased. I tried this one and found that it has a nice texture that is easily absorbed and feels very nice, But it has a very strong perfume that I find unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, so I am very careful with new products. I love the texture and the density of the moisturizer, and it&#x27;s not oily.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion and works nicely. Unfortuately it is perfumed and I dislike the smell. I have senative skin and I am usually sensitive to perfumes; this one does not seem to bother me and I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> great product great price</li>
            <li> I am very disatisified with this product.  It comes on thick and chalky and did not leave my skin moisturized.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This works great for me. I love that it makes my skin feel silky smooth not oily. Different moisturizers for different people..this is the one for me.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion I use it every morning and night and it makes my skin feel soft and smooth. Easily dispenses a perfect amount.Not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product, it works tremendously well and keeps me looking younger!!! I wouldn&#x27;t do without this!  My skin feels so soft and supple~  THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I love the Olay Regenerist line! Moisturizes your skin and makes it smooth. You will see a big difference after the first use! I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years now and just recently started the serum and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but it&#x27;s not the best for me.  I tried it because I prefer its pump bottle format over the jar that my night recovery comes in.  This product gave me tiny clogged pores, almost like milia on both cheeks.  Also, the fragrance is a bit overpowering for my allergies and asthma.  So I&#x27;m back to the Regenerist Night Recovery treatment, which is a much better choice for me.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER had sensitive skin and have tried well over 100 different skin care creams, serums and treatments in the last 15 or so years. I have even been using Olay Touch of Sun daily moisturizer for months with no ill effects. BUT - the Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating cream is HORRIBLE. I used it once in the morning and once again that night. The next day I had little bumps covering my neck, forehead and temples. It has been 4 days and they are still there. It looks like lizard skin at the moment and I have never been more horrifed. My upper lip even swelled in the center. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT - ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li> I got this as part of a Christmas gift for the lady in my life.  She loves this stuff and loves me for getting it for her!</li>
            <li> The cream itself is great. Softens with a rich deepness to it and renews skin surface. If you&#x27;re young-get a life &amp; enjoy it.If you&#x27;re my age, try a product with a less strong fragrance. I hope they come out with their fragrance-free version soon as it is a superior product otherwise. Use by itself, or after Olay definity.</li>
            <li> The most important thing for anyone to be aware of when first trying this product is that you have to be patient for results. At least that is what happened to me. I started using it on the third of November, 2008 and at first I thought that I had just purchased another run of the mill, empty promises, face cream. I stuck with it anyway, mostly because I ran out of all of my other creams and did not have the funds to purchaes more. That turned out to be a good thing for me because after 2 weeks I started to see an amazing difference in my skin. Mostly when I woke up in the morning. I was used to avoid gazing in the mirror at my tierd looking skin and dark circles.  But now I can see dramatic differences, my reddish spots disapeared, my dark circles are much lighter, the fine lines around my eyes are smoothing out, my lumpy forehead that I was beginning to dispise is soft and youthfull again, and the scaly dryness from living in Colorado is gone. And today as I write this review is the day before Thanksgiving and I must tell you that I even feel comfortable not wearing any makeup!!!! I highly recomend this product to anyone who feels like giving up on their skin, just give it a few weeks and it will surely pay off!</li>
            <li> With once daily use, this size lasted me just over 2.5 months. This was very lightweight and nongreasy. I am 30yo, and have mildly dry, but not problematic or sensitive skin. I didn&#x27;t notice any changes in my skin over time, but it did keep me hydrated.</li>
            <li> Had purchased this cream from the grocery store several times and fell in love.  Purchased two containers from Amazon and they are expired!  The container looks the same except the cap is a different color.  The cream feels TOTALLY different on my face and I will discontinue use.  It does not absorb and sits on top, leaving a filmy and somewhat sticky white residue on my skin that slowly clumped up and felt like it peeled away over the course of the day.  I looked in the mirror part way through the day and saw white clumps!  I was not wearing makeup on top of it, so it had to be the cream.  Nearly $40 down the drain.  I&#x27;ll buy it from the grocery store from now on.</li>
            <li> I used Estee Lauder for 15 years with great results but tried Olay Regenerist on the advice of a friend.  I had been using it for 9 months and absolutely loved it and the price was great, but the last one I bought was different.  There is a hint of an added fragrance that irritates my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling hydrated like it did before.  Why did they change a perfectly great product?  I won&#x27;t be purchasing this anymore.</li>
            <li> I have used this wonderful moisturizer for years and never had a complaint. I have recommended it to friends as it was light, did not irritate my sensitive skin, was non-greasy, did not cause break-outs, didn&#x27;t have a strong scent and worked very well under make-up. HOWEVER, they have gone and changed the formula and what you get is not the bottle pictured. It is now super greasy and scented and putting make-up on top of this this morning was almost impossible. If I were more vain, I would have been sending my husband on an emergency run to the drug store, but I just hate to pay drug store prices after so many years of subscribe and save on Amazon. I did my best with it and headed out for the day. Thankfully I only had to be out in public for the morning because this afternoon my foundation is so patchy and looks like it flaking off, while still looking super greasy. I am not impressed at all. I didn&#x27;t think to keep the packaging to return it. I just put it in the cabinet straight out of the box when my subscribe and save shipment gets here, so I can&#x27;t return it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be irritating my skin or clogging my pores in these short few hours I&#x27;ve worn it. I&#x27;ll keep it and use it for emergencies if my night cream runs short or something. Not impressed, Olay. Not impressed. I see a lot of other people having the same issues. If you find the perfect replacement, please let me know.</li>
            <li> For many years I used another brand for my skin, I have dry skin and the older I get its becoming drier.  I have never had a blemish problem and just about any product was good.  But this is the BEST I have ever used.  Nice fragrance, just a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I used the Olay skin cleanser, moisturirzer, daily cream and night cream.And just about to purchase another bottle to eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the outcome of using these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katie Finch&lt;br /&gt;Winter Haven, Fl</li>
            <li> I cannot get by in winter without face cream and this is perfect.  i do not wear face makeup and this leaves my skin looking great and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this product! And the delivery was quicker than was indicated on the order.</li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;With a name like that, Olay promises a mouthful. About the “Advanced Anti-Aging” part, there are peptides in it to speed up the production of collagen. On their website Olay says the cream will improve the look of fine lines in just 10 minutes! After a few days, you get dramatic results! After 4 weeks you will look 10 years younger! Imagine that! Unfortunately, I can’t testify to any of that.&lt;br /&gt;Then there’s the Deep Hydration part and the Moisturizer part. I admit I don’t know the difference between them. Do I want to hydrate my skin or moisturize it? Isn’t it basically the same thing?&lt;br /&gt;The cream is okay as far as moisturizers go.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is not very pleasant but fortunately dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again? Probably not. I will continue to try others.&lt;br /&gt;Olay should get the Golden Cocoon Award. You not only get 1.7 once of cream but plenty of plastic, metal and high-gloss paper. I took the pump bottle apart and photographed it with some parts of the packaging (see photo below). I would prefer paying less for a simple jar with screw cap.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this makes my skin feel.  But!  I have very sensitive eyes and there is something in this stuff that makes my eyes irritated if it gets too close to my eyes, or if I touch my face and then touch the corner of my eye.  So, I have to be very mindful of where I apply it.  Seems to be ok as long as it stays below my cheek bone.  If it&#x27;s the fragrance that&#x27;s getting to me.....wish Olay would drop that ingredient because otherwise I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for year and it has really made a difference.  I used to tan at least 4 days a week for four years while I was a college cheerleader, so my face had cheer lines as well as early aging from exposure.  I took a break from using this product and could really see a difference in my skin!  Now im back at it and already love the results!  and buying it with my Amazon Prime account, I dont have to wait for a sale to purchase!  LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> My face is always dry and I really like how these feels on my face and it keeps my skin moist.  I buy this on subscription I like it so much.</li>
            <li> Does a great job moisturizing, but leaves traces behind, which turn into itsy bitsy crumbs when applying my makeup with the sponge.</li>
            <li> For our daughter....she loves this!</li>
            <li> Thick like body butter.  Not light. Did not absorb well.</li>
            <li> I actually use every morning under makeup.  Works great</li>
            <li> A few weeks after a milestone birthday this winter, my previously oily acne prone skin became dry , flaky and I noticed a very fine line on my left cheek. I live in New England where the harsh winters wreck havoc on our skins. Horrified I threw out my salicylic based cleanser and moisturizer and bought this hydration cream hoping to regenerate my degenerating skin. I would slather it in the morning at 8 am and it would go on smooth and my skin would look shiny. But  by 10 my skin would feel tight, look flaky and show white patches .Yet the only time I spent outdoors was two minutes to get to and from my car!! I was so desperate to believe the consumer reports that I carried it with me and kept on re-applying more but my skin never improved. I was very disappointed in this product because it does not do any hydration at all!! I bought it specifically to moisturize my dry skin and all I got was a strong face perfume (it has a very strong smell). I am desperately looking for a cream for my dry skin , for now I am using Olive oil!!.[...]</li>
            <li> It is a very nice basic moisturizer product.&lt;br /&gt;The way it is dispensed is a little bit peculiar, but I have grown fond of that as well.&lt;br /&gt;I quite enjoy the &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish of this product after application, and this works very nice if you need to put more layers on top of that.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they have this product in fragrance free form as well, don&#x27;t know if anyone from P&amp;G will ever read this.</li>
            <li> Have used this for 5 months and have seen a difference. I have sensitive skin and use hypoallergenic so I buy the fragrance free style. It actually does as advertised. I am very impressed. I am 64 and have seen a noticeable improvement in texture.  It is worth trying and the price is reasonable compared to other products. I have never used Olay products before, and am thrilled to find these results at such a reasonable price. I use it with their Pro X scrub and small white brush that spins. Together, with a few other of their Regenerist products, and WOW!</li>
            <li> Positives:&lt;br /&gt;-The moisturizer hydrates very well.&lt;br /&gt;-Smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;-Pricey.&lt;br /&gt;-The fragrance is a bit overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;-No SPF.&lt;br /&gt;-The formula is a tad bit on the greasy side.&lt;br /&gt;-Product has also caused me to break out a little bit. Never really had any pimples present until I used this product more frequently. This may be due to my sensitive acne prone skin, but that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Good product, but you can spend the same amount of money and buy a better moisturizer that&#x27;s non comedogenic and has an SPF. Also, the texture is a little too thick for my taste. You only get a small amount for the price. The bottle only lasted me for about month. I&#x27;d rate this product as average.</li>
            <li> Like all of the Olay Regenerist products this moisturizer is great!  It goes on smoothly, and lasts through my day.  It&#x27;s great under my light makeup.</li>
            <li> As good as more expensive products</li>
            <li> A mainstay in my everyday routine.  I&#x27;ve used the whole Olay Regenerist line for the last 10 years or so.  Maybe that&#x27;s one of the reasons I&#x27;m frequently mistaken for 53, instead of the 63 that I am.  Love, love the Regenerist line</li>
            <li> Soaks in, good product, small amount comes out when you push the top, so no waste or contamination. I like Olay products</li>
            <li> I have been using this since it first came out and swear by it. Needless to say, I was delighted to find it so inexpensive on Amazon. I hope they continue to have at such a low price...</li>
            <li> I got this for a stocking stuffer for my mom.  She has been wanting the Olay Regenerist for a long time, but would not spend the money to get it for herself.  I decided to get it for her because of the good price and product.  Olay has been around for a long time.  Good product!!!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone with dry skin.  It relieves the tight, pulling feeling of the skin on my face.</li>
            <li> It is not to heavy and is gentle on the face - My face already feels better. It does not break out your face (this was a big concern)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive lotions and creams on my face, but I really love this one the best.  It leaves my face feeling and looking very soft.  I also love the way you just press the top and the lotion/cream comes out....you don&#x27;t have to dip your fingers in a jar or touch what&#x27;s left in it.  All creams and lotions should be this way...I hate having to dig out cream in a jar with my fingers not knowing if I&#x27;ve left any germs in the remaining cream.  I recommend this.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to. I usually use the Oil of Olay Age Defying Day Lotion with sunscreen but I decided to try this. I like the scent of it (it is NOT unscented) and the texture is soft. I feel it sits on top of my skin longer than the other one does but it makes my skin feel softer than the other one does and isn&#x27;t quite as heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall good product and experience!</li>
            <li> I am twenty-four and have used this product for a year. It has made a dramatic difference in the clarity and radiance of my skin. I am customer for life!</li>
            <li> This is fantastic and makes the skin look lighter/bright and younger... in that way almost works as a primer and makes makeup-less faces look better  :)</li>
            <li> I suppose everyones skin is different... But if you have dry skin year round like me, I definitely recommend you to try it! I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now, It makes my skin glow after it sets in. It also helps my foundation/bb cream go on smoothly and flawlessly. The smell is also very pleasant! (:</li>
            <li> I am a long-time user of the all natural type of moisturizers (like Kiss your face, Jasons, pure aloe, etc) so have avoided this type of product that seemed to be more chemical-based.  I got a free sample somewhere or other and there&#x27;s no avoiding that it works much better than the all natural products I&#x27;ve used for years.  The things I don&#x27;t like are how expensive it is and not that impressed with the weird pump up design, if you get too much, you can&#x27;t put the pricey stuff back.</li>
            <li> I love Olay products and again this is one more great one.  I highly recommend it for all.  I love it on my skin.</li>
            <li> a little spensivebut i love this products let my skim soff and my husband love to thanks&#x27; this is my second time buy this products</li>
            <li> I think the Regenerist is a great product.  I have very sensitive skin which gets a lot of redness with products.  With Regenerist, there is no problem.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time.  It is such a nice weight moisturizer.  I use all the regenerist products and have great results!</li>
            <li> i like it... simply nice cream... make bright your skin...but leaving wrinkles)...heheh&lt;br /&gt;But next time try Loreal... under eyes...Or nother Olay</li>
            <li> If you love smooth skin this is the one.  I am a senior soon to be 75, and I am getting compliments from everyone.  Thank you Olay.</li>
            <li> Just love it! I have a sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve always broke out, even from very expensive creams! This one fits my skin like a glove</li>
            <li> This product is too fragrant and too many ingredients I cannot pronounce.  Not a good sign for something going on my face.</li>
            <li> Great lotion and leaves my face feeling so soft and smooth. Not sure about getting rid of wrinkles cause I don&#x27;t have too many but it&#x27;s definitely great lotion and I&#x27;m hoping it prevents the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Well,  I had ordered 2 of these moisturizers..... from 2 different companies...... I received them both around the same time.... I noticed 1 of the bottles had a seal over the dispensing hole and the other did not.... i looked at them carefully and also realized THIS one was much lighter than the other one, along with No seal on it.....The description said it was NEW but I have my doubts now.... There was a significant difference in weight when holding them in each hand.....The description did say the BOX could have some minor cosmetic details.. which it surely did..... but Im not worried about the box, i only cared about the product....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you happen to order from them, just make sure their products have a safety seal on the lids.</li>
            <li> I prefer this Olay moisturizer to others I have tried.  I often get compliments asking what kind of cream I use.  It provides a smooth surface on which to apply my foundation.  I have used more expensive creams in the past, but have decided they&#x27;re not worth it compared to this product.</li>
            <li> this again is a lovely product for my wifes moisturizing.  She loves it.  she loves it..  she loves it..loves it</li>
            <li> I love it.  it makes my skin smooth and wrinkles less noticeable</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me - I tried it and was delighted - nice thick cream that goes in well, is not oily and does not shine, but FEELS good in the skin.  When I apply this, I feel like I am doing something GOOD for my skin.  Hard to explain but I really REALLY like it.  Bought my sister and my mother some and they like it too.  Much better than a lot of the really expensive creams that do not feel nearly as nice.</li>
            <li> love this creamy lotion that relieves the tightness of my skin!</li>
            <li> I have been an Oil of Olay user for decades, I&#x27;m 61, and with very dry skin in last few years I tried this just recently. After 3 coats of this I still had skin so flaky it was very visible.I went back to my Nature&#x27;s Gate herbal moisturizer which seems to work better than anything I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> I used this for many years and loved it, but they changed the formula in 2013 and this new and improved version made my face hot, dry, red and irritated after three days of use. I called the company and they are sending me coupons for $26 worth of their other products, which I do also use. I am sad because it was a great cream and I never had a problem, but this new version has more fragrance and is thicker, and apparently something I&#x27;m too sensitive for. If you&#x27;re sensitive, be warned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for a moisturizer but doesn&#x27;t do anything to help with wrinkles</li>
            <li> love it for years now. it goes nicely under my make up too</li>
            <li> I used to love this face moisturizer, in fact, it was my only go-to.  Since I first started buying, they changed from the original light Olay fragrance to a terrible perfume and unfortunately, I&#x27;m so sad to not be able to wear it because of &#x27;scent&#x27;sitivity.  Either bring back the original fragrance, or do a fragrance free.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, GOOD CARE OF SELLER. I RECOMMEND 100%</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many moisturizers but this one is my favorite. I can see a big difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is the greatest. i noticed a difference right away. Use in morning and at night. Better then some moisturizers. Seems like you put them on and its not there anymore. Love it</li>
            <li> This is a very good product...wife uses it everyday.  She looks younger and more beautiful than you can imagine.  She loves how it makes her skin feel.</li>
            <li> Would you believe this was recommended to me by my 95 year old aunt, who has used it forever and still has skin that glows?&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely dry skin, and nothing has worked until I began using the two Olay products she swears by from Olay.&lt;br /&gt;I put this cream on in the morning and my makeup glides on. Thanks, Aunt Martha!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. The cream is very nice, the skin is very delicate, the texture of the skin smoother. Almost no odor. I&#x27;m still happy. For wrinkles do not know, I use recently.</li>
            <li> I get this for my mom (who&#x27;s in her mid 40&#x27;s) (and I use it from time to time as well) and we both love it. Right away putting it on you can see a difference the finer lines just start disappearing. The more you use it the more it starts melting years off! This bottle also lasts quite a while, my mom goes through about one of these every 2 to 2 and a half months and that&#x27;s with me using a bit every now and then!</li>
            <li> This product is great and easily absorbed by skin. It smells great, and my skin feels more moisturized and softer.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this product ...  i have been using it for years and will not change unless they stop making it ..</li>
            <li> This was nothing special. I used it for a few days and didn&#x27;t notice any hydration more than normal. After the 4th day I started breaking out pretty badly and had to stop using it. Going back to my Estee Lauder Day Wear which is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I was randomly sent this cream, the eye serum and the cleanser in the mail after winning a giveaway.  I&#x27;ve been thru a litany of moisturizers, always on the hunt for the perfect cream.  This is the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far and I&#x27;m not sure I will be looking anymore as long as this keeps working!  I honestly and truly see a difference in my skin and I&#x27;ve only been using it for one week.  My skin looks smoother and younger (I&#x27;m 37) and I even feel it has made my pores less noticeable.  No wonder they keep this stuff under lock and key in the drugstores!  It really works!!  Love it!</li>
            <li> This product is a fake!  I have been using play regenerist for years and have always purchased at a retail store.... It took less than a minute to realize this is a total fake! There is not even a registered trademark label.... Doesn&#x27;t even look real!! The horrible smell and quality of the lotion is not even close to the quality that I have been purchasing from the REAL Olay line.....extremely disappointed:(</li>
            <li> great on face and lips</li>
            <li> I have always used Olay face wash and I have always loved it! That said I have been using Olay Regenerist night cream, mico-scuplting cream and serum for a month now and am just figuring out that it is the probable cause of my recent bad skin issues. I have always had good skin-- a few little pimples here and there that are always hormonal, but since using this stuff my skin is the worst it has ever been. I have tiny little bumps all over my face-- cheeks, forehead, nose, chin-- they are not zits and they are skin colored or red. When I touch my face it feels rough and uneven and I am self conscience about it. I feel like for the first time I have bad skin and feel like I have to put on a lot of foundation to cover it up. My sister uses the same product and hasn&#x27;t had any problems, so something in my skin is reacting to an ingredient in the product. I still love Olay, but I would say you should be careful with this product. I have found several people online having the same issues. I am going to give the rest of it to my sister and find something else for me. I guess it isn&#x27;t for everyone-- hope you don&#x27;t have the same problems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a crunchy hippie, so I normally shy away from drugstore products, or anything that isn&#x27;t simple and natural. But, I bought this in desperation when I was in my tiny hometown over the holidays, with no natural stores in sight. My skin was SO DRY, I couldn&#x27;t even wait a couple of days for shipping. I researched all of the skin creams available at the big box retailer that is the only shopping option in this town, and this one had the best reviews, so I gave it a try. Despite &amp;#34;wanting&amp;#34; to go back to my more expensive natural creams, I like this better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. Not only does it hydrate deeply, it&#x27;s made my skin look better in other ways, as well. It looks radiant and breaks out less-- something that is high praise, considering how troubled by skin has always been! I doubt I will ever stop using this.</li>
            <li> What can I say, I don&#x27;t use it but my lovely bride likes it.  From my point of view she doesn&#x27;t need it but I try and go with the flow.  Price is better on Amazon than anyplace else I have found, up to and including eBay.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  This product is often hard to find in the local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this product for a number of years, and it leaves my face feeling so soft!  And, I love the smell!  Also, love the dispenser -- dispenses just the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry</li>
            <li> This is a nice, hydrating moisturizer, but the jar design doesn&#x27;t work you to see how little product is actually inside.  I used it two weeks, and suddenly nothing more came out of the strange little pump.  Too expensive foy such short use.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  My mom used to use it.  I tried it and now use it every night.  It&#x27;s good for day and night.  I don&#x27;t feel oily or over moisturized when I use it.  Use it sparingly and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I love it, best value for product results</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Olay Regenerist is the only moisturizer I&#x27;ll use on my face. It&#x27;s the only one that seems to really work and combat my dry skin. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough! It smells lovely, too.</li>
            <li> I used to love this product, but the formula change does not work for me. It doesn&#x27;t absorb as well as before, and tends to sit on the top of my skin to the point that it creates almost a film which gets gummy when I apply make up (and I use very little make up). I have been a loyal customer for years, but now will have to find a new mousturizer. I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the woman loves this.</li>
            <li> My favorite night time cream</li>
            <li> You gotta love Olay products. I always love Oil of Olay I just wish the pro x products were a little be cheaper.</li>
            <li> This is magnificent!  I am 56 with very fair skin and somewhere along the way lost my &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34;. I reevaluate my skin care and makeup every year at my birthday and recently decided to try the Regenerist products. I use the Deep Hydration as day cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning, I cleansed, used the skin tightening serum, and moisturized with this product.  I was sidetracked before I could start my makeup, and when I returned to my dressing table, immediately started choosing a lipstick. It wasn&#x27;t until I had applied the lipstick that I realized I had no foundation or blush on!  What!!!???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complexion has improved drastically.  No more redness on my nose and chin.  I don&#x27;t need to use a primer before foundation.  I barely use concealer anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the pre-measured dispenser top, and that this does not have an SPF (I find them irritating) or fragrance.</li>
            <li> Ths works so well on my dry skin and the price was really good compared to every other place I checked.</li>
            <li> It seems whenever I buy face care products I always try something different because nothing I buy ever seems to make an impression (unless its a bad one). But I saw this ranked on some website so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try - I&#x27;ve never spent so much on lotion before, esp. for such a small bottle. But I love, love, love the way my face feels after putting it on. Not to mention amazon&#x27;s price thus far has been the cheapest I have found it (unless you can come across a coupon somewhere).</li>
            <li> Love, love, love! Highly recommend this product!  I have sensitive skin, and I can use this lotion twice a day with no oily spots or breakouts!</li>
            <li> This product is a good buy when compared to the pricier products on the market.  I saw on the Today show on NBC quite some time ago that this moisturizer is as good at the leading salon products</li>
            <li> This item the same as it describe.My mother like it very much.It is good for skin.She use it every day.But when I contact seller,he doesn&#x27;t replay me.</li>
