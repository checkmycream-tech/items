            <li>Good job Nicci Marie Skincare!</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve got a happy face, and a happy face is a good thing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice moisturizer, not silicon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for an alternative to retinol in an anti aging cream that also contains effective percentages /combinations of peptides at a price that doesn&#x27;t break the bank; once again Nicci Marie nailed it!  </li>
            <li>LOVE it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Nicci Marie Skincare is an AWESOME skin care line!!!!</li>
            <li>Feels good on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what Matrixyl 3000 is, but it&#x27;s good stuff</li>
            <li>I absolutly loved it</li>

            <li>Smells really nice, moisturizes nicely........will keep using it</li>
            <li>Goes on nice.  </li>
            <li>Feels great on skin, and has a nice clean scent</li>
            <li>Love it,it works.</li>
            <li>like but more of a cream like feeling that soaks into your face within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Love it over the serum.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t like the product as it needs to have more moisterizing elements that help to plump up the skin.  </li>
            <li>I am SOLD :)</li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It is very creamy and smooth with a great smell.</li>
            <li>Compared with other companies,this was the best price.</li>
            <li>Good, decent face cream.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and leaves a non-greasy feel.</li>
            <li>I did find out about this through that because I was looking for a light moisturizer/serum.</li>
            <li>I use three products currently and can&#x27;t say enought great things about how they work with my skin</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple days now and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, no garbage ingredients, and you use very little each time.</li>
            <li>I am now using the cream and so far, am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I like how this moisturizer goes on, and the peppermint in the formula makes skin feel clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>It is a little sticky but in a good way!</li>
            <li>Lovely, light texture and pleasing fresh minty scent leave my skin feeling hydrated but not heavy.</li>
            <li>but it actually sits pretty nicely on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the slightly mint refreshing feeling too.</li>
            <li>Used for more than 3 weeks with no noticeable difference from other, more reasonably priced, moisturizers/serums.</li>
            <li>Makes my face soft and smooth, yet not greasy.  </li>
            <li>kinda smells like medicine at first</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, I did use it in combination with their hyaluronic acid serum and it does work pretty well in combination.</li>
            <li>first i bought NICCI MARIE hyaluronic acid serum.</li>
            <li>Its texture is soft and like light face lotion.</li>
            <li>First of all as I start to put in on my face</li>
            <li>Overall,  I think so far this moisturizer is pretty great and is helping reversing some of the current aging I already have.</li>
            <li>However, since it&#x27;s only been a couple days and because I am rather young, I don&#x27;t really know how effective it is against wrinkles, etc.</li>
            <li>If you have very dry skin, that may be a negative thing, but for my combination skin it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells very minty, almost like you&#x27;re rubbing a candy cane all over your face.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much aging on my face</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more when I get low, which is pretty soon now.</li>
            <li>every day,the result is obvious from the very first day of use.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a couple of days so far, and I really like the way</li>
            <li>Skin more plump a nd firm.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Feels smooth on face and skin feels toned and tight and hydrated.</li>
            <li>My face feels Amazingly soft after using, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>My face remains soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nicci Marie offers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple of days and can already tell a difference in the texture of my skin especially the areas that that have lines (between the eyebrows and laugh lines).</li>
            <li>I bought this with good reviews posted, and I have been using this for a week, but unfortunately, I can&#x27;t see any change my face.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The best price. Compared with other companies,this was the best price. Love it,it works.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells very minty, almost like you&#x27;re rubbing a candy cane all over your face. It&#x27;s a very nice moisturizer, not silicon like but more of a cream like feeling that soaks into your face within 5 minutes. It also tingles in the beginning, so use a little bit if you have sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple of days and can already tell a difference in the texture of my skin especially the areas that that have lines (between the eyebrows and laugh lines). I&#x27;m 32 so I don&#x27;t have much aging on my face but I have enough to want to take care of it and limit the amount of aging to come. Overall,  I think so far this moisturizer is pretty great and is helping reversing some of the current aging I already have.</li>
            <li> I just received my Nicci Marie moisturizer.  It is very creamy and smooth with a great smell. My face feels wonderful. Great find !</li>
            <li> I like the Anti Aging cream.  It goes on smooth and leaves a non-greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Smells really nice, moisturizes nicely........will keep using it</li>
            <li> Arrived timely.  Goes on nice.  Feels good on the skin.  Used for more than 3 weeks with no noticeable difference from other, more reasonably priced, moisturizers/serums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for an alternative to retinol in an anti aging cream that also contains effective percentages /combinations of peptides at a price that doesn&#x27;t break the bank; once again Nicci Marie nailed it!  I&#x27;m 49 with sensitive skin; this cream is very light / silky typically associated with very expensive brands and absorbs immediately without any irritation.  I noticed reduced pores and skin tightening by 3rd day without any redness.  Nicci Marie won me over with their Hyaluronic Serum and has now become my first go to source for cutting edge anti aging skin care.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels great! Love it over the serum.</li>
            <li> just what I wanted. I had purchased before and this is a very good product. Makes my face soft and smooth, yet not greasy.  Price is also great for a product I am pleased with.</li>
            <li> My face feels Amazingly soft after using, not greasy at all. I love the slightly mint refreshing feeling too. I use it last after using hyaluronic acid serum made by same company.</li>
            <li> I like it but the Moisturizer leaves my skin dryer  then I like it to be.</li>
            <li> Feels smooth on face and skin feels toned and tight and hydrated. Worked well under foundation.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few days and my skin feels so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Nicci Marie Skincare is an AWESOME skin care line!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of days so far, and I really like the way if makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple days now and so far so good. I was concerned that it might be too heavy for me because I have oily combination skin but it actually sits pretty nicely on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t make me any oilier than I already am. I didn&#x27;t break out from it either, so that&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effect:&lt;br /&gt;Instead, it moisturizes and leaves a slightly moist/dewy touch. My face remains soft throughout the day. It is a little sticky but in a good way! I personally like it. However, since it&#x27;s only been a couple days and because I am rather young, I don&#x27;t really know how effective it is against wrinkles, etc. It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent:&lt;br /&gt;It kinda smells like medicine at first but then after a couple pumps, the minimal amount of peppermint oil they added comes in to mask it. Not the best smelling thing but I don&#x27;t mind it too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I did use it in combination with their hyaluronic acid serum and it does work pretty well in combination. I did find out about this through that because I was looking for a light moisturizer/serum. Good job Nicci Marie Skincare!</li>
            <li> 5 Stars - Received the Anti Aging Cream promptly. I am now using the cream and so far, am very pleased with the product. I have very sensitive skin and it has not caused a problem. I like the texture and the way the cream feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> Good, decent face cream. I felt it was a little high priced.</li>
            <li> Lovely, light texture and pleasing fresh minty scent leave my skin feeling hydrated but not heavy. If you get dry winter cheeks like I do, you&#x27;ll appreciate the way this cream makes your face feel.  I don&#x27;t know what Matrixyl 3000 is, but it&#x27;s good stuff - I&#x27;ve got a happy face, and a happy face is a good thing!</li>
            <li> Have used this for just one week and can see a difference! Skin more plump a nd firm. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Feels great on skin, and has a nice clean scent</li>
            <li> I like how this moisturizer goes on, and the peppermint in the formula makes skin feel clean and fresh! Doesn&#x27;t break me out like other anti-aging stuff has. Not oily or greasy. If you have very dry skin, that may be a negative thing, but for my combination skin it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like the product as it needs to have more moisterizing elements that help to plump up the skin.  For me this was quite pricey.  How can I return it and receive a refund.</li>
            <li> Love this line of products! Excellent quality, no garbage ingredients, and you use very little each time. I am SOLD :) Looking for trustworthy websites to look up products for safety? Here are two: http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ and http://www.goodguide.com/</li>
            <li> Love love love Nicci Marie offers. I use three products currently and can&#x27;t say enought great things about how they work with my skin and I&#x27;m over 65! Try everything!!</li>
            <li> first i bought NICCI MARIE hyaluronic acid serum. I absolutly loved it i got the compliments every day,the result is obvious from the very first day of use. then i bought this anti age cream. i am 29 and and its sooooooooooo super!thanks a lot</li>
            <li> I bought this with good reviews posted, and I have been using this for a week, but unfortunately, I can&#x27;t see any change my face. This cream is supposed to moisturize my face, but I don&#x27;t feel it does. I have a dry combination skin. I am using it at every night, but it doesn&#x27;t moisturize my face cuz I can feel dried on face when I wake up in the morning. Its texture is soft and like light face lotion. Actually, this is not a type of face creams. I will not buy this product again and I oily recommend this for oily type skin who has. Who said its smell is good???? there is no scent, and this product is over charged to compare to another products. I didn&#x27;t check this product&#x27;s amount before I decided to buy. It only contains 30ml!!! it is too expensive with infamous reputation. I will never buy it again...</li>
            <li> I saw this product as I was looking for something on Amazon and after reading the reviews I thought I would give it a try. First of all as I start to put in on my face I notice it feels like velvet. It goes on so smooth and creamy. I love it.  I notice already how some of the  lines between my eyes and around my mouth have already started to soften. I will definitely be ordering more when I get low, which is pretty soon now.</li>
