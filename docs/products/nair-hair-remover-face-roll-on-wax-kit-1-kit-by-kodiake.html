    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m just happy</li>
            <li>To be honest, the application is great</li>
            <li>I sure wish I had checked the reviews before I bought this!</li>
            <li>I might give it one more try tomorrow</li>
            <li>I followed the directions precisely, and I&#x27;ve been doing my own waxing for years, so</li>
            <li>You would have better luck with self created honey and sugar scrub.</li>
            <li>Ok, let me rephrase that....</li>
            <li>...guess that does make for easy clean up.</li>
            <li>When I bought this product, I was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li>This was a product I was excited about</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pay full price for this.</li>
            <li>The only good thing is that it didn&#x27;t lie about being water rinsable</li>
            <li>After 4 perfect tries and following directions to the letter, not one hair came off my face.</li>
            <li>I did everything right, everything according to the directions, but no dice.</li>
            <li>The cloth strips slide right off of the wax, and they do not pull your skin at all, let alone your hair.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly</li>
            <li>However, I realized that if I tried it without heating it first, it works somewhat.</li>
            <li>it very watery and doesnt even pull my hair on my eye brow</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try it out because I had used other Nair products in the past and been very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I was completely ready to fall in love with it until I discovered that the entire process doesn&#x27;t actually remove any hair.  </li>
            <li>I tried it several more times thinking maybe I didn&#x27;t apply enough wax or that the wax was too cool, but had the same results.</li>
            <li>Luckily I got this half-price on the clearance rack of my local drug store.</li>
            <li>and I managed to get some halfway decent chunks of hair out.</li>
            <li>I got excited because the process is A LITTLE fun.</li>
            <li>you are stuck with the product like I was, I may be able to help you out (a little).</li>
            <li>I had spent like forever in the drugstore looking for something cheap to do my eyebrows with...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time or money with Nair, NADS works a hundred times better.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to remove ANY hair, it was a joke and waste of time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your time or money.</li>
            <li>On top of that, in the few minutes it was on my face, the area became REALLY red and sensitive and</li>
            <li>Do not waste your $$, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions to the letter, but when I went to pull the first strip, not one single hair came out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You will most likely have to pluck the remaining (or at least I did).</li>
            <li>With most waxing products the wax is very sticky and difficult to remove from your skin, but this stuff is not even sticky at all</li>
            <li>Do not get me wrong, it is nothing spectacular.</li>

            <li> The strips simply get wet by the \\&quot;wax\\&quot; and it will not grip the hair at all.</li>
            <li> This product was a complete waste of my time and left me with a giant mess.  </li>
            <li> I am just thankful for everyone else&#x27;s reviews because after trying this product I was extremely upset and it is at least somewhat comforting that I am not the only one who this wax kit did absolutely nothing for.</li>
            <li> It did not remove one single follicle, and I gave it multiple tries.</li>

            <li> All that was left was a mess on my eyebrows and a pissed off me.</li>
            <li> and it was just a big mess with no results.</li>
            <li> Did not remove a SINGLE hair!</li>
            <li> I certainly should have done my research prior to making the purchase, but unfortunately it was an impulse buy while at the store.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how this company can even continue to sell this product when it assuredly does not remove a single hair despite repeated trials and extensive review of the instructions.</li>
            <li> i was expecting better :(</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s messy, does NOT remove the hair, and the strips simply soak up the sugary liquid mess which they, for some reason, refer to as a &#x27;wax&#x27;??</li>
            <li> And wouldn&#x27;t that be extremely unsanitary??</li>
            <li> When I say nothing, I mean not a single hair was removed.  </li>
            <li> I tried it 6 times and it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time or money on this completely useless product.</li>
            <li> and I just wasted like 6 bucks on nothing.</li>
            <li> waste your money!</li>
            <li> I was at Walmart about to buy my usual wax but saw this for a bit cheaper and on a whim decided to try it.</li>
            <li> i wish i could get my money back, also i wished i saw the reviews before buying this useless</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> so the horrible mess wasn&#x27;t hard to clean off.</li>
            <li> It is useless and NAIR should be ashamed to have their name on such a poor product.</li>
            <li> it is the quality of the wax that sucks.</li>
            <li> Given the 18 terrible reviews below I don&#x27;t believe I am going to be able to add anymore information about the absolute failure of this product but its so awful</li>
            <li> Disgusted that I spent almost ten bucks, when the pre-waxed strips are about six.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, by the time I saw the reviews, it was too late</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, waste of money.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of the worst purchases I have ever made.</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair removal product I have ever used, and I have used quite a few.</li>
            <li> BAD CHOICE.</li>
            <li> When I got home and tried to use it I was SO disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very disappointing</li>
            <li> But it is worthless and DOES NOT pull off hair</li>
            <li> It is AWFUL.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Awful awful.</li>
            <li> Terrible product - does not pull hair out.  </li>
            <li> Worst stuff ever!</li>

            <li> This product was a complete waste of my time and left me with a giant mess.  I was completely ready to fall in love with it until I discovered that the entire process doesn&#x27;t actually remove any hair.  after some research online I found that other people performed the steps correctly, as I did, and got the same result.... no hair being removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I followed every direction that was provided. I got excited because the process is A LITTLE fun. But it is worthless and DOES NOT pull off hair what so ever. I tried it 6 times and it was a waste of money. I will never buy this again</li>
            <li> When I bought this product, I was so excited to use it. I have this habit of letting my eyebrows go for a while and when I saw this on the shelf I grabbed it. When I got home and tried to use it I was SO disappointed. After 4 perfect tries and following directions to the letter, not one hair came off my face. All that was left was a mess on my eyebrows and a pissed off me. This was a product I was excited about but now, I will never buy another nair product again. Please do not waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> https://hundredforever.wordpress.com/2015/05/24/to-wax-or-not-to-wax/</li>
            <li> I bought the Nair roll on wax for $10 at a local grocery store because it was the only wax product there. I was very excited to try it out because I had used other Nair products in the past and been very satisfied. I followed the directions to the letter, but when I went to pull the first strip, not one single hair came out. I tried it several more times thinking maybe I didn&#x27;t apply enough wax or that the wax was too cool, but had the same results. I wish I had checked the reviews before purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even think this product deserves one star. I followed the directions to the letter and not one hair was removed! Complete waste! Don&#x27;t bother buying it!!</li>
            <li> Definitely one of the worst purchases I have ever made. Did not remove a SINGLE hair! I&#x27;ll never buy a nair product again.</li>
            <li> i got it n it very watery and doesnt even pull my hair on my eye brow i was expecting better :(</li>
            <li> I decided to try this instead of the strips that already have wax on them.  BAD CHOICE. Followed the instructions to a tee and nothing happened.  When I say nothing, I mean not a single hair was removed.  Disgusted that I spent almost ten bucks, when the pre-waxed strips are about six. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money with Nair, NADS works a hundred times better.</li>
            <li> If I could give one star, I would. This stuff does not work. It FEELS like wax... sticks to the cloth... but then, when you yank it off with that satisfying motion, the hair is all left behind! I did everything right, everything according to the directions, but no dice. I tried several different ways, different angles, etc. It MIGHT have pulled off one hair in the eight or nine attempts I made. Do not waste your time or money on this completely useless product. I can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re allowed to sell this and claim it works. Jeez.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Walgreens at 50% off. I needed a waxing product for my upper lip. I followed the instructions exactly and it was just a big mess with no results. I might give it one more try tomorrow but I am extremely disappointed. I&#x27;m just happy I didn&#x27;t pay full price for this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Nad&#x27;s wax strips for years, but recently bought this roll-on wax since it was the only wax at the store. It is AWFUL. The cloth strips slide right off of the wax, and they do not pull your skin at all, let alone your hair. It did not remove one single follicle, and I gave it multiple tries. What a disappointment! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Save yourself some time and money, and go with the wax strips from Nad&#x27;s, because those always work for me.</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair removal product I have ever used, and I have used quite a few. it&#x27;s messy, does NOT remove the hair, and the strips simply soak up the sugary liquid mess which they, for some reason, refer to as a &#x27;wax&#x27;?? It is useless and NAIR should be ashamed to have their name on such a poor product.</li>
            <li> Luckily I got this half-price on the clearance rack of my local drug store. But I wish I could get even that money back. I followed the directions precisely, and I&#x27;ve been doing my own waxing for years, so I know how to do it. It didn&#x27;t remove even one hair. The strip seemed to soak up all of the wax instead of helping it to remove hair. On top of that, in the few minutes it was on my face, the area became REALLY red and sensitive and burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awful awful.</li>
            <li> Is there any way I can get my money back!? I followed every single direction and it was a complete waste! I was at Walmart about to buy my usual wax but saw this for a bit cheaper and on a whim decided to try it. I am so upset with myself that I did! It was a sticky mess and the strips just slipped right off with absolutely NO hair removal! The only good thing is that it didn&#x27;t lie about being water rinsable so the horrible mess wasn&#x27;t hard to clean off. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT USE YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE!</li>
            <li> Terrible product - does not pull hair out.  To be honest, the application is great it is the quality of the wax that sucks. I tried to pull out hair on my upper lip 5 times with no luck.  Do not purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Given the 18 terrible reviews below I don&#x27;t believe I am going to be able to add anymore information about the absolute failure of this product but its so awful and I was so pissed when it didn&#x27;t work AT ALL that I felt compelled to share my experience. I am not sure how this company can even continue to sell this product when it assuredly does not remove a single hair despite repeated trials and extensive review of the instructions. I certainly should have done my research prior to making the purchase, but unfortunately it was an impulse buy while at the store.</li>
            <li> I had the same experience as everyone else. The strips simply get wet by the \\&quot;wax\\&quot; and it will not grip the hair at all. With most waxing products the wax is very sticky and difficult to remove from your skin, but this stuff is not even sticky at all...guess that does make for easy clean up. I am just thankful for everyone else&#x27;s reviews because after trying this product I was extremely upset and it is at least somewhat comforting that I am not the only one who this wax kit did absolutely nothing for. Very disappointing, waste of money.</li>
            <li> Worst stuff ever! Do not waste your $$, it doesn&#x27;t work at all. You would have better luck with self created honey and sugar scrub. And I have no idea how they can claim the strips are reusable - how?? And wouldn&#x27;t that be extremely unsanitary??</li>
            <li> I really wished I read the reviews before I wasted my money it doesn&#x27;t work at all it&#x27;s very disappointing</li>
            <li> I wish I had purchased this product from Amazon. Ok, let me rephrase that....I wish I had &amp;#34;shopped&amp;#34; for this product on Amazon (and passed it up). Unfortunately, by the time I saw the reviews, it was too late and I was stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, if you have not opened the box and can return it, DO return it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are stuck with the product like I was, I may be able to help you out (a little). This product, if used as the directions instruct, does NOT work. However, I realized that if I tried it without heating it first, it works somewhat. It occurred to me, why am I heating it if it is already in liquid form. So, I tried it cold/room temp and I managed to get some halfway decent chunks of hair out. Do not get me wrong, it is nothing spectacular. But, if you are stuck and need to get something done in a pinch...try it without heating first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will most likely have to pluck the remaining (or at least I did). However, in an effort not to just throw the product away (and your money with it) you might try this &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34; method first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> i wish i could get my money back, also i wished i saw the reviews before buying this useless product.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work. The hair wont stick to the glue/gel/wax. I wasn&#x27;t able to remove ANY hair, it was a joke and waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;i have experience using wax hair removals, but I deiced to give this a try because of the roll concept.&lt;br /&gt;i wish i could get my money back.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t buy this product! it wont do anything.</li>
            <li> I had spent like forever in the drugstore looking for something cheap to do my eyebrows with... I saw this and I immediately brought it home...&lt;br /&gt;I followed every single direction, and placed the tube in boiling water, I put it on my eyebrows, and NOTHING HAPPENED.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves the product on your skin and the strip just gets wet.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the stupidest thing ever and I just wasted like 6 bucks on nothing.</li>
            <li> I sure wish I had checked the reviews before I bought this! It doesn&#x27;t work. The wax just doesn&#x27;t seem to dry and the strips just get wet with the wax but do not remove the hair. I paid $10 something at Walgreens. Waste of money!</li>
