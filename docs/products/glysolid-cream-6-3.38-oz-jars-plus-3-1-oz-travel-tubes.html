            <li>you just have to try this cream on your hands and soon you&#x27;ll feel 1000 X better.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for 20 years and have found nothing better to keep my feet and heels from cracking.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best cream around.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipper!</li>
            <li>No odor, and will leave your skin silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>My feet, elbows and hands are baby smooth.  </li>
            <li>If I want to smell pretty, I use a perfumed cream on top of this.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m impressed, enough that i&#x27;ve been buying this for nearly 20 years now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great for the feet too especially if you are one that rarely wears socks and/or shoes</li>
            <li>The price is right and the tubes are convenient for travel,  </li>
            <li>I purchased enough glysolid cream so that most of my family can use it during our winter</li>
            <li>When I came back from Christmas vacation, all they could talk about was how much better their hands felt.</li>
            <li>first introduction to this was from my mother.  </li>
            <li>Simple as that! :)</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Glysolid cream has always worked very well for my husband and myself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very healing esp in the winter months because we are both in the Heath Care profession.</li>
            <li>They were very grateful to try anything that might help.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product and helps to keep your hand skin from cracking during the cold weather.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Glycerin does truly grow new skin cells.  </li>
            <li>I put this on heavy at night with gloves and my hands stay soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Soft as a baby&#x27;s booty!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I could do such a small thing for my friends and give them so much</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s obvious that this nearly pure glycerin hand cream has been a miracle cure for their hands.</li>
            <li>My knees and elbows are soft as a baby&#x27; bottom.</li>
            <li>I have been using GlySolid for nearly 2 decades now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>gave me my first tin of this stuff and ironically enough a year later when i saw her again</li>
            <li>If used consistently, it will make rough spots soft again.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using it ever since and to this day my hands are still not rough</li>

            <li> a little greasy, but that is the nature of it, as a super thick emollient.</li>
            <li> so my hands are wet and dry constantly.</li>
            <li> I used this cream on my dry and cracked heels.</li>
            <li> If your hands are dry, cracked and bleeding...</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and</li>
            <li> We are also building a house ourselves and when handling rough wood and cement blocks I wear leather gloves which dry out my hands.  </li>
            <li> I lather this on after my shower every other day, and cannot believe the difference in the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Also, I carry the little tube in my purse at all times.</li>
            <li> and they both told me they use it EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li> My husband gets bad cracks on his feet and this cream really takes care of those.</li>
            <li> I did not receive my 3 small tubes for my purse can you correct this?</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding it wholesale.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and my feet dry out and crack horribly.</li>
            <li> They have some secret to their formula.</li>
            <li> Between all the hand washing and the frigid temperatures we&#x27;ve had in New England  this winter; their hands were red and cracking and very painful to them.</li>

            <li> I used this cream on my dry and cracked heels. I had tried several creams, nothing worked. I started using the Glysolid,&lt;br /&gt;and was amazed. I would rub it in after my shower,  or I would rub it in before bed. My heels and feet look like they did when I was eighteen! Absolutely beautiful. I also put it on my elbows. I would not recommend using as a body lotion, however, you could mix it in with your body lotion.</li>
            <li> I love it. Finally, I found the cream that will protect my hands and feet from drying in the winter.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t survive without Glysolid. I groom dogs for a living so my hands are wet and dry constantly. This is the only product I have found that works so I&#x27;ve stuck with it.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best cream around.  Both my husband and I use this.  No odor, and will leave your skin silky and smooth. I lather this on after my shower every other day, and cannot believe the difference in the texture of my skin.  If I want to smell pretty, I use a perfumed cream on top of this. Also, I carry the little tube in my purse at all times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years on both my hands and feet nightly. When I could no longer buy it in town conveniently I did an Amazon search. The price is right and the tubes are convenient for travel,  Thanks</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased with my order. An excellent source to buy from! I purchased enough glysolid cream so that most of my family can use it during our winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again, &amp; God Bless,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Glysolid cream has always worked very well for my husband and myself. It&#x27;s very healing esp in the winter months because we are both in the Heath Care profession.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and my feet dry out and crack horribly. This product is amazing, transforming my damaged heals overnight. Nothing compares to it with similar ingredients. They have some secret to their formula.</li>
            <li> I am a flower gardener and don&#x27;t like to wear gloves.  We are also building a house ourselves and when handling rough wood and cement blocks I wear leather gloves which dry out my hands.  I put this on heavy at night with gloves and my hands stay soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I love this product :)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 25 years.  It is the best!!  My feet, elbows and hands are baby smooth.  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!!!</li>
            <li> Quick shipper! Love them!</li>
            <li> My husband gets bad cracks on his feet and this cream really takes care of those. Works on elbows too.</li>
            <li> I bought these for 2 of my friends who work in a factory and need to constantly wash their hands. Between all the hand washing and the frigid temperatures we&#x27;ve had in New England  this winter; their hands were red and cracking and very painful to them. They were very grateful to try anything that might help. When I came back from Christmas vacation, all they could talk about was how much better their hands felt. They both wanted to know where I found this wonderful hand cream and they both told me they use it EVERYDAY. It&#x27;s the 1st thing they put on in the morning and the last thing they do at night. Their hands look so much better and it&#x27;s obvious that this nearly pure glycerin hand cream has been a miracle cure for their hands. I&#x27;m so glad I could do such a small thing for my friends and give them so much comfort.&lt;br /&gt; If your hands are dry, cracked and bleeding... you just have to try this cream on your hands and soon you&#x27;ll feel 1000 X better.</li>
            <li> I use this myself and resale it in our salon. I have a hard time finding it wholesale. It&#x27;s the only thing that heals my hands and feet. I&#x27;m a hairdresser. Water all day with chemicals. It is the best!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> Nothing but nothing compares to Glysolid.  Glycerin does truly grow new skin cells.  I&#x27;m both a gardener and a hairdresser and it is my hands saving grace.</li>
            <li> Im a auto technician so you can imagine what my hands go through on a daily basis with this lotion once a day before i go to bed they stay looking like i wash dishes for a living. The seller sucks comment is because at this point i still havent received my order, i have used this product for years is the reason i can give a positive comment about the lotion.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of lotions for my skin condition and this glycerin is in great absorbable medium leaving skin softer so to heal.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for 20 years and have found nothing better to keep my feet and heels from cracking.</li>
            <li> My cuticles look great. My knees and elbows are soft as a baby&#x27; bottom. I have extremely dry skin and this stuff works!</li>
            <li> excellent service product as described</li>
            <li> I did not receive my 3 small tubes for my purse can you correct this? I waited thinking it would come but it did not</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and helps to keep your hand skin from cracking during the cold weather.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> excellent cream. a little greasy, but that is the nature of it, as a super thick emollient. truly fragrance-free, which is essential. great stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using GlySolid for nearly 2 decades now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first introduction to this was from my mother.  I was an electrician for 2 years at the time and she noticed that i had \\&quot;working hands\\&quot;.  LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She gave me my first tin of this stuff and ironically enough a year later when i saw her again she asked if i had changed to an office job.  I told her my career had not changed, but apparenly, my hands did.  Soft as a baby&#x27;s booty!  LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i&#x27;ve been using it ever since and to this day my hands are still not rough are are soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know, not a manly thing, but i&#x27;m impressed, enough that i&#x27;ve been buying this for nearly 20 years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for the feet too especially if you are one that rarely wears socks and/or shoes/flops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just give it a try.  90 days.  I&#x27;m confident you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Been using this for 25 years. Best lip cream ever. Use once a day and you will have perfect, soft lips.</li>
            <li> The perfect handcream!</li>
            <li> this product is awesome for hands but excellent for rough elbows and  bottom of feet.  If used consistently, it will make rough spots soft again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed w/the out come of the product. Good price, quick shipping, and the size of containers are an added bonus. I&#x27;ll be a return customer.</li>
            <li> The only thing that makes my feet human! Simple as that! :)</li>
