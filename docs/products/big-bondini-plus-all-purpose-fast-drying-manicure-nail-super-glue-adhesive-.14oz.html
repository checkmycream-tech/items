            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>Worked great.</li>
            <li>This stuff is good.</li>
            <li>You want some good nail glue that doesn&#x27;t let your nails flip off buy this.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because of all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>Im sure it would be great</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this glue!</li>
            <li>good strong bonding...</li>
            <li>Polish applies smoothly over the glue and you can&#x27;t tell the nail has been repaired at all once polish has been applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It holds really well better than the glues that you buy at the drugstores.</li>
            <li>It felt like I was putting super glue on my nails.</li>
            <li>, it can be filed off completely, leaving a whole, healthy nail edge.  </li>
            <li>works great but didnt realize how small the bottle really is</li>
            <li>The glue is good, but was almost empty when i receive it !!!!</li>
            <li>Make sure you always have a safety pin in case the tube gets clogged, and always wipe the tip off before recapping because it will dry shut.</li>
            <li>You can only see that the nail has been repaired if you look up close and very carefully, so long as you bother to smooth out the patch of glue and gently buff it and the nail to blend the edge.  </li>
            <li>Best artificial nail glue out there!</li>
            <li>When the glue came out, it was all stringy like it was old!</li>
            <li>my acrylic nails lasted for about two weeks and felt really sturdy while doing daily tasks.</li>
            <li>So far, do good, but it&#x27;s hard to get off the other parts of your hands!</li>
            <li>i mean its teeny tiny great quality small quanity</li>
            <li>the chip/split/peeled part of the nail with the glue grows out far enough</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this glue! my acrylic nails lasted for about two weeks and felt really sturdy while doing daily tasks. Knowing now the quality of the glue, I would buy the larger size with a brush. The problem with the small bottle the is you have to use a needle type tool to keep the nozzle clear or else the glue builds up and clogs the small hole.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too clumpy and hard to apply neatly. It felt like I was putting super glue on my nails. It did hold the break for a week but then the glue flaked off.</li>
            <li> Product as described.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the .5 oz at that price</li>
            <li> This stuff is good. It holds really well better than the glues that you buy at the drugstores.</li>
            <li> The glue is good, but was almost empty when i receive it !!!!</li>
            <li> Im sure it would be great but my bottle came EMPTY. Like nothing was ever in there empty not just dried up. It&#x27;s an infuriating feeling.</li>
            <li> Came two weeks earlier than expected! Works great but the bottle is a lot smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> This is the only Nail Glue I have found that works so well.</li>
            <li> So far, do good, but it&#x27;s hard to get off the other parts of your hands!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm to mend the nearly constant split in a weak part of one nail.  All of my nails tend to peel, even when I keep nail conditioner on them, so I decided to try this glue since it works so well on the split.  It works for that too!  You can only see that the nail has been repaired if you look up close and very carefully, so long as you bother to smooth out the patch of glue and gently buff it and the nail to blend the edge.  Polish applies smoothly over the glue and you can&#x27;t tell the nail has been repaired at all once polish has been applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you take off your polish, the glue will thin and may lift up around the edges, but once the nail polish remover is washed off and your hands are dry, it&#x27;s no problem to put another dab of glue on the damaged area of the nail and buff out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the chip/split/peeled part of the nail with the glue grows out far enough, it can be filed off completely, leaving a whole, healthy nail edge.  Using a nail conditioner on the rest of the nail over the dried glue does not make the glue peel off, or it least it hasn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two very small &#x27;cons&#x27; to this nail glue:  1 - the bottle does tend to gunk up, but using a pin to remove the bit of glue that stays in the neck of the bottle after you use it and storing the bottle upright helps to keep this from happening.  2 - the glue doesn&#x27;t dry all that fast and you have to wait a few minutes before smoothing out the line between the nail and the glue with a nail buffer.  Those are two very tiny flaws that are not worth considering, especially if you have problem nails like mine.</li>
            <li> good strong bonding...I am very impressed with this nail glue..</li>
            <li> You want some good nail glue that doesn&#x27;t let your nails flip off buy this.</li>
            <li> Best artificial nail glue out there!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of all the good reviews. Well when I got this in the mail and started to use it, there was hardly any glue in the bottle! It was all in the back and I had to sit there and squeeze it out and hardly any came out! When the glue came out, it was all stringy like it was old! Not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Worked great. I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> works great but didnt realize how small the bottle really is i mean its teeny tiny great quality small quanity</li>
            <li> Make sure you always have a safety pin in case the tube gets clogged, and always wipe the tip off before recapping because it will dry shut.</li>
