            <li>i absolutely love this stuff, i could never find anything to help with the tangles in my hair till now</li>
            <li>my hair is. :)</li>
            <li>The smell of it was overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Love this product, was given a sample to try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently tried about three detanglers and this one was the best.</li>
            <li>wish I would have ordered more for the price they had on here</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell</li>
            <li>It smells really good, a kind of tropical fruity scent, I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on the scent and how shiny and soft</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing to my hair except make it smell good.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good detangler that was free of a lot of alcohol (something that had the most natural ingredients), preferably a conditioner</li>
            <li>make sure that you are fully satisfied and if you are dissatisfied give yourself and sellers a chance to offer refund or resolve issues first before leaving seller feedback.</li>

            <li>it seemed to cause frizz and light shedding this</li>
            <li>Also smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>, this is a definite must have i will be buying more the best stuff ever thanks so much</li>
            <li>Made my hair very silky, smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li>I LOVE the way it smells and, although irrelevant, even the color is nice (would make a great color for the kitchen walls *</li>
            <li>this product previously worked great when I tried the bottle my sister purchased offline, but when I received and used the Edens leave in purchased here</li>
            <li>This product caught my eye because I was looking for a more natural detangler.</li>
            <li>I want to make it clear that Amazon is one of my favorite online shopping stores</li>
            <li>in mind I had used this product before purchasing it here on Amazon, and my previous experience had been good</li>
            <li>I really like how this  leave in conditioner makes my hair feel!</li>
            <li>decided to purchase this product here on Amazon note if it does not say verified purchase that maybe because when I first created this review it was before I purchased it here</li>
            <li>One detangler I tried was twice the price of this one and it only did okay</li>
            <li>Makes detangling my hair during a relaxer stretch much easier</li>
            <li>Really untangles my hair and refreshes it too.</li>
            <li>The powerful spray nozzle could more than likely be switched out to a different nozzle.</li>
            <li>Even when all of the new growth I have it still softens my hair and allows me to detangle with much ease.</li>
            <li>Usually, the ingredients listed within the first five make up most of the product.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin or even if you don&#x27;t, make sure you are careful when you are spraying it, use your hand or something to shield your face.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to certain smells, then I would not recommend it to you.</li>
            <li>I was looking for somewhere to purchase these items since I live in Hawaii and the one place that sells them here had doubled the price.</li>
            <li>this makes my new growth and relaxed hair so manageable and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I did my first review I had used the product second hand,</li>
            <li>I purchased it for my little one&#x27;s hair which gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li>As far as detangling, I guess it is helping</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s making it a lot easier to detangle my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>Finally someone came out with an all natural hair relaxer for those of us that still prefer straight hair over the natural look.</li>
            <li>my sister and I both have natural hair and we often share and recommend products to try my sister</li>
            <li>so I wanted to continue using this leave in to help prevent tangles in my natural hair&lt;</li>
            <li>The spray nozel on this is powerful, meaning that a lot comes out per spray and the range of the spray is wide.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually good at taking my own advice but sometimes there are still occasional shopping mishaps, just be careful to avoid annoying shopping mistakes like the one I had with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually good at taking my own advice but sometimes there are still occasional shopping mishaps, just be careful to avoid annoying shopping mistakes like the one I had with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sensitive to smells, but as I was using this product, I kept coughing even though I wasn&#x27;t spraying that much.</li>
            <li>and I feel fairly certain that I received an old formula or watered down counterfeit version of the Creme of Nature</li>
            <li>When using it on my little one&#x27;s head, I now only spray it on my hands and  distribute it throughout her hair or I spray it on the brush or comb first then comb through her hair.</li>

            <li> also take your time testing the product before leaving positive or negative feedback</li>
            <li> Just right for my very thick, long, kinky-curly gray hair.</li>
            <li> point is just be aware of the potential of receiving watered down or fake, even old formulas of products, just because it looks like the real product doesn&#x27;t always mean it is.</li>
            <li> My point is just be aware of the potential of receiving watered down or fake, even old formulas of products, just because it looks like the real product doesn&#x27;t always mean it is.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I would definitely recommend this product I will buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I even use it on dry hair after its straightened.</li>
            <li> but after my experience purchasing this product I&#x27;ve learned that there is the potential to get fake or counterfeit products here or watered down versions of the real product old formulas etc</li>
            <li> previously did not happen when I used the product before, and though the product seem to smell the same it appeared separated meaning the liquid would not mix together well even after vigorously shaking it.</li>
            <li> I have applied it both to my hair when it is wet and when it is dry.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not feeling that product, then the other I would recommend using is the Just for Me Hair Milk detangler.</li>
            <li> I would not trade it in for any other leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on my little one&#x27;s head, 11yrs old who has sensitive skin, and the mist came in contact with her facial skin and immediately acne flared up bad.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle and it actually detangles my hair.</li>
            <li> I mean there was two different color liquids one mint green and plain green</li>
            <li> I usually use the Creme of Nature Argan Oil leave in, but I decided to splurge on this instead.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not really sure what it is doing to my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely, positively, the worst relaxer I have ever had in my entire life.</li>
            <li> my girls have really thick hair</li>
            <li> what do I mean by separated</li>
            <li> Her hair is extremely thick and I was doubtful that this would actually work.</li>
            <li> Bad decision to stray from what has worked for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it though.  </li>

            <li> Excellent! Makes detangling my hair during a relaxer stretch much easier</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this stuff, i could never find anything to help with the tangles in my hair till now, this is a definite must have i will be buying more the best stuff ever thanks so much</li>
            <li> Sticky, over-scented, and sticky</li>
            <li> I really like how this  leave in conditioner makes my hair feel! It moisturizes and conditions very well and at a great price point! It smells really good, a kind of tropical fruity scent, I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on the scent and how shiny and soft my hair is. :)</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so great!! I was looking for somewhere to purchase these items since I live in Hawaii and the one place that sells them here had doubled the price. I came to amazon to quinch my product junkie thirst. This detangler is everything. Even when all of the new growth I have it still softens my hair and allows me to detangle with much ease. This will be a staple of mine for a while.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  It left my hair nourished and hydrated.</li>
            <li> This product caught my eye because I was looking for a more natural detangler. I usually use the Creme of Nature Argan Oil leave in, but I decided to splurge on this instead. Bad decision to stray from what has worked for me. It did nothing for my hair. I felt as if I were spraying perfume on my head. I had to add oils to keep it from drying out my hair and to actually detangle it. The smell of it was overwhelming. I&#x27;m not sensitive to smells, but as I was using this product, I kept coughing even though I wasn&#x27;t spraying that much. I looked at the ingredients and found FRAGRANCE to be listed third. I didn&#x27;t notice it until after I bought it. Usually, the ingredients listed within the first five make up most of the product. If you&#x27;re sensitive to certain smells, then I would not recommend it to you. It is sitting on my counter and I&#x27;m thinking about tossing it in the trash. I would recommend the argan oil leave in from Creme of Nature. The smell is subtle and it actually detangles my hair. If you&#x27;re not feeling that product, then the other I would recommend using is the Just for Me Hair Milk detangler.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stretching my relaxer at 20 weeks and I use this after all my hair washes and this makes my new growth and relaxed hair so manageable and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I like this but I&#x27;m not really sure what it is doing to my hair.  I think if I go a week without using it, I can tell if it is making a difference.  I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it though.  As far as detangling, I guess it is helping but I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s making it a lot easier to detangle my natural hair.  For sure, though, it&#x27;s not hurting it!</li>
            <li> Love this product, was given a sample to try. Leaves my hair feeling smooth w/ a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> Really untangles my hair and refreshes it too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with this product. Would highly recommend. Finally someone came out with an all natural hair relaxer for those of us that still prefer straight hair over the natural look. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely, positively, the worst relaxer I have ever had in my entire life. Did absolutely nothing to my hair except make it smell good. Now I have to go out and buy another relaxer to actually do my hair.</li>

            <li> makes your hair silky soft and smells wonderful ......my girls have really thick hair and it works awesome will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> Made my hair very silky, smooth and shiny! I even use it on dry hair after its straightened. Also smells fantastic. Would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The leave- in conditioner kept my hair moisturized. It smells great. It is a must as a total hair system.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good detangler that was free of a lot of alcohol (something that had the most natural ingredients), preferably a conditioner and I stumbled across this. I purchased it for my little one&#x27;s hair which gets tangled easily. Her hair is extremely thick and I was doubtful that this would actually work. To my surprise, it worked. I&#x27;ve recently tried about three detanglers and this one was the best. One detangler I tried was twice the price of this one and it only did okay so an expensive product isn&#x27;t always better. I LOVE the way it smells and, although irrelevant, even the color is nice (would make a great color for the kitchen walls *LOL*).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to give a &amp;#34;heads up&amp;#34;. The spray nozel on this is powerful, meaning that a lot comes out per spray and the range of the spray is wide. I sprayed it on my little one&#x27;s head, 11yrs old who has sensitive skin, and the mist came in contact with her facial skin and immediately acne flared up bad. If you have sensitive skin or even if you don&#x27;t, make sure you are careful when you are spraying it, use your hand or something to shield your face. When using it on my little one&#x27;s head, I now only spray it on my hands and  distribute it throughout her hair or I spray it on the brush or comb first then comb through her hair. The powerful spray nozzle could more than likely be switched out to a different nozzle. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this product I will buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Just right for my very thick, long, kinky-curly gray hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best I have ever used if your hair is matted you need this product</li>
            <li> Great product is now staple product in my hair regimen I would not trade it in for any other leave in conditioner wish I would have ordered more for the price they had on here</li>
            <li> Great leave in conditioner! I LOVE the smell and it actually works to detangle and add moisture to my locks. I have applied it both to my hair when it is wet and when it is dry. I will purchase again.</li>
