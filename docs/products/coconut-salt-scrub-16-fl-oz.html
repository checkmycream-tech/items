            <li>Perfect natural product for restoring moisture to dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a super exfoliator and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The product spoils quickly and then smells like cooking oil.  </li>
            <li>I tried this last night in a restroom at a restraunt and it was just amazing.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love soft</li>
            <li>This is WORTH every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth it again and again.</li>
            <li>Love this product makes the skin so soft  and fresh .</li>
            <li>It is very historic and lovingly cared for.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin so soft and smells lovely.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and soft feel on my skin.</li>
            <li>Given to me as a gift, subtle great smell, hands are so soft after... Love !</li>
            <li>We tried this product at a couple local restaurants &amp; were so impressed by how smooth skin is after using &amp; the lovely fragrance, but it was really expensive.  </li>
            <li>I decided to look at Amazon for something similar, and to my great amazement, I found the exact same product, just be luck in clicking the right product and reading the review.  </li>
            <li>My granddaughter fell in love with this scrub when we were at the Embassy Suites Hotel in Charleston, SC, last winter.  </li>
            <li>I first used this while on vacation.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin super soft.</li>
            <li>The restroom put it in a little saucer like dish with a spoon to dip out the scrub but just for fun I ordered a jam jar to put it in as I thought that would look cute in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>This Company will fight you on who is responsible for this cost.    </li>
            <li>You see, the harder a sales representative works, the more commission this employee makes.  </li>
            <li>I tried to make this scrub by using recipes I found on-line, but it just doesn&#x27;t compare to the real thing.</li>
            <li>It came uber-quickly and was really well-packaged - which matters a lot when the product is in a glass</li>
            <li>so much I needed a replacement) from Amazon.</li>
            <li>, I had them pressed up against my face the whole night.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe once I used it maybe it would turn out different...not so much....</li>
            <li>and it was like I washed my hands in straight</li>
            <li>I feel like a brand new person!</li>
            <li>It really does make my hands feel soft  </li>
            <li>however because of the oil residue that is left on your skin (that is eventually absorbed into it) you have to be selective when you use this product, maybe 30 minutes before bed, or just a time when you have about 15 to 30 minutes to allow the absorption to take place.</li>
            <li>wrote to the company explaining I was a regular customer and had a large jar of the Coconut Salt Scrub which had turned</li>
            <li>The scents are Not all Natural as they are a Chemical Blend.    </li>
            <li>This means the jars which are purchased could be near their spoiling experation.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soooo soft and smoother than a baby butt.</li>
            <li>Delivery was incredibly fast and well-packaged with a personal touch.  </li>
            <li>All natural.</li>
            <li>BTW if you ever go to Charleston try to stay at the old Citadel (Embassy Suites).</li>
            <li>It leaves hands remarkably soft.  </li>
            <li>I my hands were so soft</li>
            <li>The fresh coconut smell is long lasting.</li>
            <li>I put a tiny scoop in my hand and gently, thoroughly rub my hands and wrists for several minutes, then let it sit for a minute or so before rinsing and drying.  </li>
            <li>While I prefer things to be all natural, this is a case where a preservative would be necessary.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is more expensive on Amazon than buying direct from the retailer.</li>
            <li>Secret of the Islands has many Lawsuits filed against former employees and former Business&#x27; which once carried their product.  </li>
            <li>I was first introduce to this product a few years back when it was in a local restaurant</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A++++  Love this scrub.  Leaves your skin super soft.</li>
            <li> I recently read that this comment in its entirety that Secret of the Islands is a Salt Scrub Company which advertises that it&#x27;s product is \\&quot;all Natural\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s Not!  This oil in the Scrub is the heavest cheapest Soy Bean Oil which can be found at the time of  Bulk Purchase.  (Coconut oil is the best Oil to be used on your Skin.)    The \\&quot;Secret\\&quot; in Their scrub is that the ingrediants used are not \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; which is Advertised.  The scents are Not all Natural as they are a Chemical Blend.    The \\&quot;shelf life\\&quot; on the Jar&#x27;s of sold product is about 90 day&#x27;s.  This means the jars which are purchased could be near their spoiling experation.  There is not a manufatoring date on the jars so it is impossible to buy the freshest  scrub.  Once the scrub spoils, it smells like \\&quot;Cooking Oil\\&quot; and gets sticky.  Again it is Soy Bean Oil.    When you wash your Hands with the scrub, you have a greasy residue left on you.  It is so bad that Normal soap is needed to remove the greasy oil.  The grease coats your sinks and showers and tubs.  In some cases the grease will stain your bathroom facilities.  Slippery means liability!.  The product also is known to clog Drains.  The Company knows this and offers to pour drain cleaner down your drains.  It does not work and in some cases corrosion and replacement is needed.  This Company will fight you on who is responsible for this cost.    Secret of the Islands has a History of firing their employees who work the hardest.  You see, the harder a sales representative works, the more commission this employee makes.  This Company lets these employees go, after a territory is \\&quot;built up\\&quot;.  The Company no longer has to pay commissions to that employee and the company pockets this money.  Secret of the Islands claims the individual employee is Falseifying paperwork or stealing from the company and then fires that employee.  This Same activity has occured to every employee which has done well and this is documented.  The Company always claims to be thevictim.    The owner of this company is a convicted Felon for Bank Fraud.  All these records are open to the Public, just google Johnny Hoy in South Carolina.  When the Employee is fired, the Company refuses to pay them their last commissions and expenses.  Basically, Secret of the Islands Uses their Employees, fires them, and the Steals from them.    Secret of the Islands has many Lawsuits filed against former employees and former Business&#x27; which once carried their product.  If a Business who carries Secret of the Islands Product line, decides to drop the scrub and move in another direction, Secret sues this Company for breach of Contract.    Look elsewhere Folks.  Secret of the Islands is a Nightmare.  It wrecks drains and property.  It is a Liability because of it&#x27;s greasy slippery residue. It treats employees and it&#x27;s own clients horrible.    Secret of the Island Salt Scrub is Drama.  Run away</li>
            <li> Absolutely love soft my hands are after using this product. The fresh coconut smell is long lasting. I use this every night.</li>
            <li> This is WORTH every penny. My skin is soooo soft and smoother than a baby butt. I recommend the 16 oz jar. It smells so nice too. Worth it again and again.</li>
            <li> Love this product makes the skin so soft  and fresh . I was first introduce to this product a few years back when it was in a local restaurant it was on the Ladies Room as a hand scrub . Really awesome for hands as well.</li>
            <li> My husband bought me a jar in late summer at the beach and saved it for a Christmas gift.  I tried putting some in dish like they do the samples at restaurants.  It dried out into an extremely gummy residue which was almost impossible to clean.  Once the jar was opened, the remainder of the product in the jar went rancid and lost its coconut smell.  It still seems to soften my hands but does not smell nice.  While I prefer things to be all natural, this is a case where a preservative would be necessary.  Very expensive to go bad so quickly.  I tried to email them about it and got no response.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best salt scrubs I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s a super exfoliator and moisturizer.  I put a tiny scoop in my hand and gently, thoroughly rub my hands and wrists for several minutes, then let it sit for a minute or so before rinsing and drying.  My hands are unbelievable soft and younger-looking.  Keeping your skin exfoliated also allows a good moisturizer (like Curel original) to penetrate and heal much more effectively.  Delivery was incredibly fast and well-packaged with a personal touch.  I will continue to purchase for years to come!</li>
            <li> We discovered this in a restaurant. Bought a jar. But then the restaurant stopped handling it. Glad we found it here. My wife is is fussy about what she uses on her skin. This salt scrub is her favorite!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter fell in love with this scrub when we were at the Embassy Suites Hotel in Charleston, SC, last winter.  I decided to look at Amazon for something similar, and to my great amazement, I found the exact same product, just be luck in clicking the right product and reading the review.  I can&#x27;t wait to surprise my granddaughter.  It really does make my hands feel soft  and in this cold winter with the dry air, it is a big help.  I tried to make this scrub by using recipes I found on-line, but it just doesn&#x27;t compare to the real thing. I was also concerned that this product was not sold directly or shipped through Amazon, but I had absolutely no problems.  I just wish that it were less expensive.</li>
            <li> We tried this product at a couple local restaurants &amp; were so impressed by how smooth skin is after using &amp; the lovely fragrance, but it was really expensive.  So, of course, I looked on amazon.  Seller offered it at an excellent price (at that time), with free shipping.  It came uber-quickly and was really well-packaged - which matters a lot when the product is in a glass jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciated the seller - could not have been better.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible. Its slippery in the shower and it clogs your drains.  The product spoils quickly and then smells like cooking oil.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!</li>
            <li> I first used this while on vacation. Believe it or not the restaurant we ate at had this in the restroom to try.  It smells wonderful and leaves your skin feeling great! The only thing I wish is that it came in an unbreakable container.</li>
            <li> The best body scrub out there. I&#x27;m in love with this stuff. By the time I get out of the tub I feel like a brand new person!</li>
            <li> Great product. All natural. Nice aroma. Works as described. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Found it while on a work trip to Florida and pleased to see that Amazon carries it.&lt;br /&gt;It is more expensive on Amazon than buying direct from the retailer.</li>
            <li> The oil turned rancid after about two weeks. Wish the instructions said to refrigerate. Had to throw most of it out</li>
            <li> Buyer BEWARE!  I enjoyed this product UNTIL I had purchased a jar that had already spoiled.  It is advertised as an all natural&lt;br /&gt;product and believing so, when I opened the jar and it had an off smell, I used it any way as a hand scrub......what a mistake!&lt;br /&gt;I had to use an automotive hand soap to try and remove not only the odor but the sticky, gummy residue that remained on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote to the company explaining I was a regular customer and had a large jar of the Coconut Salt Scrub which had turned bad.&lt;br /&gt;The response was shockingly rude.  I explained the problem and the response was it was probably beyond its shelf life!  Shelf life???? There is no &#x27;best if used by date&#x27;, no production date; no expiration date and yet that was the explanation given by Katie Harwood.  Oh, but wait, there is more.....Even though this $29 jar of salt scrub is useless, Katie Harwood made the most generous offer of 20% off MY NEXT PURCHASE.....as if I would ever give a found penny in business to Secret of the Islands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I back tracked as much as possible and warned all the family and friends I had introduced the product to that the company does not stand behind their product so do NOT support the business.  Save your money and go to a company that will stand behind its product.</li>
            <li> We love the scrub, we&#x27;ve had it before....awesome!</li>
            <li> makes your hands and body feel great and smells wonderful</li>
            <li> We stayed at the Embassy Suites hotel in Charleston, NC and this product was in the restroom. I loved it so bought some to take home and just ordered another bottle (I shared my first one so much I needed a replacement) from Amazon. BTW if you ever go to Charleston try to stay at the old Citadel (Embassy Suites). It is very historic and lovingly cared for. But in the meantime, get this stuff. The restroom put it in a little saucer like dish with a spoon to dip out the scrub but just for fun I ordered a jam jar to put it in as I thought that would look cute in my bathroom. Here is how it is listed on Amazon:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jam Jar With Serving Spoon by Godinger</li>
            <li> This makes your skin feel so smooth afterwords and smells great!</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Discovered this product in Sault Ste. Marie Michigan restaurant restroom.  Great for hands, arms, legs and feet.  There are less expensive copies out there but, you&#x27;ll get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The hotel I was standing at had Secret of the Islands hand scrub and I thought that was what I was ordering.  The salt scrub was too greasy for me so I returned the product.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product that performs as advertised. It leaves hands remarkably soft.  The scent does remind you of the islands.</li>
            <li> Tried some while on vacation down in Puerto Rico, and had to get some. Makes your skin so soft and smells lovely. Great substitute for either lotion and or hand soap.</li>
            <li> When you wash you hands you have to follow up by washing with regular soap because it leaves such a greasy residue</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff it is the best I have ever used smells great and leave my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Perfect natural product for restoring moisture to dry winter skin. Great in the bath too. Also used as an exfoliant</li>
            <li> Given to me as a gift, subtle great smell, hands are so soft after... Love !</li>
            <li> I tried this last night in a restroom at a restraunt and it was just amazing. All I did was put a tiny scoop (1/2 teaspoon) into my hands, work it in for what I thought was a minute, rinse and dry. It made my hands feel SO smooth, and it smelled SO good. Though I think I had a different scent than coconut. I my hands were so soft, I had them pressed up against my face the whole night. I was so impressed that I&#x27;m going to go purchase a bottle as soon as the restraunt opens</li>
            <li> I wish they sold just the oil - I could use that daily!  Love the scent and soft feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> Got this salt scrub via a Groupon and it smelled awful - like rancid spoiled mayonnaise.  I thought maybe once I used it maybe it would turn out different...not so much....it was so bad I was gagging and it was like I washed my hands in straight oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning item!</li>
            <li> The product is very good, but the seller was excellent.  My order was recieved before the date promised, and was just as described.</li>
            <li> Beautiful product clearly! however because of the oil residue that is left on your skin (that is eventually absorbed into it) you have to be selective when you use this product, maybe 30 minutes before bed, or just a time when you have about 15 to 30 minutes to allow the absorption to take place.</li>
            <li> LOVE it. Great scent.</li>
