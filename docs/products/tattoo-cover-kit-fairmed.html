            <li>I followed the directions and was immediately impressed with my results.</li>
            <li>tried it on my fiancée and it works great.</li>
            <li>then it wont work as good as it can.  </li>
            <li>If you order this kit, make sure you have time to practice with it!  </li>
            <li>I ordered this kit for my girlfriend who has many tattoos.</li>
            <li>The product alone isn&#x27;t going to magically cover your tattoo..</li>
            <li>: )</li>
            <li>takes time and more than 3 layers, but works.</li>
            <li>Better off purchasing Dermablend to cover tattoos .</li>
            <li>I rate this a 3 out of 5 star because I know their is better stuff out their.</li>
            <li>For the most part please with the purchase though.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m good with makeup or lucked out having the right skin tone</li>
            <li>Take the time to apply it right and its great, the longevity isnt quit as long stated but nonetheless its good for temporary use.</li>
            <li>I wear bracelets over them on a daily basis but thought it would be great if I could go a day or two without jewelry.</li>
            <li>I use the \\&quot;leg magic\\&quot; on hard to cover flaws and it is the best.</li>
            <li>ALSO, even if the product would have worked, we paid $33.95 for the kit, and while it does come in a cool mini lunchbox, it is a SAMPLE kit.</li>
            <li>offer all our products in full sizes</li>
            <li>Worked good for me, follow directions and apply several coats as recommended</li>
            <li>And reading other reviews just to be clear, she is very experienced with makeup and is not user error.</li>
            <li>So the next day on the On-Camera Event is when I got interviewed and by that day I kind of already knew how to put it on because of messing up the day before.  </li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried a few different lines of make-up, and this works the best.</li>
            <li>First of all, this is supposed to be light/fair.  </li>
            <li>This product is okay if you don&#x27;t mind re-applying it several times throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>covered it up the first day of the Event</li>
            <li>I now use the primer that came in this kit and then follow up with my bare minerals concealer and foundation in order to get a perfect match; this doesn&#x27;t fully cover my tattoos but does make them far less noticeable.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s not a big deal, you might just want to leave your tattoo visible instead of having a big discolored spot or have someone who is really good with colors and makeup</li>
            <li>I used this on a BLACK tattoo on my wrist for my friend&#x27;s wedding and it was amazing..</li>
            <li>She has a large chest piece and a large tattoo on her forearm.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>/&gt;The makeup was very noticable (caked up) and a bit of outline from my tattoos could still be seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This kit covers it very well.</li>
            <li>You could absolutely tell I had makeup on.</li>
            <li>you have to use the right technique, and they give you clear instructions.</li>
            <li>We were extremely hopeful this would allow her to use more of her clothes at work</li>
            <li>this is a decent product for covering tattoos.</li>
            <li>I recently ran out of my first kit.</li>
            <li>My only complaints are that there is not a shade that exactly matches my skin, and if you bump something within an hour or so of application it will smear and some will come off.</li>
            <li>Use some common sense.. if you need to apply more, do so.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s not exactly the right color you can add some colored powder you already have to adjust.</li>
            <li>However, since I wss wearing a lace dress it worked well enough under the lace to cover up my tattoo on my back (a large dolphin).</li>
            <li>Once it was completely dry it became a shade darker and a little more orange than my actual skin tone.</li>
            <li>Was kind of sad</li>
            <li>her arm tattoo was still completely visible, just slightly faded or less colorful.</li>

            <li> and/or dont have several minutes to let it dry before going to the next step of the process</li>
            <li> I expected it to go a lot further than it did.</li>
            <li> Overall, if you have a smaller tattoo, even if it is very dark, I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Also it does rub off on shoes and other items, which is not unexpected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This may work for little tattoos but not for big ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> because even after it dried and kept lightly applying it, it looked fake; it looked like you were try to cover something up.  </li>
            <li> The colors were lighter than expected and the size was deffinately a suprise.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that this product is horrible, I just know that my skin shade is very light and hard to match so this might very well work for someone else.</li>
            <li> I have a small, very dark tattoo on my foot which I must cover daily for my profession.</li>
            <li> When applying it it went on thick and was obvious</li>
            <li> , I have a half sleeve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waaayy too dark!</li>
            <li> Waste of $$$$.</li>
            <li> The product seems to work well, after a few applications.</li>
            <li> ill be using it to cover my tats on my back for my wedding</li>
            <li> But even at that, It still looked a little fake and after a while it was chipping off.  </li>
            <li> She applied the base and then 4 applications of the actual cover up and</li>
            <li> While it does cover completely, it is not flawless.</li>
            <li> It could cover the tattoo, but after while, it fails.</li>
            <li> had hi hopes and don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very disappointed and feel that I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This product was disappointing.</li>

            <li> I ordered this kit for my girlfriend who has many tattoos. She was just hired for a sales position that would require her to cover her tats with clothing. She has a large chest piece and a large tattoo on her forearm. We bought this so she could wear a shirt other than a high collar or long sleeve. This product did not work for her at all. She applied the base and then 4 applications of the actual cover up and her arm tattoo was still completely visible, just slightly faded or less colorful. This did not cover the tattoo at all. And reading other reviews just to be clear, she is very experienced with makeup and is not user error. We were extremely hopeful this would allow her to use more of her clothes at work so tried several times to make this product work. It also rubbed off on her clothing. Basically this product did nothing it said it would. ALSO, even if the product would have worked, we paid $33.95 for the kit, and while it does come in a cool mini lunchbox, it is a SAMPLE kit. There is even a note inside that says \\&quot;We offer all our products in full sizes also!\\&quot; Really? 34 dollars for a sample kit that does not even work??? Trust me, move on to the next product. We are going to try something else, so save your money and skip this one.</li>
            <li> tried it on my fiancée and it works great. ill be using it to cover my tats on my back for my wedding</li>
            <li> If you order this kit, make sure you have time to practice with it!  It takes several practice applications to get the shade just right.  While it does cover completely, it is not flawless. You can tell that you&#x27;ve covered something up on your skin.  If it&#x27;s not a big deal, you might just want to leave your tattoo visible instead of having a big discolored spot or have someone who is really good with colors and makeup cover it for you with this kit.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is supposed to be light/fair.  I have a tattoo on my arm that needs to be covered for work.  When I use this stuff it looks like a nasty buise or a birth mark. Waaayy too dark! Unfortunately I have yet to find anything better so it will have to do for now.  This product is okay if you don&#x27;t mind re-applying it several times throughout the day.  It comes off on everything, so don&#x27;t rub up on anything!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cover my tattoos, mind you, I have a half sleeve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may work for little tattoos but not for big ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makeup was very noticable (caked up) and a bit of outline from my tattoos could still be seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed and feel that I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product in order to cover up a couple of wrist tattoos. I wear bracelets over them on a daily basis but thought it would be great if I could go a day or two without jewelry. I followed the directions and was immediately impressed with my results. Once it was completely dry it became a shade darker and a little more orange than my actual skin tone. I wouldn&#x27;t say that this product is horrible, I just know that my skin shade is very light and hard to match so this might very well work for someone else. I now use the primer that came in this kit and then follow up with my bare minerals concealer and foundation in order to get a perfect match; this doesn&#x27;t fully cover my tattoos but does make them far less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It could cover the tattoo, but after while, it fails. Not fully invisible.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m good with makeup or lucked out having the right skin tone but it WORKED. Just follow the directions! It&#x27;s simple! The product alone isn&#x27;t going to magically cover your tattoo.. you have to use the right technique, and they give you clear instructions. Use some common sense.. if you need to apply more, do so. Apply around the tattoo too.. and BLEND that area.. ON the tattoo it needs to be cakey, but the powdery stuff will keep it in place. If it&#x27;s not exactly the right color you can add some colored powder you already have to adjust. I used this on a BLACK tattoo on my wrist for my friend&#x27;s wedding and it was amazing.. if you look close you can see there is some different texture to the area, but in pictures it looked like there was no difference to the area at all. I had a ribbon type thing I made to wear at the reception in case it ended up fading, but it lasted. : )&lt;br /&gt;Now I use the \\&quot;leg magic\\&quot; on hard to cover flaws and it is the best.</li>
            <li> this is a decent product for covering tattoos. i&#x27;ve tried a few different lines of make-up, and this works the best. takes time and more than 3 layers, but works. color is a bit off, and others can tell that you&#x27;re covering something up...</li>
            <li> Waste of $$$$. Terrible investment. Better off purchasing Dermablend to cover tattoos . Maybe so etching from Kat Vondee. Of course</li>
            <li> This product was disappointing. When applying it it went on thick and was obvious I was hiding something.</li>
            <li> I used this to cover up my tattoos for a church play, it works but if you have no idea how to apply the makeup and/or dont have several minutes to let it dry before going to the next step of the process then it wont work as good as it can.  Take the time to apply it right and its great, the longevity isnt quit as long stated but nonetheless its good for temporary use.</li>
            <li> This is my second tattoo cover kit from this company. I recently ran out of my first kit. I have a small, very dark tattoo on my foot which I must cover daily for my profession. This kit covers it very well. It does take some skill and practice with amount to use and shading methods. Patience is needed until you have experience using it. It does include helpful instructions. My only complaints are that there is not a shade that exactly matches my skin, and if you bump something within an hour or so of application it will smear and some will come off. Also it does rub off on shoes and other items, which is not unexpected. Overall, if you have a smaller tattoo, even if it is very dark, I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have a tattoo on my left hand that&#x27;s only about the size of a nickle.&lt;br /&gt;And yeah I do regret it.&lt;br /&gt;I am a client at a Talent Agency and I had an On-Camera Event to got to.&lt;br /&gt;So I had to order this because I didn&#x27;t need my tattoo shown.&lt;br /&gt;I had hi hopes and don&#x27;t get me wrong it does sort of work.&lt;br /&gt;I covered it up the first day of the Event and it didn&#x27;t work so well because even after it dried and kept lightly applying it, it looked fake; it looked like you were try to cover something up.  So the next day on the On-Camera Event is when I got interviewed and by that day I kind of already knew how to put it on because of messing up the day before.  But even at that, It still looked a little fake and after a while it was chipping off.  But it wasn&#x27;t noticeable unless they were actually looking for a tattoo on my left hand.&lt;br /&gt;So I rate this a 3 out of 5 star because I know their is better stuff out their.</li>
            <li> I expected it to go a lot further than it did. The white primer doesn&#x27;t work for all colours of tattoo.</li>
            <li> I used this to cover a tattoo on my wedding day. You could absolutely tell I had makeup on. However, since I wss wearing a lace dress it worked well enough under the lace to cover up my tattoo on my back (a large dolphin). The makeup did get on my dress but it came off when professionaly cleaned. I think you would need a makeup artist who knows what they&#x27;re doing in order for it to be blended correctly.</li>
            <li> Worked good for me, follow directions and apply several coats as recommended</li>
            <li> The product seems to work well, after a few applications. The colors were lighter than expected and the size was deffinately a suprise. It is a lot smaller than in looks in the picture. For the most part please with the purchase though.</li>
            <li> Did not even work. Was kind of sad</li>
