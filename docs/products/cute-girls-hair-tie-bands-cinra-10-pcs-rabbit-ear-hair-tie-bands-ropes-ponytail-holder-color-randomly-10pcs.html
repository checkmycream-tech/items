            <li>Well worth the wait</li>
            <li>Love these for my 2 year old.</li>
            <li>They are strong enough and high quality enough to use by them selves to put all her hair up in a secure pony tail and they are super pretty and cute!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very well made, and so pretty!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cute, but not that stretchy, so if you have a lot of hair it won&#x27;t wrap around multiple times.</li>
            <li>Very cute and colorful, however, it&#x27;s a bit loos after a few time usages...</li>

            <li>They have lasted a very long time (zero have broken) and are super adorable, too.</li>
            <li>Being made and coming from overseas you usually except cheap material and an assumption</li>
            <li>So far, they haven&#x27;t lost their elasticity and my girls have long, kinky curly hair.</li>

            <li> have nothing to do with black hair ropes for 3 years old girl.</li>
            <li> 5 from 10 hair ropes are in black color, only 5 remaining are really colored for a little girl.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just a little slippery for my baby fine thin hair</li>
            <li> too loose.  </li>

            <li> they are definitely for a little girl</li>
            <li> Lots of pink and black but no purple or green etc.</li>

            <li> Some of the threads from mine were poorly sewn though.</li>

            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product. Being made and coming from overseas you usually except cheap material and an assumption the product to be used for short term.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this!

            <li> High quality, I use these as a hair tie for my two year old daughter. They are strong enough and high quality enough to use by them selves to put all her hair up in a secure pony tail and they are super pretty and cute! You get a lot of them for a low price too.</li>
