            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant smell but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic oil!</li>
            <li>Ok, I searched forever on amazon for an authentic argan oil.</li>
            <li>But I am in LOVE with this argan oil.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought the 4 oz because I also love rubbing it on my neck, chest and legs.  </li>
            <li>But I probably won&#x27;t need to for quite some time. :)</li>
            <li>and my cuticles get healthy.</li>
            <li>but I still love it.  </li>
            <li>so I tried Teddies jojoba oil and found that to be much more to my liking :)  </li>
            <li>and it looks more healthy around my edges and tips.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>Am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>My face is smoother and more youthful looking.</li>
            <li>No complaints here : )  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite ways to use Teddie Organics Argan oil is immediately after shower.</li>
            <li>I have seen benefits by using argan oil by itself or by mixing with my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I add a drop of Argan oil to my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>I receive so many compliments about my glowing skin.</li>
            <li>The most important thing when buying argan oil is the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I feel my fine lines diminishing.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try argan oil for its light feel.</li>
            <li>I let my hair air dry than blow dryed it &amp; my hair has a beautiful gloss to it but not greasy</li>
            <li>Please continue to offer this product at such a high quality and great price!</li>
            <li>Trying to find a new and better way to have clean, healthy skin.  </li>
            <li>Applying 4-5 drops of this oil has helped improve the dryness and hair texture significantly.</li>
            <li>But I put my essential  rose oil in it and makes it better.</li>
            <li>both work great on my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I received my Teddie Argan Oil last week, previously I have used Josie Maran Argan Oil and liked it, but, I decided I should be able to do better price wise without sacrificing quality.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to waste time with powder, I look good without it!</li>
            <li>Luckily, I was fortunate enough to receive a sample of Teddie Organics Argan oil in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Arrived super</li>
            <li>Have been using for a few months now and the quality is great.  </li>
            <li>This product is great goes on smooth and is not sticky, smelly or thick.</li>
            <li>So far, I have been pleased and would recommend trying the Argan oil and purchasing it with Teddie Organics.  </li>
            <li>Then I saw this brand on Amazon and liked the purity and overall statement</li>
            <li>must say Teddie Organics Argan oil has been effective in my daily skincare routine.</li>
            <li>Its color and texture is a nice yellow-orange, showing it is relatively unrefined</li>
            <li>The product absorbs quickly and you can use it anywhere with positive results.</li>
            <li>With just a few drops, her hair looked and felt shiny, healthy, and much more controllable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product and will totally order again ,</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased and used Argan oil after reading about its benefits.</li>
            <li>I can actually be ready to face the day in 5 minutes!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>So I will most likely continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li>My oil arrived in a timely manner, well packaged, and transaction was a positive experience.</li>
            <li>thanks much !</li>
            <li>Amazing product but extremely overpriced!</li>
            <li>I have combination, super sensitive skin and this</li>
            <li>I will refer it to anyone looking for pure Argon Oil.</li>
            <li>Pure -USDA</li>
            <li>This is a great oil, equal to what I used previously.</li>
            <li>but yours is certainly working very well for me.  </li>
            <li>The Argan Oil was recieved early in tact ..very high quality !!!</li>
            <li>Fast service and the oils were delivered on time.</li>
            <li>I find this product to be than Josie Maran ( a very over priced Argan Oil ).</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>Thanks for being in touch.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend this Oil!</li>
            <li>When I tried the argan from Teddie Organics, I found it really made a difference.</li>
            <li>I no longer dread seeing a new blemish!</li>
            <li>I almost don’t use creams, and I have been using Rosehip Oil as my main beauty product for years.</li>
            <li>For my mature skin I really battle the elements here.</li>
            <li>I use it on my coarse frizzy hair, as well as a fresh tattoo, and my husband uses it on his hair and his beard.</li>
            <li>I love that it does not cause breakouts and that I can have so much use out of a small drop of product.</li>
            <li>It is noticeably softer and more tame,</li>
            <li>Light yellow color oil with a slight scent, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>New to the product</li>
            <li>Time to time I like to discover &amp; test new brands.</li>
            <li>but I recently realized the same organic product is available here for a cheaper price.   </li>
            <li>I also follow up with a drop of Argan oil throughout my hair while it is drying or right before I use a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>( If it is a too clear color it may not be as high quality).</li>
            <li>My first time trying a product not marketed by traditional beauty houses with well known names.</li>
            <li>Certified Organic (Some “organic certification” is done by companies connected to the seller of the product).The dark brown bottle design does not let light in which helps to keep its effectiveness without going rancid.</li>
            <li>The change has been amazing, and it&#x27;s only been a few days!</li>
            <li>recently watched a popular makeup artist on Youtube recommend mixing a small drop of Argan oil with liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>My skin is clear and soft!</li>
            <li>Works well to keep the skin soft after bath.</li>
            <li>I am 36 yr old mom of 3.</li>
            <li>and my scalp feels soooooo naturally refreshed</li>
            <li>I discovered Argan oil and all I can say is wow.</li>
            <li>By the way my 24 year old daughter loves it as well.</li>
            <li>Every dollar is important in our home, so I always think hard before I spend on myself.</li>
            <li>I get a facial a couple of times each year and the woman who does it asked what I was using because my skin was completely hydrated (for a change).</li>
            <li>If the label says anything more than 100% pure cold pressed argan oil</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive dry skin and winter weather only adds to my woes.</li>

            <li> friend introduced me to argan oil, but he bought his little 1 oz bottle (which was a mixture of oils; argan was 3rd on the list) at a local barber shop for the same price I spent on 4x the amount of pure argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Used other Argan Oils</li>
            <li> I felt led to write this review, because I know there are other busy women who are tired of acne as an adult and tired of not knowing what product to try and trust.  </li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s not worth your money</li>
            <li> Thank You Teddie Organics for bringing this product to the average working person.</li>
            <li> less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> also have wavy, thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> I do mix in a little Shea Butter as well.</li>
            <li> A little heavier than Marula,</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s  a little sticky.</li>
            <li> I have tried endless products!!</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have found that Argan oil does wonders for my skin and hair year round.</li>
            <li> However, it is a heavy oil.</li>
            <li> One other side note, my very thin sparse eyebrows seem to be growing back which is odd as nothing ever helped them before.</li>
            <li> I used like half the bottle in 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> You have changed the way I look at my face everyday!</li>
            <li> so I washed and conditioned as usual than part my hair in 4 sections and applied the oil to my scalp than massaged it in than rubbed some in my hair.</li>
            <li> and lately others have noticed by skin</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed in this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE IT!  Skin has softened and become radiant.  I feel my fine lines diminishing.  I have been looking for an oil that is absorbant, and doens&#x27;t just lay on the surface, this is it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great follow up customer service and a great product. I use it on my coarse frizzy hair, as well as a fresh tattoo, and my husband uses it on his hair and his beard. It does wonders for all of the things we use it for. This product is top notch! The most important thing when buying argan oil is the ingredients. If the label says anything more than 100% pure cold pressed argan oil then it&#x27;s not worth your money</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil was recieved early in tact ..very high quality !!! Love this product and will totally order again , thanks much !</li>
            <li> Amazing product but extremely overpriced! Ive been a customer for years but I recently realized the same organic product is available here for a cheaper price.   It is great for all hair types if you want length retention sleep with this in your hair and wash it out the next day - amazing results!  Great for skin as well,</li>
            <li> Still using it so don&#x27;t know results yet</li>
            <li> Fast service and the oils were delivered on time. This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased and used Argan oil after reading about its benefits. New to the product and it has only been a few days. I use the oil on my face and on my body after shower. Light yellow color oil with a slight scent, but not unpleasant. The oil seems to absorb well and doesn&#x27;t have an oily feel. Works well to keep the skin soft after bath.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic oil! I have combination, super sensitive skin and this has been a great face moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Very thick and very oily.  I am extremely disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> It arrived in time and it works for my hair just fine!</li>
            <li> Love the oil! Not too heavy. So great for face and scalp. I used like half the bottle in 3 weeks! Great price for a great oil. It doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant smell but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Ok, I searched forever on amazon for an authentic argan oil. I was so resistant not going with a name brand like Josie Maran.  But I simply cannot afford the Josie Maran price. Well after reading endless reviews on the dozens of argan brands offered on amazon, I took the plunge and ordered from Teddie.  I never write reviews! I am 36 yr old mom of 3. I suffer from adult acne and often take steroids due to Crohn &#x27;s disease. I have tried endless products!! But I am in LOVE with this argan oil. I have been using the product for 5 days and my skin is amazing! My skin is clear and soft! It literally healed the acne on my face. I am glad I bought the 4 oz because I also love rubbing it on my neck, chest and legs.  I felt led to write this review, because I know there are other busy women who are tired of acne as an adult and tired of not knowing what product to try and trust.  Every dollar is important in our home, so I always think hard before I spend on myself. Thank you Teddie! Please continue to offer this product at such a high quality and great price! You have changed the way I look at my face everyday! I no longer dread seeing a new blemish! I can actually be ready to face the day in 5 minutes! I wash with Cerave SA face wash, rub on my argan oil and I am done. I don&#x27;t need to waste time with powder, I look good without it! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Nice product,  my girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a few months now and the quality is great.  Wonderful product</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast!&lt;br /&gt;This will last very long.  I love it!  I&#x27;m going to buy it again from this seller!!</li>
            <li> Really nice, love it. I use it with my Lift Wand and to moisturize my legs, it works great!</li>
            <li> I like ... it does the trick ........... I put this on my face, neck and ears after my evening shower, when I put it on my neck I do mix in a little Shea Butter as well. No breakouts, no rash on my skin, absorbs well and I don&#x27;t feel like it is leaves an oily shine if used in moderation, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with Teddy&#x27;s Orgabic Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend introduced me to argan oil, but he bought his little 1 oz bottle (which was a mixture of oils; argan was 3rd on the list) at a local barber shop for the same price I spent on 4x the amount of pure argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily on my dry, frizzy beard, and brushing with a boar bristle brush. The change has been amazing, and it&#x27;s only been a few days! It is noticeably softer and more tame, less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave some to my daughter, who has long, flyaway hair. With just a few drops, her hair looked and felt shiny, healthy, and much more controllable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again from the same seller. But I probably won&#x27;t need to for quite some time. :)</li>
            <li> Used other Argan Oils but yours is certainly working very well for me.  I&#x27;m well over sixty and lately others have noticed by skin and I&#x27;ve received some compliments. It has only been 2 weeks.  I attribute this to your product.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer! I’ve been looking for something to use when my face gets dry, especially in winter. Just a few drops of the Argan Oil made my skin feel hydrated, and much softer. Great product!</li>
            <li> This product is great goes on smooth and is not sticky, smelly or thick. The product absorbs quickly and you can use it anywhere with positive results. I find this product to be than Josie Maran ( a very over priced Argan Oil ). Thank You Teddie Organics for bringing this product to the average working person. Please continue to provide us with these great product ( I also use the Rose Water Spray Awesome!!!!!)</li>
            <li> AWESOME PRODUCT!!! AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! Will purchase more!!!</li>
            <li> I really like the product. It is helping my nails grow and my cuticles get healthy. It is also putting moisture into my dry arms. Mary Williamson</li>
            <li> I received my Teddie Argan Oil last week, previously I have used Josie Maran Argan Oil and liked it, but, I decided I should be able to do better price wise without sacrificing quality.This is a great oil, equal to what I used previously.I did try another brand but was not so happy with it. I will definitely re order this brand again.</li>
            <li> Thanks for being in touch. It&#x27;s great oil at a fantastic price. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.  A little heavier than Marula, but I still love it.  Great for wintertime use.</li>
            <li> I only used a few days and see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Received my argan  oil fast.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s  a little sticky. Maybe all argan oil is that way.And has a strange smell,kind of like something  burning. But I put my essential  rose oil in it and makes it better.</li>
            <li> I did not care for the smell of the Argan oil so I tried Teddies jojoba oil and found that to be much more to my liking :)  both work great on my dry skin.  Gave the Argan oil to my sister who loves it. Thanks so much</li>
            <li> This oil gives my face a glow!! Not too greasy, just perfect. My hair is very dry so I washed and conditioned as usual than part my hair in 4 sections and applied the oil to my scalp than massaged it in than rubbed some in my hair. I let my hair air dry than blow dryed it &amp; my hair has a beautiful gloss to it but not greasy and my scalp feels soooooo naturally refreshed and it looks more healthy around my edges and tips. Love it!!!👍❤️</li>
            <li> My first time trying a product not marketed by traditional beauty houses with well known names. Trying to find a new and better way to have clean, healthy skin.  Saying this, I did a bit of research on the product and the company and cast the dice. So far, I have been pleased and would recommend trying the Argan oil and purchasing it with Teddie Organics.  My oil arrived in a timely manner, well packaged, and transaction was a positive experience.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate. I also have very dry skin. For my mature skin I really battle the elements here. I discovered Argan oil and all I can say is wow. I started with using another brand bought in a health food store. Then I saw this brand on Amazon and liked the purity and overall statement they made so thought I would give it a try. Am I glad I did. My face is smoother and more youthful looking. My hair is dry and tends to get kinky but ONE drop rubbed between my palms and then just smoothed over my hair takes care of that. One other side note, my very thin sparse eyebrows seem to be growing back which is odd as nothing ever helped them before. No complaints here : )  So I will most likely continue to buy this product. By the way my 24 year old daughter loves it as well. She&#x27;s the picky one but she is very pleased. Thanks</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive dry skin and winter weather only adds to my woes. I have found that Argan oil does wonders for my skin and hair year round. One of my favorite ways to use Teddie Organics Argan oil is immediately after shower. I have seen benefits by using argan oil by itself or by mixing with my favorite moisturizer. Luckily, I was fortunate enough to receive a sample of Teddie Organics Argan oil in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I also have wavy, thick and long hair. Winter months make my hair frizzy. I add a drop of Argan oil to my favorite shampoo. It does not make my hair greasy but adds shine and stops frizz. I also follow up with a drop of Argan oil throughout my hair while it is drying or right before I use a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently watched a popular makeup artist on Youtube recommend mixing a small drop of Argan oil with liquid foundation. This has been a life changing technique for me because my foundation no longer dries. It looks flawless, dewy and I receive so many compliments about my glowing skin. I highly recommend it to women with dry skin that need liquid foundation that does not leave dry patches or dry out as hours go by after initial makeup application. It will make your foundation last all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say Teddie Organics Argan oil has been effective in my daily skincare routine. I love that it does not cause breakouts and that I can have so much use out of a small drop of product.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazingly pure and wonderful for all skin issues and the customer service of this seller is great! I will refer it to anyone looking for pure Argon Oil.</li>
            <li> I almost don’t use creams, and I have been using Rosehip Oil as my main beauty product for years. Time to time I like to discover &amp; test new brands. Teddie Organics passed all my personal quality checklist. 100% Pure -USDA Certified Organic (Some “organic certification” is done by companies connected to the seller of the product).The dark brown bottle design does not let light in which helps to keep its effectiveness without going rancid. Its color and texture is a nice yellow-orange, showing it is relatively unrefined ( If it is a too clear color it may not be as high quality). The smell check is very pleasant as well. My last brand smelled like beer or salami, or something In between :-)&lt;br /&gt;This is brilliant stuff. I can highly recommend this Oil!</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and a flaky scalp. Applying 4-5 drops of this oil has helped improve the dryness and hair texture significantly.</li>
            <li> I have been using pomegranate oil for my dry skin, and it helped keep it somewhat hydrated. However, it is a heavy oil. I decided to try argan oil for its light feel. I had been given a sample of another brand from another company but wasn&#x27;t impressed. When I tried the argan from Teddie Organics, I found it really made a difference. I get a facial a couple of times each year and the woman who does it asked what I was using because my skin was completely hydrated (for a change). I&#x27;m very happy with the results I&#x27;m getting from this product.</li>
