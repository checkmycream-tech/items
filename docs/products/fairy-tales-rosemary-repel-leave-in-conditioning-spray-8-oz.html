            <li>And we have offically been lice free for a month!!!</li>
            <li>we are lice free this school year!!!</li>
            <li>we love the conditioning spray!!  </li>
            <li>I even use it on my own hair!</li>
            <li>On a better note, neither of my children have had any bugs in their hair.  :D</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the world&#x27;s best detangler, but it works ok for my toddler.</li>
            <li>We (family of 5) have been using this successfully for 5 years now.  </li>
            <li>I am not saying that this stuff is awesome, but my child has not had any signs of head lice and many of her classmates have.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant, the packaging is charming, and my child doesn&#x27;t feel like she&#x27;s doing a treatment.  </li>
            <li>Then it smells good and helps with tangles  </li>
            <li>; GOOD SMELL&amp;#62;</li>
            <li>Fairy Tales makes good products.</li>
            <li>but the smell is soo good</li>
            <li>My girls use nothing but the Fairly Tale products on their hair.  </li>
            <li>Unlike others like this, this smells really good and kids don&#x27;t mind wearing this.  </li>
            <li>Good for curly or wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>Good stuff</li>
            <li>I feel so good after spraying this - knowing my daughter&#x27;s hair/head is protected when she goes to school.  </li>
            <li>I think any leave-in conditioner/detangler helps though, and this (to me) does NOT smell good</li>
            <li>Smells good and we haven&#x27;t had any issues with lice</li>
            <li>But what I do now is that it makes my hair smell good (well, after you get used to the scent that</li>
            <li>Detangles fairly well</li>
            <li>And it smells good.</li>
            <li>Good product, smells good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great with controlling static, too.</li>
            <li>SMELLS GREAT LOVE THIS ITEM&lt;</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell too great but better than the lice guard</li>
            <li>Very strong fragrance and pleasant too.</li>
            <li>Once this bottle is gone, I will definatley be buying more!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>love the spray!  </li>
            <li>Plus I love the smell!</li>
            <li>Astonishingly, we have been lice-free for 2 years now!  </li>
            <li>I just dont understand how some parents let their kids go without being treated and think that it&#x27;s ok!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Smells good yet strong to keep the lice monsters AWAY!</li>
            <li>This is a great addition to an lice prevention program and easy to spritz on the go.</li>
            <li>We use this in conjunction with the Fairy Tales Rosemary Repel Shampoo, which is another amazing product.  </li>
            <li>So in comes this amazing product.</li>
            <li>Excellent product I am very please with it</li>
            <li>If you go on their website, it states that when all three are used together, it&#x27;s 100% effective in repeling them.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, too.  </li>
            <li>It smells so nice</li>
            <li>I even use it on my own hair.</li>
            <li>But, adding the conditioner and then leave-in spray (or gel) brings it to about 100% by (admittedly) their own research.</li>
            <li>it does work nicely as a detangler as well.</li>
            <li>Nice conditioning spray to get rid of bed head</li>
            <li>so that is nice too.  </li>
            <li>She liked that it has a castle on it and calls it her princess spray.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice refresher for those days</li>
            <li>Kind of smells like the Aveda products.</li>
            <li>Reviews said it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>Awesome Product, highly recommend</li>
            <li>Smells nice and is a good light leave in.</li>
            <li>This product did not work for me at all, and the scent is very strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made our morning so much more enjoyable!</li>
            <li>Light and smells good.</li>
            <li>The most effective way to stop or prevent is to buy the comb from fairy tales and do a 1 or 2 combing every week....</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a good detangler and smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>Smells great, non offensive, just the right mix.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this spray!</li>
            <li>Not only are the ingredients excellent, but it does the job and more!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>Nice smell, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff for my son&#x27;s fine hair!</li>
            <li>I would have given 5 stars if it helped get his tangles out better.</li>
            <li>seriously love this stuff.</li>
            <li>two kids in school makes you nervous and this helps me feel better.</li>
            <li>We love it.  </li>
            <li>I like this spray because it has a refreshing scent and prevents headlice along with conditioning child&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>Oh well, its ok.  </li>
            <li>It was a wonderful tip given to me by my boys former hair stylist.</li>
            <li>well and smells lovely (if you like rosemary).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that the spray deserves credit for that, but it helped us feel better.</li>
            <li>(she couldn&#x27;t handle any more) and they started disappearing.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to prove if the spray is the cause of it</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>I love this product and continually reorder it.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>It does work to detangle nicely and leaves a light silky sheen on her hair when combed thru afterwards</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product..</li>
            <li>Makes her hair more manageable, too</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s shoulder length hair always looks lovely.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS</li>
            <li>Love the spray.</li>
            <li>You still have to make sure your children are not sharing,</li>
            <li>but this stuff smells nice and leaves my son&#x27;s hair soft and makes his curls look really great.</li>
            <li>Two things I love about this product.</li>
            <li>Not as many tears in the am before we head out the door to school.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It also helps with static &amp; frizzes</li>
            <li>and I feel safe using it on my kids.  </li>
            <li>my daughter is still lice free!  </li>
            <li>It has stood up to the terrors of public school, and it smells awesome.  </li>
            <li>What more could you want?</li>
            <li>so I immediately combed the internet for a healthy alternative to any chemical lice sprays.</li>
            <li>Smells great and works really well.</li>
            <li>Work at a school and we love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This spray conditioner is ok.</li>
            <li>It just works ok.</li>
            <li>I am a preschool teacher and one of the reason that I love my job</li>
            <li>but I have been in many opportunities where I could have caught it.</li>
            <li>I feel as if this makes my hair even more silky and healthier.</li>
            <li>Yes, I would recommend this...can&#x27;t hurt to have a preventative when it comes to head lice. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy more when we run out.</li>
            <li>Love the smell...</li>
            <li>so trying stop them means no sharing and head touching.  </li>
            <li>You must love the smell of Rosemary to consider this product.</li>
            <li>It create static in the hair</li>
            <li>We use two to four spritzes on my daughters hair for the lovely smell this has.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for sure if this works or not, but my son does not like the smell.  </li>
            <li>If you like the smell of rosemary then youâ€™re going to love it.</li>
            <li>Have been spraying kids&#x27; hair every day for school and so far so good!</li>
            <li>;  So far so good!</li>
            <li>It has a nice, soft smell, it keeps her hair silky and healthy, and it must work fairly well at keeping bugs/lice away.</li>
            <li>Also, per their own materials, the products must be layered for full effect.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and super de-tangler and good preventative!</li>
            <li>Kid friendly!</li>
            <li>Overall it is a nice conditioning spray that smells great</li>
            <li>The conditioner is a great detangler, and leaves the hair soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Great product so far and smooth transaction with the seller!</li>
            <li>We LOVE the smell of this spray, it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>, HOW COOL IS THAT!</li>
            <li>Smells nice and makes my daughters hair nice and soft</li>
            <li>Easy on the hair too.</li>
            <li>Makes hair manageable and easy to brush thru.  </li>
            <li>but the smell is so strong and lingers, so</li>
            <li>she is just fine...</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be bothering my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So much so I&#x27;ve started using the product myself just so my hair looks better!</li>
            <li>Smella great and leaves the hair feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>Great product and easy to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>but I do believe the spray is a huge help too.    </li>
            <li>and both kids are still lice free.</li>
            <li>Have been free for 2-months</li>
            <li>but I can say my kids are lice free.</li>
            <li>So in short, we are quite happy with this spray.  </li>
            <li>kids been lice free.</li>
            <li>Used it with the Nit Free Terminator Lice Comb</li>
            <li>but mine has been lice free since I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>pesticide free in all cases.</li>
            <li>it leaves even the cleanest, most freshly washed hair, looking oily if applied liberally.</li>
            <li>So far so good on this repelling the lice</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>otherwise so far so good</li>
            <li>SO GOOD we are in the clear.</li>
            <li>Smells good and leaves hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>We use this as a preventative every day, and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>We have been using Fairy Tales for 2 years at our house, and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I do not know if it is working, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>It sprays a lovely stream right at the side of your head</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think that purchasing strong, chemical-laden, (in which those are all carinogenic) products to kill or deter lice is appropriate for children.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this entire product line!!!</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>The prece is worth the piece of mind!  </li>
            <li>But after doing some research, I found out that lice prefer clean hair.</li>
            <li>.....don&#x27;t LOVE the smell, but if it helps prevent lice, I can get past that very easily! :)</li>
            <li>There have been no breakouts thus far in her class, but just want to be on the safe side for prevention, if there ever is!</li>
            <li>Very good product use it on my daughter hair everyday Before school</li>
            <li>but the herbal smell is amazing and makes hair super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>It smells nice, is natural, and we haven&#x27;t gotten any lice.</li>
            <li>but if it really does then it&#x27;s a plus for me :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;She mentioned that shampoos that we all like that smell fruity &amp; sweet, lice like as well.  </li>
            <li>I love that its a natural product and great for daily use.</li>
            <li>Eventually you get used to the sweet smells.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice, leaves hair soft.  </li>
            <li>Prefer this over another brand (green bottle from Walgreensâ€¦.can&#x27;t remember name) because the smell is much more pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Smells strong at first but smell dissipates rather quickly, hoping that it will still repel without classmates saying &amp;</li>
            <li>We are a very clean family and am very anal about our childrens hygiene.</li>
            <li>I can spray some on quickly and brush their hair</li>
            <li>and this helps detangle it quickly.</li>
            <li>then your kid will be lice free too ;-)</li>
            <li>I think I might start buying their shampoo and conditioner (since they are all natural ingredients) as well! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>We will definitely get more when this bottle is gone!</li>
            <li>and I love that it is natural!</li>
            <li>Smells a little strong but way better than risking getting lice :-)</li>
            <li>Works really well as a detangler for my daughter&#x27;s fine, curly hair, and lasts quite a while, which is always a plus.</li>
            <li>Works great and more importantly, no lice issues so far!</li>
            <li>If you like more sheen there are a ton of products, but this is the only thing I could find for kids with lice issues and fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It also seems to be a bit more environmentally friendly than my usual hair care products, which is great when you&#x27;re visiting in sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel comfortable saying it absolutely works.</li>
            <li>I used it a few times while on vacation to keep the static out of my own hair.</li>
            <li>Lice were making the rounds at my daughter&#x27;s elementary school, so we ordered this product preemptively.</li>
            <li>There has been many cases of head lice and so far no one in our home has gotten it again.</li>
            <li>Also love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>Leaves fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that the fragrance is the same as the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s color safe and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>A must for kids in elementary school.  </li>
            <li>if they are exposed you can catch right at the onset.</li>
            <li>Plus, I love the smell of rosemary in general, so there you go...</li>
            <li>From elementary to college student, our girls have had positive experience.</li>
            <li>The important this is SO FAR</li>
            <li>Not a trace of lice in our home since the first time my daughter came home from school with it over a year ago.  </li>
            <li>This spray makes brushing kids hair a breeze, Easy to get through tough nuts.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is good and if you believe in fairy tales...</li>
            <li>The child I used it on like that it &amp;#34;styled&amp;#34; his hair and then other children asked to have the &amp;#34;styling spray&amp;#34; put in their hair which made a nice additional precaution.</li>
            <li>Works great as a detangler and does not dry her hair out like other leave in sprays.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for sure if it really repels lice, but we&#x27;ve had multiple cases at our school over the years and my children have never gotten them.</li>
            <li>It has the huge advantage over other products that it does not add sheen for girls with fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I treated my whole family with spray first time even though not all had lice-</li>
            <li>It smells nice but not worth the money for prevention.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good detangler however due to the natural essences</li>
            <li>Luckily I tried it before I sprayed it on my 13 year old, because she would have been mortified at the smell and effect on her hair.  </li>
            <li>This does have a very strong smell -- that&#x27;s the point -- and you have to be very careful not to get it in anyone&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li>We use it daily and it makes it easy to manage her hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>It does smell strongly of citronella but fades in a short time.</li>
            <li>Odd smell but so far so good.</li>
            <li>My daughter was a magnet for lice last year and since using this spray we&#x27;ve been lucky and not infected!</li>
            <li>Anyway, they both have kind of dry hair but using a real conditioner is too much for them at their young age - enter this product...</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and knowing it keeps the little critters away is a bonus.</li>
            <li>Keeping my daughter&#x27;s hair in a bunn or high ponytail forever wasn&#x27;t exactly going over well with her.  </li>
            <li>it works very well.</li>
            <li>Worth the use a continued natural precaution, unless the day comes when it&#x27;s proven ineffective.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well on tangles though</li>
            <li>Our school has not had a lice breakout, but I am hoping if it does, we will be ready and armed to prevent it.  </li>
            <li>There is something in the spray which deters bugs from buzzing around the kids&#x27; heads at night at camp on a really buggy lake.  </li>
            <li>, however there is something in this that my daughter is highly allergic to!</li>
            <li>We figured we needed to really layer the products on to keep the buggers away</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>it works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like using the Fairy tales Rosemary Repel Spray and Shield as a preventative product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it really repels lice or not</li>
            <li>One it really, really works to repel head lice.</li>
            <li>After switching to Fairy Tales Shampoo and Conditioner in a last ditch effort to get rid of school born lice, we liked both so much that we switched the entire family to using it all the time.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping-</li>
            <li>and it took a real heart-to-heart with a couple moms to stop the madness.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment if it really does repel anything or not.  </li>
            <li>sometimes she comes out smelling like a citronella candle if she puts too much.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really detangle her hair, but then again it doesn&#x27;t advertise this option.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but I found it very medicated and offputting and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell either.</li>
            <li>This leave in conditioner was nice, not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>and I will probably just go back to making my own spray with water and essential oils when this bottle is done.</li>
            <li>Not a huge fan of the smell, kind of reminds me of a spray for dogs.</li>
            <li>I do not like the strong smell, and I was hoping this would be a detangling conditioner for my daughter&#x27;s long hair.  </li>
            <li>It makes combing her hair in the morning super easy with just a few sprays.</li>
            <li>It smells much better than the other one I had</li>
            <li>I do a lot of outdoor activities, and find that mosquitos and other flying pests are attracted by the perfumes in most hair products.  </li>
            <li>Meh its ok love the smell but its certainly not very effective so far</li>
            <li>While difficult to know if it really is a lice preventative, this works very well as a detangler and smells great.</li>
            <li>Fairytales Terminator comb: available on AMAZON or Ulta beauty supply- for long hair, part into 3 sections, start with bottom, clip sides forward, working thru each section&lt;br</li>
            <li>A true testament of this product is that my daughter had a sleepover at a friend&#x27;s house and we found out the next day the friend had lice.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how effective it is at preventing lice</li>
            <li>It works okay as a detangler and does not weigh hair down when used every day.</li>
            <li>It has a odd strong smell when you first put it on</li>
            <li>Nice scent but harsh on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong at first but after 5 minutes you don&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you have kids in school.</li>
            <li>They all smell a little like a citronella candle to me, but this one is much better than the others.  </li>
            <li>This was highly recommended by a few teachers at the school, and Amazon had a slightly better price than buying it at a brick and mortar place.  </li>
            <li>After using the FT removal kit, I wanted to help the third go-around be a success.  </li>
            <li>I think it works for adding extra protection and maybe we should use this in-between shampooing and right before school.</li>
            <li>REAPEAT COMBING AFTER 4 DAYS, no spray unless there are live bugs</li>
            <li>I am wondering where people live (</li>
            <li>It is the BEST leave in spray I have found for my daughter who has very hard to tame hair.</li>
            <li>This seems to do a good job at repelling lice before they become expensive when the kid really uses it.  </li>
            <li>He is in kindergarten and with his wild hair in the morning, this makes it calm right down.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old daughter loves the smell of this stuff!</li>
            <li>daughter has not got any lice since the first (and only time) even though there was another case in her class at school.</li>
            <li>The first time my daughter got lice we were only using the Repel Spray.  </li>
            <li>My 6 yr old loves the rosemary, tea tree, citronella-ish smell too!</li>
            <li>No more tears and silky smooth hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to get tangles out and smooth down that crazy wake-up hair.</li>
            <li>The lice went away in January and everyone has been clear since.  </li>
            <li>So far my kids have not gotten lice, but I also don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s anyone at school with it.</li>
            <li>Thanks to daily spraying my kids heads, backpacks and coats</li>
            <li>People have been using natural ingredients to solve problems for years and years that have worked.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my twin 3yr old boys and 8 yr old girl.</li>
            <li>After combing is complete, SPRAY/SATURATE with ACU LIFE LICE CURE (this is the product she used)</li>
            <li>My 4 year old uses this is her hair for protection and</li>
            <li>thus far, it seems to work.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat a natural, organic product I guess.     </li>
            <li>So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter enjoys the smell of it and has welcomed it as part of the daily routine for getting ready for school.</li>
            <li>Seems to work so far.  </li>
            <li>So far, she has not had lice</li>
            <li>The rosemary is not over powering as far as the smell goes.</li>
            <li>I also have my girls put their coats inside their backpack, instead of hanging them right next to a potentially lice infested coat.</li>
            <li>I have 3 other kids at home 2 girls that also have long beautiful thick hair, so</li>
            <li>This product is not on the inexpensive side,  I agree, but when battling the little creatures that breed at our children&#x27;s schools this product is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really say if it&#x27;s working...since we have not had a lice scare in my school for a long time now.</li>
            <li>(Re-comb weekly to ensure nits are gone &amp; for prevention-comb only not spray); spray is for killing live</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only real preventative measure I have found that actually prevents and kills and treats on contact</li>
            <li>and if it helps a little bit it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I use this on both younger sons (7 and 10 years old)</li>
            <li>It may remind you of the essential oils aisle at a natural food grocery store.  </li>
            <li>It not only worked but it also makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li>Recieved extremely fast and exactly as expected</li>
            <li>I ordered this as a post-cautionary application since the first two attempts using a more widely known product were fails.  </li>
            <li>It really has been a life and stress saver for this house hold because we hate bugs of all kinds and head lice is at the top of the list right next to bedbugs.</li>
            <li>I was horrified when I first found the little boogers.</li>
            <li>You can make something pretty darn similar with essential oils for a lot less.</li>
            <li>and even though I have naturally straight, black, silky hair...</li>
            <li>Works really well at detangling hair as long as you use enough of it and comb through when the hair is really wet.</li>
            <li>and it comes Highly recommended by other parents that we know personally!</li>
            <li>She has fine, thick blonde hair with some loose curl.</li>
            <li>Lice do not like certain smells, tea tree oil, lavender, rosemary to name a few.  </li>

            <li> we are lice free this school year!!!</li>
            <li> we love the conditioning spray!!  </li>
            <li> I even use it on my own hair!</li>
            <li> On a better note, neither of my children have had any bugs in their hair.  :D</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the world&#x27;s best detangler, but it works ok for my toddler.</li>
            <li> We (family of 5) have been using this successfully for 5 years now.  </li>
            <li> I am not saying that this stuff is awesome, but my child has not had any signs of head lice and many of her classmates have.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is pleasant, the packaging is charming, and my child doesn&#x27;t feel like she&#x27;s doing a treatment.  </li>
            <li> Then it smells good and helps with tangles  </li>
            <li> ; GOOD SMELL&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Fairy Tales makes good products.</li>
            <li> but the smell is soo good</li>
            <li> My girls use nothing but the Fairly Tale products on their hair.  </li>
            <li> Unlike others like this, this smells really good and kids don&#x27;t mind wearing this.  </li>
            <li> Good for curly or wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> Good stuff</li>
            <li> I feel so good after spraying this - knowing my daughter&#x27;s hair/head is protected when she goes to school.  </li>
            <li> I think any leave-in conditioner/detangler helps though, and this (to me) does NOT smell good</li>
            <li> Smells good and we haven&#x27;t had any issues with lice</li>
            <li> But what I do now is that it makes my hair smell good (well, after you get used to the scent that</li>
            <li> Detangles fairly well</li>
            <li> And it smells good.</li>
            <li> Good product, smells good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great with controlling static, too.</li>
            <li> SMELLS GREAT LOVE THIS ITEM&lt;</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell too great but better than the lice guard</li>
            <li> Very strong fragrance and pleasant too.</li>
            <li> Once this bottle is gone, I will definatley be buying more!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> love the spray!  </li>
            <li> Plus I love the smell!</li>
            <li> Astonishingly, we have been lice-free for 2 years now!  </li>
            <li> I just dont understand how some parents let their kids go without being treated and think that it&#x27;s ok!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Smells good yet strong to keep the lice monsters AWAY!</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to an lice prevention program and easy to spritz on the go.</li>
            <li> We use this in conjunction with the Fairy Tales Rosemary Repel Shampoo, which is another amazing product.  </li>
            <li> So in comes this amazing product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product I am very please with it</li>
            <li> If you go on their website, it states that when all three are used together, it&#x27;s 100% effective in repeling them.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, too.  </li>
            <li> It smells so nice</li>
            <li> I even use it on my own hair.</li>
            <li> But, adding the conditioner and then leave-in spray (or gel) brings it to about 100% by (admittedly) their own research.</li>
            <li> it does work nicely as a detangler as well.</li>
            <li> Nice conditioning spray to get rid of bed head</li>
            <li> so that is nice too.  </li>
            <li> She liked that it has a castle on it and calls it her princess spray.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice refresher for those days</li>
            <li> Kind of smells like the Aveda products.</li>
            <li> Reviews said it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> Awesome Product, highly recommend</li>
            <li> Smells nice and is a good light leave in.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me at all, and the scent is very strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made our morning so much more enjoyable!</li>
            <li> Light and smells good.</li>
            <li> The most effective way to stop or prevent is to buy the comb from fairy tales and do a 1 or 2 combing every week....</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a good detangler and smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> Smells great, non offensive, just the right mix.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this spray!</li>
            <li> Not only are the ingredients excellent, but it does the job and more!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> Nice smell, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my son&#x27;s fine hair!</li>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars if it helped get his tangles out better.</li>
            <li> seriously love this stuff.</li>
            <li> two kids in school makes you nervous and this helps me feel better.</li>
            <li> We love it.  </li>
            <li> I like this spray because it has a refreshing scent and prevents headlice along with conditioning child&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> Oh well, its ok.  </li>
            <li> It was a wonderful tip given to me by my boys former hair stylist.</li>
            <li> well and smells lovely (if you like rosemary).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that the spray deserves credit for that, but it helped us feel better.</li>
            <li> (she couldn&#x27;t handle any more) and they started disappearing.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to prove if the spray is the cause of it</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> I love this product and continually reorder it.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> It does work to detangle nicely and leaves a light silky sheen on her hair when combed thru afterwards</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product..</li>
            <li> Makes her hair more manageable, too</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s shoulder length hair always looks lovely.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS</li>
            <li> Love the spray.</li>
            <li> You still have to make sure your children are not sharing,</li>
            <li> but this stuff smells nice and leaves my son&#x27;s hair soft and makes his curls look really great.</li>
            <li> Two things I love about this product.</li>
            <li> Not as many tears in the am before we head out the door to school.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It also helps with static &amp; frizzes</li>
            <li> and I feel safe using it on my kids.  </li>
            <li> my daughter is still lice free!  </li>
            <li> It has stood up to the terrors of public school, and it smells awesome.  </li>
            <li> What more could you want?</li>
            <li> so I immediately combed the internet for a healthy alternative to any chemical lice sprays.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works really well.</li>
            <li> Work at a school and we love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This spray conditioner is ok.</li>
            <li> It just works ok.</li>
            <li> I am a preschool teacher and one of the reason that I love my job</li>
            <li> but I have been in many opportunities where I could have caught it.</li>
            <li> I feel as if this makes my hair even more silky and healthier.</li>
            <li> Yes, I would recommend this...can&#x27;t hurt to have a preventative when it comes to head lice. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably buy more when we run out.</li>
            <li> Love the smell...</li>
            <li> so trying stop them means no sharing and head touching.  </li>
            <li> You must love the smell of Rosemary to consider this product.</li>
            <li> It create static in the hair</li>
            <li> We use two to four spritzes on my daughters hair for the lovely smell this has.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure if this works or not, but my son does not like the smell.  </li>
            <li> If you like the smell of rosemary then youâ€™re going to love it.</li>
            <li> Have been spraying kids&#x27; hair every day for school and so far so good!</li>
            <li> ;  So far so good!</li>
            <li> It has a nice, soft smell, it keeps her hair silky and healthy, and it must work fairly well at keeping bugs/lice away.</li>
            <li> Also, per their own materials, the products must be layered for full effect.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and super de-tangler and good preventative!</li>
            <li> Kid friendly!</li>
            <li> Overall it is a nice conditioning spray that smells great</li>
            <li> The conditioner is a great detangler, and leaves the hair soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Great product so far and smooth transaction with the seller!</li>
            <li> We LOVE the smell of this spray, it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li> , HOW COOL IS THAT!</li>
            <li> Smells nice and makes my daughters hair nice and soft</li>
            <li> Easy on the hair too.</li>
            <li> Makes hair manageable and easy to brush thru.  </li>
            <li> but the smell is so strong and lingers, so</li>
            <li> she is just fine...</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be bothering my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So much so I&#x27;ve started using the product myself just so my hair looks better!</li>
            <li> Smella great and leaves the hair feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> but I do believe the spray is a huge help too.    </li>
            <li> and both kids are still lice free.</li>
            <li> Have been free for 2-months</li>
            <li> but I can say my kids are lice free.</li>
            <li> So in short, we are quite happy with this spray.  </li>
            <li> kids been lice free.</li>
            <li> Used it with the Nit Free Terminator Lice Comb</li>
            <li> but mine has been lice free since I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> pesticide free in all cases.</li>
            <li> it leaves even the cleanest, most freshly washed hair, looking oily if applied liberally.</li>
            <li> So far so good on this repelling the lice</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> otherwise so far so good</li>
            <li> SO GOOD we are in the clear.</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> We use this as a preventative every day, and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> We have been using Fairy Tales for 2 years at our house, and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I do not know if it is working, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> It sprays a lovely stream right at the side of your head</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think that purchasing strong, chemical-laden, (in which those are all carinogenic) products to kill or deter lice is appropriate for children.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this entire product line!!!</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> The prece is worth the piece of mind!  </li>
            <li> But after doing some research, I found out that lice prefer clean hair.</li>
            <li> .....don&#x27;t LOVE the smell, but if it helps prevent lice, I can get past that very easily! :)</li>
            <li> There have been no breakouts thus far in her class, but just want to be on the safe side for prevention, if there ever is!</li>
            <li> Very good product use it on my daughter hair everyday Before school</li>
            <li> but the herbal smell is amazing and makes hair super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> It smells nice, is natural, and we haven&#x27;t gotten any lice.</li>
            <li> but if it really does then it&#x27;s a plus for me :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;She mentioned that shampoos that we all like that smell fruity &amp; sweet, lice like as well.  </li>
            <li> I love that its a natural product and great for daily use.</li>
            <li> Eventually you get used to the sweet smells.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice, leaves hair soft.  </li>
            <li> Prefer this over another brand (green bottle from Walgreensâ€¦.can&#x27;t remember name) because the smell is much more pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Smells strong at first but smell dissipates rather quickly, hoping that it will still repel without classmates saying &amp;</li>
            <li> We are a very clean family and am very anal about our childrens hygiene.</li>
            <li> I can spray some on quickly and brush their hair</li>
            <li> and this helps detangle it quickly.</li>
            <li> then your kid will be lice free too ;-)</li>
            <li> I think I might start buying their shampoo and conditioner (since they are all natural ingredients) as well! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> We will definitely get more when this bottle is gone!</li>
            <li> and I love that it is natural!</li>
            <li> Smells a little strong but way better than risking getting lice :-)</li>
            <li> Works really well as a detangler for my daughter&#x27;s fine, curly hair, and lasts quite a while, which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> Works great and more importantly, no lice issues so far!</li>
            <li> If you like more sheen there are a ton of products, but this is the only thing I could find for kids with lice issues and fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It also seems to be a bit more environmentally friendly than my usual hair care products, which is great when you&#x27;re visiting in sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel comfortable saying it absolutely works.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times while on vacation to keep the static out of my own hair.</li>
            <li> Lice were making the rounds at my daughter&#x27;s elementary school, so we ordered this product preemptively.</li>
            <li> There has been many cases of head lice and so far no one in our home has gotten it again.</li>
            <li> Also love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Leaves fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that the fragrance is the same as the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s color safe and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> A must for kids in elementary school.  </li>
            <li> if they are exposed you can catch right at the onset.</li>
            <li> Plus, I love the smell of rosemary in general, so there you go...</li>
            <li> From elementary to college student, our girls have had positive experience.</li>
            <li> The important this is SO FAR</li>
            <li> Not a trace of lice in our home since the first time my daughter came home from school with it over a year ago.  </li>
            <li> This spray makes brushing kids hair a breeze, Easy to get through tough nuts.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is good and if you believe in fairy tales...</li>
            <li> The child I used it on like that it &amp;#34;styled&amp;#34; his hair and then other children asked to have the &amp;#34;styling spray&amp;#34; put in their hair which made a nice additional precaution.</li>
            <li> Works great as a detangler and does not dry her hair out like other leave in sprays.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure if it really repels lice, but we&#x27;ve had multiple cases at our school over the years and my children have never gotten them.</li>
            <li> It has the huge advantage over other products that it does not add sheen for girls with fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I treated my whole family with spray first time even though not all had lice-</li>
            <li> It smells nice but not worth the money for prevention.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good detangler however due to the natural essences</li>
            <li> Luckily I tried it before I sprayed it on my 13 year old, because she would have been mortified at the smell and effect on her hair.  </li>
            <li> This does have a very strong smell -- that&#x27;s the point -- and you have to be very careful not to get it in anyone&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li> We use it daily and it makes it easy to manage her hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> It does smell strongly of citronella but fades in a short time.</li>
            <li> Odd smell but so far so good.</li>
            <li> My daughter was a magnet for lice last year and since using this spray we&#x27;ve been lucky and not infected!</li>
            <li> Anyway, they both have kind of dry hair but using a real conditioner is too much for them at their young age - enter this product...</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent and knowing it keeps the little critters away is a bonus.</li>
            <li> Keeping my daughter&#x27;s hair in a bunn or high ponytail forever wasn&#x27;t exactly going over well with her.  </li>
            <li> it works very well.</li>
            <li> Worth the use a continued natural precaution, unless the day comes when it&#x27;s proven ineffective.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well on tangles though</li>
            <li> Our school has not had a lice breakout, but I am hoping if it does, we will be ready and armed to prevent it.  </li>
            <li> There is something in the spray which deters bugs from buzzing around the kids&#x27; heads at night at camp on a really buggy lake.  </li>
            <li> , however there is something in this that my daughter is highly allergic to!</li>
            <li> We figured we needed to really layer the products on to keep the buggers away</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> it works very well.</li>
            <li> I really like using the Fairy tales Rosemary Repel Spray and Shield as a preventative product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really repels lice or not</li>
            <li> One it really, really works to repel head lice.</li>
            <li> After switching to Fairy Tales Shampoo and Conditioner in a last ditch effort to get rid of school born lice, we liked both so much that we switched the entire family to using it all the time.  </li>
            <li> fast shipping-</li>
            <li> and it took a real heart-to-heart with a couple moms to stop the madness.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment if it really does repel anything or not.  </li>
            <li> sometimes she comes out smelling like a citronella candle if she puts too much.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really detangle her hair, but then again it doesn&#x27;t advertise this option.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but I found it very medicated and offputting and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell either.</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner was nice, not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> and I will probably just go back to making my own spray with water and essential oils when this bottle is done.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the smell, kind of reminds me of a spray for dogs.</li>
            <li> I do not like the strong smell, and I was hoping this would be a detangling conditioner for my daughter&#x27;s long hair.  </li>
            <li> It makes combing her hair in the morning super easy with just a few sprays.</li>
            <li> It smells much better than the other one I had</li>
            <li> I do a lot of outdoor activities, and find that mosquitos and other flying pests are attracted by the perfumes in most hair products.  </li>
            <li> Meh its ok love the smell but its certainly not very effective so far</li>
            <li> While difficult to know if it really is a lice preventative, this works very well as a detangler and smells great.</li>
            <li> Fairytales Terminator comb: available on AMAZON or Ulta beauty supply- for long hair, part into 3 sections, start with bottom, clip sides forward, working thru each section&lt;br</li>
            <li> A true testament of this product is that my daughter had a sleepover at a friend&#x27;s house and we found out the next day the friend had lice.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how effective it is at preventing lice</li>
            <li> It works okay as a detangler and does not weigh hair down when used every day.</li>
            <li> It has a odd strong smell when you first put it on</li>
            <li> Nice scent but harsh on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong at first but after 5 minutes you don&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you have kids in school.</li>
            <li> They all smell a little like a citronella candle to me, but this one is much better than the others.  </li>
            <li> This was highly recommended by a few teachers at the school, and Amazon had a slightly better price than buying it at a brick and mortar place.  </li>
            <li> After using the FT removal kit, I wanted to help the third go-around be a success.  </li>
            <li> I think it works for adding extra protection and maybe we should use this in-between shampooing and right before school.</li>
            <li> REAPEAT COMBING AFTER 4 DAYS, no spray unless there are live bugs</li>
            <li> I am wondering where people live (</li>
            <li> It is the BEST leave in spray I have found for my daughter who has very hard to tame hair.</li>
            <li> This seems to do a good job at repelling lice before they become expensive when the kid really uses it.  </li>
            <li> He is in kindergarten and with his wild hair in the morning, this makes it calm right down.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter loves the smell of this stuff!</li>
            <li> daughter has not got any lice since the first (and only time) even though there was another case in her class at school.</li>
            <li> The first time my daughter got lice we were only using the Repel Spray.  </li>
            <li> My 6 yr old loves the rosemary, tea tree, citronella-ish smell too!</li>
            <li> No more tears and silky smooth hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to get tangles out and smooth down that crazy wake-up hair.</li>
            <li> The lice went away in January and everyone has been clear since.  </li>
            <li> So far my kids have not gotten lice, but I also don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s anyone at school with it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to daily spraying my kids heads, backpacks and coats</li>
            <li> People have been using natural ingredients to solve problems for years and years that have worked.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my twin 3yr old boys and 8 yr old girl.</li>
            <li> After combing is complete, SPRAY/SATURATE with ACU LIFE LICE CURE (this is the product she used)</li>
            <li> My 4 year old uses this is her hair for protection and</li>
            <li> thus far, it seems to work.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat a natural, organic product I guess.     </li>
            <li> So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter enjoys the smell of it and has welcomed it as part of the daily routine for getting ready for school.</li>
            <li> Seems to work so far.  </li>
            <li> So far, she has not had lice</li>
            <li> The rosemary is not over powering as far as the smell goes.</li>
            <li> I also have my girls put their coats inside their backpack, instead of hanging them right next to a potentially lice infested coat.</li>
            <li> I have 3 other kids at home 2 girls that also have long beautiful thick hair, so</li>
            <li> This product is not on the inexpensive side,  I agree, but when battling the little creatures that breed at our children&#x27;s schools this product is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really say if it&#x27;s working...since we have not had a lice scare in my school for a long time now.</li>
            <li> (Re-comb weekly to ensure nits are gone &amp; for prevention-comb only not spray); spray is for killing live</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only real preventative measure I have found that actually prevents and kills and treats on contact</li>
            <li> and if it helps a little bit it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I use this on both younger sons (7 and 10 years old)</li>
            <li> It may remind you of the essential oils aisle at a natural food grocery store.  </li>
            <li> It not only worked but it also makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li> Recieved extremely fast and exactly as expected</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a post-cautionary application since the first two attempts using a more widely known product were fails.  </li>
            <li> It really has been a life and stress saver for this house hold because we hate bugs of all kinds and head lice is at the top of the list right next to bedbugs.</li>
            <li> I was horrified when I first found the little boogers.</li>
            <li> You can make something pretty darn similar with essential oils for a lot less.</li>
            <li> and even though I have naturally straight, black, silky hair...</li>
            <li> Works really well at detangling hair as long as you use enough of it and comb through when the hair is really wet.</li>
            <li> and it comes Highly recommended by other parents that we know personally!</li>
            <li> She has fine, thick blonde hair with some loose curl.</li>
            <li> Lice do not like certain smells, tea tree oil, lavender, rosemary to name a few.  </li>
            <li> their other conditioner in order to make their hair soft.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money is the main point I can make.</li>
            <li> This product last a long time, and a little really will go a long way.</li>
            <li> not sure if it will really help</li>
            <li> I got this to help repel lice, not sure if it really works or not</li>
            <li> Secondly, my granddaughter has really long hair, so I spray this in it and around any snarls and it does work as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love that it all smells fine and doesn&#x27;t have all those nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> I checked this one out and has all the same ingredients as other more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> and we&#x27;re still using both products everyday nearly two years later.</li>
            <li> It does get the tangles out of long hair.</li>
            <li> She has extremely long hair</li>
            <li> I like this product, but didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating because it is not completely clear of chemical additives.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has thick, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I think me &amp; my daughter were giving them back and forth to each other.</li>
            <li> They had slept next to each other and she NEVER got lice.</li>
            <li> 1) COMB DRY HAIR with nit comb:  </li>
            <li> I used it alone, there is no live lice found.</li>
            <li> We use this every single school day.  </li>
            <li> My tips- have your girls wear a ponytail, loose hair is like a ladder for lice.</li>
            <li> I actually have no idea if it works other than to say we haven&#x27;t had lice!</li>
            <li> As for a previous review, lice eggs can take two weeks to hatch, so it&#x27;s possible they were already in the child&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I end up just doing one long spray from one ear to the other.</li>
            <li> I use this EVERY  single day I send my child to school!  </li>
            <li> ,  not only does is smell yummy, but it does ward off the little things</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> After a few infestations, I finally placed an order for this and the Fairy Tales</li>
            <li> I use on my daughter&#x27;s hair roughly once-a-week just in case.  </li>
            <li> I can, although for anyone else in this position please reference pink Everlast boxing gloves and hand wraps</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Kindergarten aged daughter.  </li>
            <li> no strong citronella smell like some of the similar products.</li>
            <li> I had talked to a few other parents who purchased some other similar sprays.</li>
            <li> Can I say with complete assurance that the spray repels little creepy crawlies, no I can&#x27;t, but so far we have not had to deal with them and we have been exposed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product religiously for the past YEAR...  </li>
            <li> When lice broke out at school, like every other parent, I freaked out.  </li>
            <li> and it went to my other girls</li>
            <li> took her to the dr this morning and kept her home from school due to the redness</li>
            <li> While other kids in my daughter&#x27;s class have caught lice, my daughter never has.</li>
            <li> reminds me of an expensive shampoo scent (Av*d*).  </li>
            <li> But just like any other bug spray, I like having it for when I feel we need it--</li>
            <li> If you use the shampoo and conditioner, this item is a must as the other products will produce drying effects after a month or so.</li>
            <li> I love the spray, but this time it took quite a bit of time to get to me:( so alittle bummed</li>
            <li> are all the endless hugs that I get: In the morning, through out the day...</li>
            <li> My kids wash their hair every other day and this is what we use after.</li>
            <li> I told a bunch of other moms at school about this when I got mine.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are both active duty in the USAF and our daughter is in daycare 9hrs a day.</li>
            <li> Its more a repellent / daily use product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like I see other products that other parents use does to their kids!</li>
            <li> Obviously some of that is common sense teaching our children not to share hair accessories</li>
            <li> Not worth the hype.</li>
            <li> Nice to have the added repellent bonus.</li>
            <li> Since using there have been a few other lice breakouts and we&#x27;ve not gotten anything.  </li>
            <li> Use a shampoo with things like mint, rosemary, tea tree, lavender, eucalyptus, not sweet, fruity smelling.</li>
            <li> We use it everyday before preschool to comb down his bed head.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad and dries quickly in the hair</li>
            <li> Little girls get tangly hair</li>
            <li> I had to get something to try to keep the little buggers away from my child.</li>
            <li> At no time over the past year have my kids used ANY other shampoo and conditioner and we used the repel spray EVERY DAY.  </li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about all the oil mentioned in the product, but I needn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> I DONT WORRY IF MY KIDS ARE GOING TO BRING LITTLE BUGS</li>
            <li> Tends to make my girl&#x27;s hair a little sticky/oily.</li>
            <li> We use this almost everyday to keep those pesky little critters away.</li>
            <li> I used it on my son everyday before he goes to school to prevent the lice.</li>
            <li> The product has all natural ingredients and you can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> We have used it religiously everyday and she has not gotten lice when it&#x27;s been going around school.</li>
            <li> We use this everyday in my pre-school daughter&#x27;s hair to avoid getting lice.</li>
            <li> Everyday use of this leave in conditioner prevents lice.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all greasy, so I don&#x27;t mind using it on their hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s been lice in the class a few times (or continuously</li>
            <li> I have used this for my daughter&#x27;s hair a few times.</li>
            <li> And it does not leave my daughter&#x27;s hair greasy or stiff</li>
            <li> so your hair is stiff in one spot.  </li>
            <li> I do the shampoo and conditioner every other night during bath time and spray this stuff on her head before leaving for school everyday and I have not seen any signs of lice yet!!</li>
            <li> I feel better thinking I&#x27;m doing something proactive to avoid those nasty little critters.</li>
            <li> Also not very effective at detangling.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t prevent getting lice, but might make it less common, from my experience.  </li>
            <li> just had very little contact with the child who had it.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it it because of this product or not.</li>
            <li> Was so hoping an all-natural product wouldn&#x27;t be so harsh on skin!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s luck or the product</li>
            <li> I wish I would have done it a few months ago!  </li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t get it, but not sure if I can attribute that to the spray or to she</li>
            <li> Not sure about deterring lice, we haven&#x27;t been around any yet</li>
            <li> UNTIL this past week...</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s school had a small outbreak of lice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it &#x27;truly&#x27; works on the lice front</li>
            <li> there is no magic bullet.</li>
            <li> No more lice...</li>
            <li> I have the shampoo and conditioner too and the conditioner is not very good either.</li>
            <li> I can only say it stinks</li>
            <li> leave in AT LEAST 20 minutes or overnight before washing out.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> My daughter does tell me she hasn&#x27;t noticed the gnats flying around her face lately.</li>
            <li> So it is not a pleasant experience to attempt to comb through afterwards.</li>
            <li> There were several notes sent home since that horrible episode about other children having it</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> it broke her out in rash immediately after applying it around her face, behind her ears her hairline</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> It does not untangle the hair, if anything the spray makes it worse.  </li>
            <li> Do not get lulled into a false sense of security with these products.</li>
            <li> Well needless to say, it took us a MONTh to fully get rid of them.</li>
            <li> but we were wrong.  </li>
            <li> Left a terrible rash all over my daughters neck and shoulders!</li>
            <li> and (hopefully!) ward off any potential nasty bugs.</li>
            <li> the lil&#x27; one is sad that they have to go home</li>
            <li> Daily spray to use to help repel lice - they hate the smell of rosemary!</li>
            <li> Those little buggers are dreadful to deal with, so if an ounce of prevention is on your mind, this is something I recommend.</li>
            <li> you can imagine how bad it would be if my daughter got it</li>
            <li> We use Fairy Tales Shampoo, Conditioner, Detangler and Repel spray EVERY DAY and both my kids still got lice and they got it bad.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell too bad.  </li>
            <li> Smell isnt too bad.</li>
            <li> We spray our girls (ages 9 and 7 now) hair with this every morning before going off to school, especially behind the ears and nape areas.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the lice repellent portion of it</li>
            <li> It seemed to work well, but my granddaughter hated the scent, so would not use it.</li>
            <li> this is a repellent not an eliminator.</li>
            <li> (that stuff stinks!!)</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> And both of my children just contracted a horrible case of lice.  </li>
            <li> We have been dealing with this nasty problem for months.</li>
            <li> my daughter is in kindergarten and my worst fear as a mother is head lice</li>
            <li> it was awful</li>
            <li> Others they&#x27;ve tried have smelled really horrible!</li>
            <li> My daughter has had the worst luck with lice this school year</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best. I am a teacher and have several lice outbreaks in my classroom and I never get it. My hair feels wonderful after using it and it smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> I used it alone, there is no live lice found. But with nits. So I used it with the shampoo. it works very well.</li>
            <li> Not so great smell but works nevertheless</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to an lice prevention program and easy to spritz on the go.</li>
            <li> After a lice scare at school, we ordered this to use as preventative. It smells nice, is natural, and we haven&#x27;t gotten any lice. I&#x27;ll keep using it until the end of the school year after her nightly bath.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where/how this got described as a conditioning spray - I could not even put a comb through my hair after applying it.  Luckily I tried it before I sprayed it on my 13 year old, because she would have been mortified at the smell and effect on her hair.  I cannot speak to whether it &amp;#34;repels&amp;#34; lice because how can you know that?  I can only say it stinks and it does not condition.  I might try it as a bug spray when summer comes and the mosquitoes are rampant.  Don&#x27;t waste your money is the main point I can make.</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair to help detangle after a bath. I only purchased the rosemary repel shampoo and used this with it after wards. I even use it on my own hair!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this truly repels lice, but my preschooler hasn&#x27;t had lice yet, which again doesn&#x27;t necessarily show cause and effect, but if there&#x27;s something I can do that may help I want to try it. Works really well as a detangler for my daughter&#x27;s fine, curly hair, and lasts quite a while, which is always a plus. Knocked a star off because I personally don&#x27;t like the rosemary smell for a hair product, but once her hair dries it&#x27;s really not as noticeable. Worth the use a continued natural precaution, unless the day comes when it&#x27;s proven ineffective.</li>
            <li> So far so good on this repelling the lice but it&#x27;s a good detangler and smells pretty good.My kids like it.</li>
            <li> I just got this yesterday for my son.  We have never had a lice incident but I am paranoid about it and want to prevent it.  This leave in conditioner was nice, not too heavy.  I would have given 5 stars if it helped get his tangles out better.</li>
            <li> Excellent product I am very please with it and I use it with the Fairy Tales Rosemary Repel Styling Gel.</li>
            <li> So far my kids have not gotten lice, but I also don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s anyone at school with it. I just use it just in case. It doesn&#x27;t work very well on tangles though and I will probably just go back to making my own spray with water and essential oils when this bottle is done. I have the shampoo and conditioner too and the conditioner is not very good either. Little girls get tangly hair and I find myself having to use it plus their other conditioner in order to make their hair soft.</li>
            <li> I use this EVERY  single day I send my child to school!  We&#x27;ve had lice twice in our house, and I use this product RELIGIOUSLY to keep them away!!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this entire product line!!!</li>
            <li> We had a lice incident last year and I have been using this product on my daughters hair.  A recent lice outbreak at her school and guess who did not have lice, my daughter.  It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Nice scent but harsh on sensitive skin. Also not very effective at detangling.</li>
            <li> Fairy Tales is a great product and the developers should be very proud of it.  It smells great and works well at getting out tangles.  Our school has not had a lice breakout, but I am hoping if it does, we will be ready and armed to prevent it.  Even though there haven&#x27;t been any outbreaks, I use it anyway, I like the scent.    I am definitely recommending it to my friends and family!</li>
            <li> Best lice spray ever! I bought this last year and this and both kids are still lice free. This product is great!</li>
            <li> We have been using this de tangling spray for years. It does get the tangles out of long hair. We have not gotten lice. Not sure if it it because of this product or not.</li>
            <li> seriously love this stuff. two kids in school makes you nervous and this helps me feel better. Then it smells good and helps with tangles  I rebuy this often if not here ulta has it. My son&#x27;s school did a bug check (gag) no bugs here!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this after trying another lice repel spray after my daughter had lice.  It smells much better than the other one I had and my daughter just sprays her hair every morning before she puts it up.  We have not had lice again, I will continue to use this throughout her school days!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product religiously for the past YEAR...  And both of my children just contracted a horrible case of lice.  What a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this spray for about 8 months and swear by it! My daughter was a magnet for lice last year and since using this spray we&#x27;ve been lucky and not infected! I will continue to use this product on both my kids through their school years.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter loves the smell of this stuff! It makes combing her hair in the morning super easy with just a few sprays.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are both active duty in the USAF and our daughter is in daycare 9hrs a day. She has never had a case of lice and I spray this in her hair every morning before we leave the house. It has a nice, soft smell, it keeps her hair silky and healthy, and it must work fairly well at keeping bugs/lice away. While I&#x27;m swatting gnats/flies away when outside (because they&#x27;re attracted to my conditioner smell?) she is just fine... It&#x27;s great with controlling static, too. I used it a few times while on vacation to keep the static out of my own hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter brought home lice from preschool. I was horrified when I first found the little boogers. We are a very clean family and am very anal about our childrens hygiene. But after doing some research, I found out that lice prefer clean hair. Well needless to say, it took us a MONTh to fully get rid of them. I was looking on amazon for some preventive shampoos and came across this product. I purchased the fairytales shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner. If you go on their website, it states that when all three are used together, it&#x27;s 100% effective in repeling them. And we have offically been lice free for a month!!! I do the shampoo and conditioner every other night during bath time and spray this stuff on her head before leaving for school everyday and I have not seen any signs of lice yet!! It does not leave her hair greasy or anything like that. The smell is a little strong at first but after 5 minutes you don&#x27;t smell it anymore. But hey, if it&#x27;s going to keep them away, I can deal with the smell for alittle bit.  Once this bottle is gone, I will definatley be buying more!</li>
            <li> My daughter used it at camp and she didn&#x27;t come back with lice.  Not to say she would have come back with lice if she hadn&#x27;t used it.  There you have it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 years.  We love it.  It makes doing my girls&#x27; hair a breeze in the mornings.  Plus, the Rosemary scent is a deterant for lice.</li>
            <li> Prefer this over another brand (green bottle from Walgreensâ€¦.can&#x27;t remember name) because the smell is much more pleasant.  They all smell a little like a citronella candle to me, but this one is much better than the others.  Have been spraying kids&#x27; hair every day for school and so far so good!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT&amp;#62; GOOD SMELL&amp;#62; works well as a detangler. also use to spray backpacks and hats coats etc. Works great for camp, school, sleepover use</li>
            <li> Awesome Product, highly recommend</li>
            <li> I like this spray because it has a refreshing scent and prevents headlice along with conditioning child&#x27;s hair.  However, there is something added that wasn&#x27;t in the last bottle that I don&#x27;t like.  I think its the Citronella scent.  Oh well, its ok.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Cheapest price on the net! Works!!</li>
            <li> This was highly recommended by a few teachers at the school, and Amazon had a slightly better price than buying it at a brick and mortar place.  It smells nice, too.  Those little buggers are dreadful to deal with, so if an ounce of prevention is on your mind, this is something I recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to go with some lice prevention shampoos when there was an outbreak at my kids&#x27; school. So far so good. This does have a very strong smell -- that&#x27;s the point -- and you have to be very careful not to get it in anyone&#x27;s eyes. I recommend washing hands after using if you style hair that&#x27;s been sprayed with it. It works okay as a detangler and does not weigh hair down when used every day.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  We&#x27;ve never had lice in the house, or at camp.  There is something in the spray which deters bugs from buzzing around the kids&#x27; heads at night at camp on a really buggy lake.  We buy in pairs so we never run out!</li>
            <li> love the spray!  we use it almost every day....not sure if it will really help but we haven&#x27;t gotten lice...so I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> Smells good and good prevention against lice!</li>
            <li> We have used this for years. I spray my boys hair and backpacks every morning.  In a school with 800 kids and plenty of lice notices, they&#x27;ve never had lice. It was a wonderful tip given to me by my boys former hair stylist. I highly recommend it if you have kids in school.</li>
            <li> At this point last year we had lice already twice! Thanks to daily spraying my kids heads, backpacks and coats we are lice free this school year!!! My tips- have your girls wear a ponytail, loose hair is like a ladder for lice. I also have my girls put their coats inside their backpack, instead of hanging them right next to a potentially lice infested coat.</li>
            <li> Lice were making the rounds at my daughter&#x27;s elementary school, so we ordered this product preemptively. It&#x27;s a great spray - detangles well and smells lovely (if you like rosemary). And ...  no lice. I don&#x27;t know that the spray deserves credit for that, but it helped us feel better.</li>
            <li> We have been dealing with this nasty problem for months. I think me &amp; my daughter were giving them back and forth to each other. So we both used the Fairy Tales shampoo, conditioner &amp; conditioning spray and then combed our hair with LiceFreee and lice comb. I did it every day but I did my daughters twice a week (she couldn&#x27;t handle any more) and they started disappearing. It took about a month. Have been free for 2-months and it&#x27;s great. I think in was the combination of everything because when I tried these products individually they didn&#x27;t work. We still use the shampoo, conditioner &amp; conditioning spray every time.&lt;br /&gt;And on a side note, my daughter started swimming at the Y pool &amp; at friends houses and I noticed them disappearing also. Coincidence?&lt;br /&gt;Just happy they&#x27;re gone.</li>
            <li> If it didnt smell like thanksgiving dinner.. otherwise so far so good</li>
            <li> Odd smell but so far so good. When I received a notice that there were students in my child&#x27;s class that had lice I basically panicked! I had to get something to try to keep the little buggers away from my child. It has a odd strong smell when you first put it on but it seems to be gone with in about 5 mins. I think some of the others said it was rosemary but I have no clue. The important this is SO FAR SO GOOD we are in the clear.</li>
            <li> Great leave-in conditioner and hair detangler.  I can&#x27;t speak to the lice repellent portion of it but I can say my kids are lice free. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to prove if the spray is the cause of it but if it really does then it&#x27;s a plus for me :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sons...they use the Shampoo too -- because I have a fear of lice coming into our house after a scare last year...Anyway, they both have kind of dry hair but using a real conditioner is too much for them at their young age - enter this product...I can spray some on quickly and brush their hair and we are done.  Love it...Fairy Tales makes good products.</li>
            <li> I used it on my son everyday before he goes to school to prevent the lice. The product has all natural ingredients and you can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and continually reorder it.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this conditioning spray in addition to the shampoo for about a month. The scent is pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be bothering my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin. There have been a couple lice outbreaks at my daughter&#x27;s school. We haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li> When lice broke out at school, like every other parent, I freaked out.  Keeping my daughter&#x27;s hair in a bunn or high ponytail forever wasn&#x27;t exactly going over well with her.  I had talked to a few other parents who purchased some other similar sprays. I checked this one out and has all the same ingredients as other more expensive ones.  We LOVE the smell of this spray, it&#x27;s light but the smell is soo good I wish they made it in a regular aerosol for adults hair! &#x3D;)  Anyway daughter and son both like it (don&#x27;t let the title deter you from using for boys because they can get lice too!).  It does work to detangle nicely and leaves a light silky sheen on her hair when combed thru afterwards which are great added bonuses.  Since using there have been a few other lice breakouts and we&#x27;ve not gotten anything.  Obviously some of that is common sense teaching our children not to share hair accessories etc., but I do believe the spray is a huge help too.    People have been using natural ingredients to solve problems for years and years that have worked.  I really don&#x27;t think that purchasing strong, chemical-laden, (in which those are all carinogenic) products to kill or deter lice is appropriate for children.  So in short, we are quite happy with this spray.  It smells so nice I think I might start buying their shampoo and conditioner (since they are all natural ingredients) as well! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> My girls use nothing but the Fairly Tale products on their hair.  Have not gotten lice since its use and smells great.</li>
            <li> my daughter is in kindergarten and my worst fear as a mother is head lice I have 3 other kids at home 2 girls that also have long beautiful thick hair, so you can imagine how bad it would be if my daughter got it and it went to my other girls, however there is something in this that my daughter is highly allergic to! it broke her out in rash immediately after applying it around her face, behind her ears her hairline it was awful took her to the dr this morning and kept her home from school due to the redness</li>
            <li> Smella great and leaves the hair feeling super soft. I buy the shampoo too!</li>
            <li> Great product. Cannot be without this. Ever since I started using it kids been lice free. Nothing before this worked. I spray it on their hair every morning before school. it also detangles hair.</li>
            <li> Smells great, softens hair. Hopefully it works to repel the lice. We shall see.</li>
            <li> Do not care for this product. It didn&#x27;t work like it said it would.</li>
            <li> We got this for our daughter after we treated her hair for lice. Note: This will NOT remove / get rid of Lice (there is another product by Fairy Tales for that). Its more a repellent / daily use product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our daughter has not got any lice since the first (and only time) even though there was another case in her class at school. We use it daily and it makes it easy to manage her hair. Daughter loves the smell (not everyone may like the fragrance). We ordered another when we ran out. Love the product.</li>
            <li> We use Fairy Tales Shampoo, Conditioner, Detangler and Repel spray EVERY DAY and both my kids still got lice and they got it bad.  This is the second time.  The first time my daughter got lice we were only using the Repel Spray.  We figured we needed to really layer the products on to keep the buggers away but we were wrong.  At no time over the past year have my kids used ANY other shampoo and conditioner and we used the repel spray EVERY DAY.  Didn&#x27;t work. Do not get lulled into a false sense of security with these products.</li>
            <li> Left a terrible rash all over my daughters neck and shoulders! Was so hoping an all-natural product wouldn&#x27;t be so harsh on skin!</li>
            <li> It seemed to work well, but my granddaughter hated the scent, so would not use it. (sigh)</li>
            <li> These products are great for prevention.  The school year is starting stock up.</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves hair shiny and soft. Used it with the Nit Free Terminator Lice Comb (Now that is a great investment).</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this brand for over 2 yrs now. While other kids in my daughter&#x27;s class have caught lice, my daughter never has. Not sure if it&#x27;s luck or the product but we&#x27;re not taking any chances! My 6 yr old loves the rosemary, tea tree, citronella-ish smell too! And it does not leave my daughter&#x27;s hair greasy or stiff like I see other products that other parents use does to their kids!</li>
            <li> Great product.... My daughter loves it!!  Smells great, non offensive, just the right mix. I will recommend to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Unlike others like this, this smells really good and kids don&#x27;t mind wearing this.  Others they&#x27;ve tried have smelled really horrible!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It is the BEST leave in spray I have found for my daughter who has very hard to tame hair. Works great as a detangler and does not dry her hair out like other leave in sprays.  I actually bought the product because the shampoo was recommended by a friend.  She uses it on her daughter to prevent lice exposure at daycare.</li>
            <li> Our family has been using this product for almost a year now and it really works. My oldest son got head lice from school last December and ever since then we have been using it daily. There has been many cases of head lice and so far no one in our home has gotten it again. I tell everyone I know to use it on their children. It smells great too.</li>
            <li> We use it everyday before preschool to comb down his bed head. Works great and more importantly, no lice issues so far!</li>
            <li> After a few infestations, I finally placed an order for this and the Fairy Tales Rosemary Repel Creme Shampoo.  I can&#x27;t believe it, but I haven&#x27;t seen a nit in 2 weeks now.  I wish I would have done it a few months ago!  The fragrance is pleasant, the packaging is charming, and my child doesn&#x27;t feel like she&#x27;s doing a treatment.  I will definitely keep buying this.</li>
            <li> Using daily to help with NOT getting lice. Smells strong at first but smell dissipates rather quickly, hoping that it will still repel without classmates saying &amp;#34;what&#x27;s that smell!&amp;#34;  So far so good!</li>
            <li> Smells nice and makes my daughters hair nice and soft</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and super de-tangler and good preventative!</li>
            <li> This is a must have for anyone with daughters. It truly helps prevent lice.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. My school-age children spray their hair with it each morning before school. It smells great! I even use it on my own hair. Works well as a detangling spray. My kids have never gotten lice when it is going around the school.</li>
            <li> We used this product and my daughter still got lice. It smells nice but not worth the money for prevention.</li>
            <li> We use this as a preventative every day, and so far, so good.  Plus I love the smell!</li>
            <li> My kids never go to school wtih it!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this spray! It has a scent that reminds me of Aveda products. I use it on my twin 3yr old boys and 8 yr old girl. It&#x27;s great to get tangles out and smooth down that crazy wake-up hair. I like the added benefit of preventing lice which is why I switched to this brand of detangler when my daughter started school.</li>
            <li> Perfect for prevention.  I use on my daughter&#x27;s hair roughly once-a-week just in case.  especially during the summer!</li>
            <li> I love this product.. it works very well.</li>
            <li> Works great to detangle.  Nice to have the added repellent bonus.</li>
            <li> While difficult to know if it really is a lice preventative, this works very well as a detangler and smells great. Also love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Terrific spray. Smells great and a great preventative for lice!</li>
            <li> 1) COMB DRY HAIR with nit comb:  eggs HAVE to be removed NO PRODUCT KILLS EGGS! Combing is KEY&lt;br /&gt;She used- Fairytales Terminator comb: available on AMAZON or Ulta beauty supply- for long hair, part into 3 sections, start with bottom, clip sides forward, working thru each section&lt;br /&gt;2) After combing is complete, SPRAY/SATURATE with ACU LIFE LICE CURE (this is the product she used) leave in AT LEAST 20 minutes or overnight before washing out.&lt;br /&gt;3) REAPEAT COMBING AFTER 4 DAYS, no spray unless there are live bugs&lt;br /&gt;4) (Re-comb weekly to ensure nits are gone &amp; for prevention-comb only not spray); spray is for killing live bugs)- I treated my whole family with spray first time even though not all had lice- no need to comb daily&lt;br /&gt;5) For DAILY PREVENTION: Fairy Tales Rosemary leave-in conditioning spray was recommended for daily prevention (spray before school), as well as shampoo Fairy Tales Rosemary repel &amp; conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;She mentioned that shampoos that we all like that smell fruity &amp; sweet, lice like as well.  Use a shampoo with things like mint, rosemary, tea tree, lavender, eucalyptus, not sweet, fruity smelling. Also take 10 minutes each week and comb thru your childâ€™s hair, that way if they are exposed you can catch right at the onset.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!!! Made it though 3 lice cases in my daughters class this year!</li>
            <li> My 4 year old uses this is her hair for protection and thus far, it seems to work.  Makes her hair more manageable, too</li>
            <li> We spray our girls (ages 9 and 7 now) hair with this every morning before going off to school, especially behind the ears and nape areas.  Astonishingly, we have been lice-free for 2 years now!  We use this in conjunction with the Fairy Tales Rosemary Repel Shampoo, which is another amazing product.  Not only are the ingredients excellent, but it does the job and more!</li>
            <li> This spray makes brushing kids hair a breeze, Easy to get through tough nuts.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is good and if you believe in fairy tales... then your kid will be lice free too ;-)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my son&#x27;s fine hair! He is in kindergarten and with his wild hair in the morning, this makes it calm right down. Plus the smell isn&#x27;t too herbal or weird, and I love that it helps repel lice. A win-win!</li>
            <li> Gets tangles out.  Leaves fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this spray a couple years ago when my daughter started Kindergarten to help avoid lice. We have used it religiously everyday and she has not gotten lice when it&#x27;s been going around school. A true testament of this product is that my daughter had a sleepover at a friend&#x27;s house and we found out the next day the friend had lice. They had slept next to each other and she NEVER got lice. I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li> I have no idea whether this stuff actually repels lice or not, except that my girls haven&#x27;t gotten lice since they started using it.  Correlation does not imply causation.  But one thing I can say is that it smells great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo, conditioner and detangling spray on my daughter every day. (Well, we shampoo/condition about twice a week.) I use the shampoo and gel on my son&#x27;s hair in the same way. We have not had issues with lice yet. I would give the products 5 stars, but until they are around children with lice (we fought it for 6 months in the classroom last year!) I don&#x27;t feel comfortable saying it absolutely works. For me, I figure we&#x27;ve got to buy shampoo etc. anyway, might as well use a preventative one. My daughter does tell me she hasn&#x27;t noticed the gnats flying around her face lately. I was a little concerned about all the oil mentioned in the product, but I needn&#x27;t have. My daughter&#x27;s shoulder length hair always looks lovely. So much so I&#x27;ve started using the product myself just so my hair looks better! Can&#x27;t beat a natural, organic product I guess.     As for a previous review, lice eggs can take two weeks to hatch, so it&#x27;s possible they were already in the child&#x27;s hair. Using the preventative products after the fact isn&#x27;t going to help. Also, per their own materials, the products must be layered for full effect. The shampoo alone only has about a 70% rate of working. But, adding the conditioner and then leave-in spray (or gel) brings it to about 100% by (admittedly) their own research.</li>
            <li> Meh its ok love the smell but its certainly not very effective so far</li>
            <li> Must have for all girls!</li>
            <li> Not a trace of lice in our home since the first time my daughter came home from school with it over a year ago.  Great product!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS and it comes Highly recommended by other parents that we know personally!</li>
            <li> SMELLS GREAT LOVE THIS ITEM&lt;br /&gt;NOW I DONT WORRY IF MY KIDS ARE GOING TO BRING LITTLE BUGS HOME!LOL</li>
            <li> We used this religiously for months. My daughter still got lice 3 times. Not worth the hype. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years and we haven&#x27;t had lice since.  There were several notes sent home since that horrible episode about other children having it but mine has been lice free since I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;I will note this:  I only use the conditioning spray.  She sprays it on as a detangler in the morning before school.  I&#x27;ve never felt it necessary to buy the shampoo/conditioner.  Also, I accidentally bought the hair spray once.  It looks similar.  I did NOT like it.  It sprays a lovely stream right at the side of your head so your hair is stiff in one spot.  Not great.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> This seems to do a good job at repelling lice before they become expensive when the kid really uses it.  It has the huge advantage over other products that it does not add sheen for girls with fine hair.  If you like more sheen there are a ton of products, but this is the only thing I could find for kids with lice issues and fine hair.  So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Single dad with daughter and split custody so I am working this as best I can, although for anyone else in this position please reference pink Everlast boxing gloves and hand wraps, HOW COOL IS THAT!</li>
            <li> Excellent! Great smell and perfect lice protection.</li>
            <li> Great product for children in school. Good for curly or wavy hair. Nice smell, easy to use. Kid friendly! Good</li>
            <li> Smells good yet strong to keep the lice monsters AWAY!</li>
            <li> Maybe this spray does repel lice, however it doesn&#x27;t work for anything else.  It does not untangle the hair, if anything the spray makes it worse.  It makes the hair oily and gives the hair an unkept look.  I don&#x27;t like it, I am even debating on whether I want to finish the bottle or not.</li>
            <li> Works really well at detangling hair as long as you use enough of it and comb through when the hair is really wet. We use this everyday in my pre-school daughter&#x27;s hair to avoid getting lice. There have been no breakouts thus far in her class, but just want to be on the safe side for prevention, if there ever is!</li>
            <li> I really like using the Fairy tales Rosemary Repel Spray and Shield as a preventative product.  We haven&#x27;t gotten lice yet, fingers crossed, and the spray seems to work well alone.  It does smell strongly of citronella but fades in a short time.</li>
            <li> Use this on my daughter to prevent lice. So far so good. I love that its a natural product and great for daily use. Easy on the hair too. My daughter enjoys the smell of it and has welcomed it as part of the daily routine for getting ready for school.</li>
            <li> Very good product use it on my daughter hair everyday Before school</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really repels lice or not but the herbal smell is amazing and makes hair super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Use it ever night, smells great and I am happy to know it conditions too</li>
            <li> I like this product, but didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating because it is not completely clear of chemical additives.  On a better note, neither of my children have had any bugs in their hair.  :D</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Kindergarten aged daughter.  We use this every single school day.  There was a lice outbreak in her class. She didn&#x27;t get it, but not sure if I can attribute that to the spray or to she just had very little contact with the child who had it.  Love the spray. Light and smells good. It&#x27;s like spraying leave in conditioner in her hair. Will definitely keep on using just for some peace of mind. Feel like I&#x27;m doing something to repel lice.</li>
            <li> We started using this on recommendation from another mom at my daughters preschool after a lice outbreak. We have been using it for two years now and whether or not it definitely keeps the lice away ( we have had none despite outbreaks at the school) it does work nicely as a detangler as well.</li>
            <li> Great Smelling Spray that is suppose to help repel lice.  Lice do not like certain smells, tea tree oil, lavender, rosemary to name a few.  This product will not treat lice if someone has it already but it will help repel lice if someone comes in contact with lice.  I use this on both my children(girl and boy) and myself.  It smells great reminds me of an expensive shampoo scent (Av*d*).  I have never had lice nor have either of my children.  I think this product can help prevent lice but it is not guaranteed.  You still have to make sure your children are not sharing, hats, brushed, and bumping heads with others that could have lice. Overall it is a nice conditioning spray that smells great and if it helps a little bit it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product when four kids in my son&#x27;s kindergarten class had lice. I spray it on his hair before he goes to school (when I remember) and he had any bugs in his hair yet! It&#x27;s been three months since the breakout. I haven&#x27;t been as diligent recently but I think it helped us avoid an infestation!</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me at all, and the scent is very strong. I felt like it actually had the opposite effect on my hair. I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.....don&#x27;t LOVE the smell, but if it helps prevent lice, I can get past that very easily! :)</li>
            <li> Not sure about deterring lice, we haven&#x27;t been around any yet that I know of but this stuff smells nice and leaves my son&#x27;s hair soft and makes his curls look really great. Helps keep his bangs out of his eyes. So we don&#x27;t mind using it to try and ward of buggies!</li>
            <li> Use it daily in my daughters hair and she has never caught lice from kids at her school.</li>
            <li> Best product to repel head lice. Two things I love about this product. One it really, really works to repel head lice. Secondly, my granddaughter has really long hair, so I spray this in it and around any snarls and it does work as a conditioner. Not as many tears in the am before we head out the door to school. I think that it is important to also follow the instructions and do a spray behind each ear and on their shoulders. I end up just doing one long spray from one ear to the other. Love it. I actually bought an extra for a friend to use on her daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome preventative !</li>
            <li> I have used this product for two months in my child hair and no lice. Last year at this time she had lice. This product is working!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice conditioning spray to get rid of bed head and (hopefully!) ward off any potential nasty bugs. I use this on both younger sons (7 and 10 years old)</li>
            <li> I feel so good after spraying this - knowing my daughter&#x27;s hair/head is protected when she goes to school.  Love it.</li>
            <li> After switching to Fairy Tales Shampoo and Conditioner in a last ditch effort to get rid of school born lice, we liked both so much that we switched the entire family to using it all the time.  We use the Leave In Conditioning Spray in conjunction with the Shampoo and Conditioner as triple protection in lice prevention.  Seems to work so far.  Love that it all smells fine and doesn&#x27;t have all those nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li> we love the conditioning spray!!  The smell isn&#x27;t bad and dries quickly in the hair</li>
            <li> Everyday use of this leave in conditioner prevents lice.  We&#x27;ve used this for 4 years without lice coming home despite annual school lice infestations.  The conditioner is a great detangler, and leaves the hair soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I got this to help repel lice, not sure if it really works or not but she hasn&#x27;t gotten lice at all.  I would rather spend the money on this product than take the chance of getting lice.  It also helps with static &amp; frizzes so that is nice too.  It smells awesome!!  no strong citronella smell like some of the similar products.</li>
            <li> Lice was going around my kids school and I bought this for the peace of mind.  I think any leave-in conditioner/detangler helps though, and this (to me) does NOT smell good so I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it daily.  But just like any other bug spray, I like having it for when I feel we need it--playdates/sleeppovers/parties/kids activities.  I gave it 4 stars because I do think it helps and I feel safe using it on my kids.  Can&#x27;t give it 5 because of the smell and price.</li>
            <li> My daughter has had the worst luck with lice this school year and I was willling to try anything to help prevent her from getting them again. So I bought this along with the shampoo and conditioner. IT DID NOT WORK!!!! She has them again and I used it faithfully!! It hasnt even been a month and she has them again!  I know the school has alot to do with it because she is the only one in our family getting them. I just dont understand how some parents let their kids go without being treated and think that it&#x27;s ok!</li>
            <li> great product!!! fast shipping- great price - thank you!</li>
            <li> Smells good and we haven&#x27;t had any issues with lice so it seems to be working!</li>
            <li> Great product so far and smooth transaction with the seller!</li>
            <li> I do a lot of outdoor activities, and find that mosquitos and other flying pests are attracted by the perfumes in most hair products.  I used Rosemary Repel on a river raft camping trip, and found that the bugs didn&#x27;t swarm around my head anymore.  It also seems to be a bit more environmentally friendly than my usual hair care products, which is great when you&#x27;re visiting in sensitive areas.  Plus, I love the smell of rosemary in general, so there you go...</li>
            <li> Would not go a school year without it! From elementary to college student, our girls have had positive experience. If you use the shampoo and conditioner, this item is a must as the other products will produce drying effects after a month or so.</li>
            <li> Works great as a preventive spray.  Use daily</li>
            <li> Since the 3rd grade, lice has been a constant issue at my daughter&#x27;s school.  Last school year (4th grade), it took me months to get rid of her lice, she kept getting re-infested and it took a real heart-to-heart with a couple moms to stop the madness.  The lice went away in January and everyone has been clear since.  UNTIL this past week...one of my daughter&#x27;s friends slept overnight Friday, they went to a birthday party Saturday and on Saturday night we received the dreaded &amp;#34;I have lice&amp;#34; message.  I was horrified!  As of today...my daughter is still lice free!  She was like a lice magnet in prior incidents and I thank Fairy Tales for this miracle!  I&#x27;m ecstatic and do not know why anyone wouldn&#x27;t use this product as their regular shampoo and conditioner for ever!</li>
            <li> This works well as a conditioner and makes brushing my toddler&#x27;s curly hair possible.  I can&#x27;t comment if it really does repel anything or not.  Hopefully, we wont need to put it to the test.</li>
            <li> I love the spray, but this time it took quite a bit of time to get to me:( so alittle bummed but I got it now so, it&#x27;s all good!</li>
            <li> Smels great and we&#x27;ve had no issues with lice!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with the fairy tales shampoo when a child in my son&#x27;s class had head lice and we&#x27;re still using both products everyday nearly two years later. Smells great and helps to keep my kids hair in place, and added bonus.</li>
            <li> A bonus to the shampoo, removes tangles and smells good! Does not condition as well as I would like it to!</li>
            <li> I bought this and the rosemary conditioner when there was lice going around my daughter&#x27;s school.  So far, she has not had lice so hopefully it is doing its job!  I do not like the strong smell, and I was hoping this would be a detangling conditioner for my daughter&#x27;s long hair.  It is not.  So it is not a pleasant experience to attempt to comb through afterwards.</li>
            <li> This concoction is kinda awesome.  It has stood up to the terrors of public school, and it smells awesome.  What more could you want?</li>
            <li> Appears to work - keep in mind this is a repellent not an eliminator.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s school had a small outbreak of lice so I immediately combed the internet for a healthy alternative to any chemical lice sprays. This spray seemed to have done the job of repelling any critters.  She liked that it has a castle on it and calls it her princess spray.  It&#x27;s a good detangler however due to the natural essences sometimes she comes out smelling like a citronella candle if she puts too much.  Eventually you get used to the sweet smells.  Great product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made our morning so much more enjoyable! No more tears and silky smooth hair!</li>
            <li> The product smells great.  It&#x27;s not at all greasy, so I don&#x27;t mind using it on their hair everyday.  It&#x27;s a nice refresher for those days we don&#x27;t wash hair.  Just hoping it does the trick &amp; keeps the yucky bugs away.</li>
            <li> It works great as a detangler, also.  I like the herbal smell of it.  We will definitely get more when this bottle is gone!</li>
            <li> I am wondering where people live (states)...getting lice in school?  I have never had to deal with this but now my kiddos are school age.</li>
            <li> This is my go to product for the school year. I give my kids a bath in the evening and during the school year, I always use this in the morning to get rid of bedhead. I&#x27;m not sure if it &#x27;truly&#x27; works on the lice front but after numerous outbreaks through the years at their school, my kids have never had lice.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is quite pleasing... I actually love the smell for nostalgic reasons. Every fall when I break this out again, a wave of familiarity washes over me. It just reminds me of that time of year.</li>
            <li> I think it seems to be working. My sister in law uses this line of products for her granddaughter and even though she&#x27;s been exposed to them she hasn&#x27;t gotten them while using these hair care products.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works really well. I am not sure how effective it is at preventing lice but we will still buy it!</li>
            <li> Work at a school and we love this stuff.  Smells a little strong but way better than risking getting lice :-)</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Works great with the repel shampoo.  Makes hair manageable and easy to brush thru.  Also, gives an extra protection against lice.</li>
            <li> Love it. Seems to help. Just have to remember to put on kids daily.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a post-cautionary application since the first two attempts using a more widely known product were fails.  After using the FT removal kit, I wanted to help the third go-around be a success.  Since this uses essentials oils, it has a scent that one may not expect or be used to.  It may remind you of the essential oils aisle at a natural food grocery store.  The child I used it on like that it &amp;#34;styled&amp;#34; his hair and then other children asked to have the &amp;#34;styling spray&amp;#34; put in their hair which made a nice additional precaution.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t prevent getting lice, but might make it less common, from my experience.  Doesn&#x27;t smell too bad.  That is all I can say.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t like the smell.  We stopped using it and the scent is lingering.  I think we&#x27;ll have to wash the car seats.</li>
            <li> This product is not on the inexpensive side,  I agree, but when battling the little creatures that breed at our children&#x27;s schools this product is worth every penny!  Induldge and buy the 32 oz sized,  not only does is smell yummy, but it does ward off the little things</li>
            <li> I got this when my daughter got lice so we wouldn&#x27;t get it. It not only worked but it also makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick, straight hair. We use the Fairy Tales shampoo and Conditioner as well. This spray conditioner is ok. It&#x27;s nice that the fragrance is the same as the shampoo and conditioner. Smells like Rosemary with hint of mint. Kind of smells like the Aveda products. It just works ok. Doesn&#x27;t really detangle her hair, but then again it doesn&#x27;t advertise this option. Wish it had a detangler added.</li>
            <li> My kids have never had lice using this. Even when class had lice scare. They did not have it.</li>
            <li> This smells pleasant and seems to work great!</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t let my daughter go to school without putting this in her hair. It has a nice scent and knowing it keeps the little critters away is a bonus.</li>
            <li> I am a kindergarten teacher. Head lice have  been going around my room. Using this, I feel protected. I spray some on every morning.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It smells great and I love that it is natural!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it! I am a preschool teacher and one of the reason that I love my job are all the endless hugs that I get: In the morning, through out the day...and when they are going home, they are still giving me hugs. But that means that if one of my keikis have head lice, I&#x27;m screwed. Even if I do discover that they have it, and we are just waiting for their parents to pick them up, I&#x27;m screwed because of course the lil&#x27; one is sad that they have to go home and so they want &amp;#34;cuddles&amp;#34;  with their teacher for comfort. I can&#x27;t say no to that. So in comes this amazing product. I have never had head lice and I never want to have head lice and trust me or not but I have been in many opportunities where I could have caught it. I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now and I can&#x27;t really say if it&#x27;s working...since we have not had a lice scare in my school for a long time now. But what I do now is that it makes my hair smell good (well, after you get used to the scent that is)...and even though I have naturally straight, black, silky hair...I feel as if this makes my hair even more silky and healthier. Yes, I would recommend this...can&#x27;t hurt to have a preventative when it comes to head lice. :)</li>
            <li> Detangles fairly well but the smell is so strong and lingers, so unless you want your kids smelling like bug spray you might want to go another way... haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to see if it fights lice or not.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell too great but better than the lice guard (that stuff stinks!!)</li>
            <li> Whew,  thank goodness for this stuff. Kids in her class got lice last year, we use this daily and never had a problem.  Smells nice, leaves hair soft.  I recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the world&#x27;s best detangler, but it works ok for my toddler. And it smells good. I&#x27;ll probably buy more when we run out.</li>
            <li> a big group of kids in the 1st grade got lice. I freaked out and bought this along with the shampoo. My kids wash their hair every other day and this is what we use after. I wouldn&#x27;t say it conditions as in a Tangle spray though. I think it works for adding extra protection and maybe we should use this in-between shampooing and right before school. I actually have no idea if it works other than to say we haven&#x27;t had lice! I told a bunch of other moms at school about this when I got mine. They are been using it as well and no lice.</li>
            <li> We have been using Fairy Tales for 2 years at our house, and so far so good. Can I say with complete assurance that the spray repels little creepy crawlies, no I can&#x27;t, but so far we have not had to deal with them and we have been exposed. It leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair feeling super soft. I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> You can make something pretty darn similar with essential oils for a lot less.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the smell, kind of reminds me of a spray for dogs. But it works!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the smell. She has extremely long hair and this helps detangle it quickly. I&#x27;m terrified she&#x27;ll get lice so we are using this product which was recommended by a friend.</li>
            <li> Recieved extremely fast and exactly as expected</li>
            <li> Love the smell...we&#x27;ve had cases of lice at our daughters preschool. She has yet to get a case...use with shampoo and conditioner...spray hair, neck, shoulders. Lice crawl....they do not jump....so trying stop them means no sharing and head touching.  The most effective way to stop or prevent is to buy the comb from fairy tales and do a 1 or 2 combing every week....pesticide free in all cases. Prevention and proactive practice is best...there is no magic bullet.</li>
            <li> Nothing can repel lice ask any lice specialist. They want to suck blood u think some peppermint or tea tree oil will keep lice away. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if it works to repel lice because I could not handle the smell. Reviews said it&#x27;s nice but I found it very medicated and offputting and every time I sprayed my kids hair with it I could taste it for hours. I had to return it. You must love the smell of Rosemary to consider this product. I purchased the ROMbi comb  instead and I use it once a week in my girls hair as preventative for lice and nits. . If any are detected it electrocutes them on contact. It&#x27;s the only real preventative measure I have found that actually prevents and kills and treats on contact additionally it removes eggs as well if your kid by chance has one. It create static in the hair so I comb  each section once a week and then wash and condition.</li>
            <li> We just spray on granddaughter&#x27;s hair (age 5) daily before she goes to school to prevent re-infestation, she loves the smell.  No more lice...</li>
            <li> We (family of 5) have been using this successfully for 5 years now.  The prece is worth the piece of mind!  Plus, I use it on my grown-up hair too!  It&#x27;s color safe and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Tends to make my girl&#x27;s hair a little sticky/oily. Still use it with an up-do and when worried about lice, but not our go-to conditioning spray/detangler. She has fine, thick blonde hair with some loose curl.</li>
            <li> I have used this spray on my son for months now. There&#x27;s been lice in the class a few times (or continuously and they just periodically send home notes about it!) and my son has never gotten them! Him having short hair does make things simpler, but still, no lice here!!</li>
            <li> Smell isnt too bad. I have used this for my daughter&#x27;s hair a few times.</li>
            <li> This works great. My granddaughter had a friend over and after sending her home because of bugs I bought this. She has never had bugs and I believe this could be part of the reason.</li>
            <li> After I combed out the lice and eggs, I began using this product. Well, my daughter has lice again. She rather get combed weekly than to use the spray. She hates the smell.</li>
            <li> it works very Good as a detangler. My girls swear by it. YOu need to order it with something else.</li>
            <li> We use this almost everyday to keep those pesky little critters away.</li>
            <li> A must for kids in elementary school.  Good product, smells good.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and is a good light leave in. I don&#x27;t know for sure if it really repels lice, but we&#x27;ve had multiple cases at our school over the years and my children have never gotten them. It could be luck or it could be that we wash with Fairy Tales and use this spray. I feel better thinking I&#x27;m doing something proactive to avoid those nasty little critters.</li>
            <li> We use two to four spritzes on my daughters hair for the lovely smell this has. Very strong fragrance and pleasant too. We use the store bought cheep stuff for styling and this for the smell and lice protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughters school has lice outbreaks two to three times a year. We started using this product this year hoping that it will help. I do not know if it is working, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure if this works or not, but my son does not like the smell.  I don&#x27;t really like the smell either.</li>
            <li> Daily spray to use to help repel lice - they hate the smell of rosemary!</li>
            <li> Lice in your child&#x27;s hair is a nightmare not a fairy tale.  I am not saying that this stuff is awesome, but my child has not had any signs of head lice and many of her classmates have.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful, but I don not like that it leaves even the cleanest, most freshly washed hair, looking oily if applied liberally.</li>
            <li> 1st off this stuff works no jokes no lies. My daughterâ€™s kindergarten class had head lice around 4 times this school year and she never had one bug! Out of 30 students in one classroom she and 2 others never got a bug one! We have been using this product for a year now along with the shampoo and itâ€™s wonderful. It really has been a life and stress saver for this house hold because we hate bugs of all kinds and head lice is at the top of the list right next to bedbugs. If you like the smell of rosemary then youâ€™re going to love it. The rosemary is not over powering as far as the smell goes. It also helps with tangled hair. This product last a long time, and a little really will go a long way. I recommend this product along with the shampoo, and when I get low on the product I will keep ordering this!</li>
