            <li>Great straightener.</li>
            <li>Great item, my hairstylist recommended it.</li>
            <li>, it catches on the hair, and the plates do not touch without great effort.  </li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>THIS DIVA IS A HAPPY CAMPER.  </li>

            <li>(although I won&#x27;t have to because it has a 4 year warranty - now thats a great product) because it does THAT amazing of a job on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Price was good.</li>
            <li>Loved everything about it but</li>
            <li>Even the thickest hair shouldn&#x27;t require the highest setting so a good heat protectant is a must.  </li>
            <li>IT DID DARN GOOD JOB.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased.  </li>

            <li>It leaves hair so nice and doesn&#x27;t split the ends or burn the hair.  </li>

            <li>Love this better than my Chi that I use to use!</li>
            <li>Love this better than my Chi Turbo I had!</li>
            <li>So far is the best iron I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>I have always used Chi, but this straightener has been by far the best I have ever used!  </li>

            <li>I LOVE this straightener it is AMAZING.</li>

            <li>This is an awesome tool that will make your hair feel magically clean, straight and silky.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I would be super impressed but not so much.</li>
            <li>Straightens beautifully and makes my hair silkier; highly recommend</li>
            <li>I bought an FHI and that works even better than the GHD</li>
            <li>(these are all over $100 though I paid a bit  more for the GHD and FHI )</li>
            <li>I had never purchased or used a Babyliss iron before but knew many hairdressers who used them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many hair straighteners.  </li>
            <li>So glad I took a chance and bought this iron.</li>
            <li>Better than the chi iron</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Works great on my thich very curly hair.</li>
            <li>sure you use a heat protectant to help prevent breakage and damage.</li>
            <li>A must have...saves time and your hair :-)</li>
            <li>This is my favorite straightener.</li>

            <li>You could not hold it,then the finish started coming off the edges and the top face of the iron.</li>
            <li>I thought I was safe ordering thru Amazon, thought they made sure their products were legit.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t they check to make sure they are selling Their customers authentic products?</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted :)</li>
            <li>OOH WE WAS SUPER EXCITED BECAUSE IT LOOKED FABULOUS,</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this flat iron!</li>
            <li>This iron is GREAT for natural sisters looking to create that straight (relaxed) look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light, comfortable to hold, and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle, heats up right away.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and in the original box.</li>
            <li>I really thought it was going to be much better...</li>
            <li>I WAS ABLE TO PICK UP ALL OF MY HAIR IN EACH SECTION AND MAKE SUPER STRAIGHT</li>
            <li>Other than that great product</li>
            <li>I put it on med/high and it straightened my hair quickly but after a couple weeks, my ends we&#x27;re brittle and split.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light weight and heats up very fast.</li>
            <li>The plates heat up quickly and it gets very, very hot.  </li>
            <li>Plates get very hot so must use with care.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot but doesn&#x27;t appear to damage my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several generic, cheap flat irons; it was wonderful to finally find one that does an incredible job.</li>
            <li>It gets super hot!</li>
            <li>A sturdy, awesome straightener that will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen my hair this straight!!</li>
            <li>I am VERY pleased with how well this flat iron works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen my hair so straight!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use it for the first time.</li>
            <li>I had a chi before and this product is definitely better by far!</li>
            <li>Gets hot almost immediately!</li>
            <li>I am very glad I decided on this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have very thick wavy hair and this straightener is awesome.</li>
            <li>It Iron Straight Spray and finish off the look with Tresemme Keratin Smooth Shine Serum.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t blink, or light up specifically when it&#x27;s ready -</li>
            <li>It is not rounded enough on the edges to flip ends of hair nicely.</li>
            <li>this Iron is definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love it and so does my 12 year old daughter.....</li>
            <li>This product is worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Iron gets super hot.</li>
            <li>At first things were fine, heats fast, straighten well.</li>
            <li>Is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve used is very lightweight and heats very quickly, It takes half the time doing my hair.</li>
            <li>DOING THE CABBAGE PATCH RIGHT</li>
            <li>The hair just fell right through it.</li>
            <li>Works great on my kinky African American hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is super straight.</li>
            <li>Professional quality, easy to use.</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast.</li>
            <li>why pay for this Babyliss at $129  when it does not work AND higher chance to burn your hand.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very curly and this works amazing with getting it straight and allowing it to last.  </li>
            <li>When I straighten my hair, it&#x27;s too straight!</li>
            <li>Not this one-my hair is straight, not fuzzy and in record time!  </li>
            <li>Im very upset!</li>
            <li>My old cheap Revlon hair straightener is a toy compared to this.</li>
            <li>I got my first one 8 years ago</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First of all, I never write reviews</li>
            <li>PLUS - it STAYS straight - for DAYS!  </li>
            <li>I hope this iron will last more then a couple of year?</li>
            <li>Got extremely hot.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned this thing gets EXTREMELY hot</li>
            <li>ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO HAVE A BETTER PRICE.  </li>
            <li>NO CURVE WAS TESTED FIRST.  </li>
            <li>Doesnt get hot or stay hot.</li>
            <li>But then the iron would get too hot to touch on the 30 heat setting.  </li>
            <li>and  get so hot</li>
            <li>Love this iron and it&#x27;s multiple settings.</li>
            <li>The first stopped heating after a couple uses.</li>
            <li>Would totally recommend it :)</li>
            <li>however I do not think this one gets as hot as my first one.</li>
            <li>Great for thick hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plates do not close all the way, they only touch completely at the very top.</li>
            <li>I love this flat Iron.</li>
            <li>I love this flat.....</li>
            <li>I LOVE this flat iron!</li>
            <li>now I can get the same flowy, shiny professional look in the privacy of my own home.</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron!!!</li>
            <li>This flat iron I use it in a not so hot temperature (35) and was very smooth and soft for days!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this product on Amazon pretty much because of all these reviews.</li>
            <li>With this iron, I only had to go over each section once, maybe twice, and my hair is perfectly smooth, shiny, and feels like pure silk!</li>
            <li>the blue covering is so cheap that it gets just as hot as the plates.  </li>
            <li>Definitely easy on the arms and shoulders when straightening an entire head of hair.</li>
            <li>Love the bigger plates and the grip is better than my old FHI flat iron.</li>
            <li>My hair is some of the most coarse, frizzy, curly hair you&#x27;ve ever seen &amp; this flat iron gets my hair from blow dryed &amp; poofy to smooth, straight &amp; silky.</li>
            <li>the&lt;br /&gt;separation between the blades is too large.  </li>
            <li>I certainly recommend this iron for real curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;Leave</li>
            <li>Flat iron should straighten hair fairly easily, but this one just leaves it frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have very thick corse Italian hair and was recommended to try this out and am very happy.</li>
            <li>The second time you use, the lower the temperature to 25 and my hair was soo smooth and soft and fast!!</li>
            <li>I also do my BFF&#x27;s hair, whose hair is very course, and it add so much shine and gets it so silky.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, was a bit worried that I might have been sent a mock up since I reside in a U.S. Territory.</li>
            <li>I used to use a CHI, and had to go over each section several times and it still wasn&#x27;t as smooth as I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this iron!</li>
            <li>This straightener is a miracle worker that leaves my hair stick straight...</li>
            <li>and it stays straight in humidity.</li>
            <li>But for now, I know why straight haired girls want curly hair.</li>
            <li>(As a curly haired girl, I&#x27;d still rather have straight hair, though, it&#x27;s so much easier.)</li>
            <li>This product is the REAL thing.</li>
            <li>This iron heats up fast but it really burns your hair.</li>
            <li>Gets it straight but no straighter than a Chi.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really irritated.</li>
            <li>It heats fast and it gives my hair that straight shiny look.</li>
            <li>and it works really, really FAST.</li>
            <li>Also, the outer material is very flimsy for the cost of the iron.</li>
            <li>This iron is working very well.</li>
            <li>your hair looking shiny and straight.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This thing heats up fast, and when I say &#x27;heats up&#x27;</li>
            <li>it gets really straight</li>
            <li>TO GET MY HAIR STRAIGHT.  </li>
            <li>REALLY GET MY HAIR STRAIGHT LIKE THE HAIR SALON</li>
            <li>THAT I AM GETTING READY TO DO FOR IT.  </li>
            <li>TO SEE IF MINES WERE REAL.  </li>
            <li>Once swipe is usually enough to make my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>She loves it so much and says it gives her &amp;#34;Celebrity hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It does get super hot though and you will definitely need to use a hair serum to protect your hair from burning and breaking.</li>
            <li>It works much quicker than cheap flat irons.</li>
            <li>YEAH FORGOT TO SAY THAT I LOVE THAT THIS ONE WAS NOT HEAVY BUT WORKED JUST LIKE THE HEAVIER FLAT IRONS</li>
            <li>My 5 year old flat iron works better than this.</li>
            <li>Amazon and Amazon was the best, my hair is long and thin in parts</li>
            <li>The price is good and my experience has been, when it breaks down send it back to the company.  </li>
            <li>Not only I finish in half or less the time,but the result is simply amazing!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it several times and it&#x27;s not a fake and is exactly like the one my stylist uses.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and the settings go over 400 degrees which is sometimes necessary depending on the humidity.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my niece who is classic when it comes to breaking straightening irons.</li>
            <li>Like the other users stated below, it heats up super fast and gets really hot.</li>
            <li>You expect a cheap straightening iron to stop working in less than a year, but not with higher end product.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>But I guess at a high heat one can expect in time for the paint closest to the heating plates to wear.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far better than  cheaper straightening flat irons and the hair remained straight  till the next wash...</li>
            <li>One swipe and my naturally wavy hair is straight.  </li>
            <li>After going on Babyliss&#x27;s site and reading about all their irons, I decided on this iron because it has longer plates and wider plates than the normal irons</li>
            <li>I would suggest to only use this iron on freshly washed hair.  </li>
            <li>It really is worth the extra money...</li>
            <li>Thin and smooth, easy to work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sad that even though it&#x27;s new and works great it looks old and worn.  </li>
            <li>So far it leaves my hair more pin straight than any other flat iron.</li>
            <li>Pleased with the results that the straightening iron gave, not pleased with the life of the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the warranty is void through amazon or not, but make sure you look into that</li>
            <li>I have very coarse thick curly hair, and I only have to pass through my hair once, and it works great.</li>
            <li>WELL, MY CURRENT FLAT IRON WAS TEN TIMES BETTER THAN BOTH.  </li>
            <li>I have super coarse, thick hair (I can easily look like Gilda Radner on a humid day...)</li>
            <li>and this is the first flat iron that I can use below the highest setting</li>
            <li>Wow, wow, wow.</li>
            <li>My old iron, which was made by HairArt was much sturdier, around the same price, and lasted for six years.</li>
            <li>and it straightens it pin straight with minimal effort and stays straight through humidity.</li>
            <li>and she has long, straight, shinny, non-frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>My hairs naturally curly</li>
            <li>I just wish it had a electronic screen showing you when it&#x27;s ready &amp; the current temperature...</li>
            <li>I tell everyone I know that wants a straightening iron that Babyliss is the only way to go!</li>
            <li>THE REGULAR STRAIGHT ONE AND THE C MODEL</li>
            <li>Still keeping my old flat iron though because I don&#x27;t always want my hair that pin straight bc</li>
            <li>After going through SO MANY other flat irons, I&#x27;ve finally found one that&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li>it gets really hot on the outside blue part  </li>
            <li>I have used Chi, GHD and quite a few other brands, but this flat iron blows them away (and yes the others were purchased from a reputable beauty salon-no &amp;#34;knock-offs&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>I have Asian hair that is naturally wavy/frizzy and very sensitive to humidity.</li>
            <li>Not only in the way this worked on my hair, (which due to medical reason has gotten so fine)</li>
            <li>ANY OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS SAY I TOOK THE CHANCE OF TRYING THEM READY AND WILLING TO SEND THEM BOTH BACK AND CONTINUING MY QUEST TO GET THE RIGHT FLAT IRON ME..  </li>
            <li>and they sent back a new one.  </li>
            <li>Currently looking for a new straightener for them.</li>
            <li>The blue finish is the only real reason I didn&#x27;t give this product a 5th star.</li>
            <li>Straight as an arrow with the first past through.</li>
            <li>so a normal flat iron  would damage my hair.</li>
            <li>It grips my hair like no other straightening iron has.</li>
            <li>Flattens hair like no other iron does.</li>
            <li>This flat iron gets my hair STICK STRAIGHT and stays that way, even the next day.</li>
            <li>A NEW FLAT IRON</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend for those wanting a professional type iron with out two hundred dollar price tag.</li>
            <li>I though for sure this was false information.</li>
            <li>The ONLY complaint I have is that the outside of the heating plates gets pretty darn hot.  </li>
            <li>My old flat iron broke after six years of use.</li>
            <li>Now, I have only had it for two weeks, but i&#x27;ve already claimed that if it were to break in the near future, I would re-buy it</li>
            <li>All the other flat irons I used I would put it on it&#x27;s highest setting and they still weren&#x27;t hot enough....</li>
            <li>After many uses at high heat the paint will start to fade which is disappointing for the price.  </li>
            <li>Love the straightener, cut down from an hour to 15 mins for my long(around mid-thigh) thick hair.</li>
            <li>THERE IS NO FLAT IRON OUT THERE</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy and thick and any sign of humidity usually makes it grow outward :)</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure about how long the effectiveness lasts, but on the highest temperature setting it takes me just one really quick stroke for each section of hair.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I highly suggest this flat iron over all others.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This has been the best decision I have made!  </li>

            <li> Great straightener.</li>
            <li> Great item, my hairstylist recommended it.</li>
            <li> , it catches on the hair, and the plates do not touch without great effort.  </li>
            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> THIS DIVA IS A HAPPY CAMPER.  </li>

            <li> Great product..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok but not the best</li>
            <li> (although I won&#x27;t have to because it has a 4 year warranty - now thats a great product) because it does THAT amazing of a job on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Price was good.</li>
            <li> Loved everything about it but</li>
            <li> Even the thickest hair shouldn&#x27;t require the highest setting so a good heat protectant is a must.  </li>
            <li> IT DID DARN GOOD JOB.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased.  </li>

            <li> Straightens beautifully and makes my hair silkier; highly recommend</li>
            <li> I bought an FHI and that works even better than the GHD</li>

            <li> The hair just fell right through it.</li>
            <li> Works great on my kinky African American hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is super straight.</li>
            <li> Professional quality, easy to use.</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast.</li>
            <li> why pay for this Babyliss at $129  when it does not work AND higher chance to burn your hand.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and this works amazing with getting it straight and allowing it to last.  </li>
            <li> When I straighten my hair, it&#x27;s too straight!</li>
            <li> Not this one-my hair is straight, not fuzzy and in record time!  </li>
            <li> Im very upset!</li>
            <li> My old cheap Revlon hair straightener is a toy compared to this.</li>
            <li> I got my first one 8 years ago</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First of all, I never write reviews</li>
            <li> PLUS - it STAYS straight - for DAYS!  </li>
            <li> I hope this iron will last more then a couple of year?</li>
            <li> Got extremely hot.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned this thing gets EXTREMELY hot</li>
            <li> ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO HAVE A BETTER PRICE.  </li>
            <li> NO CURVE WAS TESTED FIRST.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt get hot or stay hot.</li>
            <li> But then the iron would get too hot to touch on the 30 heat setting.  </li>
            <li> and  get so hot</li>
            <li> Love this iron and it&#x27;s multiple settings.</li>
            <li> The first stopped heating after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> Would totally recommend it :)</li>
            <li> however I do not think this one gets as hot as my first one.</li>
            <li> Great for thick hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plates do not close all the way, they only touch completely at the very top.</li>
            <li> I love this flat Iron.</li>
            <li> I love this flat.....</li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat iron!</li>
            <li> now I can get the same flowy, shiny professional look in the privacy of my own home.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron!!!</li>
            <li> This flat iron I use it in a not so hot temperature (35) and was very smooth and soft for days!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product on Amazon pretty much because of all these reviews.</li>
            <li> With this iron, I only had to go over each section once, maybe twice, and my hair is perfectly smooth, shiny, and feels like pure silk!</li>
            <li> the blue covering is so cheap that it gets just as hot as the plates.  </li>
            <li> Definitely easy on the arms and shoulders when straightening an entire head of hair.</li>
            <li> Love the bigger plates and the grip is better than my old FHI flat iron.</li>
            <li> My hair is some of the most coarse, frizzy, curly hair you&#x27;ve ever seen &amp; this flat iron gets my hair from blow dryed &amp; poofy to smooth, straight &amp; silky.</li>
            <li> the&lt;br /&gt;separation between the blades is too large.  </li>
            <li> I certainly recommend this iron for real curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;Leave</li>
            <li> Flat iron should straighten hair fairly easily, but this one just leaves it frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have very thick corse Italian hair and was recommended to try this out and am very happy.</li>
            <li> The second time you use, the lower the temperature to 25 and my hair was soo smooth and soft and fast!!</li>
            <li> I also do my BFF&#x27;s hair, whose hair is very course, and it add so much shine and gets it so silky.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, was a bit worried that I might have been sent a mock up since I reside in a U.S. Territory.</li>
            <li> I used to use a CHI, and had to go over each section several times and it still wasn&#x27;t as smooth as I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this iron!</li>
            <li> This straightener is a miracle worker that leaves my hair stick straight...</li>
            <li> and it stays straight in humidity.</li>
            <li> But for now, I know why straight haired girls want curly hair.</li>
            <li> (As a curly haired girl, I&#x27;d still rather have straight hair, though, it&#x27;s so much easier.)</li>
            <li> This product is the REAL thing.</li>
            <li> This iron heats up fast but it really burns your hair.</li>
            <li> Gets it straight but no straighter than a Chi.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really irritated.</li>
            <li> It heats fast and it gives my hair that straight shiny look.</li>
            <li> and it works really, really FAST.</li>
            <li> Also, the outer material is very flimsy for the cost of the iron.</li>
            <li> This iron is working very well.</li>
            <li> your hair looking shiny and straight.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This thing heats up fast, and when I say &#x27;heats up&#x27;</li>
            <li> it gets really straight</li>
            <li> TO GET MY HAIR STRAIGHT.  </li>
            <li> REALLY GET MY HAIR STRAIGHT LIKE THE HAIR SALON</li>
            <li> THAT I AM GETTING READY TO DO FOR IT.  </li>
            <li> TO SEE IF MINES WERE REAL.  </li>
            <li> Once swipe is usually enough to make my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.  </li>
            <li> She loves it so much and says it gives her &amp;#34;Celebrity hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It does get super hot though and you will definitely need to use a hair serum to protect your hair from burning and breaking.</li>
            <li> It works much quicker than cheap flat irons.</li>
            <li> YEAH FORGOT TO SAY THAT I LOVE THAT THIS ONE WAS NOT HEAVY BUT WORKED JUST LIKE THE HEAVIER FLAT IRONS</li>
            <li> My 5 year old flat iron works better than this.</li>
            <li> Amazon and Amazon was the best, my hair is long and thin in parts</li>
            <li> The price is good and my experience has been, when it breaks down send it back to the company.  </li>
            <li> Not only I finish in half or less the time,but the result is simply amazing!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it several times and it&#x27;s not a fake and is exactly like the one my stylist uses.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and the settings go over 400 degrees which is sometimes necessary depending on the humidity.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece who is classic when it comes to breaking straightening irons.</li>
            <li> Like the other users stated below, it heats up super fast and gets really hot.</li>
            <li> You expect a cheap straightening iron to stop working in less than a year, but not with higher end product.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> But I guess at a high heat one can expect in time for the paint closest to the heating plates to wear.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far better than  cheaper straightening flat irons and the hair remained straight  till the next wash...</li>
            <li> One swipe and my naturally wavy hair is straight.  </li>
            <li> After going on Babyliss&#x27;s site and reading about all their irons, I decided on this iron because it has longer plates and wider plates than the normal irons</li>
            <li> I would suggest to only use this iron on freshly washed hair.  </li>
            <li> It really is worth the extra money...</li>
            <li> Thin and smooth, easy to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad that even though it&#x27;s new and works great it looks old and worn.  </li>
            <li> So far it leaves my hair more pin straight than any other flat iron.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the results that the straightening iron gave, not pleased with the life of the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the warranty is void through amazon or not, but make sure you look into that</li>
            <li> I have very coarse thick curly hair, and I only have to pass through my hair once, and it works great.</li>
            <li> WELL, MY CURRENT FLAT IRON WAS TEN TIMES BETTER THAN BOTH.  </li>
            <li> I have super coarse, thick hair (I can easily look like Gilda Radner on a humid day...)</li>
            <li> and this is the first flat iron that I can use below the highest setting</li>
            <li> Wow, wow, wow.</li>
            <li> My old iron, which was made by HairArt was much sturdier, around the same price, and lasted for six years.</li>
            <li> and it straightens it pin straight with minimal effort and stays straight through humidity.</li>
            <li> and she has long, straight, shinny, non-frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> My hairs naturally curly</li>
            <li> I just wish it had a electronic screen showing you when it&#x27;s ready &amp; the current temperature...</li>
            <li> I tell everyone I know that wants a straightening iron that Babyliss is the only way to go!</li>
            <li> THE REGULAR STRAIGHT ONE AND THE C MODEL</li>
            <li> Still keeping my old flat iron though because I don&#x27;t always want my hair that pin straight bc</li>
            <li> After going through SO MANY other flat irons, I&#x27;ve finally found one that&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> it gets really hot on the outside blue part  </li>
            <li> I have used Chi, GHD and quite a few other brands, but this flat iron blows them away (and yes the others were purchased from a reputable beauty salon-no &amp;#34;knock-offs&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> I have Asian hair that is naturally wavy/frizzy and very sensitive to humidity.</li>
            <li> Not only in the way this worked on my hair, (which due to medical reason has gotten so fine)</li>
            <li> ANY OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS SAY I TOOK THE CHANCE OF TRYING THEM READY AND WILLING TO SEND THEM BOTH BACK AND CONTINUING MY QUEST TO GET THE RIGHT FLAT IRON ME..  </li>
            <li> and they sent back a new one.  </li>
            <li> Currently looking for a new straightener for them.</li>
            <li> The blue finish is the only real reason I didn&#x27;t give this product a 5th star.</li>
            <li> Straight as an arrow with the first past through.</li>
            <li> so a normal flat iron  would damage my hair.</li>
            <li> It grips my hair like no other straightening iron has.</li>
            <li> Flattens hair like no other iron does.</li>
            <li> This flat iron gets my hair STICK STRAIGHT and stays that way, even the next day.</li>
            <li> A NEW FLAT IRON</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend for those wanting a professional type iron with out two hundred dollar price tag.</li>
            <li> I though for sure this was false information.</li>
            <li> The ONLY complaint I have is that the outside of the heating plates gets pretty darn hot.  </li>
            <li> My old flat iron broke after six years of use.</li>
            <li> Now, I have only had it for two weeks, but i&#x27;ve already claimed that if it were to break in the near future, I would re-buy it</li>
            <li> All the other flat irons I used I would put it on it&#x27;s highest setting and they still weren&#x27;t hot enough....</li>
            <li> After many uses at high heat the paint will start to fade which is disappointing for the price.  </li>
            <li> Love the straightener, cut down from an hour to 15 mins for my long(around mid-thigh) thick hair.</li>
            <li> THERE IS NO FLAT IRON OUT THERE</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy and thick and any sign of humidity usually makes it grow outward :)</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure about how long the effectiveness lasts, but on the highest temperature setting it takes me just one really quick stroke for each section of hair.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I highly suggest this flat iron over all others.</li>
            <li> but I simply had to for this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have used several flat irons - Chi, Croc, Onassis Aphrodite.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist uses this same flat iron and recommended I buy it from Amazon because it&#x27;s cheaper than the beauty</li>
            <li> Plus, this purchase comes with a three year warranty which is 2 years longer than the last two flat irons I purchased; both died in the 14th month!</li>
            <li> AND it does not keep my hair flat...</li>
            <li> My fiance got this flat iron for me as a gift</li>
            <li> because when I was researching flat irons, I read  every review and watched just about every video out there.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all-Chi, Sedu, GHD and this flat iron beats them all (GHD</li>
            <li> I just purchased this flat iron</li>
            <li> so I found out what flat iron my beautician uses and it was this one</li>
            <li> I needed a flat iron and did not know which</li>
            <li> A friend recommended Baby Bliss, so I bought this flat iron in February, 2014.</li>
            <li> I have really long and coarse hair</li>
            <li> Then, as I am flat ironing, I use L&#x27;Oreal Sleek</li>
            <li> I only have to do minor touch-ups.  </li>
            <li> Burnt hair.i prefer my rusk flat iron.</li>
            <li> I like this flat iron</li>
            <li> This flat iron has served it&#x27;s purchase.  </li>
            <li> I IMMEDIATELY STARTED MY INTERNET SEARCH FOR THE FLAT IRON, CHECKING FOR PRICE AND</li>
            <li> IN THE END I DECIDED TO BUY BOTH FLAT IRONS</li>
            <li> FLAT AND LOOKING</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron in August.</li>
            <li> I was Leary about ordering these flat irons because of knock off.</li>
            <li> I might buy another one to use for my travel flat iron</li>
            <li> I have been flat ironing my heparin for,years</li>
            <li> I take this with me everywhere, especially if I know I am going out after a long day.  </li>
            <li> The plates actually were not completely flush, however, I don&#x27;t think it matters.</li>
            <li> This iron made the biggest difference in working with my hair and also working with the hard to iron spots like right in the back, center.  </li>
            <li> I mean it gets really hot.</li>
            <li> Not only does it straighten my hair, it doesn&#x27;t give it a fried, dry look.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works!!!  </li>
            <li> I have 5 daughters with medium to long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair myself.  </li>
            <li> I have waist-length hair that behaves really well in the winter but has an ugly life of it&#x27;s own in North Carolina&#x27;s humid summers even though it&#x27;s not that thick.</li>
            <li> the other flat irons only lasted a day and dry felt .</li>
            <li> AND THEN BOX UP THE OTHER TO SEND IT BACK.</li>
            <li> The second was made so the two heating plates didn&#x27;t even come close to each other.</li>
            <li> all other irons left my hair looking dry and crunchy regardless of product I used.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, coarse, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I just blow dry it.</li>
            <li> and I can not go dry, so</li>
            <li> I have long, very curly (wavy curls, ringlet curls), thick and extremely course hair.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair that usually takes me a long time to straighten with other flat irons.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even try to use any other flat iron.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to have it on the highest setting like the other flat irons I have owned (Chi, Sedu, HairArt)</li>
            <li> It Frizz Vanisher Cream when my hair is still wet, then I spray L&#x27;Oreal Boost it before I blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had much less straighteners last way longer.</li>
            <li> MY STYLIST USES THIS FLAT IRON ON HER CLIENTS + ME &amp; I JUST HAD TO BREAK DOWN AND GET ONE.</li>
            <li> but with this flat iron it takes half the time.</li>
            <li> It is not hot enough and it&#x27;s too long and not easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> and  do not enjoy the hours spent having to dry and flat hour it.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint about the HairArt iron is that it doesn&#x27;t come in the smaller size for curling hair, however considering my experience with this Baby Bliss</li>
            <li> Just as I expected.....</li>
            <li> But I actually don&#x27;t use this everyday.</li>
            <li> After only a few weeks I noticed it coming off on either side of the blades.</li>
            <li> Thought for as much as I spent</li>
            <li> BIG waste of money.</li>
            <li> Did not straighten hair as expected.</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift for my daughter who has thick, naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll never get any other type.</li>
            <li> Pros definitely outweigh the few cons!</li>
            <li> and I can have my all of my hair straightened in a quarter of the time it took me with other irons.</li>
            <li> WITH NO SATISFACTION, ONE FROM SALLY&#x27;S THE OTHER</li>
            <li> My hair is usually frizzy and it would take sometimes, with the Chi, going over the same piece of hair about 5 times.  </li>
            <li> It takes me a few minutes to straighten my thick hair, when it took me 20 minutes with my old one.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve only had the Babyliss for a few months and it&#x27;s dead.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it</li>
            <li> However I am quite disappointed that after using it only twice to curl my hair the blue finish has completely rubed off the edges.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Babyliss Prop Nano in June 2014 and it has stop working in less than year.  </li>
            <li> I used to spend over an hour straightening my hair, and with this I was finished in less than 40 minutes.</li>
            <li> It takes less than a minute to heat up</li>
            <li> , that still straightens my hair in less than an hr.</li>
            <li> It is not long, just shoulder length, but so thick!  </li>
            <li> Not only does it perform well, but it is so lightweight due to its thin design AND the Titanium leaves my hair looking shiny</li>
            <li> Doesnt work for thick, curly, long hair.</li>
            <li> AND I WAS SICK OF MY FLAT IRON BECAUSE IT WAS SO MUCH HASSLE</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daugher for Christmas, she has very long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Other than that small detail</li>
            <li> (MEANING THIS LITTLE BABY</li>
            <li> Also the temperature dial on the second one was very hard to turn.</li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse hair</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few days, I don&#x27;t regret at all having paid the premium.</li>
            <li> Got so tired of sending it back and waiting.  </li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t make the big curls with this one because it is too thin.</li>
            <li> since it is poor value at $129, you have to hold the iron flat tight so that your hand hurts after a while and</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Babyliss straighteners for a few years now and in my opinion, they cause very little damage if any to my hair.</li>
            <li> This one pulls my hair pretty badly while trying to straighten.</li>
            <li> I did this recently with another expensive straightener</li>
            <li> I think the HSI reviews are fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using the Bablyliss for a few months, I no longer have to straighten my hair!</li>
            <li> but no better then another cheapy I had.</li>
            <li> The plate has a small rust stain on it</li>
            <li> Looks misaligned so pointless</li>
            <li> OMG AMAZON IS USUALLY MY GO TO PLACE</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> It usually takes me an hour to straighten my hair</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased the Babyliss Prop Nano in June 2014 and it has stop working in less than year.  For the price of this straightening iron, the expectation would be that it should last longer.  Pleased with the results that the straightening iron gave, not pleased with the life of the product.  You expect a cheap straightening iron to stop working in less than a year, but not with higher end product.  Very skeptical to purchase again.</li>
            <li> returned this the next day - it gets really hot on the outside blue part  and I burned my hand - as for straightening my hair - it doesn&#x27;t work - I have thick wavy hair ( not even that curly) but it does not work like my GHD (which broke) .  I bought an FHI and that works even better than the GHD (these are all over $100 though I paid a bit  more for the GHD and FHI ) why pay for this Babyliss at $129  when it does not work AND higher chance to burn your hand.  Not worth it and if there was a -5  rating I would have done that since it is poor value at $129, you have to hold the iron flat tight so that your hand hurts after a while and the blue covering is so cheap that it gets just as hot as the plates.  AND it does not keep my hair flat... so returned the very next day</li>
            <li> Great straightener. Plates get very hot so must use with care. Would definitely recommend for those wanting a professional type iron with out two hundred dollar price tag.</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and this works amazing with getting it straight and allowing it to last.  I also do my BFF&#x27;s hair, whose hair is very course, and it add so much shine and gets it so silky. I don&#x27;t even try to use any other flat iron.</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron after doing hours of research and after my second CHI iron stopped working.  I have very thick, course,  wavy, frizzy hair and  do not enjoy the hours spent having to dry and flat hour it.  It is not long, just shoulder length, but so thick!  It had become a burden to do.  After going on Babyliss&#x27;s site and reading about all their irons, I decided on this iron because it has longer plates and wider plates than the normal irons plus it is light weight.  I had never purchased or used a Babyliss iron before but knew many hairdressers who used them.  This has been the best decision I have made!  I love this iron!  This iron made the biggest difference in working with my hair and also working with the hard to iron spots like right in the back, center.  It has heat settings which a Chi does not have, so you can set the iron for a low heat or a 450 heat for course hair.  A pamphlet will come with the iron telling you the best heat adjustment for your hair.  Plus using an thermal/heat protectant spray would help.  It also has a 4 year warranty!  That was another plus!  The only thing I wished the company would do is to enclose a sales receipt with the purchase.  I just went back into my Amazon account and printed it out to keep with my box.  Even when my daughter comes to visit she loves it and she has long, straight, shinny, non-frizzy hair! (the kind of hair I wold love to have!),  So overall, this iron is a keeper!  Must say, good job self!</li>
            <li> Straightens well but makes your hair smell burnt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many hair straighteners.  I have 5 daughters with medium to long hair.  I have long hair myself.  All of our hair is thick.  I like this straightener.  It heats up quickly and does a nice job.  We have had it now for 3 months without any problems.  It&#x27;s used daily.  The price is good and my experience has been, when it breaks down send it back to the company.  I did this recently with another expensive straightener and they sent back a new one.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, was a bit worried that I might have been sent a mock up since I reside in a U.S. Territory. Love the straightener, cut down from an hour to 15 mins for my long(around mid-thigh) thick hair. RECOMMEND hair protection shampoo, conditioner, leave-on spray-smell of burnt hair lasted 3days without any of the hair products.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long, curly hair. Being biracial, it&#x27;s sometimes difficult to find products and tools to create the look I&#x27;m going for. My hairdresser used this on my hair and I was truly amazed! I purchased one immediately. I used to use a CHI, and had to go over each section several times and it still wasn&#x27;t as smooth as I wanted it to be. With this iron, I only had to go over each section once, maybe twice, and my hair is perfectly smooth, shiny, and feels like pure silk! I used to spend over an hour straightening my hair, and with this I was finished in less than 40 minutes. It&#x27;s super light, comfortable to hold, and heats up quickly. Highly recommend this iron! You won&#x27;t be sorry!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great straightener, and gets my hair flat in under 5 minutes!  I own the 1 1/2\\&quot; iron and the size is perfect for longer hair.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this flat iron! It has a fantastic range of heat. Once turns on it heats up instantly. It&#x27;s light weight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Item didn&#x27;t work. waste of money. DO NOT BUY IT...</li>
            <li> My fiance got this flat iron for me as a gift and I fell in love with it!  I&#x27;ve even thought about making a youtube video of it (haven&#x27;t yet) because when I was researching flat irons, I read  every review and watched just about every video out there.  My hair is naturally wavy and thick and any sign of humidity usually makes it grow outward :) However, I used this straightener on humid days in NC and have yet to see a problem!  I&#x27;m sure there are other great ones out there, but this is the best one i have found thus far.  Now, I have only had it for two weeks, but i&#x27;ve already claimed that if it were to break in the near future, I would re-buy it (although I won&#x27;t have to because it has a 4 year warranty - now thats a great product) because it does THAT amazing of a job on my hair.  I&#x27;m not sure if the warranty is void through amazon or not, but make sure you look into that if that is what you&#x27;re buying this for.  All in all, I think i&#x27;ve made my point.  This flat iron works!!!  I&#x27;ve never seen my hair this straight!!</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, colored, thick gray hair. This straightener is a miracle worker that leaves my hair stick straight...and it stays straight in humidity. I tried the HSI and it was horrible. I think the HSI reviews are fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using the Bablyliss for a few months, I no longer have to straighten my hair! I just blow dry it. It&#x27;s winter, so come Summer and humidity, I&#x27;ll probably have to straighten again. But for now, I know why straight haired girls want curly hair. When I straighten my hair, it&#x27;s too straight! Wow, wow, wow. (As a curly haired girl, I&#x27;d still rather have straight hair, though, it&#x27;s so much easier.)</li>
            <li> I am VERY pleased with how well this flat iron works. My hair looks amazing. Best flat iron I have ever owned. However I am quite disappointed that after using it only twice to curl my hair the blue finish has completely rubed off the edges. I&#x27;m sad that even though it&#x27;s new and works great it looks old and worn.  But I guess I&#x27;d choose function over looks.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, coarse, naturally curly hair. This straightener works wonders!! I&#x27;ve never seen my hair so straight!! It gets very hot but doesn&#x27;t appear to damage my hair. It took me hardly any time at all to straighten all of my hair. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I read some negative product reviews. This product is the REAL thing. It came quickly and in the original box. Works great on my kinky African American hair.</li>
            <li> This iron heats up fast but it really burns your hair. It is thin so it&#x27;s easy to get to the roots of your hair. However, I have a lot of hair so it takes longer to finish.</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny!  One swipe and my naturally wavy hair is straight.  It gets super hot!</li>
            <li> After receiving my Babyliss Pro Nano. I was so excited to use it for the first time. I used it and yeah it worked but no better then another cheapy I had. Then I started reading all the reviews about knock offs being sold my Amazon. I though for sure this was false information. I have used amazon several times before and never have had a problem with them until now! I called 800-326-6247 for verify authenticity. Just as I expected..... my serial number is NOTHING LIKE what it should be. I am so upset and out a lot of money for a fake! BEWARE WHEN YOU ARE BUYING!!!!</li>
            <li> Gets it straight but no straighter than a Chi. It&#x27;s been 2 months and the blue paint is chipping. I&#x27;m really irritated. I should have just gotten a Chi or something like I had before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all-Chi, Sedu, GHD and this flat iron beats them all (GHD a close second though).  I have super thick hair that usually takes me a long time to straighten with other flat irons.  Not this one-my hair is straight, not fuzzy and in record time!  The ONLY complaint I have is that the outside of the heating plates gets pretty darn hot.  So glad I took a chance and bought this iron.</li>
            <li> Awesome straightner!!! The best.. Better than the chi iron</li>
            <li> I just purchased this flat iron and I love it! It heats fast and it gives my hair that straight shiny look. I am currently in cometology school and I am unable to get to the hair salon to get my hair done due to my schedule so I found out what flat iron my beautician uses and it was this one now I can get the same flowy, shiny professional look in the privacy of my own home. I would recommend this product to anyone. Thanks BaByliss!!!</li>
            <li> Im very upset! The plate has a small rust stain on it and there are several scratches on it!!! I would likr another one and im requesting a discount! Please contact me!!!</li>
            <li> I needed a flat iron and did not know which so I looked for comments on  Folica.com experiance and found this flat iron with the best reviews and not very expensive, compare the price with  Amazon and Amazon was the best, my hair is long and thin in parts so a normal flat iron  would damage my hair. This flat iron I use it in a not so hot temperature (35) and was very smooth and soft for days!! the other flat irons only lasted a day and dry felt . The second time you use, the lower the temperature to 25 and my hair was soo smooth and soft and fast!! and I can not go dry, so I hope the split ends are removed when I cut his hair,</li>
            <li> Is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve used is very lightweight and heats very quickly, It takes half the time doing my hair. I have to say I am very happy with this purchase and recommend this product 100% !!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it! She said it doesn&#x27;t pull on her hair and gets the heat just correct temperature! Very nice flat iron</li>
            <li> I love it. Works great on my thich very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat iron! Like the other users stated below, it heats up super fast and gets really hot. You don&#x27;t need to have it on the highest setting like the other flat irons I have owned (Chi, Sedu, HairArt) and it works really, really FAST. I have Asian hair that is naturally wavy/frizzy and very sensitive to humidity. This flat iron gets my hair STICK STRAIGHT and stays that way, even the next day. I do have one warning - make sure you use a heat protectant to help prevent breakage and damage. Other than that, I highly suggest this flat iron over all others.</li>
            <li> My old flat iron broke after six years of use. A friend recommended Baby Bliss, so I bought this flat iron in February, 2014. It has only been a year and four months and it wont heat up anymore. Also, the outer material is very flimsy for the cost of the iron. My old iron, which was made by HairArt was much sturdier, around the same price, and lasted for six years. My only complaint about the HairArt iron is that it doesn&#x27;t come in the smaller size for curling hair, however considering my experience with this Baby Bliss I may just buy another HairArt. I don&#x27;t want to make another $100+ purchase only to have it break on me in another year.</li>
            <li> I have waist-length hair that behaves really well in the winter but has an ugly life of it&#x27;s own in North Carolina&#x27;s humid summers even though it&#x27;s not that thick. My old cheap Revlon hair straightener is a toy compared to this. I&#x27;ve only had it for a week so I&#x27;m not sure about how long the effectiveness lasts, but on the highest temperature setting it takes me just one really quick stroke for each section of hair. Even without sectioning, results are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a bunch of reviews that say this is a fake, just to clarify - I didn&#x27;t buy this product on Amazon pretty much because of all these reviews. I bought it at an Ulta beauty store where the retail price was $139. After using it for a few days, I don&#x27;t regret at all having paid the premium. For years I&#x27;ve hated how my hair looks in the summer so this seems like a small price to pay to have my hair look perfect during these months.</li>
            <li> THE best I&#x27;ve ever used!!! A must have...saves time and your hair :-) LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> This iron is working very well. So far is the best iron I&#x27;ve owned. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing. My hairs naturally curly and I just got it cut short into a bob hairstyle and the baybliss works like a charm. I had a chi before and this product is definitely better by far!</li>
            <li> best flat iron i&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> The best flat iron. I certainly recommend this iron for real curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;Leave your hair looking shiny and straight.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite straightener. I got my first one 8 years ago and I&#x27;ll never get any other type. I have really long and coarse hair and I had a hard time finding a tool that would do the trick. I only spend about 20-30 min on my hair with this compared to 40-60. It recently broke (I think someone just dropped it. Not a problem with the actual straightener.) I got another and it works perfectly again. This is the cheapest you can find them too! Overall wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> Thanks! Your feedback helps us improve your Marketplace experience.</li>
            <li> First of all, I never write reviews but I simply had to for this flat iron. I have used several flat irons - Chi, Croc, Onassis Aphrodite.  I have long, very curly (wavy curls, ringlet curls), thick and extremely course hair. This flat iron - in ONE PASS - straightens perfectly. I am truly blown away by its performance.  I did just receive it but am provided some comfort as it comes with a 4 year warranty.  Straightening my hair went from taking 45 minutes to between 20 and 30 minutes - KID YOU NOT.  Not only does it perform well, but it is so lightweight due to its thin design AND the Titanium leaves my hair looking shiny which I have NEVER had before - all other irons left my hair looking dry and crunchy regardless of product I used.  I use L&#x27;Oreal Sleek products: Sleek It Frizz Vanisher Cream when my hair is still wet, then I spray L&#x27;Oreal Boost it before I blow dry my hair.  Then, as I am flat ironing, I use L&#x27;Oreal Sleek It Iron Straight Spray and finish off the look with Tresemme Keratin Smooth Shine Serum.  PLUS - it STAYS straight - for DAYS!  I only have to do minor touch-ups.  It&#x27;s just crazy that this does so well.  I am very pleased.  If something goes wrong with iron, I will update on the service provided by the company through its warranty.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work for thick, curly, long hair. Must have ceramic for that. GHD is the one to go with.Flat iron should straighten hair fairly easily, but this one just leaves it frizzy.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. So far it leaves my hair more pin straight than any other flat iron. Still keeping my old flat iron though because I don&#x27;t always want my hair that pin straight bc it has no volume😂.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of this iron is thay my hair lasts long straight. It has been 3 days and I haven&#x27;t had to repass the iron in my hair.</li>
            <li> does not straighten as well as stated</li>
            <li> Love my babyliss iron. My hair is super straight. Iron gets super hot. Price was good. I hope this iron will last more then a couple of year?</li>
            <li> My hair is some of the most coarse, frizzy, curly hair you&#x27;ve ever seen &amp; this flat iron gets my hair from blow dryed &amp; poofy to smooth, straight &amp; silky. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair smell or feel fried. It heats up very fast. I just wish it had a electronic screen showing you when it&#x27;s ready &amp; the current temperature... because it only has an on/off button &amp; a dial to adjust temp.. and it doesn&#x27;t blink, or light up specifically when it&#x27;s ready - it stays lit up the entire time it&#x27;s on. I&#x27;d definitely buy another. I love it. Pros definitely outweigh the few cons!</li>
            <li> This must have been defective. Got extremely hot. Burnt hair.i prefer my rusk flat iron.</li>
            <li> THE BEST EVER.. MY STYLIST USES THIS FLAT IRON ON HER CLIENTS + ME &amp; I JUST HAD TO BREAK DOWN AND GET ONE. THERE IS NO FLAT IRON OUT THERE LIKE THIS ONE! DOES MIRACLES ON AFRICAN AMERICAN HAIR!!</li>
            <li> BEST FLAT IRON EVER!!!</li>
            <li> I am in love with the straightener! It takes me a few minutes to straighten my thick hair, when it took me 20 minutes with my old one. I love my babyliss!</li>
            <li> I like this flat iron but there are some aspects I&#x27;m not happy with. It is not rounded enough on the edges to flip ends of hair nicely. I do like the heat setting options. But I actually don&#x27;t use this everyday. I went back to my chi iron on a daily basis</li>
            <li> The plates heat up quickly and it gets very, very hot.  There is a temperature dial on the iron.  I put it on med/high and it straightened my hair quickly but after a couple weeks, my ends we&#x27;re brittle and split.  I would suggest to only use this iron on freshly washed hair.  I think it tends to cook any hairspray or product that may be on the hair, thus breaking the hair in the process.</li>
            <li> I have just purchased this iron. This iron is amazing for my hair, I have really curly hair and after using this fantastic iron. I totally recommend this iron!</li>
            <li> Blades do not meet I am returning. Loved everything about it but the&lt;br /&gt;separation between the blades is too large.  Looks misaligned so pointless&lt;br /&gt;because of the gap it does nothing</li>
            <li> Heats up fast....can dial your temperature preference so you don&#x27;t fry your hair..... straightens perfectly the first time, no need to go over one area more than once.... definitely not cheaply made, I highly recommend tis product! I have VERY thick hair and it does the job.</li>
            <li> Best hair straightener I&#x27;ve purchased! It&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Easy to handle, heats up right away. Great item, my hairstylist recommended it.</li>
            <li> Trust me when I warn you off about this.  It does not work well, it catches on the hair, and the plates do not touch without great effort.  After all of the research that I did, I am extremely disappointed that this iron did not live up to reviews.  Not even close.</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift for my daughter who has thick, naturally wavy hair. She loves it!</li>
            <li> After going through SO MANY other flat irons, I&#x27;ve finally found one that&#x27;s a keeper! This thing heats up fast, and when I say &#x27;heats up&#x27; I mean it gets really hot. All the other flat irons I used I would put it on it&#x27;s highest setting and they still weren&#x27;t hot enough.... this one? I don&#x27;t even use it at it&#x27;s highest. It takes less than a minute to heat up and I can have my all of my hair straightened in a quarter of the time it took me with other irons. It really is worth the extra money... you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> Bought one for myself, second one is a gift.</li>
            <li> The best purchase ever!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I had a Chi straightener before, but now that I have the Babyliss, what a difference!!!! Not only I finish in half or less the time,but the result is simply amazing!!! I just love it. And the price? One really can&#x27;t beat it!!! Great product !!!</li>
            <li> I love this flat Iron. I have used Chi, GHD and quite a few other brands, but this flat iron blows them away (and yes the others were purchased from a reputable beauty salon-no &amp;#34;knock-offs&amp;#34;).  I purchased one for me and a friend for her birthday and we are equally impressed!! I also got a Babyliss blow dryer, as my Chi is so heavy and am very pleased with it as well!!</li>
            <li> This iron is GREAT for natural sisters looking to create that straight (relaxed) look. I have very thick coarse hair and this is the first flat iron that I can use below the highest setting, that still straightens my hair in less than an hr. It&#x27;s super light weight and heats up very fast. Definitely easy on the arms and shoulders when straightening an entire head of hair. As others have mentioned this thing gets EXTREMELY hot SO CARE MUST BE TAKEN not to accidentally burn your hair.  Even the thickest hair shouldn&#x27;t require the highest setting so a good heat protectant is a must.  The blue finish is the only real reason I didn&#x27;t give this product a 5th star. While it does make the iron cuter the paint doesn&#x27;t seem to be heat resistant. After only a few weeks I noticed it coming off on either side of the blades. Other than that small detail this Iron is definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This flat iron has served it&#x27;s purchase.  Lightweight, easy to handle.  I never have hand fatigue when using it.  After many uses at high heat the paint will start to fade which is disappointing for the price.  But I guess at a high heat one can expect in time for the paint closest to the heating plates to wear.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Best straightener i have ever used! Heats up in seconds, doesn&#x27;t damage my hair, straightens faster than almost all of the straighteners i have used. No complaints here :)</li>
            <li> Works great I&#x27;m African American and I love it works good on my natural hair and my weaves it gets really straight and I can use it to style my hair</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several generic, cheap flat irons; it was wonderful to finally find one that does an incredible job. Not only does it straighten my hair, it doesn&#x27;t give it a fried, dry look. I&#x27;ve been using Babyliss straighteners for a few years now and in my opinion, they cause very little damage if any to my hair. I tell everyone I know that wants a straightening iron that Babyliss is the only way to go!</li>
            <li> OMG AMAZON IS USUALLY MY GO TO PLACE ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO HAVE A BETTER PRICE.  I JUST GOT THIS BOMB HAIR CUT AND I WAS SICK OF MY FLAT IRON BECAUSE IT WAS SO MUCH HASSLE TO GET MY HAIR STRAIGHT.  IT ACTUALLY DID NOT EVER  REALLY GET MY HAIR STRAIGHT LIKE THE HAIR SALON AND IT WOULD BE PUFFY LOL FLUFFY RATHER THAN NICE AND SHINY.  I DECIDED TO FIND ME A NEW FLAT IRON AND I ENDED UP PURCHASING 2 WITH NO SATISFACTION, ONE FROM SALLY&#x27;S THE OTHER A REMINGTON FROM TARGET BOTH HAD 450 MAXIMUM HEAT BUT BOTH WERE TOTALLY WHACK AND DID NOT DO ANYTHING WELL, MY CURRENT FLAT IRON WAS TEN TIMES BETTER THAN BOTH.  DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY TEXTED MY STYLIST AND ASKED HIM WHAT TO BUY HE STATED BABYLISS PRO THE BEVELED ONE IS THE ONE THAT HE USES. I IMMEDIATELY STARTED MY INTERNET SEARCH FOR THE FLAT IRON, CHECKING FOR PRICE AND ALL REVIEWS. IN THE END I DECIDED TO BUY BOTH FLAT IRONS THE REGULAR STRAIGHT ONE AND THE C MODEL THE ONE WITH A CURVED EDGE.  JUST GOT BOTH TODAY AND I AM TOTALLY SOLD. MY PLAN FOR  WAS TO GET THEM BOTH SEE WHICH ONE I LIKE BEST AND THEN BOX UP THE OTHER TO SEND IT BACK. I PLANNED TO WASH MY HAIR TONIGHT AND THEN TEST THEM BOTH, I ENDED UP JUST TESTING WITHOUT WASHING, BOY AM I GLAD I DID.  THE REGULAR 1 1/2 IN NANO WITH  NO CURVE WAS TESTED FIRST.  I WAS ABLE TO PICK UP ALL OF MY HAIR IN EACH SECTION AND MAKE SUPER STRAIGHT I WAS AMAZED AND SAID OUT I OWN THIS (MEANING THIS LITTLE BABY WASN&#x27;T GOING ANYWHERE OOH WE WAS SUPER EXCITED BECAUSE IT LOOKED FABULOUS, FABULOSITY TIMES TEN SHINY AS HELL FLAT AND LOOKING I JUST WALKED OUT OF THE SALON I IMMEDIATELY TEXTED STYLIST SAID HE ROCKED AND THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE 411.  I DO NOT CARE WHAT ANY OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS SAY I TOOK THE CHANCE OF TRYING THEM READY AND WILLING TO SEND THEM BOTH BACK AND CONTINUING MY QUEST TO GET THE RIGHT FLAT IRON ME..  LADIES THIS IS THE ONE ACTUALLY I AM IN LOVE WITH BOTH AND I AM NOT SENDING EITHER BACK BUT I AM SAVING MY REVIEW DETAIL FOR MY REVIEW THAT I AM GETTING READY TO DO FOR IT.  I WAS PLANNING TO CALL MANUFACTURER LIKE EVERYONE ELSE TO SEE IF MINES WERE REAL.  DON&#x27;T GIVE A DAM_ THEY ROCK AND WHOEVER MADE IT DID DARN GOOD JOB.  DOING THE CABBAGE PATCH RIGHT NOW LADIES. THIS DIVA IS A HAPPY CAMPER.  CUDOS TO AMAZON FOR GETTING IT TO ME THE NEXT DAY FOR FREE AND IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, CUDOS TO BABYLISS FOR HAVING AN AWESOME PRODUCT THAT DOES WHAT IT SAYS OH YEAH FORGOT TO SAY THAT I LOVE THAT THIS ONE WAS NOT HEAVY BUT WORKED JUST LIKE THE HEAVIER FLAT IRONS THAT REALLY GETS A GOOD GRIP DID IT PERFECTLY LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Broke after two weeks. Doesnt get hot or stay hot. Keeps shutting off. Looks like a fake one. Wish i could get my money back</li>
            <li> My wife loves it only disadvantage is it won&#x27;t work in Europe. We won&#x27;t on the trip and my wife wasn&#x27;t able to use it. Other than that great product</li>
            <li> Thought for as much as I spent I would be super impressed but not so much. This one pulls my hair pretty badly while trying to straighten. Purchased August 2014 its now March 2015 today tried to use straightener it powers up until the cord get bumped and it shuts off. Must have a short in the cord. I&#x27;ve had much less straighteners last way longer. I will be going through the warranty process so I better be getting one that works!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!! Can straighten my thick wavy shoulder length hair in under 10 minutes!</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron in August. At first things were fine, heats fast, straighten well. But then the iron would get too hot to touch on the 30 heat setting.  You could not hold it,then the finish started coming off the edges and the top face of the iron. I was Leary about ordering these flat irons because of knock off. Seems I had reason to be concerned. I can&#x27;t believe that the genuine Babyliss would be this poorly made to flake it&#x27;s finish coat and  get so hot the user can&#x27;t hold it. BIG waste of money. I thought I was safe ordering thru Amazon, thought they made sure their products were legit. This was fulfilled thru Amazon, not an outsider. Don&#x27;t they check to make sure they are selling Their customers authentic products?</li>
            <li> My hair stylist uses this same flat iron and recommended I buy it from Amazon because it&#x27;s cheaper than the beauty supply.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it several times and it&#x27;s not a fake and is exactly like the one my stylist uses. Love the bigger plates and the grip is better than my old FHI flat iron. I might buy another one to use for my travel flat iron</li>
            <li> Recommend this product. I love this straightener. Makes my hair shiny and smooth and slides through my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this iron and it&#x27;s multiple settings. My hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair are different textures and this works perfect for the both of us.</li>
            <li> My daughter purchased this for my wife and her to use when our chi died.  (They had that for 4 years).  They&#x27;ve only had the Babyliss for a few months and it&#x27;s dead.  The on/off switch just doesn&#x27;t work any longer.  Disappointed in the manufacturer&#x27;s craftsmanship.  Currently looking for a new straightener for them.</li>
            <li> Professional quality, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these and returned them both. The first stopped heating after a couple uses. The second was made so the two heating plates didn&#x27;t even come close to each other. The hair just fell right through it. Also the temperature dial on the second one was very hard to turn. Very disappointed. Will be looking for a product from a different company.</li>
            <li> Straightens beautifully and makes my hair silkier; highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have always used Chi, but this straightener has been by far the best I have ever used!  It locks out the humidity.  Plus, I love their warranty!</li>
            <li> My hair dresser had one of these an d when I bought it, I already knew what I was getting, beats the chi any day. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love this better than my Chi that I use to use!</li>
            <li> En realidad todo llego bien y es un muy buen equipo lo recomiendo fue una entrega rápida recomiendo al vendedor</li>
            <li> Awesome!!!!! Love this better than my Chi Turbo I had!</li>
            <li> I have been flat ironing my heparin for,years and this is by far the best iron I have ever used. It heats up quickly and the settings go over 400 degrees which is sometimes necessary depending on the humidity. Once swipe is usually enough to make my hair smooth and shiny. Plus, this purchase comes with a three year warranty which is 2 years longer than the last two flat irons I purchased; both died in the 14th month!</li>
            <li> Works perfect on my weave , and good on my natural hair but doesnt allow it to stay straight</li>
            <li> Lightweight and get the job done quickly,hair very straight do a much better job than the chi</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daugher for Christmas, she has very long, thick hair.  She said it was the best straightener she&#x27;s ever had including ones that cost more money!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! It&#x27;s well worth the money. It grips my hair like no other straightening iron has.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted :)</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.  Flattens hair like no other iron does. It&#x27;s the perfect flat iron!!!</li>
            <li> Loved this straightener! It works so well! Would totally recommend it :)</li>
            <li> Straight as an arrow with the first past through. I have very thick wavy hair and this straightener is awesome. Cut my straightening time in half!! feels great in my hand, lon cord, just all around an amazing product!!!!</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be skinnier but still love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece who is classic when it comes to breaking straightening irons. This one is the Queen of all! She loves it so much and says it gives her &amp;#34;Celebrity hair&amp;#34;. A sturdy, awesome straightener that will last a long time. It leaves hair so nice and doesn&#x27;t split the ends or burn the hair.  Very worth the price.</li>
            <li> And it is the best hair straightening iron that i have every used. Thin and smooth, easy to work. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I do love this hair straightener however I do not think this one gets as hot as my first one.</li>
            <li> Terrible piece of junk.  Flimsy and the plates don&#x27;t come together at the ends.  Really poor value.</li>
            <li> Gets hot almost immediately! No waiting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful! Great for thick hair!&lt;br /&gt;The best straightener I ever had. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love it and so does my 12 year old daughter.....it works great on my hair....and the style stays till time for a wash....every three weeks,,,,,love it. Love it</li>
            <li> This is an awesome tool that will make your hair feel magically clean, straight and silky. I recommend it! Very satisfied w/ this.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price.  Thank you for this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this straightener it is AMAZING. I have very coarse thick curly hair, and I only have to pass through my hair once, and it works great. It also adds shine!!! Its a must in my hair tool kit.</li>
            <li> straightener was broken before I even got to use it :/ disappointed I have to return and look for another</li>
            <li> This product is worth the investment. It works much quicker than cheap flat irons. It does get super hot though and you will definitely need to use a hair serum to protect your hair from burning and breaking.</li>
            <li> I received the straightener before the delivery date and it works great. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> This thing works! It&#x27;s wonderful, no complaints at all. I have very thick corse Italian hair and was recommended to try this out and am very happy. It usually takes me an hour to straighten my hair but with this flat iron it takes half the time. So happy!</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron!!!</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this flat iron since I had heard so many great things about it. But once I got it, it didn&#x27;t meet any of my expectations. My 5 year old flat iron works better than this. Plates do not close all the way, they only touch completely at the very top. It pulls my hair. This is a counterfeit. Returning it asap.</li>
            <li> Can you save LOVE!  This by far is the best straightening iron I have ever purchased.  I had a Chi prior to this and it kept breaking.  Got so tired of sending it back and waiting.  I bit the bullet and while my Chi was away, I ordered and played with the Babyliss Pro Nano and so happy a that I did!  What a difference!  Not only in the way this worked on my hair, (which due to medical reason has gotten so fine) but on the temperature control and how it feels to hold.  My hair is usually frizzy and it would take sometimes, with the Chi, going over the same piece of hair about 5 times.  Not with Babybliss! Mone time and I am done and I love it.  It does not burn my hair and it....I can&#x27;t even describe how great it makes my hair look.  It straightens it so well that my hair feels like silk.  With the Chi, my hair was frizzing up again within 3 hours (used the same products - never changed those it with the Babybliss I don&#x27;t have that problem.  I take this with me everywhere, especially if I know I am going out after a long day.  Shove it in my purse, plug it in, refresh my hair and I am gone.  No more bad hair days for me!!  Thank you Babybliss!</li>
            <li> It is not what I thought it would be.  It is not hot enough and it&#x27;s too long and not easy to handle.  I will return it.</li>
            <li> Great item and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I really thought it was going to be much better...it&#x27;s ok but not the best</li>
            <li> I love the babyliss pro nano titanium! It is the best straightener I have yet to buy. I would recommend anyone to buy it. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> A Birthday Gift For my Girl and She Loves it</li>
            <li> Great product..fast shipping is amazing.</li>
            <li> Hi just got babyliss pro nano  titanium  1.5 inch. I have a very thick curly  hair. It took an hour to straighten  hair. It&#x27;s far better than  cheaper straightening flat irons and the hair remained straight  till the next wash... I love this flat.....</li>
            <li> I am very glad I decided on this flat iron. I read many reviews that talked about the plates not being flush, which made me hesitant about this purchase. The plates actually were not completely flush, however, I don&#x27;t think it matters. This iron works so well. I have super coarse, thick hair (I can easily look like Gilda Radner on a humid day...) and it straightens it pin straight with minimal effort and stays straight through humidity. I don&#x27;t even have a need to turn the heat up past 200 degrees because it works so well. I save time and have straighter hair! I absolutely love this iron!</li>
            <li> Very thin but straightens well but you can&#x27;t make the big curls with this one because it is too thin.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve owned!!</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made. Sent back. Did not straighten hair as expected.</li>
