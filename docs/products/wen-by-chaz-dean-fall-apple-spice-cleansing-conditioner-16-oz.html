            <li>Pleasant fragrance and consistently good product from WEN by Chaz Dean.</li>
            <li>Wen is really great for my hair, I love it a lot!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is good that a stranger standing almost 2 feet away</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t know what hair type is ideal for this, but it sure isn&#x27;t fine.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Also, you need to use a lot of product for each use, which it about a bottle a month, which of course makes it fairly expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel and look good.</li>
            <li>It smells like a spicy baked good.</li>
            <li>I have used WEN for quite some time and always have had good luck with it.  </li>
            <li>but is good for my hair</li>

            <li>I tried a family members Lavender WEN and absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>shampoo or conditioner, but its damn good.</li>
            <li>However, the Fall Apple Spice just did not smell good to me.</li>
            <li>To be fair this shampoo does not smell like vomit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a very spicy heady fragrance yet smells wonderful!!</li>
            <li>A nice smell, but I don&#x27;t want to wear it.</li>
            <li>I really relish the wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like caramel.</li>
            <li>Based on those results I decided to purchase my own bottle of WEN.  </li>
            <li>I&#x60;m loving this reaction from men</li>
            <li>Thanks for another great scent!</li>
            <li>Figured if she liked it</li>
            <li>I am absolutely thrilled with the way my hair feels after using this product.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice to try it without the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Nice for fall.</li>
            <li>I have to say that the smell is nice....</li>
            <li>Although this cleansing conditioner helped my hair to look and feel nice...</li>
            <li>I tried this product because the price was GREAT for a 16oz bottle, but now that I have it, Im LOVE it and will def order more.  </li>
            <li>Have already loved WEN cleansing conditioner, but I just love the smell of this one.</li>
            <li>After using it, my husband complimented me on how nice my hair smelled.</li>
            <li>Was not for me but works nice.</li>
            <li>My hair is much softer and smells awesome!!!!</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love!!</li>
            <li>If you use it correctly it makes your hair feel light and silky smooth!!!</li>
            <li>These prices seem too good to be true!</li>
            <li>can smell your hair, but it nice that they liked the smell :)</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick and they made the package with a happy face.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell very strongly of apple</li>
            <li>It smells very strong before you shampoo</li>
            <li>it smells like a Yankee candle and it has a very strong maple smell to it.</li>
            <li>I have curly wavy hair that gets frizzy very easily.  </li>
            <li>so I was so surprised when I got not one or two but dozens of comments that my hair smelled wonderful - sometimes even strangers in the line at the store.  </li>
            <li>The colors blend nicely and there are many colors in this label.  </li>
            <li>I love the Wen conditioner, the Fall Apple Spice has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>I love wen and it works amazing</li>
            <li>Love the smell of the apple spice,it&#x27;s a nice change.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and manageable while smelling great!</li>
            <li>Scenario: most effective shampoo on the market has critics raving.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about this fragrance, but still a great hair product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like apples but more of a warm spice.</li>
            <li>Everything Chaz says about his products is 100% true!!  </li>
            <li>that is how strong the smell is YUCK!  </li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, and only after one use I had two comments about my hair being shiny and looking healthy!</li>
            <li>Love, Love, love Wen!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love the way it makes your hair feel!</li>
            <li>Smell was really strong!</li>
            <li>I love the smell, kind of like Dutch Apple Pie,  and my hair feels really healthy.  </li>
            <li>Real clean smelling.  : )</li>
            <li>Smells great, but made hair very greasy feeling!  </li>
            <li>and it worked just fine!</li>
            <li>Return was very smooth.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even try this on my hair before returning it, the fragrance is nice but WAY too strong.</li>
            <li>Scent is nice but too strong.</li>
            <li>I do notice my hair seems healthier most of the time, but I began using Wen in the summer.  </li>
            <li>I love Wen</li>
            <li>Used it only for a month after noticing remarkable hair loss!!!</li>
            <li>Love the products, but wasn&#x27;t too keen on the scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I ordered anyway.</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s more like a mulled cider,</li>
            <li>I love Wen, but this scent is NOT for me.  </li>
            <li>like most of them, but this one I won&#x27;t use again.</li>
            <li>Same wonderful cleansing conditioner (could never use anything else on these curls!),</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser</li>
            <li>Love how this smells and makes my hair feel</li>

            <li>Seemed like all the delicious vanilla scent evaporated, and I was just left with the spice.  </li>
            <li>but it was ok</li>
            <li>The seasonal scents are much better.</li>
            <li>WInter Vanilla MInt was my all time favorite</li>
            <li>I love, love,</li>

            <li>have colored my hair for many year and a lot of time i have to strip my hair before placing the color(blues, greens and reds)</li>

            <li>If you like Yankee Candles then you will probably love this.  </li>
            <li>I figured it would have a more apple/fruity smell to it, but thats not the case at all.</li>
            <li>Tried it one more time today and decided to return it.  </li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>I doubt that I&#x27;ll buy any more.</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>My young-adult daughters love it.</li>

            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>sure.</li>
            <li>I love the WEN hair product line.  </li>
            <li>glad WEN doesnt compromise quality to make the product smell like comfort food.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this formula.  </li>
            <li>I have had several people tell me my hair smells amazing, even on day 2!!!  </li>
            <li>Love the cinnamon smell.  </li>
            <li>Smelled more like chemicals, caramel and spice than apple.  </li>
            <li>My hair is always looking shiny and lovely.</li>
            <li>I love WEN.</li>
            <li>Lovvveeee the smell i love love love the smell of cinnamon</li>
            <li>I love all WEN products.</li>
            <li>Love Wen Cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love the product Wen, but not a fan of this one.  </li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love the smell.  </li>
            <li>So getting more.  </li>
            <li>The Fall Apple Spice is my favorite</li>
            <li>Great Item, fast shipping ....</li>
            <li>I love this cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many compliments.  </li>
            <li>Love this and</li>
            <li>I love wen.</li>
            <li>I love the summer mango coconut.  </li>
            <li>I normally purchase Wen from QVC but am happy that Amazon provides these formulas which are no longer in season.</li>
            <li>The Fall Apple Spice reminds me of a good hot cup of mulled caramel apple cider.</li>
            <li>That flavor was pretty good</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use it!  </li>
            <li>I like it, but am glad it doesn&#x27;t linger for hours because it is rather strong.</li>
            <li>Love it although smell is strong</li>
            <li>It is also thicker than the almond version, and I did like the smell after I washed my hair was not too strong, but still like the almond better.</li>
            <li>The scent itself is okay, its just way to strong.</li>
            <li>The scent is really overpowering and more baked good smelling than apple.</li>
            <li>The cream is very rich, easy to work into scalp and strands.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews that said that sent was overwhelming but if rinsed well it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>Next best are the Pumpkin Spice and Sweet Almond.  </li>
            <li>After using WEN my hair is much easier to straighten or wear with my waves, which look pretty good!  </li>
            <li>I usually do not write reveiws in products but this stuff smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li>this is a great product and I was not disappointed with the new scent.  </li>
            <li>I love it love the smell of cinnamon in this product ,so fresh smelling</li>
            <li>and I love how clean and shiny my hair is.  </li>
            <li>I wish it&#x27;s cheaper,and easy to buy somewhere&lt;</li>
            <li>Like a strong yankee candle in your hair</li>
            <li>I thought the smell was too strong</li>
            <li>the scent is a bit strong.  </li>
            <li>If you like a strong spicy apple scent then you will probably like this one.  </li>
            <li>If strong or lingering smells bother you, this one might not be for you.</li>
            <li>too strong.  </li>
            <li>My husband likes Wen, but the smell of the apple is too strong for him.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong, yes.</li>
            <li>It does not smell like apples but to me this does not have a strong cinnamon smell either</li>
            <li>I have also read reviews stating that it is strong smelling and does not go away, I do not have these problems.</li>
            <li>This scent is a bit strong, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>However, the strong smell lingered for the 24 hours, until I washed my hair.  </li>
            <li>I am not a fan of strong scents.  </li>
            <li>Some say this is too strong.............</li>
            <li>But the spice is so strong that you don&#x27;t smell any apple in it</li>
            <li>Wish all the Wen cleansers smelled as strong as this one.</li>
            <li>Great product as I have experienced with many different wen products try it you will like it like no other</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely more of a spice scent, but you can also smell sort of a sweet crust smell.</li>
            <li>Product was received  in a timely manner &amp; in good shape - Excellent Service - will definitely come back!</li>
            <li>Does not have a sweet apple smell, but more like a caramel spice smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet and lovely.</li>
            <li>It makes the Wen go through my hair better and makes combing my hair after the shower super easy.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best hair product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Sweet Almond and love it - tried this to mix it up and am not super impressed.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, this is NOT the product for you.</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy/curly hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>The price is worth having beautiful soft hair.</li>
            <li>The product itself works fine.</li>
            <li>It kept me awake the first night I used it because the smell was amazing, but when I woke up my hair was silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it works fine if you don&#x27;t mind the smell.</li>
            <li>Smells super!</li>
            <li>I love this product, keeps my hair soft and and amazing.</li>
            <li>It did make a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but not crazy about this smell...  </li>
            <li>Could be my imagination, but I&#x27;m going to stock up while it is available.</li>
            <li>The Wen brand is great but this scent is gross.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell great  </li>
            <li>I had only used it twice before going to my hairdresser and she said my hair felt great and to keep using whatever I was using.</li>
            <li>Just recently had a bundle of joy</li>
            <li>Rolling around in the mud would be free.</li>
            <li>It smelled like a cheap holiday candle from the dollar store.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>Good quality as this brand always is, leaves the hair so soft and shiny</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair nice and soft. :-)</li>
            <li>The smell was so strong and sickly sweet</li>
            <li>I discontinued it, and that&#x27;s the fine prints after receiving your special promo.</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for the best hair product and this is it.</li>
            <li>I guess my hair isn&#x27;t special enough to start with - the girls in the WEN ads already have great hair.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely my new favorite!</li>
            <li>I love Wen products in general, they are so great for my hair and high quality.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>and I know there are copy cats but the original Wen cannot be beat.</li>
            <li>LOVE Wen products - Have tried several of the shampoos &amp; Fall Apple Spice is my favorite!</li>
            <li>It smelled of rich vanilla frosting and cinnamon.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to see an apple scent</li>
            <li>Great &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34;  I used it years ago when I didn&#x27;t have long hair.  </li>
            <li>Try WEN - but stick with the original scents.</li>
            <li>As far as conditioning, like many of the other flavors, it leaves my hair feeling great!!!</li>
            <li>and it wouldnt clean out the chlorine from my hair.</li>
            <li>I thought squeaky clean was the way to go....NOT.</li>
            <li>But your hair will be SQUEAKY clean.</li>
            <li>Now, the good thing is, after your wash, you can use a tiny amount as a leave-in conditioner and it will smell and look fabulous.</li>
            <li>My hair seems to stay clean longer when I use the seasonal products.  </li>
            <li>WEN is brilliant and I actually like this scent (though it is really strong!), but that this flavor is sort of a brown/off red in color.</li>
            <li>My wife is very meticulous about her hair and this is a very important part of her routine.</li>
            <li>And b/c of that it  stripped the color right out of my hair!</li>
            <li>The product itself is good, but I will definitely not buy this scent again.</li>
            <li>It is more of a spice scent, I don&#x27;t really smell any apple.</li>
            <li>This formula is a bit thicker than the others and a bit weightier so it probably best for thick, curly hair, not think stringy hair.  </li>
            <li>my hair is in such good condition, I know it is exspencif  </li>
            <li>They suggest way too much for most people</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cloyingly sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>But it is gentle on the hair so in many cases I do use mine</li>
            <li>Smelt like a sweet candle.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try Wen to see if it was really any better than its competition.  </li>
            <li>It smells like really sweet custard or egg nog with a hint of cinnamon.</li>
            <li>,it is more like a Yankee candle or a spiced backed good  with nutmeg and cinnamon mixed together but not at all like straight cinnamon.</li>
            <li>I bought this instead of the sweet almond mint.  </li>
            <li>Gotten compliments on how good my hair looks overall.</li>
            <li>Horribly sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this one, it reminds me of a really sweet perfumed candle.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser says she wants to eat my hair:)</li>
            <li>My color seems to stay true longer (not turn brassy).  </li>
            <li>Not so much like apple spice, but more like maple syrup.  </li>
            <li>I love WEN hair care products , they make my hair soft and easy to style....</li>
            <li>I first used it because the smell is so nauseatingly strong.</li>
            <li>Works great like other Wen products,</li>
            <li>I mainly use the seasonal scents, and the Vanilla mint is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Every time my wife uses it I get a tremendous headache.  </li>
            <li>I love the WEN products but just dont like this smell in particular.  </li>
            <li>Kind of like cheap potpourri only lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair super greasy.</li>
            <li>I used it daily at first, then I loved it so much I bought more on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>My favorite so far!!</li>
            <li>If you enjoy the smell of potpourri mixed with mild apple and a very strong spiced beeswax vanilla candle ...</li>
            <li>I love this new seasonal offering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier to apply, I use much less, and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong but I really like it</li>
            <li>Please be aware that while advertised as a shampoo and conditioner all in one, this product DOES NOT LATHER!</li>
            <li>It thickens your hair and makes it grow twice as fast!!</li>
            <li>Should have apple first then a hint of maple- now that would be a hit!</li>
            <li>Much better than my old shampoo!</li>
            <li>Too funny!</li>
            <li>WEN&#x27;s products are very nice, but this scent is a thumbs down.</li>
            <li>I love wen products, my favorite is lavender because it seems to work so well for my dry, colored hair.</li>
            <li>The best way to describe this scent is to say that it smells like a Yankee Candle store in the fall, when they have every single fall scent going at the same time.</li>
            <li>When my hair changed drastically at age 45 from medium texture to fine and thinning, after much research, lack of moisture was a culprit, so I tried this product.</li>
            <li>WEN has left my hair smooth, supple, shiny and extraordinary manageable more so than any of the others.</li>
            <li>hair looks great, everyday washing at 8 pumps per shower</li>
            <li>wen is amazing, obviously.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair very silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>My 6-year-old son, who loves nothing more than snuggling cut me off early the night</li>
            <li>Loved the scent but it smelled so much like french toast</li>
            <li>All it did was make it smell good and easier to brush while wet.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance  by far</li>
            <li>I also think the Kids&#x27; conditioner works even better than the adult formula.</li>
            <li>Should have read the reviews b/c I was hoping for a fresh Apple scent like Bath &amp; Body Words lotion</li>
            <li>As far as how my hair did with it, I guess ok.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel....soft and hydrated but not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>My favorite WEN so far, I purchased it since it is one of the newer in his line</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better for all of us to use natural fragrances.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered a kit off of the Wen site, lavender this time, because at $40, I think it&#x27;ll be well worth it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it😊</li>
            <li>Wen is pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>I liked last year&#x27;s seasonal scent better--Pumpkin Spice.</li>
            <li>I bet I will get probably a month&#x27;s worth of shampoos</li>
            <li>This cleanser definitely smells spicy...and not the apple pie kind.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would try it again; I liked it back then and still do.  </li>
            <li>I typically love Wen products, however, this particular one has a very high concentration of alcohol.</li>
            <li>I do use a high-end lathering shampoo about once a month which may not be necessary, but like most people, I associate lather with squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>but it has that fresh, sweet deliciousness of so many treats that apples make an appearance in or are the star of, especially at this time of year.</li>
            <li>, the scent is not overpowering as of right now.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought right from the Chaz website and from QVC.</li>
            <li>The scent is reminiscent of an Autumn Spice Cake, a warm Apple Crisp, etc., it may not be apple per se</li>
            <li>My 18 yr old daughter even commented on my hair as being so bouncy and lovely the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>however the maple syrup scent  is very strong and stays with you even the next day.  </li>
            <li>Anyone with sinus problems or issues with very strong smells should try a different version.</li>
            <li>I do so love this new smell, very fall like.</li>
            <li>This is after using a very large amount of shampoo one day to try to get the scent out.</li>
            <li>the smell is amazing and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and lingers on your hair all day long.</li>
            <li>When I first opened it I was put off by the smell, but after it reached room temperature from shipment, it seemed to calm a bit.</li>
            <li>That said, I use it once or twice a week as a break from my other shampoo with pretty good results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice after the hair is dry, but wet in the shower, it is just too strong and reminds me more of a Glade air freshener than a shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I am down to about 2 or 3 pumps per section and it does really good in my hair.</li>
            <li>I use it year round, as do my girls, and CONSTANTLY get compliments from people about how wonderful our hair smells!!!</li>
            <li>I even tried this on my 1yr old and her hair is so soft and nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that not only works well, but smells great and actually lasts.  </li>
            <li>the conditioning, cleansing, does not dry out hair, love the scent.</li>
            <li>I was excited to see this new scent come out and ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li>I will try other scents when this is gone because I am very pleased with how my hair feels.</li>
            <li>The seller was great, transaction quick and easy, so not a single complaint there.</li>
            <li>I know many women who like vanilla, pumpkin, and other fruit and food scents, but I prefer fresh, clean and some herbals.  </li>
            <li>It is very much like a cream rinse.</li>
            <li>In my opinion it is hands down the best cleanser for dry, curly, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>Been happy with all the other varieties that I have purchased so far, and my hair color does not seem faded at all.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong, spice scented candle like smell that lingers long after you cleanse your hair.</li>
            <li>The only negative mark is the scent - I&#x27;ve tried three different ones and while they are all wonderful, they are VERY strong.</li>
            <li>If youre a fan of Gold Canyon Candles, it smells exactly like their Farmhouse Cider candle.</li>
            <li>Will never stop using Wen love all the different smells</li>
            <li>I hoped this would be better, but I personally didn&#x27;t like the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li>It really does smell lake fall!</li>
            <li>I really like it a lot!</li>
            <li>(Makes the bottle last longer too:) )  </li>
            <li>Those two seem to work exactly the same, but this one seems to give me a bit more bounce and shine.  </li>
            <li>I kept looking at it and thinking it&#x27;s really pretty.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several WEN Cleansing Conditioners, and this is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I have really frizzy hair!  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews about the scent before buying it, so I was aware of the controversy.  </li>
            <li>When I first opened the bottle, I thought &amp;#34;Oh, delicious!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I love what Wen does for my hair but don&#x27;t like any of the regular scents.</li>
            <li>Kept my color longer, leaves hair smooth, soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what Chaz says it does</li>
            <li>and I have different textures though mostly 4c.</li>
            <li>The moment I opened the bottle, it reminded me of fall candles, baking, crisp air and leaves -</li>
            <li>My second washing was better.</li>
            <li>I used more product and left it on longer.</li>
            <li>Yes, Wen is pricy, but, I can see already that it will be replacing many of my products that I use daily.</li>
            <li>But overall, I love its&#x27; creamy texture &amp;</li>
            <li>Left my hair greasy and the smell was overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>First of all, the pump was defective.</li>
            <li>I have used this for several weeks now and I am pleased with how this product works.</li>
            <li>first time I used it a friend of mine came over and asked what was that smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am going to try to purchase more of this same fragrance.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like an air freshener from a truck stop bathroom.</li>
            <li>I am not totally convienced this is an authentic product by wen.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great but sucks.</li>
            <li>However, the scent of this one just is just too much!</li>
            <li>My hair was SO greasy immediately after the first wash that it looked like I had Vaseline in it.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more and hope to see more New scents in the near future</li>
            <li>If you like Wen they have many other scents that are nice, especially the pumpkin one.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the bamboo green tea, that one smells really fresh and clean</li>
            <li>This particular scent, however, was very overpowering and sweet.</li>
            <li>It leave the hair so clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>It got my hair really clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>It met all my expectations - love the smell - definitely reminds me of Fall and getting ready for the holidays.  </li>
            <li>This is a true apple scent and is less overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I tried pretty much all wen conditioners,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>More like a strange maple syrup aroma.</li>
            <li>For some reason this one is way too strong on the smell and feels that it doesn&#x27;t clean my hair as well as other flavors.</li>
            <li>Make hair feel full, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>so my hair has started to look faded, but I noticed after washing with this a few times my hair has a nice rich color again and is really soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a spiced apple, but too strong of a spice scent.  </li>
            <li>i would certainly buy again,adds body and shine</li>
            <li>This smells like pure maple syrup.</li>
            <li>Worked nicely after the first 2 washes, after that my hair was left sooooo greasy and gross.</li>
            <li>It really does leave your hair super soft.  </li>
            <li>Bought as gift for my two daughters with long natural red hair, different type hair but worked very will for both,arrived in excellent condition and prompted delivery</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for mixed girl hair (curly and fine).</li>
            <li>And if you have less hair, obviously you would get a lot more, maybe twice as many, idk.</li>
            <li>and WEN has made such a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the smell,  I really like wen though</li>
            <li>works well like all wen but the smell is a bit much..</li>
            <li>I much prefer herbal essence</li>
            <li>I tried, i really tried to make this product work.</li>
            <li>It tells u to use so much.</li>
            <li>Wen did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>having to buy the whole kit.</li>
            <li>And it you feel you really must try it for yourself, buy from Amazon so you don&#x27;t get locked into the auto-refill jam at the Wen website.  </li>
            <li>I really like this scent.  </li>
            <li>Chaz really missed the mark on this one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping time was reasonable for this product.</li>
            <li>This is too much for me.</li>
            <li>REALLY</li>
            <li>, REALLY well, rubbing the scalp with your finger tips.</li>
            <li>Not only did I enjoy this one</li>
            <li>everyone wants to know what it is.  </li>
            <li>It is very overpowering.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see any real difference in it.  </li>
            <li>She really didn&#x27;t know alot about Wen</li>
            <li>Very fall.</li>
            <li>It really, really does work.  </li>
            <li>I used to get my monthly delivery, but it was just too much products they send you .&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is way too much for me.</li>
            <li>it smells as much like apple as an apple fritter...</li>
            <li>the whole scent is apple fritter dipped in a soy chai latte...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit much, like huffing a vanilla/brown sugar yankee candle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It reminds me too much of a Yankee Candle---the smell has some sort of after scent that just turns my stomach.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a light platinum blonde</li>
            <li>Reading these reviews and seeing the label, Chaz warns if products are not purchased from his official website, salon or QVC there is no guarantee it is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Very disapponted with this WEN product.....</li>
            <li>I really like this scent.</li>
            <li>it was very nutty.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t really like the smell.  </li>
            <li>I have used other scents and everything was fine!</li>
            <li>I love wen and the reason I didn&#x27;t give this one 5 stars is because it has a very strong spiced smell which I don&#x27;t mind and its not strong once your hair is dry.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended the product to me, and I was glad that I took her advice of washing twice--the first time with half the recommended amount, and then repeat.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and concentrated formula goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair a bit on the fine side</li>
            <li>Now Im using it every other day and my hair has never looked better...</li>
            <li>Love the other wen scents.</li>
            <li>My other seasonal favorite is the coconut smell for summer.</li>
            <li>I love WEN products, but this one could put you in a sugar coma!  </li>
            <li>The scent as other reviewers have said, is pretty strong in the shower.</li>
            <li>The smell is too strong and it sticks with you all day long!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t give this 5 stars because I am still not sure how great Wen is, compared to regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>If I only use the Wen without shampooing, it leaves my hair not feeling quite as clean.</li>
            <li>The scent, first off, is akin to a reallllly great, expensive candle from Yankee or some Scentsy wax melts.</li>
            <li>I am a 35ish year old who stills wants to smell and look pretty, not remind someone of their grandma.</li>
            <li>More for people with dry hair, curly hair,  not for straight hair that is already soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>This does happen with other Wen conditioners (specifically the mango coconut), but this particular scent is more overwhelming than any other Wen scent I have encountered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried more pumps, less pumps, washing once, twice, leave-in the whole bit.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with the WEN products, and the results that I found were voluminous, soft hair with a festive harvest scent.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work as well as the traditional sweet almond version.  </li>
            <li>This one is my favorite, hands down.  </li>
            <li>I usually like apple scented hair products, but you better be ready to smell like a holiday candle!</li>
            <li>This particular product was discounted, which made it easier to get used to the fragrance.</li>
            <li>this particular one.</li>
            <li>I threw it away and ordered the Ginger Pumpkin, so I could celebrate Fall with a decent aroma.</li>
            <li>It is, essentially, a weak cleanser, so for many of us (me included), our hair will not feel as clean as we&#x27;re used to.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this company that charges so much for its products can&#x27;t get something as basic as fragrance right.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If you have curly or unmanageable hair - I highly recommend you try Wen.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend Wen products.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it,&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It really helps the hair from growing back quickly and leaves my skin really soft.</li>
            <li>Causes my wife to get headaches afterwards due to the strong smell.</li>
            <li>i have fine hair and even if i rinse it for 5 minutes straight and feel like i have it all out it still weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li>:  ) I would like any other scent (almond, pomegranet, orange blossom, fig, cucumber, etc, ) instead of this!!</li>
            <li>One thing I do recommend for others is that you do not need near as much as Wen recommends.</li>
            <li>It has left my hair in better condition than it has been in a long time.</li>
            <li>There was no apple scent, but it was like being up close and personal with a fresh cinnamon bun.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first as I&#x27;ve never had good luck with products claiming to &amp;#34;tame the frizz&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>My hair is normal and looked greasy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>there is a product that is pretty much the same as this one called a &amp;#34;cowash&amp;#34; sold here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I think the smell is fine with this one and works like all other WEN products.</li>
            <li>She takes the extra time to wash and blow dry my hair just so she can smell it and fill the shop with this lovely scent.  </li>
            <li>The initial smell is not exactly what I expected, but the conditioning effect is great.</li>
            <li>I love Wen products , however this one has a very odd scent ...</li>
            <li>It is strong smelling from the bottle, but tames down on your hair.</li>
            <li>I have used sulfur free shampoos from Carol&#x27;s Daughter and other hair care lines.</li>
            <li>Wanted to try the new fall sent</li>
            <li>and I can officially say I have new hair growth.</li>
            <li>I said it was my new shampoo</li>
            <li>Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li>Decided to try a new fragrance with the Fall Apple Spice scent.</li>
            <li>I live everything about this product....</li>
            <li>I can now wash my naturally curly hair every other day, instead of daily, and it is nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft and no tangles when I took the towel off.  </li>
            <li>It is heavy on the Carmel (so, very sweet) then spice, with a hint of Apple.</li>
            <li>I can understand why some people might not like this scent, as it is very sweet and not light and breezy.  </li>
            <li>This sounds way harsh, but it is very true.</li>
            <li>I usually use Redkin products, but ordered more Wen</li>
            <li>but it also leaves your hair incredibly soft!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think this product is for my hair type which is fine, gray and slightly frizzy.</li>
            <li>Not actually sure this is 100% authentic since I&#x27;ve never had this problem before.</li>
            <li>I went for it despite other reviews because I love keeping with the seasons, but this makes my hair smell like one big yankee candle.</li>
            <li>I have lots of fine hair, pretty thick hair.</li>
            <li>For such a lovely, healthy hair product, I would like to see natural oils used for scent instead of fake fragrance/parfum.  </li>
            <li>I liked the other \\&quot;seasonal\\&quot; scents, especially winter vanilla mint, but this one needs to go away and never come back!</li>
            <li>There are mixed reviews about the scent, and I too was wishing it was more apple and less spice...</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to fragrances, stay far, far away!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Wen Cleansing Conditioner works wonders for fine, dried out hair.  </li>
            <li>Although this seasonal Wen cleansing conditioner received some bad reviews I found it to be a very good performer.  </li>
            <li>If it had only remained like the first week, but after that, my hair went limp, not bouncy and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Love the scent,but did not like that it made my hair look dull and flat,so I would not buy it again</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to earlier reviews saying how bad this smelled, but I liked the Ginger Pumpkin and decided to give this one a try.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product for my naturally curly, coarse, tangle-prone hair.</li>
            <li>if you prefer the lavender or the tea tree oil, steer clear of this sugar-n-spice bomb.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this one, and it seems to last all day.  </li>
            <li>I washed my hair 3 days ago and I can still smell the spicy apple scent, and my hair is so soft.</li>
            <li>It made my hair far too greasy after a while.</li>
            <li>As much as I paid for this bottle I should have a pump that works, so 3 stars because of this one big frustration.</li>
            <li>My hair is shoulder length, fyi, I don&#x27;t use as much as the directions say making product last longer.  </li>
            <li>Try it, you might be surprised.</li>
            <li>Make my hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li>I bought this because fall apple is one of my favorite scents, but this is no nice smelling candle or air freshner.</li>
            <li>I bleach my hair and it keeps it soft.</li>
            <li>I still have split ends but they are soft not brittle.</li>
            <li>Plus complete strangers will tell me they can smell my hair upon passing by and they say it smells like a Yankee Candle.</li>
            <li>So much so that I could not actually use it at all.</li>
            <li>I think it is one of the stronger scents, and lingers on my hair for at least a day or more after use.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and this products makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair soft</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shinny, manageable, and your scalp always feels hydrated.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell of natural ingredients either, but rather of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I think the smell of it is too intense, it does work the same though.</li>
            <li>maybe i have sensitive skin?</li>
            <li>It is like walking into Lush and they featured spiced products.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s definitely a candy coating to the whole thing that seems detached somehow, like they wanted to sweeten the fragrance, but couldn&#x27;t quite get it to blend.</li>
            <li>and when i went to go get a hsir cut the lady said wow soft hair.</li>
            <li>It will be squeaky and shiny and soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair is sooo soft and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Pay a few bucks more and get a different scent</li>
            <li>I actually only used this in my hair with no styling products a few times, something I have never been able to do.</li>
            <li>I love WEN Cleansing Condition, but this particular one, Fall Apple Spice, just smells musky or moldy which is not a pleasant fragrance for your hair.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy the 16 oz because it was only a few bucks more.</li>
            <li>I have super long rather coarse hair and with Wen and straightener</li>
            <li>I also bought the Pantene cleansing conditioner and alternate it with the Wen to cut down on the cost, works amazing, won&#x27;t go back to regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>I so wanted to love this...its way to heavy after the first few uses.</li>
            <li>but the scent is a very heavy and strong cinnamon spice.</li>
            <li>Seriously the cheapest shampoos have done better than this.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair soft and smooth and less washing necessary!</li>
            <li>I may go back and order a bottle of Lavender but do not recommend this particular scent / formula.</li>
            <li>I just used this for the first time (being a Wen user for the last 6 months), and while the results are standard, the smell is ...</li>
            <li>and i felt out of all the WEN products i&#x27;ve tried so far (sweet almond, pomegranate, mint vanilla, green tea gardenia, and mango coconut)</li>
            <li>A little to sweet smelling</li>
            <li>Smell was a little bit too sweet.</li>
            <li>And if the high alcohol content &amp; color stripping isn&#x27;t enough to keep you away from the Fall Apple scent maybe</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait for the weather to cool down to use the Apple Spice!</li>
            <li>It evokes the scent of a crisp fall evening spent around the fire swapping stories and drinking cider.</li>
            <li>When i first get out of the shower and my hair is wet</li>
            <li>actual conditioning shampoo worked just as well as it normally does.</li>
            <li>Have liked other Wen products in the past.</li>
            <li>Also it tends to weigh my hair down a bit more than other Wen products.</li>
            <li>(Right now I&#x27;m a big Winter Mint fan, hope they bring that back next season!)&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>For the love of GOD this stuff STINKS to high heaven!!!  </li>
            <li>This would probably work very well for those with dry or chemically treated hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly, dry and overprocessed hair because I color it</li>
            <li>But if you don&#x27;t wash your hair daily the scent really is lessened on the second day.</li>
            <li>..have to wait and see how it continues to work, but so far I like it, love the smell on your hair, it leaves behind.</li>
            <li>Just use regular conditioner the same way u would use wen and it does the same exact thing.</li>
            <li>There is no other conditioner on the market that makes my hair feel the way Wen does.</li>
            <li>I use it now once a month more as a deep conditioner so that it&#x27;s not a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li>Does not go away completely, but if you rinse it out really well and follow with other hair products you may use, you probably won&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li>I like the clean scent of bamboo green tree!</li>
            <li>I tried several other cleansing conditioners with marginal success</li>
            <li>The product left my hair feeling and looking very limp and the smell was extremely strong - to the point it made me nauseous.  </li>
            <li>Ive been a WEN user for 4 years, and feel very fortunate to have found a high quality product that actually helps my long, coarse, thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>left my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft using wen then regular shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>With the winter dryness, the extra moisturizing helps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to use too much as a leave in conditioner can make hair oily.</li>
            <li>(kissing me or is standing close enough that his nose is near my hair) to smell the Spice scent.</li>
            <li>When I perspire, the smell is 10 times worse or more.</li>
            <li>I ended up using just a little bit, and rinsing it right off and not leaving it set on my hair while I showered like the instructions suggested.</li>
            <li>From what I am reading in other review some of the other WEN scents are less overpowering, so it is likely I will purchase one of those, because I LOVE how the product works for my hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m VERY disappointed as most of the wen products are amazing.</li>
            <li>While I did not have an issue with the actual product as far as using it and product performance, I want to warn others who consider buying this &amp;#34;seasonal&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;limited&amp;#34; scent that they will walk around with their head stinking like last year&#x27;s holiday candle.</li>
            <li>I had to experiment with it a bit, as I have very thin, fine hair, and it was too much conditioning for my hair to follow the instructions that came with it.</li>
            <li>I love Wen products usually as they do make my hair stronger and less prone to break.  </li>
            <li>I started out using the like 20 pumps that it calls for on my long hair but quickly stopped becase it was just a waste of the product.</li>
            <li>Also this scent was a little odd and strong.  </li>
            <li>I have seen the commercials for this product for literally years and never thought much about it other than it couldn&#x27;t possibly work.</li>
            <li>I am an African American female with short natural hair that is curly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it on the first use, and the second time it smelled even worse than the first, if that was possible.  </li>
            <li>I love WEN and the other scents are good, but this one is disgusting!!</li>
            <li>Although it felt soft, it appeared dry.</li>
            <li>for the first few times, I shampooed with regular shampoo, then shampooed with WEN.  </li>
            <li>When I use other shampoos, my hair looks shiny and normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the other Wen products and I feel my hair did better on those, but that weird herbal chemical smell of this particular shampoo would linger in my hair for days.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t usually write reviews on how things smell because I&#x27;m more interested in how the product works for my hair, but this was pretty bad.</li>
            <li>Super bad smell, stay with you for days, even if you wash your hair again with different product.&lt;br /&gt;Like cheap candle.</li>
            <li>Love Wen products, but the smell of this one is not only sickening, but overwhelmingly strong.  </li>
            <li>I even tried to give my brand new bottle to two other WEN fans, and both declined.</li>
            <li>now, it&#x27;s going to a friend who is very much into Caramel Apples, so will not be wasted!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a little stronger than most and the tint is a pinkish shade, however, I do not find either of these facets to be negative in any way.  </li>

            <li> Love all wen products this smells great !</li>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance and consistently good product from WEN by Chaz Dean.</li>
            <li> Wen is really great for my hair, I love it a lot!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is good that a stranger standing almost 2 feet away</li>
            <li> and I guess wavy but not in a good way.</li>
            <li> This product is a good product.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and the fragrance seems to stay in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what hair type is ideal for this, but it sure isn&#x27;t fine.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Also, you need to use a lot of product for each use, which it about a bottle a month, which of course makes it fairly expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel and look good.</li>
            <li> It smells like a spicy baked good.</li>
            <li> I have used WEN for quite some time and always have had good luck with it.  </li>
            <li> but is good for my hair</li>
            <li> I use all Wen products and unlike some posters, which are entitled to their opinion, I loved this scent.  </li>
            <li> I tried a family members Lavender WEN and absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li> shampoo or conditioner, but its damn good.</li>
            <li> However, the Fall Apple Spice just did not smell good to me.</li>
            <li> To be fair this shampoo does not smell like vomit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my husband LOVED the scent</li>
            <li> this fall apple by chaz dean smells so good</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged, but with wen it looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> So for me, the scent is amazing and it leaves your hair amazing.</li>
            <li> I got amazing compliments on how I smelled.  </li>
            <li> The scent is amazing</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing.  </li>
            <li> OMG, it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very spicy heady fragrance yet smells wonderful!!</li>
            <li> A nice smell, but I don&#x27;t want to wear it.</li>
            <li> I really relish the wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like caramel.</li>
            <li> Based on those results I decided to purchase my own bottle of WEN.  </li>
            <li> I&#x60;m loving this reaction from men</li>
            <li> Thanks for another great scent!</li>
            <li> Figured if she liked it</li>
            <li> I am absolutely thrilled with the way my hair feels after using this product.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice to try it without the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Nice for fall.</li>
            <li> I have to say that the smell is nice....</li>
            <li> Although this cleansing conditioner helped my hair to look and feel nice...</li>
            <li> I tried this product because the price was GREAT for a 16oz bottle, but now that I have it, Im LOVE it and will def order more.  </li>
            <li> Have already loved WEN cleansing conditioner, but I just love the smell of this one.</li>
            <li> After using it, my husband complimented me on how nice my hair smelled.</li>
            <li> Was not for me but works nice.</li>
            <li> My hair is much softer and smells awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love!!</li>
            <li> If you use it correctly it makes your hair feel light and silky smooth!!!</li>
            <li> These prices seem too good to be true!</li>
            <li> can smell your hair, but it nice that they liked the smell :)</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick and they made the package with a happy face.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell very strongly of apple</li>
            <li> It smells very strong before you shampoo</li>
            <li> it smells like a Yankee candle and it has a very strong maple smell to it.</li>
            <li> I have curly wavy hair that gets frizzy very easily.  </li>
            <li> so I was so surprised when I got not one or two but dozens of comments that my hair smelled wonderful - sometimes even strangers in the line at the store.  </li>
            <li> The colors blend nicely and there are many colors in this label.  </li>
            <li> I love the Wen conditioner, the Fall Apple Spice has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> I love wen and it works amazing</li>
            <li> Love the smell of the apple spice,it&#x27;s a nice change.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and manageable while smelling great!</li>
            <li> Scenario: most effective shampoo on the market has critics raving.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about this fragrance, but still a great hair product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like apples but more of a warm spice.</li>
            <li> Everything Chaz says about his products is 100% true!!  </li>
            <li> that is how strong the smell is YUCK!  </li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, and only after one use I had two comments about my hair being shiny and looking healthy!</li>
            <li> Love, Love, love Wen!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the way it makes your hair feel!</li>
            <li> Smell was really strong!</li>
            <li> I love the smell, kind of like Dutch Apple Pie,  and my hair feels really healthy.  </li>
            <li> Real clean smelling.  : )</li>
            <li> Smells great, but made hair very greasy feeling!  </li>
            <li> and it worked just fine!</li>
            <li> Return was very smooth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even try this on my hair before returning it, the fragrance is nice but WAY too strong.</li>
            <li> Scent is nice but too strong.</li>
            <li> I do notice my hair seems healthier most of the time, but I began using Wen in the summer.  </li>
            <li> I love Wen</li>
            <li> Used it only for a month after noticing remarkable hair loss!!!</li>
            <li> Love the products, but wasn&#x27;t too keen on the scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered anyway.</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s more like a mulled cider,</li>
            <li> I love Wen, but this scent is NOT for me.  </li>
            <li> like most of them, but this one I won&#x27;t use again.</li>
            <li> Same wonderful cleansing conditioner (could never use anything else on these curls!),</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser</li>
            <li> Love how this smells and makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> Love the smell too.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> I am really enjoying the Fall Apple Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I love all the WEN products I have used over the years.</li>
            <li> This scent was a bit overwhelming.</li>
            <li> and I just love it.  </li>
            <li> No smell of apples, more like cookie dough and pumpkin.</li>
            <li> but I LOVE this cleanser.</li>
            <li> But this Fall Apple Spice lingers on and I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> I love wen.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent is the six thirteen</li>
            <li> This scent is ok.</li>
            <li> I love the product it self.  </li>
            <li> The Fall Apple Spice scent was too overwhelming for me.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE the scent of this.  </li>

            <li> I love the Wen Conditioning Cleansers.</li>
            <li> I think my favorite is still the Ginger Pumpkin Spice.</li>
            <li> This scent smells more like cinnamon than fruity (matter of fact it doesnt smell fruity at all)  </li>
            <li> and i love it.  </li>
            <li> The scent was a bit overwhelming for me in the shower.</li>

            <li> Ok... the scent.  </li>
            <li> Seemed like all the delicious vanilla scent evaporated, and I was just left with the spice.  </li>
            <li> but it was ok</li>
            <li> The seasonal scents are much better.</li>
            <li> WInter Vanilla MInt was my all time favorite</li>

            <li> That was fabulous !</li>
            <li> Love this &amp;#34;non-shampoo&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> but it sure helped out my hair.</li>

            <li> have colored my hair for many year and a lot of time i have to strip my hair before placing the color(blues, greens and reds)</li>
            <li> This smells like your favorite fall candle.</li>
            <li> I love this smell for the fall/winter.</li>
            <li> I am confident with buying any Wen product that its going to nourish my hair and leave it healthy.</li>
            <li> Love this one for sure!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love Wen hair products.</li>
            <li> My hair is healthy, shinny</li>

            <li> love the smell, you&#x27;ll like it if you like yankee candle apple spice/fall smell, etc</li>
            <li> and you want to level up on the omgiwant2eaturhairNAHW, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>

            <li> Gotta love wen products</li>
            <li> If you like Yankee Candles then you will probably love this.  </li>
            <li> I figured it would have a more apple/fruity smell to it, but thats not the case at all.</li>
            <li> Tried it one more time today and decided to return it.  </li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> I doubt that I&#x27;ll buy any more.</li>
            <li> You will love it.</li>
            <li> My young-adult daughters love it.</li>

            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> sure.</li>
            <li> I love the WEN hair product line.  </li>
            <li> glad WEN doesnt compromise quality to make the product smell like comfort food.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this formula.  </li>
            <li> I have had several people tell me my hair smells amazing, even on day 2!!!  </li>
            <li> Love the cinnamon smell.  </li>
            <li> Smelled more like chemicals, caramel and spice than apple.  </li>
            <li> My hair is always looking shiny and lovely.</li>
            <li> I love WEN.</li>
            <li> Lovvveeee the smell i love love love the smell of cinnamon</li>
            <li> I love all WEN products.</li>
            <li> Love Wen Cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the product Wen, but not a fan of this one.  </li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love the smell.  </li>
            <li> So getting more.  </li>
            <li> The Fall Apple Spice is my favorite</li>
            <li> Great Item, fast shipping ....</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many compliments.  </li>
            <li> Love this and</li>
            <li> I love wen.</li>
            <li> I love the summer mango coconut.  </li>
            <li> I normally purchase Wen from QVC but am happy that Amazon provides these formulas which are no longer in season.</li>
            <li> The Fall Apple Spice reminds me of a good hot cup of mulled caramel apple cider.</li>
            <li> That flavor was pretty good</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use it!  </li>
            <li> I like it, but am glad it doesn&#x27;t linger for hours because it is rather strong.</li>
            <li> Love it although smell is strong</li>
            <li> It is also thicker than the almond version, and I did like the smell after I washed my hair was not too strong, but still like the almond better.</li>
            <li> The scent itself is okay, its just way to strong.</li>
            <li> The scent is really overpowering and more baked good smelling than apple.</li>
            <li> The cream is very rich, easy to work into scalp and strands.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews that said that sent was overwhelming but if rinsed well it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> Next best are the Pumpkin Spice and Sweet Almond.  </li>
            <li> After using WEN my hair is much easier to straighten or wear with my waves, which look pretty good!  </li>
            <li> I usually do not write reveiws in products but this stuff smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li> this is a great product and I was not disappointed with the new scent.  </li>
            <li> I love it love the smell of cinnamon in this product ,so fresh smelling</li>
            <li> and I love how clean and shiny my hair is.  </li>
            <li> I wish it&#x27;s cheaper,and easy to buy somewhere&lt;</li>
            <li> Like a strong yankee candle in your hair</li>
            <li> I thought the smell was too strong</li>
            <li> the scent is a bit strong.  </li>
            <li> If you like a strong spicy apple scent then you will probably like this one.  </li>
            <li> If strong or lingering smells bother you, this one might not be for you.</li>
            <li> too strong.  </li>
            <li> My husband likes Wen, but the smell of the apple is too strong for him.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong, yes.</li>
            <li> It does not smell like apples but to me this does not have a strong cinnamon smell either</li>
            <li> I have also read reviews stating that it is strong smelling and does not go away, I do not have these problems.</li>
            <li> This scent is a bit strong, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> However, the strong smell lingered for the 24 hours, until I washed my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am not a fan of strong scents.  </li>
            <li> Some say this is too strong.............</li>
            <li> But the spice is so strong that you don&#x27;t smell any apple in it</li>
            <li> Wish all the Wen cleansers smelled as strong as this one.</li>
            <li> Great product as I have experienced with many different wen products try it you will like it like no other</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely more of a spice scent, but you can also smell sort of a sweet crust smell.</li>
            <li> Product was received  in a timely manner &amp; in good shape - Excellent Service - will definitely come back!</li>
            <li> Does not have a sweet apple smell, but more like a caramel spice smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet and lovely.</li>
            <li> It makes the Wen go through my hair better and makes combing my hair after the shower super easy.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best hair product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Sweet Almond and love it - tried this to mix it up and am not super impressed.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, this is NOT the product for you.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy/curly hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> The price is worth having beautiful soft hair.</li>
            <li> The product itself works fine.</li>
            <li> It kept me awake the first night I used it because the smell was amazing, but when I woke up my hair was silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it works fine if you don&#x27;t mind the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells super!</li>
            <li> I love this product, keeps my hair soft and and amazing.</li>
            <li> It did make a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but not crazy about this smell...  </li>
            <li> Could be my imagination, but I&#x27;m going to stock up while it is available.</li>
            <li> The Wen brand is great but this scent is gross.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell great  </li>
            <li> I had only used it twice before going to my hairdresser and she said my hair felt great and to keep using whatever I was using.</li>
            <li> Just recently had a bundle of joy</li>
            <li> Rolling around in the mud would be free.</li>
            <li> It smelled like a cheap holiday candle from the dollar store.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous.</li>
            <li> Good quality as this brand always is, leaves the hair so soft and shiny</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair nice and soft. :-)</li>
            <li> The smell was so strong and sickly sweet</li>
            <li> I discontinued it, and that&#x27;s the fine prints after receiving your special promo.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for the best hair product and this is it.</li>
            <li> I guess my hair isn&#x27;t special enough to start with - the girls in the WEN ads already have great hair.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely my new favorite!</li>
            <li> I love Wen products in general, they are so great for my hair and high quality.</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I know there are copy cats but the original Wen cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> LOVE Wen products - Have tried several of the shampoos &amp; Fall Apple Spice is my favorite!</li>
            <li> It smelled of rich vanilla frosting and cinnamon.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to see an apple scent</li>
            <li> Great &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34;  I used it years ago when I didn&#x27;t have long hair.  </li>
            <li> Try WEN - but stick with the original scents.</li>
            <li> As far as conditioning, like many of the other flavors, it leaves my hair feeling great!!!</li>
            <li> and it wouldnt clean out the chlorine from my hair.</li>
            <li> I thought squeaky clean was the way to go....NOT.</li>
            <li> But your hair will be SQUEAKY clean.</li>
            <li> Now, the good thing is, after your wash, you can use a tiny amount as a leave-in conditioner and it will smell and look fabulous.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to stay clean longer when I use the seasonal products.  </li>
            <li> WEN is brilliant and I actually like this scent (though it is really strong!), but that this flavor is sort of a brown/off red in color.</li>
            <li> My wife is very meticulous about her hair and this is a very important part of her routine.</li>
            <li> And b/c of that it  stripped the color right out of my hair!</li>
            <li> The product itself is good, but I will definitely not buy this scent again.</li>
            <li> It is more of a spice scent, I don&#x27;t really smell any apple.</li>
            <li> This formula is a bit thicker than the others and a bit weightier so it probably best for thick, curly hair, not think stringy hair.  </li>
            <li> my hair is in such good condition, I know it is exspencif  </li>
            <li> They suggest way too much for most people</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cloyingly sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> But it is gentle on the hair so in many cases I do use mine</li>
            <li> Smelt like a sweet candle.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try Wen to see if it was really any better than its competition.  </li>
            <li> It smells like really sweet custard or egg nog with a hint of cinnamon.</li>
            <li> ,it is more like a Yankee candle or a spiced backed good  with nutmeg and cinnamon mixed together but not at all like straight cinnamon.</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of the sweet almond mint.  </li>
            <li> Gotten compliments on how good my hair looks overall.</li>
            <li> Horribly sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this one, it reminds me of a really sweet perfumed candle.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser says she wants to eat my hair:)</li>
            <li> My color seems to stay true longer (not turn brassy).  </li>
            <li> Not so much like apple spice, but more like maple syrup.  </li>
            <li> I love WEN hair care products , they make my hair soft and easy to style....</li>
            <li> I first used it because the smell is so nauseatingly strong.</li>
            <li> Works great like other Wen products,</li>
            <li> I mainly use the seasonal scents, and the Vanilla mint is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Every time my wife uses it I get a tremendous headache.  </li>
            <li> I love the WEN products but just dont like this smell in particular.  </li>
            <li> Kind of like cheap potpourri only lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> Makes your hair super greasy.</li>
            <li> I used it daily at first, then I loved it so much I bought more on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> My favorite so far!!</li>
            <li> If you enjoy the smell of potpourri mixed with mild apple and a very strong spiced beeswax vanilla candle ...</li>
            <li> I love this new seasonal offering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to apply, I use much less, and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong but I really like it</li>
            <li> Please be aware that while advertised as a shampoo and conditioner all in one, this product DOES NOT LATHER!</li>
            <li> It thickens your hair and makes it grow twice as fast!!</li>
            <li> Should have apple first then a hint of maple- now that would be a hit!</li>
            <li> Much better than my old shampoo!</li>
            <li> Too funny!</li>
            <li> WEN&#x27;s products are very nice, but this scent is a thumbs down.</li>
            <li> I love wen products, my favorite is lavender because it seems to work so well for my dry, colored hair.</li>
            <li> The best way to describe this scent is to say that it smells like a Yankee Candle store in the fall, when they have every single fall scent going at the same time.</li>
            <li> When my hair changed drastically at age 45 from medium texture to fine and thinning, after much research, lack of moisture was a culprit, so I tried this product.</li>
            <li> WEN has left my hair smooth, supple, shiny and extraordinary manageable more so than any of the others.</li>
            <li> hair looks great, everyday washing at 8 pumps per shower</li>
            <li> wen is amazing, obviously.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair very silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> My 6-year-old son, who loves nothing more than snuggling cut me off early the night</li>
            <li> Loved the scent but it smelled so much like french toast</li>
            <li> All it did was make it smell good and easier to brush while wet.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance  by far</li>
            <li> I also think the Kids&#x27; conditioner works even better than the adult formula.</li>
            <li> Should have read the reviews b/c I was hoping for a fresh Apple scent like Bath &amp; Body Words lotion</li>
            <li> As far as how my hair did with it, I guess ok.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel....soft and hydrated but not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> My favorite WEN so far, I purchased it since it is one of the newer in his line</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better for all of us to use natural fragrances.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a kit off of the Wen site, lavender this time, because at $40, I think it&#x27;ll be well worth it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it😊</li>
            <li> Wen is pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I liked last year&#x27;s seasonal scent better--Pumpkin Spice.</li>
            <li> I bet I will get probably a month&#x27;s worth of shampoos</li>
            <li> This cleanser definitely smells spicy...and not the apple pie kind.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would try it again; I liked it back then and still do.  </li>
            <li> I typically love Wen products, however, this particular one has a very high concentration of alcohol.</li>
            <li> I do use a high-end lathering shampoo about once a month which may not be necessary, but like most people, I associate lather with squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> but it has that fresh, sweet deliciousness of so many treats that apples make an appearance in or are the star of, especially at this time of year.</li>
            <li> , the scent is not overpowering as of right now.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought right from the Chaz website and from QVC.</li>
            <li> The scent is reminiscent of an Autumn Spice Cake, a warm Apple Crisp, etc., it may not be apple per se</li>
            <li> My 18 yr old daughter even commented on my hair as being so bouncy and lovely the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> however the maple syrup scent  is very strong and stays with you even the next day.  </li>
            <li> Anyone with sinus problems or issues with very strong smells should try a different version.</li>
            <li> I do so love this new smell, very fall like.</li>
            <li> This is after using a very large amount of shampoo one day to try to get the scent out.</li>
            <li> the smell is amazing and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and lingers on your hair all day long.</li>
            <li> When I first opened it I was put off by the smell, but after it reached room temperature from shipment, it seemed to calm a bit.</li>
            <li> That said, I use it once or twice a week as a break from my other shampoo with pretty good results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice after the hair is dry, but wet in the shower, it is just too strong and reminds me more of a Glade air freshener than a shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I am down to about 2 or 3 pumps per section and it does really good in my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it year round, as do my girls, and CONSTANTLY get compliments from people about how wonderful our hair smells!!!</li>
            <li> I even tried this on my 1yr old and her hair is so soft and nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that not only works well, but smells great and actually lasts.  </li>
            <li> the conditioning, cleansing, does not dry out hair, love the scent.</li>
            <li> I was excited to see this new scent come out and ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li> I will try other scents when this is gone because I am very pleased with how my hair feels.</li>
            <li> The seller was great, transaction quick and easy, so not a single complaint there.</li>
            <li> I know many women who like vanilla, pumpkin, and other fruit and food scents, but I prefer fresh, clean and some herbals.  </li>
            <li> It is very much like a cream rinse.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it is hands down the best cleanser for dry, curly, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> Been happy with all the other varieties that I have purchased so far, and my hair color does not seem faded at all.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong, spice scented candle like smell that lingers long after you cleanse your hair.</li>
            <li> The only negative mark is the scent - I&#x27;ve tried three different ones and while they are all wonderful, they are VERY strong.</li>
            <li> If youre a fan of Gold Canyon Candles, it smells exactly like their Farmhouse Cider candle.</li>
            <li> Will never stop using Wen love all the different smells</li>
            <li> I hoped this would be better, but I personally didn&#x27;t like the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li> It really does smell lake fall!</li>
            <li> I really like it a lot!</li>
            <li> (Makes the bottle last longer too:) )  </li>
            <li> Those two seem to work exactly the same, but this one seems to give me a bit more bounce and shine.  </li>
            <li> I kept looking at it and thinking it&#x27;s really pretty.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several WEN Cleansing Conditioners, and this is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I have really frizzy hair!  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews about the scent before buying it, so I was aware of the controversy.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened the bottle, I thought &amp;#34;Oh, delicious!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I love what Wen does for my hair but don&#x27;t like any of the regular scents.</li>
            <li> Kept my color longer, leaves hair smooth, soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what Chaz says it does</li>
            <li> and I have different textures though mostly 4c.</li>
            <li> The moment I opened the bottle, it reminded me of fall candles, baking, crisp air and leaves -</li>
            <li> My second washing was better.</li>
            <li> I used more product and left it on longer.</li>
            <li> Yes, Wen is pricy, but, I can see already that it will be replacing many of my products that I use daily.</li>
            <li> But overall, I love its&#x27; creamy texture &amp;</li>
            <li> Left my hair greasy and the smell was overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> First of all, the pump was defective.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several weeks now and I am pleased with how this product works.</li>
            <li> first time I used it a friend of mine came over and asked what was that smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am going to try to purchase more of this same fragrance.</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like an air freshener from a truck stop bathroom.</li>
            <li> I am not totally convienced this is an authentic product by wen.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great but sucks.</li>
            <li> However, the scent of this one just is just too much!</li>
            <li> My hair was SO greasy immediately after the first wash that it looked like I had Vaseline in it.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more and hope to see more New scents in the near future</li>
            <li> If you like Wen they have many other scents that are nice, especially the pumpkin one.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the bamboo green tea, that one smells really fresh and clean</li>
            <li> This particular scent, however, was very overpowering and sweet.</li>
            <li> It leave the hair so clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> It got my hair really clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> It met all my expectations - love the smell - definitely reminds me of Fall and getting ready for the holidays.  </li>
            <li> This is a true apple scent and is less overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I tried pretty much all wen conditioners,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> More like a strange maple syrup aroma.</li>
            <li> For some reason this one is way too strong on the smell and feels that it doesn&#x27;t clean my hair as well as other flavors.</li>
            <li> Make hair feel full, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> so my hair has started to look faded, but I noticed after washing with this a few times my hair has a nice rich color again and is really soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a spiced apple, but too strong of a spice scent.  </li>
            <li> i would certainly buy again,adds body and shine</li>
            <li> This smells like pure maple syrup.</li>
            <li> Worked nicely after the first 2 washes, after that my hair was left sooooo greasy and gross.</li>
            <li> It really does leave your hair super soft.  </li>
            <li> Bought as gift for my two daughters with long natural red hair, different type hair but worked very will for both,arrived in excellent condition and prompted delivery</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for mixed girl hair (curly and fine).</li>
            <li> And if you have less hair, obviously you would get a lot more, maybe twice as many, idk.</li>
            <li> and WEN has made such a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell,  I really like wen though</li>
            <li> works well like all wen but the smell is a bit much..</li>
            <li> I much prefer herbal essence</li>
            <li> I tried, i really tried to make this product work.</li>
            <li> It tells u to use so much.</li>
            <li> Wen did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> having to buy the whole kit.</li>
            <li> And it you feel you really must try it for yourself, buy from Amazon so you don&#x27;t get locked into the auto-refill jam at the Wen website.  </li>
            <li> I really like this scent.  </li>
            <li> Chaz really missed the mark on this one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping time was reasonable for this product.</li>
            <li> This is too much for me.</li>
            <li> REALLY</li>
            <li> , REALLY well, rubbing the scalp with your finger tips.</li>
            <li> Not only did I enjoy this one</li>
            <li> everyone wants to know what it is.  </li>
            <li> It is very overpowering.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see any real difference in it.  </li>
            <li> She really didn&#x27;t know alot about Wen</li>
            <li> Very fall.</li>
            <li> It really, really does work.  </li>
            <li> I used to get my monthly delivery, but it was just too much products they send you .&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is way too much for me.</li>
            <li> it smells as much like apple as an apple fritter...</li>
            <li> the whole scent is apple fritter dipped in a soy chai latte...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit much, like huffing a vanilla/brown sugar yankee candle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It reminds me too much of a Yankee Candle---the smell has some sort of after scent that just turns my stomach.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a light platinum blonde</li>
            <li> Reading these reviews and seeing the label, Chaz warns if products are not purchased from his official website, salon or QVC there is no guarantee it is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Very disapponted with this WEN product.....</li>
            <li> I really like this scent.</li>
            <li> it was very nutty.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t really like the smell.  </li>
            <li> I have used other scents and everything was fine!</li>
            <li> I love wen and the reason I didn&#x27;t give this one 5 stars is because it has a very strong spiced smell which I don&#x27;t mind and its not strong once your hair is dry.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended the product to me, and I was glad that I took her advice of washing twice--the first time with half the recommended amount, and then repeat.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and concentrated formula goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair a bit on the fine side</li>
            <li> Now Im using it every other day and my hair has never looked better...</li>
            <li> Love the other wen scents.</li>
            <li> My other seasonal favorite is the coconut smell for summer.</li>
            <li> I love WEN products, but this one could put you in a sugar coma!  </li>
            <li> The scent as other reviewers have said, is pretty strong in the shower.</li>
            <li> The smell is too strong and it sticks with you all day long!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t give this 5 stars because I am still not sure how great Wen is, compared to regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> If I only use the Wen without shampooing, it leaves my hair not feeling quite as clean.</li>
            <li> The scent, first off, is akin to a reallllly great, expensive candle from Yankee or some Scentsy wax melts.</li>
            <li> I am a 35ish year old who stills wants to smell and look pretty, not remind someone of their grandma.</li>
            <li> More for people with dry hair, curly hair,  not for straight hair that is already soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This does happen with other Wen conditioners (specifically the mango coconut), but this particular scent is more overwhelming than any other Wen scent I have encountered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried more pumps, less pumps, washing once, twice, leave-in the whole bit.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with the WEN products, and the results that I found were voluminous, soft hair with a festive harvest scent.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as the traditional sweet almond version.  </li>
            <li> This one is my favorite, hands down.  </li>
            <li> I usually like apple scented hair products, but you better be ready to smell like a holiday candle!</li>
            <li> This particular product was discounted, which made it easier to get used to the fragrance.</li>
            <li> this particular one.</li>
            <li> I threw it away and ordered the Ginger Pumpkin, so I could celebrate Fall with a decent aroma.</li>
            <li> It is, essentially, a weak cleanser, so for many of us (me included), our hair will not feel as clean as we&#x27;re used to.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this company that charges so much for its products can&#x27;t get something as basic as fragrance right.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If you have curly or unmanageable hair - I highly recommend you try Wen.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend Wen products.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it,&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It really helps the hair from growing back quickly and leaves my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> Causes my wife to get headaches afterwards due to the strong smell.</li>
            <li> i have fine hair and even if i rinse it for 5 minutes straight and feel like i have it all out it still weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li> :  ) I would like any other scent (almond, pomegranet, orange blossom, fig, cucumber, etc, ) instead of this!!</li>
            <li> One thing I do recommend for others is that you do not need near as much as Wen recommends.</li>
            <li> It has left my hair in better condition than it has been in a long time.</li>
            <li> There was no apple scent, but it was like being up close and personal with a fresh cinnamon bun.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first as I&#x27;ve never had good luck with products claiming to &amp;#34;tame the frizz&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> My hair is normal and looked greasy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> there is a product that is pretty much the same as this one called a &amp;#34;cowash&amp;#34; sold here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I think the smell is fine with this one and works like all other WEN products.</li>
            <li> She takes the extra time to wash and blow dry my hair just so she can smell it and fill the shop with this lovely scent.  </li>
            <li> The initial smell is not exactly what I expected, but the conditioning effect is great.</li>
            <li> I love Wen products , however this one has a very odd scent ...</li>
            <li> It is strong smelling from the bottle, but tames down on your hair.</li>
            <li> I have used sulfur free shampoos from Carol&#x27;s Daughter and other hair care lines.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try the new fall sent</li>
            <li> and I can officially say I have new hair growth.</li>
            <li> I said it was my new shampoo</li>
            <li> Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li> Decided to try a new fragrance with the Fall Apple Spice scent.</li>
            <li> I live everything about this product....</li>
            <li> I can now wash my naturally curly hair every other day, instead of daily, and it is nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft and no tangles when I took the towel off.  </li>
            <li> It is heavy on the Carmel (so, very sweet) then spice, with a hint of Apple.</li>
            <li> I can understand why some people might not like this scent, as it is very sweet and not light and breezy.  </li>
            <li> This sounds way harsh, but it is very true.</li>
            <li> I usually use Redkin products, but ordered more Wen</li>
            <li> but it also leaves your hair incredibly soft!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think this product is for my hair type which is fine, gray and slightly frizzy.</li>
            <li> Not actually sure this is 100% authentic since I&#x27;ve never had this problem before.</li>
            <li> I went for it despite other reviews because I love keeping with the seasons, but this makes my hair smell like one big yankee candle.</li>
            <li> I have lots of fine hair, pretty thick hair.</li>
            <li> For such a lovely, healthy hair product, I would like to see natural oils used for scent instead of fake fragrance/parfum.  </li>
            <li> I liked the other \\&quot;seasonal\\&quot; scents, especially winter vanilla mint, but this one needs to go away and never come back!</li>
            <li> There are mixed reviews about the scent, and I too was wishing it was more apple and less spice...</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to fragrances, stay far, far away!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Wen Cleansing Conditioner works wonders for fine, dried out hair.  </li>
            <li> Although this seasonal Wen cleansing conditioner received some bad reviews I found it to be a very good performer.  </li>
            <li> If it had only remained like the first week, but after that, my hair went limp, not bouncy and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Love the scent,but did not like that it made my hair look dull and flat,so I would not buy it again</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to earlier reviews saying how bad this smelled, but I liked the Ginger Pumpkin and decided to give this one a try.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product for my naturally curly, coarse, tangle-prone hair.</li>
            <li> if you prefer the lavender or the tea tree oil, steer clear of this sugar-n-spice bomb.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this one, and it seems to last all day.  </li>
            <li> I washed my hair 3 days ago and I can still smell the spicy apple scent, and my hair is so soft.</li>
            <li> It made my hair far too greasy after a while.</li>
            <li> As much as I paid for this bottle I should have a pump that works, so 3 stars because of this one big frustration.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length, fyi, I don&#x27;t use as much as the directions say making product last longer.  </li>
            <li> Try it, you might be surprised.</li>
            <li> Make my hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li> I bought this because fall apple is one of my favorite scents, but this is no nice smelling candle or air freshner.</li>
            <li> I bleach my hair and it keeps it soft.</li>
            <li> I still have split ends but they are soft not brittle.</li>
            <li> Plus complete strangers will tell me they can smell my hair upon passing by and they say it smells like a Yankee Candle.</li>
            <li> So much so that I could not actually use it at all.</li>
            <li> I think it is one of the stronger scents, and lingers on my hair for at least a day or more after use.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and this products makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair soft</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shinny, manageable, and your scalp always feels hydrated.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell of natural ingredients either, but rather of chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I think the smell of it is too intense, it does work the same though.</li>
            <li> maybe i have sensitive skin?</li>
            <li> It is like walking into Lush and they featured spiced products.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s definitely a candy coating to the whole thing that seems detached somehow, like they wanted to sweeten the fragrance, but couldn&#x27;t quite get it to blend.</li>
            <li> and when i went to go get a hsir cut the lady said wow soft hair.</li>
            <li> It will be squeaky and shiny and soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair is sooo soft and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Pay a few bucks more and get a different scent</li>
            <li> I actually only used this in my hair with no styling products a few times, something I have never been able to do.</li>
            <li> I love WEN Cleansing Condition, but this particular one, Fall Apple Spice, just smells musky or moldy which is not a pleasant fragrance for your hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy the 16 oz because it was only a few bucks more.</li>
            <li> I have super long rather coarse hair and with Wen and straightener</li>
            <li> I also bought the Pantene cleansing conditioner and alternate it with the Wen to cut down on the cost, works amazing, won&#x27;t go back to regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> I so wanted to love this...its way to heavy after the first few uses.</li>
            <li> but the scent is a very heavy and strong cinnamon spice.</li>
            <li> Seriously the cheapest shampoos have done better than this.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair soft and smooth and less washing necessary!</li>
            <li> I may go back and order a bottle of Lavender but do not recommend this particular scent / formula.</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time (being a Wen user for the last 6 months), and while the results are standard, the smell is ...</li>
            <li> and i felt out of all the WEN products i&#x27;ve tried so far (sweet almond, pomegranate, mint vanilla, green tea gardenia, and mango coconut)</li>
            <li> A little to sweet smelling</li>
            <li> Smell was a little bit too sweet.</li>
            <li> And if the high alcohol content &amp; color stripping isn&#x27;t enough to keep you away from the Fall Apple scent maybe</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait for the weather to cool down to use the Apple Spice!</li>
            <li> It evokes the scent of a crisp fall evening spent around the fire swapping stories and drinking cider.</li>
            <li> When i first get out of the shower and my hair is wet</li>
            <li> actual conditioning shampoo worked just as well as it normally does.</li>
            <li> Have liked other Wen products in the past.</li>
            <li> Also it tends to weigh my hair down a bit more than other Wen products.</li>
            <li> (Right now I&#x27;m a big Winter Mint fan, hope they bring that back next season!)&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> For the love of GOD this stuff STINKS to high heaven!!!  </li>
            <li> This would probably work very well for those with dry or chemically treated hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly, dry and overprocessed hair because I color it</li>
            <li> But if you don&#x27;t wash your hair daily the scent really is lessened on the second day.</li>
            <li> ..have to wait and see how it continues to work, but so far I like it, love the smell on your hair, it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> Just use regular conditioner the same way u would use wen and it does the same exact thing.</li>
            <li> There is no other conditioner on the market that makes my hair feel the way Wen does.</li>
            <li> I use it now once a month more as a deep conditioner so that it&#x27;s not a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Does not go away completely, but if you rinse it out really well and follow with other hair products you may use, you probably won&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li> I like the clean scent of bamboo green tree!</li>
            <li> I tried several other cleansing conditioners with marginal success</li>
            <li> The product left my hair feeling and looking very limp and the smell was extremely strong - to the point it made me nauseous.  </li>
            <li> Ive been a WEN user for 4 years, and feel very fortunate to have found a high quality product that actually helps my long, coarse, thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> left my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft using wen then regular shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> With the winter dryness, the extra moisturizing helps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to use too much as a leave in conditioner can make hair oily.</li>
            <li> (kissing me or is standing close enough that his nose is near my hair) to smell the Spice scent.</li>
            <li> When I perspire, the smell is 10 times worse or more.</li>
            <li> I ended up using just a little bit, and rinsing it right off and not leaving it set on my hair while I showered like the instructions suggested.</li>
            <li> From what I am reading in other review some of the other WEN scents are less overpowering, so it is likely I will purchase one of those, because I LOVE how the product works for my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m VERY disappointed as most of the wen products are amazing.</li>
            <li> While I did not have an issue with the actual product as far as using it and product performance, I want to warn others who consider buying this &amp;#34;seasonal&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;limited&amp;#34; scent that they will walk around with their head stinking like last year&#x27;s holiday candle.</li>
            <li> I had to experiment with it a bit, as I have very thin, fine hair, and it was too much conditioning for my hair to follow the instructions that came with it.</li>
            <li> I love Wen products usually as they do make my hair stronger and less prone to break.  </li>
            <li> I started out using the like 20 pumps that it calls for on my long hair but quickly stopped becase it was just a waste of the product.</li>
            <li> Also this scent was a little odd and strong.  </li>
            <li> I have seen the commercials for this product for literally years and never thought much about it other than it couldn&#x27;t possibly work.</li>
            <li> I am an African American female with short natural hair that is curly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it on the first use, and the second time it smelled even worse than the first, if that was possible.  </li>
            <li> I love WEN and the other scents are good, but this one is disgusting!!</li>
            <li> Although it felt soft, it appeared dry.</li>
            <li> for the first few times, I shampooed with regular shampoo, then shampooed with WEN.  </li>
            <li> When I use other shampoos, my hair looks shiny and normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other Wen products and I feel my hair did better on those, but that weird herbal chemical smell of this particular shampoo would linger in my hair for days.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t usually write reviews on how things smell because I&#x27;m more interested in how the product works for my hair, but this was pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Super bad smell, stay with you for days, even if you wash your hair again with different product.&lt;br /&gt;Like cheap candle.</li>
            <li> Love Wen products, but the smell of this one is not only sickening, but overwhelmingly strong.  </li>
            <li> I even tried to give my brand new bottle to two other WEN fans, and both declined.</li>
            <li> now, it&#x27;s going to a friend who is very much into Caramel Apples, so will not be wasted!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a little stronger than most and the tint is a pinkish shade, however, I do not find either of these facets to be negative in any way.  </li>
            <li> it smells like cheap dollar store potpourri that has been on the shelf way past its half life.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as other formulas, especially as formulas I purchased from the Chaz Dean web site.  </li>
            <li> It was also odd that it really seemed to dry my hair out and make it feel straw</li>
            <li> first time I washed my hair, I was disappointed, I expected more.</li>
            <li> Fast service as usual.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair greasy and flat.</li>
            <li> flat hair\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this to anyone, as long as they get a different scented bottle.</li>
            <li> I have very long wavy/ coarse tangly hair.</li>
            <li> And you DO use a lot of this stuff on your hair, especially if you have very long hair like I do.</li>
            <li> I have thick, frizzy hair, and after several uses (4-5) as both shampoo and conditioner my hair was very flat, straight.</li>
            <li> Tangles far less and the shine is there now too.</li>
            <li> The apple scent is faint, but the vanilla/musky/woodsy scent is STRONG.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the reviews...followed directions, which I could HARDLY see, and I didn&#x27;t see much difference</li>
            <li> Sadly, it smelled like a cheap country candle and as if that wasn&#x27;t bad enough it was very strong and lingered on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that cheap scent is the one that stayed in my hair.</li>
            <li> at least I know it was a real WEN product, I like it</li>
            <li> Love the product but the shipping time and charges were crazy</li>
            <li> I bought this Apple WEN for 2 granddaughters with long, long hair.  </li>
            <li> but it still feels strange not to wash my hair with shampoo.</li>
            <li> With WEN I can go twice as long and do not get the flakes.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m middle aged and vain, what can I say)</li>
            <li> I have long hair now, as my son and husband don&#x27;t want me to cut it.  </li>
            <li> I have thick straight hair that comes just below my shoulder blades</li>
            <li> This apple scent was cheap and really disgusting, especially surprising since Wen is a very, very expensive shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Arrived much earlier than expected too!</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen hair care products for a very long time.</li>
            <li> That makes sense, it has to take time to moisturize my very long damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it works well with my dry, color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li> but I do not have any spit ends or dry hair.</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit overpowering, but lessens as you blow dry.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t look like Wen is helping it after I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> It looks like it is still dry.</li>
            <li> My hair felt dry.  </li>
            <li> the scent is stronger then when my hair is dry</li>
            <li> I ended up giving this to my sister that has dry, curly hair</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t as dry and doesn&#x27;t look oily.</li>
            <li> It does mellow out to a more apple scent afterwards, but then you get the whiffs of Caramel through the day.&lt;br /&gt;Not all together unpleasant, but not my preference.</li>
            <li> The key is to pull the wet hair with the WEN product on it through your thumb and index finger while your other fingers comb.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of different products with no success.</li>
            <li> It is extra thick and heavy, and the scent is too much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen for years and usually after your final rinse you can no longer smell the fragrance, especially after your hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that the product goes fast--my hair is past shoulder length and it did not last a month.</li>
            <li> Wish Chaz would bring back the previous Fall Pumpkin  </li>
            <li> So if you want to try it, it&#x27;s only a small investment, especially if you buy the 6 oz bottle to try it.</li>
            <li> I think it is so thick because it is very old stock.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair smell like a cupcake (which isn&#x27;t the worst) but it also doesn&#x27;t feel as light and clean as the other Wen products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love these products, but this one is bad.  </li>
            <li> I feel really bad that most did not like it.  </li>
            <li> I would actually like another one sent to replace it free of charge, because this one is so bad</li>
            <li> A huge waste of money for an expensive product.</li>
            <li> Then when dried and straightened it still looked and felt the same.</li>
            <li> I now only have to wash my hair 3 times a week instead of everyday.</li>
            <li> I use a wide shower comb that I also bought off Amazon to comb through my hair.</li>
            <li> We all have different hair texture and length, and this made it greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t waste my money again, will just stick to my regular regime.</li>
            <li> To heavy for daily use for me.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s worth to try it.&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive for a 16 oz.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m careful to rinse all of it out, so</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they are so heavy handed with the spice and nothing on the fruit,in this case apple- last time pumpkin.</li>
            <li> wet.  </li>
            <li> Also, after using this product exclusively for a few weeks (washing my hair every other day or so) I definitely felt like my scalp was oily.</li>
            <li> Other may like it however</li>
            <li> I would go for any other scent they sell.</li>
            <li> I gave this product multiple tries, adjusting the volume used each time and got same poor results each time.</li>
            <li> See my other WEN product review for specifics</li>
            <li> I have Gardenia, Pumpkin, and other scents.  </li>
            <li> I do plan on trying out some other WEN shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> I also thought it did not work as well as other forumulations.  </li>
            <li> Though, I am in the habit of only shampooing two or three times a week, I have found when I do so with WEN, my hair doesn&#x27;t get oily between shampoos unless I&#x27;ve been exercising and sweating excessively.  </li>
            <li> use such a small amount</li>
            <li> , I feel the need to warn my other wen users, it smells like hazelnuts and syrup,</li>
            <li> br /&gt;else, other than signing up with Wen.</li>
            <li> I used to have to wash my hair once a week when using other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I knew based on other reviews the smell is either hit or miss.</li>
            <li> Should have trusted other reviews and passed on this item.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents.  </li>
            <li> I have been using wen for years, but always peppermint or other flavors.  </li>
            <li> but I prefer other scents</li>
            <li> Since it was so expensive I wanted to make sure i exhausted every option before reviewing.</li>
            <li> Scent not good, left my hair heavy &amp; sticky despite following directions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed because I really loved how my curly hair looked and felt when I used it.</li>
            <li> My friend said it smells like the bowl of dusty potpourri that sits next to the bowl of old hard candy glued together on the coffee table at her grandmas nursing home.</li>
            <li> It does not perform at all as advertised, doesn&#x27;t rinse clean, weighs hair down, leaves it looking dirty and greasy and smells just odd!  </li>
            <li> I feel the only negative is the amount of WEN you have to use , 24 pumps.</li>
            <li> The results are not worth dealing with the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an absolute fail for me</li>
            <li> It seems to be extra thick</li>
            <li> Did not weigh my hair down, but also did not give my thick color treated hair enough conditioning power.</li>
            <li> I got my hair color treated the week before I used this product and as I&#x27;m rinsing, I had the displeasure of watching all of my color run down the drain.</li>
            <li> but this one I give a thumbs down.</li>
            <li> Just hoping it comes down in price.  </li>
            <li> I wish the other WEN  scents lingered like this one!</li>
            <li> I thought maybe the scent would adjust, and just smelled odd in the bottle, so I used it.</li>
            <li> Plus i cant afford it because it took half a bottle to do my hair the way they reccomend</li>
            <li> so I need less on my hair.  </li>
            <li> It works well when I mix half the pumps with Wen Sixthirteen cleanser.</li>
            <li> Takes much less time to style using Wen.</li>
            <li> It did come with a pump, which is a plus if you don&#x27;t have another one laying around from your previous Wen container.</li>
            <li> If I would use 14 pumps I would have half a cup of shampoo.</li>
            <li> I had coworkers and strangers remarking on the odd smell.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I always have a mess to deal with and end up looking like Roseanne Roseannadanna on a humid day.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I can return it without the cost and trouble not being prohibitive so that it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that requires a lot of conditioner to detangle it, and this one does do the job, the scent notwithstanding.</li>
            <li> Not only is the smell a sickening sweet smell</li>
            <li> Also I add a little water to help spread out the Wen in my hair, not a lot though.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was a little worried.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little over powering.</li>
            <li> smelled a little smokey, but made my hair fuller and softer.</li>
            <li> I used this in my son&#x27;s hair and noticed that it was a little lathering (something that Wen doesn&#x27;t do)</li>
            <li> Sometimes seems a little heavy on hair.</li>
            <li> The cold midwest winter is upon us, and I want to see what it does for my baby fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> A few close friends commented on how disheveled my hair looked.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Dont waste money on this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using wen for a few years now</li>
            <li> And the shine seemed to be missing from their hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t not have to wash my hair everyday like I did with shampoo.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my money</li>
            <li> The smell was heavy like maple syrup.</li>
            <li> which my daughter did the 1st time she used it and made her hair feel grease and heavy.  </li>
            <li> but I felt this really dried out my color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money ladies and gentlemen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all hype because all this product does is cost a lot of money and make your hair like a limp biscuit.</li>
            <li> This product is heavy on my hair</li>
            <li> It detangles my hair and doesn&#x27;t cause breakage and my shedding is a lot less!  </li>
            <li> and I tend to try them ALL and was not sure what to expect with my long, thick, difficult to manage hair (think mixed chicks</li>
            <li> I have long, thin, brown hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other WEN shampoos, but this one smells so strong and terrible</li>
            <li> Usually I have to use frizz control products at a minimum.  </li>
            <li> I have washed my hair five times since then, with different shampoos and conditioners (not this one), and when my hair is wet, I can STILL smell this scent, very faintly.</li>
            <li> women age, their hair has a tendency to become brittle, coarse, and difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but the smell is terrible!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again, probably won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love WEN Cleansing Conditioner, but this stuff smells horrible and it lingers on all day!  </li>
            <li> not rating it 5 stars because while I like caramel apples, I&#x27;m not sure I want to walk around smelling like one.</li>
            <li> This is too thick and leaves my hair feeling heavy and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I love Wen, but this scent is awful.</li>
            <li> I love the Wen Cleansing Conditioner but the smell is horrible.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure why they even used &amp;#34;apple&amp;#34; as a description for this.  </li>
            <li> It was also thicker and oilier than the usual product.  </li>
            <li> Not your usual apple fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been anxious to try this product for years now</li>
            <li> it made my mouth water constantly which was very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> When my hair is dry, even with holding it to my nose, the scent is faint and</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little less expensive, though.</li>
            <li> but this particular product just leaves my hair oily :-(</li>
            <li> I usually go at least a day between washing.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s too late.  </li>
            <li> this product sucks.</li>
            <li> Ive read reviews where people complained about the scent not being what they &amp;#34;thought it SHOULD be&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have used Wen Cleansing Conditioner continuously for at least a two years.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I have curly and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have that curly thick hair that loves to misbehave.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s NOT a shampoo??  </li>
            <li> I mean it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the knock-off versions of Wen &amp;#34;cleansing conditioner&amp;#34; (Wen&#x27;s version of shampoo)  but the less expensive brands all seem to have a build-up problem.  </li>
            <li> seriously</li>
            <li> the directions are very small, hard to read, it is a very thick product, I think I have figured out how to use it, it replaces shampoo, conditioner and leave in conditioner, my hair seems a lot fuller after using it</li>
            <li> a side note for those who have left bad feedback for Wen</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> I agree with others -- the fragrance is not good.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it left an awful residue that made my hair feel like straw - not at all like any other wen products.</li>
            <li> I am forced to use it because I can&#x27;t pay all this money to throw it away!  </li>
            <li> Also it is so thick the pump does not work!</li>
            <li> Usually it is a crazy mess</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick</li>
            <li> I also recommend the lavender scent for thin hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the results feels like a wax coating on it.</li>
            <li> I had to leave a review because I almost didn&#x27;t order this scent because of the other bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Not a good scent !</li>
            <li> not a good idea!</li>
            <li> It is so bad that I won&#x27;t use it and have wasted money on it.  </li>
            <li> My negative review is because this &#x27;flavor&#x27; sent... whatever - STINKS.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a dramatic difference using this expensive product on my dry/damaged processed hair.  </li>
            <li> so I was a little disappointed about that</li>
            <li> But I cannot get past how bad this one smells.</li>
            <li> I think I am just swapping expensive hair styling products for expensive conditioner.</li>
            <li> The smell of the &amp;#34;fall apple spice&amp;#34; is stale and cloying.</li>
            <li> I have been using WEN for 7+ years, it is expensive</li>
            <li> They seemed to have a difficult time getting the tangles out with use of conditioners + tangle lotion.  </li>
            <li> A bit over-the-top.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> You may say that WEN is expensive.</li>
            <li> what could go wrong?</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is going to be an EXPENSIVE habit.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I find this scent overpowering.  </li>
            <li> It almost comes to the point of making me ill.</li>
            <li> Sorry Wen.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry to say that this scent does not work at all for me.  </li>
            <li> It smells vaguely of a cookie candle, but somehow a tad appley.</li>
            <li> It smells weird, like a spice cake.  </li>
            <li> smells like that generic apple spice that smells awful.</li>
            <li> Too expensive to throw out, I can&#x27;t wait until the bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> My hair felt very thin.</li>
            <li> Half of my house smells like this weird nasty vaguely apple smell.</li>
            <li> Wen recommends the Aloe as well for thin hair but that scent made my hair look bad</li>
            <li> Other than that, I think its terrible</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it, hair felt greasy and dirty and looked dingy after use.</li>
            <li> The smell was overpowering and disappointing.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, but if you don&#x27;t care for cinnamon you will be unhappy.</li>
            <li> but im not to crazy anout the smell it leaves....</li>
            <li> my fav of all the wen products, price stinks</li>
            <li> it also stinks.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I hate to be so negative and seldom am, but this product was simply awful!</li>
            <li> It smells like a bad candle.</li>
            <li> Smells like a bad holiday candle.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch</li>
            <li> i know its getting a lot of bad feedback because of the smell</li>
            <li> but I decided to give it a chance - BAD idea.</li>
            <li> it smells like curry, bad curry.</li>
            <li> I hope the makers realize how bad it is and discontinue it.</li>
            <li> It smells like a bad attempt at caramel.  </li>
            <li> it literally made me sick.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Sooo disappointed in this one.</li>
            <li> This stinks!</li>
            <li> and I have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> so I was really disappointed that this didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am very  pleased with my order  thank you verymuch vicki ventura</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this one, and it seems to last all day.  I don&#x27;t give this 5 stars because I am still not sure how great Wen is, compared to regular shampoo.  I do notice my hair seems healthier most of the time, but I began using Wen in the summer.  The cold midwest winter is upon us, and I want to see what it does for my baby fine, thin hair.  This is my 4th bottle of Wen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other WEN shampoos, but this one smells so strong and terrible I can&#x27;t even use it.  It&#x27;s like plopping a handful of Glade Air Freshener on your head--and the smell sticks.  My 6-year-old son, who loves nothing more than snuggling cut me off early the night I first used it because the smell is so nauseatingly strong.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it, hair felt greasy and dirty and looked dingy after use.</li>
            <li> The smell was overpowering and disappointing. I love Wen but I won&#x27;t buy this scent again.</li>
            <li> Causes my wife to get headaches afterwards due to the strong smell. Other may like it however</li>
            <li> Good quality as this brand always is, leaves the hair so soft and shiny</li>
            <li> It came promptly. Cleans just like wen. I like the smell, but if you don&#x27;t care for cinnamon you will be unhappy. When people ask me if it works I say try it for a month then wash with regular shampoo. Trust me u will go back to wen</li>
            <li> Use nothing but this cleaner/conditioner. Like this fragrance because it stays in my hair all day.</li>
            <li> Used it only for a month after noticing remarkable hair loss!!! I&#x27;m very disappointed because I really loved how my curly hair looked and felt when I used it.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair smell like a Yanky Candle</li>
            <li> Love the products, but wasn&#x27;t too keen on the scent.</li>
            <li> I had to leave a review because I almost didn&#x27;t order this scent because of the other bad reviews. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered anyway. I have been using Wen for a year now and have used tea tree, fig, winter vanilla mint, and mango coconut. This is definitely my new favorite! I washed my hair 3 days ago and I can still smell the spicy apple scent, and my hair is so soft. I don&#x27;t know where people get that it has a maple scent, I think it&#x27;s more like a mulled cider, yummy! It is strong smelling from the bottle, but tames down on your hair. Love, Love, Love!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell,  I really like wen though</li>
            <li> I love Wen, but this scent is NOT for me.  It smells like burning plastic and even my friends are saying &amp;#34;what&#x27;s that funky smell?&amp;#34;  Works great like Wen always does but I&#x27;m going back to my Orange Blossom scent..  I&#x27;m Told this smells like a &amp;#34;milk thistle burp&amp;#34; if you know what that is.</li>
            <li> I am embarrassed to go out in public that is how strong the smell is YUCK!  Like a strong yankee candle in your hair</li>
            <li> works well like all wen but the smell is a bit much.. i feel like im being followed by a candy apple vendor</li>
            <li> the smell is amazing and lasts a long time. left my hair soft and manageable. perfect scent for the autumn</li>
            <li> I love these products, but this one is bad.  The smell is too strong and it sticks with you all day long!</li>
            <li> Loved the scent but it smelled so much like french toast it made my mouth water constantly which was very frustrating. It worked well until I went swimming and it wouldnt clean out the chlorine from my hair. It made my hair far too greasy after a while. I much prefer herbal essence</li>
            <li> some of my co-workers swear by this product. i have fine hair and even if i rinse it for 5 minutes straight and feel like i have it all out it still weighs down my hair. the product also builds up on my scalp. this is not the product for me</li>
            <li> I tried, i really tried to make this product work. Since it was so expensive I wanted to make sure i exhausted every option before reviewing. This product left my hair greasy and clumpy like I have never seen before. Seriously the cheapest shampoos have done better than this. I tried more pumps, less pumps, washing once, twice, leave-in the whole bit. A few close friends commented on how disheveled my hair looked. If you have fine hair, this is NOT the product for you.</li>
            <li> It smells like a Yankee candle shop. I do not care for this scent. The product seems to work well. I think I am just swapping expensive hair styling products for expensive conditioner. I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Super bad smell, stay with you for days, even if you wash your hair again with different product.&lt;br /&gt;Like cheap candle. I tried pretty much all wen conditioners,&lt;br /&gt;I like most of them, but this one I won&#x27;t use again. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as other formulas, especially as formulas I purchased from the Chaz Dean web site.  I thought the smell was too strong so I was so surprised when I got not one or two but dozens of comments that my hair smelled wonderful - sometimes even strangers in the line at the store.  I don&#x27;t know if it is good that a stranger standing almost 2 feet away can smell your hair, but it nice that they liked the smell :)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Wen scent ever! Same wonderful cleansing conditioner (could never use anything else on these curls!), but this one smells like a wonderful fall candle! It is heavy on the Carmel (so, very sweet) then spice, with a hint of Apple.</li>
            <li> I love this product, keeps my hair soft and and amazing. I would recommend this to everyone! It&#x27;s a must ha.ve</li>
            <li> I was excited to see this new scent come out and ordered it right away.  Sadly, it smelled like a cheap country candle and as if that wasn&#x27;t bad enough it was very strong and lingered on my hair.  If you like Wen they have many other scents that are nice, especially the pumpkin one. This apple scent was cheap and really disgusting, especially surprising since Wen is a very, very expensive shampoo and conditioner.  Boo Wen, Boo! I sent it back after one use.</li>
            <li> For my house hold. It is a waste of money. Does not work. It tells u to use so much. But it does not work on my girlfriends hair or my daughters hair. Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser but the pump doesn&#x27;t work. As much as I paid for this bottle I should have a pump that works, so 3 stars because of this one big frustration.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff great hair stuff</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of WEN products, but there is something &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; with the scent. I even tried to give my brand new bottle to two other WEN fans, and both declined. I thought maybe the scent would adjust, and just smelled odd in the bottle, so I used it. FAIL!! Now the stench is on in my hair AND on my pillows! I can&#x27;t even go to my office with my hair smelling like this, and I smoke!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try a different scent. If you wear this in a car-pool, they will kick you out on the side of the road. In the snow. Blech!</li>
            <li> this is a great product and I was not disappointed with the new scent.  I have been using Wen for about 3 years now and have not complaints. It has helped with an issue I had with breakage. I would recommend any of the products. The shipping was quick and they made the package with a happy face.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even try this on my hair before returning it, the fragrance is nice but WAY too strong.</li>
            <li> Love how this smells and makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> The BEST scent yet! I use it year round, as do my girls, and CONSTANTLY get compliments from people about how wonderful our hair smells!!! 100% A+++++</li>
            <li> Wen did absolutely nothing for my hair. I have very long wavy/ coarse tangly hair. All it did was make it smell good and easier to brush while wet. Then when dried and straightened it still looked and felt the same. Dont waste money on this. Just use regular conditioner the same way u would use wen and it does the same exact thing. Plus i cant afford it because it took half a bottle to do my hair the way they reccomend so i only get 2 uses in one bottle</li>
            <li> I am now a WEN beleiver. My hair is very thick and I guess wavy but not in a good way. After using WEN my hair is much easier to straighten or wear with my waves, which look pretty good!  I feel the only negative is the amount of WEN you have to use , 24 pumps. I used my 16 oz bottle in about 3 1/2 weeks. Waiting for my next 2. Love the smell too. Try it you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> I love wen products, my favorite is lavender because it seems to work so well for my dry, colored hair. Every now and then I do try a different one ....and this one smells awful )-: it&#x27;s cloying and it almost makes me cough. Sooo disappointed in this one. Pew.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years and love it.  My hair is in great shape</li>
            <li> WEN&#x27;s apple spice scent does not smell like apples at all.  In fact, the scent is awful.  It smells like a bad candle. WEN&#x27;s products are very nice, but this scent is a thumbs down.</li>
            <li> This product is a good product. Please be aware that while advertised as a shampoo and conditioner all in one, this product DOES NOT LATHER! It is very much like a cream rinse. I have thick, frizzy hair, and after several uses (4-5) as both shampoo and conditioner my hair was very flat, straight. My hair felt very thin. I now use this product a couple times a week and regular shampoo and regular cream rinse the rest of the time.</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reveiws in products but this stuff smells AMAZING! I love wen products and if I could afford it I would buy a gallon of this stuff! It smells like an apple cider candle...so so good!</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying the Fall Apple Cleanser.  It smells so good and the fragrance seems to stay in my hair.  It is a lot thicker than the others.</li>
            <li> This scent is awful!!  Smells like burnt leaves or woodsy rot. I love WEN products but this one should have never made it to marketing!</li>
            <li> I love all the WEN products I have used over the years. This scent was a bit overwhelming. My coworkers could smell it before I arrived in the room. I&#x27;ll stick to the scents I know in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using wen for a few years now and I just love it.  Wanted to try the new fall sent w/out having to buy the whole kit. Loved it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend. When my hair changed drastically at age 45 from medium texture to fine and thinning, after much research, lack of moisture was a culprit, so I tried this product. Saw a difference immediately. My hair is shoulder length, fyi, I don&#x27;t use as much as the directions say making product last longer.  I use 2 pumps work in and rinse then repeat with about 4 pumps and rinse. Also some things I found out in my research; iron deficiency can cause thinning as well. Juicing hydrates your body and has helped me with my weight and hair (look up the juice lady Cherie Calbom). Zinc also helpful. Hope this gives you a helpful and healthful  &amp;#34;heads up&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> No smell of apples, more like cookie dough and pumpkin. Husband didn&#x27;t like how my hair smelled at all.</li>
            <li> Was always unsure about the Wen hair care products but I LOVE this cleanser. My hair is super soft. The smell is strong but I really like it</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my hair feel and look, jut the scent is a bit strong.  I will probably try another scent that is not so over powering.</li>
            <li> It met all my expectations - love the smell - definitely reminds me of Fall and getting ready for the holidays.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it works well with my dry, color-treated hair.  Although it felt soft, it appeared dry. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, and only after one use I had two comments about my hair being shiny and looking healthy! I usually use Redkin products, but ordered more Wen</li>
            <li> Works great like other Wen products, however the maple syrup scent  is very strong and stays with you even the next day.  Pay a few bucks more and get a different scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen for years and usually after your final rinse you can no longer smell the fragrance, especially after your hair is dry.  But this Fall Apple Spice lingers on and I LOVE IT.  It&#x27;s a very spicy heady fragrance yet smells wonderful!!</li>
            <li> I love wen. I hate this scent. Smells like a bad holiday candle. Yuck. I would go for any other scent they sell.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo and it lasts for awhile! It&#x27;s great not having to use conditioner all the time</li>
            <li> While I did not have an issue with the actual product as far as using it and product performance, I want to warn others who consider buying this &amp;#34;seasonal&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;limited&amp;#34; scent that they will walk around with their head stinking like last year&#x27;s holiday candle. The smell of the &amp;#34;fall apple spice&amp;#34; is stale and cloying. The product itself is good, but I will definitely not buy this scent again. Anyone with sinus problems or issues with very strong smells should try a different version.</li>
            <li> The Fall Apple Spice reminds me of a good hot cup of mulled caramel apple cider. It evokes the scent of a crisp fall evening spent around the fire swapping stories and drinking cider. it is spicy and has a maple-ish undertone. If youre a fan of Gold Canyon Candles, it smells exactly like their Farmhouse Cider candle. I adore this scent and I adore WEN. Try it, you might be surprised.</li>
            <li> Bought as gift for my two daughters with long natural red hair, different type hair but worked very will for both,arrived in excellent condition and prompted delivery</li>
            <li> I  have never been as disappointed with a product!  It does not perform at all as advertised, doesn&#x27;t rinse clean, weighs hair down, leaves it looking dirty and greasy and smells just odd!  I have fine, wavy/curly hair, but a lot of it. I gave this product multiple tries, adjusting the volume used each time and got same poor results each time. I don&#x27;t know what hair type is ideal for this, but it sure isn&#x27;t fine.&lt;br /&gt;  The seller was great, transaction quick and easy, so not a single complaint there. And it you feel you really must try it for yourself, buy from Amazon so you don&#x27;t get locked into the auto-refill jam at the Wen website.  Sorry, I hate to be so negative and seldom am, but this product was simply awful!</li>
            <li> I wanted a different fragrance so I ordered this one. I am not disappointed. I have been using WEN for 7+ years, it is expensive but I do not have any spit ends or dry hair. See my other WEN product review for specifics</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen products for about a year now. I mainly use the seasonal scents, and the Vanilla mint is my favorite. Ginger pumpkin is close second but it&#x27;s being discontinued so I thought I&#x27;d try Fall Apple Spice. It has a very strong, spice scented candle like smell that lingers long after you cleanse your hair. Also it tends to weigh my hair down a bit more than other Wen products. I do like the product as a fall scent, and I purchased my second bottle today.</li>
            <li> I love Wen products! My favorite scent is the six thirteen but it is not an every day cleanser. This scent is ok. It is more of a spice scent, I don&#x27;t really smell any apple. I will probably go back to the Ginger Pumpkin fall scent or the Fig.</li>
            <li> WEN cleansing conditioner is AMAZING!!  I love the product it self.  It did make a huge difference in my hair. The Fall Apple Spice scent was too overwhelming for me.  I thought it would diminish throughout the day, but it didn&#x27;t. If you like a strong spicy apple scent then you will probably like this one.  I will order a different scent next time.</li>
            <li> I love it love the smell of cinnamon in this product ,so fresh smelling i would certainly buy again,adds body and shine</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE the scent of this.  It is more fall and spice than apple...but I can&#x27;t get enough of it.  AWESOME!</li>
            <li> I bought this Apple WEN for 2 granddaughters with long, long hair.  They seemed to have a difficult time getting the tangles out with use of conditioners + tangle lotion.  And the shine seemed to be missing from their hair.  Both girls (8 &amp; 10) have tried it and love it.  Their moms tried it too.  Everyone is so impressed.  Tangles far less and the shine is there now too.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing  I use on my hair. Its the greatest. I order from Amazon its cheaper than Chaz Dean. None of my friends have heard of it. Will never stop using Wen love all the different smells</li>
            <li> I really like this product for my naturally curly, coarse, tangle-prone hair. It also helps with frizz. I actually only used this in my hair with no styling products a few times, something I have never been able to do. Usually I have to use frizz control products at a minimum.  My hair feels healthier and breaks less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because I didn&#x27;t care for the scent-it reminds me of a candle. Also, after using this product exclusively for a few weeks (washing my hair every other day or so) I definitely felt like my scalp was oily. So now I periodically shampoo with regular shampoo. Also, you need to use a lot of product for each use, which it about a bottle a month, which of course makes it fairly expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again, but not in this scent.</li>
            <li> I love the WEN line of products. My hair is so soft using wen then regular shampoos and conditioners. Love the seasonal products.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but not crazy about this smell...  I have Gardenia, Pumpkin, and other scents.  I hoped this would be better, but I personally didn&#x27;t like the smell of this product.  It works great on my hair, but the scent was just not a winner for me.</li>
            <li> Great product as I have experienced with many different wen products try it you will like it like no other</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!! Smells delicious like a home made baked pie. WEN never disappoints. This is my favorite fragrance  by far</li>
            <li> This formula is a bit thicker than the others and a bit weightier so it probably best for thick, curly hair, not think stringy hair.  I really like this scent.  It really does smell lake fall!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I now only have to wash my hair 3 times a week instead of everyday. Makes my hair feel and look good.</li>
            <li> I was so expecting to love this but the smell is sickening.  Chaz really missed the mark on this one.  I had to return mine.  I love the smell of apple, but the \\&quot;spice\\&quot; is just overwhelming.  I didn&#x27;t smell any apple at all.</li>
            <li> I love Wen products in general, they are so great for my hair and high quality. I love this new seasonal offering. It doesn&#x27;t smell very strongly of apple it&#x27;s definitely more of a spice scent, but you can also smell sort of a sweet crust smell. It smells like a spicy baked good. I really like it a lot!</li>
            <li> I did not care for this fragrance. I can see why it was on sale. I prefer the Almond Mint.</li>
            <li> I Love WEN and have been using it for years but this particular product just leaves my hair oily :-(</li>
            <li> I totally love this fragrance!! Next best are the Pumpkin Spice and Sweet Almond.  It seems to be extra thick so I need less on my hair.  (Makes the bottle last longer too:) )  With the winter dryness, the extra moisturizing helps my hair soft and shiny. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch but mine smelled like chemicals!! It took over a week to get the chemical smell from my hair. Plus, it left an awful residue that made my hair feel like straw - not at all like any other wen products. This stuff needs to be pulled from the shelves!</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit overpowering, but lessens as you blow dry.</li>
            <li> It really does leave your hair super soft.  But I found that it made my hair a bit greasy. I do plan on trying out some other WEN shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> Smells great. My color lasts longer using Wen.</li>
            <li> Okay, my friend had purchased WEN from online.  She decided to try something else so she sold it to me.  I figured &amp;#34;eh, what the heck.&amp;#34; Okay, my hair color changes A LOT, so needless to stay my hair has it&#x27;s damage and WEN has made such a huge difference.  Not only can I see the difference, I can feel it too. I used it daily at first, then I loved it so much I bought more on Amazon.  Now Im using it every other day and my hair has never looked better...seriously...buy this.</li>
            <li> What can say I just love love Wen I have being using it for 6 months now and I would not go back to shampoo or conditioner some people don&#x27;t like it but I would recommend it I have fine hair but it gives me volume my hair is in such good condition, I know it is exspencif  but it&#x27;s wort it</li>
            <li> one of my favorite scents by WEN</li>
            <li> Works great, smells great.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It has left my hair in better condition than it has been in a long time. I would recommend it to anyone with any type of hair. I had to experiment with it a bit, as I have very thin, fine hair, and it was too much conditioning for my hair to follow the instructions that came with it. I ended up using just a little bit, and rinsing it right off and not leaving it set on my hair while I showered like the instructions suggested.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this product to smell like apple cider. It does not. The best way to describe this scent is to say that it smells like a Yankee Candle store in the fall, when they have every single fall scent going at the same time. The apple scent is faint, but the vanilla/musky/woodsy scent is STRONG. I washed my hair with this product on Saturday, September 21st. I have washed my hair five times since then, with different shampoos and conditioners (not this one), and when my hair is wet, I can STILL smell this scent, very faintly. This is after using a very large amount of shampoo one day to try to get the scent out. And on the actual day you wash your hair with this scent, brace yourself. You will smell nothing else. This does happen with other Wen conditioners (specifically the mango coconut), but this particular scent is more overwhelming than any other Wen scent I have encountered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, all that being said, it does work. My hair is conditioned afterward. I have long, thick hair that requires a lot of conditioner to detangle it, and this one does do the job, the scent notwithstanding. If you like apple conditioners, I recommend [[ASIN:B00A54KPU6 WEN Kids Cleansing Conditioner (Apple)]] instead. This is a true apple scent and is less overwhelming. I also think the Kids&#x27; conditioner works even better than the adult formula.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love WEN products because my hair feels softer and more manageable than ever before. I get numerous compliments from my husband as he runs his fingers through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect this product to lather. Unlike shampoo, the cleansing conditioner is the cleaning agent for your hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave soap residue because there is none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As women age, their hair has a tendency to become brittle, coarse, and difficult to manage. WEN has made my hair look and feel like I&#x27;m 21 again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping time was reasonable for this product.</li>
            <li> I love fall Apple spice, it&#x27;s my favorite scent, it smells like spiced caramel apple cake and the scent stays in my hair all day</li>
            <li> Scent not good, left my hair heavy &amp; sticky despite following directions. I love the aloe cucumber but this version fell short.</li>
            <li> Love the scent,but did not like that it made my hair look dull and flat,so I would not buy it again</li>
            <li> I Love it!  Best Shampoo/conditioner I have ever used!  I will continue using this product.  Can&#x27;t wait to try all the cleansing conditioners!</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve been using wen for years and this scent is the best one yet! This product always makes my hair look, feel, and smell great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the knock-off versions of Wen &amp;#34;cleansing conditioner&amp;#34; (Wen&#x27;s version of shampoo)  but the less expensive brands all seem to have a build-up problem.  I  need body as well as help keeping my processed hair healthy looking. I have no build up issues with Wen, which I&#x27;ve been using about 2 years now.  I do use a high-end lathering shampoo about once a month which may not be necessary, but like most people, I associate lather with squeaky clean. I can understand why some people might not like this scent, as it is very sweet and not light and breezy.  I like it, but am glad it doesn&#x27;t linger for hours because it is rather strong. For reasons I can&#x27;t explain, this one works best on my hair of any of the Wen cleansers I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve used Wen&#x27;s body shampoo with a lavender scent and the regular one with a minty scent.  Those two seem to work exactly the same, but this one seems to give me a bit more bounce and shine.  Could be my imagination, but I&#x27;m going to stock up while it is available.</li>
            <li> The scent of the Apple Spice smells like a candle aisle. There isn&#x27;t even a hint of apple in it. I got my hair color treated the week before I used this product and as I&#x27;m rinsing, I had the displeasure of watching all of my color run down the drain. I will never try this again.</li>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance and consistently good product from WEN by Chaz Dean. Easy to use and concentrated formula goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have used WEN for quite some time and always have had good luck with it.  Make my hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li> Wen is really great for my hair, I love it a lot! :) it makes my hair soft and smooth and less washing necessary!</li>
            <li> I just ordered this and hope to try the Cranberry Mint. Should have read the reviews b/c I was hoping for a fresh Apple scent like Bath &amp; Body Words lotion but the scent is a very heavy and strong cinnamon spice. A bit over-the-top. Reminds me of Glade air freshener and also how a Christmas gift store smells. A nice smell, but I don&#x27;t want to wear it. I know many women who like vanilla, pumpkin, and other fruit and food scents, but I prefer fresh, clean and some herbals.  This is too much for me. I will say I did try it just to see if the scent lingered and I can say it does not. Does not go away completely, but if you rinse it out really well and follow with other hair products you may use, you probably won&#x27;t smell it. It&#x27;s expensive so I plan to use it up and never order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all WEN products I have found that diluting with water works best. It&#x27;s easier to apply, I use much less, and it does a great job. I have long straight hair a bit on the fine side and I have been using WEN for years. I tried it, could not get the hang of it, stopped, tried it again, and finally figured out how I needed to use it. They suggest way too much for most people so I would recommend you experiment. No two heads are alike. The key is to pull the wet hair with the WEN product on it through your thumb and index finger while your other fingers comb. Do this 10-12 times for each section until it \\&quot;feel\\&quot; silky between your fingers.  Leave it on while you finish your shower and then rinse REALLY, REALLY well, rubbing the scalp with your finger tips. Happy WEN&#x27;ing.</li>
            <li> I bought this because fall apple is one of my favorite scents, but this is no nice smelling candle or air freshner. This stinks! And I don&#x27;t usually write reviews on how things smell because I&#x27;m more interested in how the product works for my hair, but this was pretty bad. As far as how my hair did with it, I guess ok. I&#x27;ve tried the other Wen products and I feel my hair did better on those, but that weird herbal chemical smell of this particular shampoo would linger in my hair for days. My husband would even comment on it Lol</li>
            <li> I really love this scent. It took me a couple of times using it to get used to it, but whenever I use it now. I really relish the wonderful scent. It works well when I mix half the pumps with Wen Sixthirteen cleanser.</li>
            <li> I also bought the Pantene cleansing conditioner and alternate it with the Wen to cut down on the cost, works amazing, won&#x27;t go back to regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> Works well but hate the smell...I like what it dies but im not to crazy anout the smell it leaves....but is good for my hair</li>
            <li> I love the Wen cleansing conditioners. I still need to shampoo about once a week using any brand then follow that with a Wen cleanse. I bleach my hair and it keeps it soft. I still have split ends but they are soft not brittle.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Be sure to rinse it thoroughly. My hair doesn&#x27;t look like Wen is helping it after I blow dry it. It looks like it is still dry. However, when I go to style my hair, Wen makes it so that styling it is a breeze. Takes much less time to style using Wen. It also dries faster using Wen. I have lots of fine hair, pretty thick hair. Love, Love, love Wen!</li>
            <li> the smell is comfort in  a bottle. I love this product. My hair was damaged, but with wen it looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and what it does...</li>
            <li> I use all Wen products and unlike some posters, which are entitled to their opinion, I loved this scent.  It reminds me of incense.  I feel really bad that most did not like it.  Not only did I enjoy this one but it had the loveliest label on the bottle.  I kept looking at it and thinking it&#x27;s really pretty.  The colors blend nicely and there are many colors in this label.  The only Wen product that I did not like the smell of is the Tea Tree BUT...Tea Tree gives the best results.  Wen truly is a product in a class by itself and I know there are copy cats but the original Wen cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Plus complete strangers will tell me they can smell my hair upon passing by and they say it smells like a Yankee Candle.</li>
            <li> I am a WEN girl! I have been using WEN for more than 4 years now and love the product. I am trying this &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; to use during the Fall months. WEN is top of the line and I have never been disappointed. You may say that WEN is expensive. I do not think so. I find that I would spend as much on regular shampoos and conditioners for the amount of use that I get from a container of WEN. AND I would not get the excellent results that I get from using WEN. This is great stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It detangles my hair and doesn&#x27;t cause breakage and my shedding is a lot less!  Thank you</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with the WEN products, and the results that I found were voluminous, soft hair with a festive harvest scent. A friend recommended the product to me, and I was glad that I took her advice of washing twice--the first time with half the recommended amount, and then repeat. The only downside is that the product goes fast--my hair is past shoulder length and it did not last a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen for about 2 months now. I def do not want to go back to Shampoo. I love the smell of the apple spice but I have to agree with others, that it does not smell like apple. One thing I do recommend for others is that you do not need near as much as Wen recommends. I started out using the like 20 pumps that it calls for on my long hair but quickly stopped becase it was just a waste of the product.I use a wide shower comb that I also bought off Amazon to comb through my hair. It makes the Wen go through my hair better and makes combing my hair after the shower super easy. Really I only comb my hair to style it.  I am down to about 2 or 3 pumps per section and it does really good in my hair. Also I add a little water to help spread out the Wen in my hair, not a lot though. I don&#x27;t not have to wash my hair everyday like I did with shampoo. it does not get as oily. I usually go at least a day between washing.  I also recommend the lavender scent for thin hair like mine. Wen recommends the Aloe as well for thin hair but that scent made my hair look bad so I use it as a shave cream. It really helps the hair from growing back quickly and leaves my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> Smells good, works great for hair affected by hypothyroidism.</li>
            <li> I followed the video and instruction to the max, and it didn&#x27;t do what it was supposed to do at all.</li>
            <li> Everyone raves about Wen, but it did not work for me or my daughters. We all have different hair texture and length, and this made it greasy and heavy. Not for me, and the smell...just no.</li>
            <li> The Wen brand is great but this scent is gross. It&#x27;s cloyingly sweet smelling. It&#x27;s kind of like caramel. Not what I imagined Fall Apple Spice smelling like. There is definitely no apple or spice smell to it. It smells so awful that I can&#x27;t use this product in my hair. Makes me gag. A huge waste of money for an expensive product.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent produce,just wished I&#x27;d chosen a different fragrance If I reorder I will amend the choice of fragarence.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do for my hair what I thought it would. But it is gentle on the hair so in many cases I do use mine</li>
            <li> Smelt like a sweet candle. My husband asked me why my hair elledclike maple syrup? Love the other wen scents. Not this one</li>
            <li> I love the Wen Conditioning Cleansers. My hair is very soft. Although I do not like this fragrance. I think my favorite is still the Ginger Pumpkin Spice.</li>
            <li> LOVE Wen products - Have tried several of the shampoos &amp; Fall Apple Spice is my favorite! My hair stylist lets me bring my Wen shampoo with me &amp; as she is  shampooing my hair everyone wants to know what it is.  Product was received  in a timely manner &amp; in good shape - Excellent Service - will definitely come back!</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen hair care products for a very long time. I like the way my hair is healthier and do not plan to ever go back to using shampoo. This particular scent, however, was very overpowering and sweet. So much so that I could not actually use it at all. I liked the other \\&quot;seasonal\\&quot; scents, especially winter vanilla mint, but this one needs to go away and never come back!</li>
            <li> I really love this apple spice product! i know its getting a lot of bad feedback because of the smell and i do admit, if you are looking for a fruity apple scent, this is not it.  This scent smells more like cinnamon than fruity (matter of fact it doesnt smell fruity at all)  Thankfully i like the smell of cinnamon.  It&#x27;s cinnamon mixed with vanilla and maple and i love it.  Not only does it smell great  but it also leaves your hair incredibly soft! I have thick curly hair and i felt out of all the WEN products i&#x27;ve tried so far (sweet almond, pomegranate, mint vanilla, green tea gardenia, and mango coconut) the apple spice left my hair the softest and the easiest in detangling my hair.  So for me, the scent is amazing and it leaves your hair amazing.</li>
            <li> I usually like apple scented hair products, but you better be ready to smell like a holiday candle! The scent was a bit overwhelming for me in the shower. This particular product was discounted, which made it easier to get used to the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Although this seasonal Wen cleansing conditioner received some bad reviews I found it to be a very good performer.  The fragrance is a little stronger than most and the tint is a pinkish shade, however, I do not find either of these facets to be negative in any way.  I normally purchase Wen from QVC but am happy that Amazon provides these formulas which are no longer in season.</li>
            <li> I have tried several WEN Cleansing Conditioners, and this is my favorite scent. I think it is a seasonal, and my not come back, so I have purchased several bottles because I don&#x27;t want to be without it. I think it is one of the stronger scents, and lingers on my hair for at least a day or more after use. If strong or lingering smells bother you, this one might not be for you.</li>
            <li> I tried a family members Lavender WEN and absolutely loved it.  Based on those results I decided to purchase my own bottle of WEN.  I went with the fall apple spice and have to say I was very disappointed.  The product left my hair feeling and looking very limp and the smell was extremely strong - to the point it made me nauseous.  I may go back and order a bottle of Lavender but do not recommend this particular scent / formula.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a dramatic difference using this expensive product on my dry/damaged processed hair.  The commericals that you see on TV makes it look like this product alone transforms your hair into luxurious shining hair.</li>
            <li> It works well with my hair. I have curly hair and this products makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I love the Chaz conditioner/cleanser.  this does a great job, as does all his products.  The initial smell is not exactly what I expected, but the conditioning effect is great.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was a little worried. I think the smell is fine with this one and works like all other WEN products. I even tried this on my 1yr old and her hair is so soft and nice now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried lots of brands who claim to be great like WEN but nothing compares to it that I have tried. If it was cheaper to purchase they would sell allot more.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews on this one before buying not one, but two bottles of it. Apple spice ... what could go wrong? Love the product, but the smell is terrible!</li>
            <li> I love it.  I have really frizzy hair!  This is the most conditioning Wen product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x60;ve read the reviews about the scent and when I opened the bottle, I agreed. But, something happened.  I love WEN, so I decided to use it anyhow.  I got amazing compliments on how I smelled.  Men especially commented.  I actually am dabbing it on my pulse and neck as a fragrance.  I&#x60;ve read men perceive aromas differently and like pumpkin and fall fragrance. I&#x60;m loving this reaction from men so I am happy with it. I smell my wrists throughout the day and love it!!!</li>
            <li> This product smells just awful.  It is very overpowering.  I also thought it did not work as well as other forumulations.  My hair felt dry.  I wish I could return it because I am just going to end up throwing it away.  I cannot imagine anyone I know would want to smell like this stuff smells.</li>
            <li> When I got this it made my hair oily and have used VO5 which is has made it almost the same.  It was a waste of my money</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel....soft and hydrated but not heavy or greasy. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I use all the wen product I like them a lot  I love.  winter one the most  but they aren&#x27;t it this year</li>
            <li> This WEN smells like apple pie and maple...perfect scent for a fall lover! The seasonal scents are WAY better then the originals!</li>
            <li> love the Wen products....would recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> This is the second WEN product I&#x27;ve purchased.  The last time was a couple years ago, and it&#x27;s about the same as I remember in terms of performance.  This would probably work very well for those with dry or chemically treated hair.  The cream is very rich, easy to work into scalp and strands.  It is, essentially, a weak cleanser, so for many of us (me included), our hair will not feel as clean as we&#x27;re used to.  Ok... the scent.  I read the reviews about the scent before buying it, so I was aware of the controversy.  When I first opened the bottle, I thought &amp;#34;Oh, delicious!&amp;#34;  There was no apple scent, but it was like being up close and personal with a fresh cinnamon bun. It smelled of rich vanilla frosting and cinnamon.  I was so excited to use it!  In the shower, the scent changed.  As I worked it through my hair, it turned into the same smell as a cheap,generic-brand fall candle you find at the grocery store.  Seemed like all the delicious vanilla scent evaporated, and I was just left with the spice.  Unfortunately, that cheap scent is the one that stayed in my hair.</li>
            <li> A little to sweet smelling but it was ok</li>
            <li> I love what Wen does for my hair but don&#x27;t like any of the regular scents. The seasonal scents are much better.WInter Vanilla MInt was my all time favorite but now it has a rival! I love, love, love fall apple spice!!! My kids and husband LOVE the way my hair smells. Thanks for another great scent!</li>
            <li> Love the product!  I have been using WEN cleansing conditioners for over a year now and I love how clean and shiny my hair is.  This particular fragrance is very nice, perfect for the fall season.</li>
            <li> My favorite WEN so far, I purchased it since it is one of the newer in his line and I tend to try them ALL and was not sure what to expect with my long, thick, difficult to manage hair (think mixed chicks hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This WEN has left my hair smooth, supple, shiny and extraordinary manageable more so than any of the others. The scent is reminiscent of an Autumn Spice Cake, a warm Apple Crisp, etc., it may not be apple per se but it has that fresh, sweet deliciousness of so many treats that apples make an appearance in or are the star of, especially at this time of year.</li>
            <li> I HATE this stuff. The smell is SO overwhelming. When I perspire, the smell is 10 times worse or more. If I perspire at night, it wakes me up! If I&#x27;m working out, you&#x27;ve got it: The smell takes over and it&#x27;s AWFUL. I even sent some to my cousin in another state to try, Figured if she liked it I&#x27;d take the bottle with me when I visit and she could have it. SHE doesn&#x27;t even want it! Can&#x27;t even GIVE it away because of the smell Take these one star reviews to heart: it&#x27;s AWFUL. What was Chaz thinking when he released this. Nothing he&#x27;s ever released is even CLOSELY as terrible as this!</li>
            <li> The product itself works great.  Is the only reason that it even got one star&lt;br /&gt;I am a WEN girl.. love my WEN cleanser, . but the smell of this one was NOT for me&lt;br /&gt;Way too strong.  Not an apple smell,  but an over powering maple syrup smell&lt;br /&gt;  Wish Chaz would bring back the previous Fall Pumpkin  That was fabulous !</li>
            <li> Otherwise I notice no difference at all. Maybe it is not meant for African American Hair. Wouldn&#x27;t waste my money again, will just stick to my regular regime.</li>
            <li> If you have curly or unmanageable hair - I highly recommend you try Wen.  I was skeptical at first as I&#x27;ve never had good luck with products claiming to &amp;#34;tame the frizz&amp;#34;.  I tried several other cleansing conditioners with marginal success so I decided to try Wen to see if it was really any better than its competition.  In my opinion it is hands down the best cleanser for dry, curly, frizzy hair.  The only negative mark is the scent - I&#x27;ve tried three different ones and while they are all wonderful, they are VERY strong.</li>
            <li> Now that Fall is almost here, gotta have Apple Spice!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it must be made of fairy wishes because it is both perfect and godawful expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks great, everyday washing at 8 pumps per shower and I&#x27;ve got great results - got it during the Christmas season &amp; am just running out now in mid-January. So, bottle lasts about a month, ~$35 a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is going to be an EXPENSIVE habit.</li>
            <li> This scent is a awful scent, have to use it because it expensive!  Wen is usually great but this one I give a thumbs down.</li>
            <li> Love this &amp;#34;non-shampoo&amp;#34;.  Kept my color longer, leaves hair smooth, soft and silky.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little over powering. My husband says it makes him crave waffles.  The smell has lasted in my hair without washing it for 2 days.  Smell aside, it still works great like WEN should.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years now and I absolutely love the way it makes my hair feel!  Made me a believer</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair soft but I don&#x27;t see any real difference in it.  I guess my hair isn&#x27;t special enough to start with - the girls in the WEN ads already have great hair.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again, probably won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My wife says it is a bit pricey for what it does</li>
            <li> This is the very best product for your hair. My hair is soft, shinny, manageable, and your scalp always feels hydrated. I would recommend this product to anyone. Any combination of contents works. Once you use this you won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I love Wen products , however this one has a very odd scent ...nothing like apples at all. More like a strange maple syrup aroma. Won&#x27;t be getting this one again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Sweet Almond and love it - tried this to mix it up and am not super impressed. It makes your hair smell like a cupcake (which isn&#x27;t the worst) but it also doesn&#x27;t feel as light and clean as the other Wen products I&#x27;ve tried. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for mixed girl hair (curly and fine).</li>
            <li> Bought this through Amazon because I wanted to try it without getting roped into an automatic monthly delivery. I absolutely love it! I had only used it twice before going to my hairdresser and she said my hair felt great and to keep using whatever I was using. She really didn&#x27;t know alot about Wen but it sure helped out my hair. Will keep ordering through Amazon because I only order it when I&#x27;m running low plus I only need the Cleansing Conditioner and the Treatment Mist. I don&#x27;t need all the products that come in the package ordered through Wen. Highly recommend Wen products.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair greasy and flat.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like the smell. Just recently had a bundle of joy so smell still bothers me lol. Besides that, I&#x27;m a WEN  girl. Does exactly what Chaz says it does and I have different textures though mostly 4c. Shampoo,  blaahh. Never again.</li>
            <li> Smells like glade air freshener!! Not a good scent !</li>
            <li> Like the smell. To heavy for daily use for me.</li>
            <li> For the love of GOD this stuff STINKS to high heaven!!!  It doesn&#x27;t smell of natural ingredients either, but rather of chemicals.  Every time my wife uses it I get a tremendous headache.  If you are sensitive to fragrances, stay far, far away!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely thrilled with the way my hair feels after using this product.  I may never return to traditional shampoos.  Though, I am in the habit of only shampooing two or three times a week, I have found when I do so with WEN, my hair doesn&#x27;t get oily between shampoos unless I&#x27;ve been exercising and sweating excessively.  It&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The loss of one star on this product is a result of the scent.  I typically LOVE apple spice/fall scented things, but I am also prone to scent triggered migraines.  Unfortunately I find this scent overpowering.  It&#x27;s nice after the hair is dry, but wet in the shower, it is just too strong and reminds me more of a Glade air freshener than a shampoo.  For such a lovely, healthy hair product, I would like to see natural oils used for scent instead of fake fragrance/parfum.  Come on WEN!  It&#x27;s better for all of us to use natural fragrances.  From what I am reading in other review some of the other WEN scents are less overpowering, so it is likely I will purchase one of those, because I LOVE how the product works for my hair!</li>
            <li> Came sealed so at least I know it was a real WEN product, I like it but it still feels strange not to wash my hair with shampoo. Be careful not to use too much as a leave in conditioner can make hair oily. Love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this! The scent is just over powering! It almost comes to the point of making me ill. I am forced to use it because I can&#x27;t pay all this money to throw it away!  I like cinnamon, but this is awful!  Also it is so thick the pump does not work! I know this is the reason because I cleaned it out and used it on water and it worked just fine! I think it is so thick because it is very old stock. (it is not in the Wen catalog anymore!) I have used other scents and everything was fine! This was just terrible!</li>
            <li> love the smell of this shampoo. Very fall.</li>
            <li> I have been using the almond mint cleansing cream for years.  I got this scent on a whim and it is awful!  Not only is the smell a sickening sweet smell the clings to you it has made my hair greasy and lifeless.  My psoriasis on my scalp has also flared up terribly while using it.  I have tossed it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel great! Has different smells. Sometimes smells like maple syrup and others cinn apple.</li>
            <li> My husband likes Wen, but the smell of the apple is too strong for him.</li>
            <li> I love WEN Cleansing Conditioner, but this stuff smells horrible and it lingers on all day!  To me it smells nothing like apple.  It smells like really sweet custard or egg nog with a hint of cinnamon.</li>
            <li> It really, really does work.  I was a skeptic and emotionally didn&#x27;t like the sensation of no shampoo which strips hair.&lt;br /&gt;So for the first few times, I shampooed with regular shampoo, then shampooed with WEN.  By the 3rd day I ditched the traditional shampoo and use just the WEN.  Wish I&#x27;d switched to WEN sooner.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent by Wen! Chaz captured everything I love about fall and put it in a bottle! The moment I opened the bottle, it reminded me of fall candles, baking, crisp air and leaves - it&#x27;s perfect. I almost didn&#x27;t buy it because of the not so good reviews, but I am so happy I did.</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time (being a Wen user for the last 6 months), and while the results are standard, the smell is ... well, I feel like I just took a shower with a Caramel Apple.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not rating it 5 stars because while I like caramel apples, I&#x27;m not sure I want to walk around smelling like one. The scent as other reviewers have said, is pretty strong in the shower. It does mellow out to a more apple scent afterwards, but then you get the whiffs of Caramel through the day.&lt;br /&gt;Not all together unpleasant, but not my preference. (Right now I&#x27;m a big Winter Mint fan, hope they bring that back next season!)&lt;br /&gt;For now, it&#x27;s going to a friend who is very much into Caramel Apples, so will not be wasted!</li>
            <li> The scent is strong, yes. But if you don&#x27;t wash your hair daily the scent really is lessened on the second day. I&#x27;ve had my cleanser for about 3 days and I&#x27;ve washed my hair twice, the scent is not overpowering as of right now.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I washed my hair, I was disappointed, I expected more. I asked my fb friends who use Wen and they told me it does take time. That makes sense, it has to take time to moisturize my very long damaged hair. My second washing was better. I used more product and left it on longer. I have approximated that I will use an entire bottle every month. Yes, Wen is pricy, but, I can see already that it will be replacing many of my products that I use daily. I&#x27;ve ordered a kit off of the Wen site, lavender this time, because at $40, I think it&#x27;ll be well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love...love the smell..love how much better my hair feels...love that I don&#x27;t have any more scalp issues!!!</li>
            <li> Fragrance is overpowering and I found that I have to wash my hair more then before.  I have curly and thick hair. It would be nice to try it without the fragrance.</li>
            <li> It leave the hair so clean and soft.  Great scent.</li>
            <li> I love WEN Cleansing Condition, but this particular one, Fall Apple Spice, just smells musky or moldy which is not a pleasant fragrance for your hair.</li>
            <li> I love the Wen conditioner, the Fall Apple Spice has a nice scent to it. It does not smell like apples but to me this does not have a strong cinnamon smell either,it is more like a Yankee candle or a spiced backed good  with nutmeg and cinnamon mixed together but not at all like straight cinnamon. I have also read reviews stating that it is strong smelling and does not go away, I do not have these problems. When i first get out of the shower and my hair is wet the scent is stronger then when my hair is dry but my boyfriend has to be next to me (kissing me or is standing close enough that his nose is near my hair) to smell the Spice scent. When my hair is dry, even with holding it to my nose, the scent is faint and in 24 hours the smell is gone.&lt;br /&gt;I have colored my hair for many year and a lot of time i have to strip my hair before placing the color(blues, greens and reds) so my hair has started to look faded, but I noticed after washing with this a few times my hair has a nice rich color again and is really soft. I have thick straight hair that comes just below my shoulder blades and i only need 8 pumps each wash. I get my hair saturated with water and them work the conditioner in at the beginning of my shower and wait until the end of my shower to wash it out.</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of the sweet almond mint.  It is horrible, made my hair greasy and un manageable.  I would not recommend this apple spice for anyone.  And by the way, my hair started falling out the second day I used it.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Hair feels great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several wen products. This was not one of my favorites. The smell was heavy like maple syrup. Product was as promised and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent! This is my second bottle</li>
            <li> Smells great find my self sniffing my hair it&#x27;s Pumpkin spice!&lt;br /&gt;You use such a small amount it&#x27;s worth it😊</li>
            <li> I love WEN!!!!! It totally has transformed my hair, making it softer and stronger</li>
            <li> Smell was a little bit too sweet. My hair is normal and looked greasy by the end of the day. More for people with dry hair, curly hair,  not for straight hair that is already soft and shiny. I ended up giving this to my sister that has dry, curly hair and she likes it, except for the smell.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, kind of like Dutch Apple Pie,  and my hair feels really healthy.  Shipping was prompt.  Arrived intact.</li>
            <li> I think the smell of it is too intense, it does work the same though.</li>
            <li> This smells like your favorite fall candle. Does not have a sweet apple smell, but more like a caramel spice smell. I love this smell for the fall/winter. My other seasonal favorite is the coconut smell for summer. I have not tried the pumpkin yet, so I can&#x27;t compare this one to that. As far as conditioning, like many of the other flavors, it leaves my hair feeling great!!! I am confident with buying any Wen product that its going to nourish my hair and leave it healthy. Now I just buy it for the smell, because no matter which one I use, I&#x27;m happy with how it makes my hair look and feel. Love this one for sure!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note for those who have left bad feedback for Wen, I also wash my hair with regular shampoo before using Wen. If I only use the Wen without shampooing, it leaves my hair not feeling quite as clean. But using this as an after shampoo conditioner is awesome!! There is no other conditioner on the market that makes my hair feel the way Wen does.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait for the weather to cool down to use the Apple Spice! Wen is pricey but worth it. Been happy with all the other varieties that I have purchased so far, and my hair color does not seem faded at all. Gotten compliments on how good my hair looks overall.</li>
            <li> I love the smell! Love, love, love the way it makes your hair feel! Damaged hair gets repair. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love wen and it works amazing but this scent is misleading and it smells horrible, I feel the need to warn my other wen users, it smells like hazelnuts and syrup, no apple scent at all. I was so excited to see an apple scent, it was a waste I gave the whole bottle away.</li>
            <li> Fast service as usual. I do so love this new smell, very fall like. This size is great for my swim bag!</li>
            <li> I love Wen hair products. I used to get my monthly delivery, but it was just too much products they send you .&lt;br /&gt;So I discontinued it, and that&#x27;s the fine prints after receiving your special promo. Otherwise, it&#x27;s worth to try it.&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive for a 16 oz. shampoo or conditioner, but its damn good. I wish it&#x27;s cheaper,and easy to buy somewhere&lt;br /&gt;else, other than signing up with Wen. So I chose &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34;, the place to order without commitment or contract.</li>
            <li> I have been using WEN for two years and absolutely love it!!!  Everything Chaz says about his products is 100% true!!  However, the Fall Apple Spice just did not smell good to me. I liked last year&#x27;s seasonal scent better--Pumpkin Spice. Going back to my fav scent--FIG!!!!</li>
            <li> Made my daughters hair look and feel greasy although we followed the directions. Also tried to adjust the amount used to no avail.</li>
            <li> I typically love Wen products, however, this particular one has a very high concentration of alcohol. And b/c of that it  stripped the color right out of my hair! The Wen Lavender scent has a very low concentration so, stick to that one. And if the high alcohol content &amp; color stripping isn&#x27;t enough to keep you away from the Fall Apple scent maybe the fact that you stink like a walking candle WILL.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best hair product. I have searched high and low for the best hair product and this is it. My hair is healthy, shinny and I can officially say I have new hair growth.</li>
            <li> I am an African American female with short natural hair that is curly. I LOVE WEN and will use nothing else! I have used sulfur free shampoos from Carol&#x27;s Daughter and other hair care lines. I thought squeaky clean was the way to go....NOT. WEN cleans my hair without stripping. I used to have to wash my hair once a week when using other shampoos. I would get dandruff flakes. With WEN I can go twice as long and do not get the flakes. The price is worth having beautiful soft hair.</li>
            <li> Eww.  I love WEN products, but this one could put you in a sugar coma!  Horribly sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> Smells like an apple orchard with a touch of Carmel.. A lot of people don&#x27;t like this product and that&#x27;s because they expect lather which there is none and they don&#x27;t rinse the product out enough which my daughter did the 1st time she used it and made her hair feel grease and heavy.  If you use it correctly it makes your hair feel light and silky smooth!!! I Love It!!!</li>
            <li> I did use this conditioner after coloring my hair.  not a good idea! my scalp was burning and i smelled a chemical reaction! maybe i have sensitive skin?</li>
            <li> The product itself works fine. The scent is really overpowering and more baked good smelling than apple. Almost like rubbing cookie dough in your hair!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of the apple spice,it&#x27;s a nice change. Real clean smelling.  : )</li>
            <li> I love Wen! This scent is a bit strong, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I smell the cinnamon more than the apple scent. But overall, I love its&#x27; creamy texture &amp; how healthy it makes my hair feel. I would definitely recommend this product! It did come with a pump, which is a plus if you don&#x27;t have another one laying around from your previous Wen container. Arrived much earlier than expected too!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and manageable while smelling great!</li>
            <li> Scenario: most effective shampoo on the market has critics raving. It thickens your hair and makes it grow twice as fast!! The catch is it smells like vomit. Who is buying some??? Not me!&lt;br /&gt;If you have the most amazing/effective hair products on the market but their scent does not appeal to me, I will never touch it. To be fair this shampoo does not smell like vomit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love the way Wen works. It has dramatically improved my hair over the last 2 years. I have that curly thick hair that loves to misbehave. Wen tames it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this one star based of the scent. If you enjoy the smell of potpourri mixed with mild apple and a very strong spiced beeswax vanilla candle ... This shampoo is for you. It is like walking into Lush and they featured spiced products.  It is way too much for me. And I do not like smelling like a spiced candle. It is overpowering. The apple scent gets lost somewhere along the way and the remaining scent gave me headache.  It smells very strong before you shampoo and I had hoped it would rince out differently ...  and that the argon oil I use would cover the smell. No dice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual conditioning shampoo worked just as well as it normally does. Just be cautious of the smell. Sorry Wen.  I will donate this bottle and return to my Almond Mint.</li>
            <li> There are mixed reviews about the scent, and I too was wishing it was more apple and less spice... but my husband LOVED the scent and I have to admit I did smell like autumn. Did not weigh my hair down, but also did not give my thick color treated hair enough conditioning power. I ended up using it as more of a leave in conditioner most of the time.</li>
            <li> Sometimes seems a little heavy on hair.</li>
            <li> smelled a little smokey, but made my hair fuller and softer. I just don,t understand the amount they say to use. If I would use 14 pumps I would have half a cup of shampoo. I use 4 pumps on med length hair and it is enough. I will try other scents when this is gone because I am very pleased with how my hair feels.</li>
            <li> love the smell, you&#x27;ll like it if you like yankee candle apple spice/fall smell, etc</li>
            <li> wen is amazing, obviously. i am only offering feedback on this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not apple, but it&#x27;s luscious. it smells as much like apple as an apple fritter... the whole scent is apple fritter dipped in a soy chai latte... flavored candy. there&#x27;s definitely a candy coating to the whole thing that seems detached somehow, like they wanted to sweeten the fragrance, but couldn&#x27;t quite get it to blend. it&#x27;s wonderful on your hair, but in the shower it&#x27;s a bit much, like huffing a vanilla/brown sugar yankee candle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re a fan of the pumpkin and you want to level up on the omgiwant2eaturhairNAHW, you&#x27;ll love this. if you prefer the lavender or the tea tree oil, steer clear of this sugar-n-spice bomb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen for years. I&#x27;ve bought right from the Chaz website and from QVC. I ran out and purchased from Amazon because shipping was faster. I knew based on other reviews the smell is either hit or miss. For me it was a miss. Like many others state it smells like a Yankee candle and it has a very strong maple smell to it. I don&#x27;t like it at all. It was also odd that it really seemed to dry my hair out and make it feel straw like. My hair loves Wen so I was really disappointed that this didn&#x27;t work for me at all. Pumpkin spice however is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Gotta love wen products</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this one, it reminds me of a really sweet perfumed candle. My favorite is the bamboo green tea, that one smells really fresh and clean</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as the traditional sweet almond version.  Also this scent was a little odd and strong.  Not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about this fragrance, but still a great hair product.</li>
            <li> love the product and service!!!! Smells super! My hairdresser says she wants to eat my hair:)</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say that this scent does not work at all for me.  It reminds me too much of a Yankee Candle---the smell has some sort of after scent that just turns my stomach.  If you like Yankee Candles then you will probably love this.  The smell lingers in your hair and on your towel.  I wish the other WEN  scents lingered like this one!</li>
            <li> this fall apple by chaz dean smells so good i wish i could eat it. my hair feels so good and when i went to go get a hsir cut the lady said wow soft hair. week of use and i do four pumps in my hair. short hair</li>
            <li> I figured it would have a more apple/fruity smell to it, but thats not the case at all. It smells like a candle from walmart. If you want to walk around smelling like a candle, then by all means, this one is for you! Other than that, I think its terrible</li>
            <li> As a devoted Wen user, I was looking forward to trying this seasonal product.  However, the strong smell lingered for the 24 hours, until I washed my hair.  Even the pillow slip smelled like spiced apple!  it was overpowering!</li>
            <li> This is my second WEN product.  Left my hair greasy and the smell was overwhelming.  Tried it one more time today and decided to return it.  But it&#x27;s too late.  Don&#x27;t think this product is for my hair type which is fine, gray and slightly frizzy.</li>
            <li> Its the best smells great and my hair is so soft I am never gonna use anything else thank u chaz</li>
            <li> I bought for my mom, and she loves it, her hair now is fuller and with shine</li>
            <li> Smell was really strong! Nice for fall. I like the clean scent of bamboo green tree!</li>
            <li> she loved this always wanted to try it</li>
            <li> It was okay. I doubt that I&#x27;ll buy any more.</li>
            <li> I have seen the commercials for this product for literally years and never thought much about it other than it couldn&#x27;t possibly work. I mean, it&#x27;s NOT a shampoo??  Come on. How could it possibly work?? But let me tell you. It DOES work. I have very curly, dry and overprocessed hair because I color it (I&#x27;m middle aged and vain, what can I say) and so my hair is like a SPONGE. You can almost HEAR it sucking the water up in the shower. Anyway, I always have a mess to deal with and end up looking like Roseanne Roseannadanna on a humid day. So I decided to give this a try. The scent, first off, is akin to a reallllly great, expensive candle from Yankee or some Scentsy wax melts. It is very strong and delicious. It smells vaguely of a cookie candle, but somehow a tad appley. It&#x27;s sweet and lovely. And you DO use a lot of this stuff on your hair, especially if you have very long hair like I do. But your hair will be SQUEAKY clean. I mean it. It will be squeaky and shiny and soft and manageable. You will love it. Now the downside. The price. I bet I will get probably a month&#x27;s worth of shampoos...excuse me...cleanings...for this thirty bucks. And if you have less hair, obviously you would get a lot more, maybe twice as many, idk. My hair is to my waist almost. So...consider if you want to spend the money. Now, the good thing is, after your wash, you can use a tiny amount as a leave-in conditioner and it will smell and look fabulous. My 18 yr old daughter even commented on my hair as being so bouncy and lovely the first time I used it. So if you want to try it, it&#x27;s only a small investment, especially if you buy the 6 oz bottle to try it. I decided to buy the 16 oz because it was only a few bucks more. Your call, but trust me on this one. This stuff is great. Now...another thought....there is a product that is pretty much the same as this one called a &amp;#34;cowash&amp;#34; sold here on Amazon. As I Am Coconut Cowash is a third the price for the same amount. I have seen NO difference in the outcome of my hair. It is gorgeous. The biggest difference is the Wen has a pump, the Wen has that gorgeous scent (the coconut cowash smells delish but is not this apple cookie concoction) and the Wen is a bit thicker. They BOTH have alcohol, but this, I believe, is the cleaning agent...the Wen has aloe vera in it, which I am allergic to, although it has not produced any issues yet. So...there you have it. Either use Wen or get a &amp;#34;cowash&amp;#34; (short for conditioning wash) and forget that shampoo and detergent stripping your hair!ence in the outcome of my hair. It is gorgeous. The biggest difference is the Wen has a pump, the Wen has that gorgeous scent (the coconut cowash smells delish but is not this apple cookie concoction) and the Wen is a bit thicker. They BOTH have alcohol, but this, I believe, is the cleaning agent...the Wen has aloe vera in it, which I am allergic to, although it has not produced any issues yet. So...there you have it. Either use Wen or get a &amp;#34;cowash&amp;#34; (short for conditioning wash) and forget that shampoo and detergent stripping your hair!</li>
            <li> Smells great. I do think my hair is healrhier after using this. My young-adult daughters love it.</li>
            <li> First of all, the pump was defective. Second of all, the product does not cleanse my hair at all. My hair actually looks dirtier AFTER using Wen! And I&#x27;m careful to rinse all of it out, so I don&#x27;t know why my hair looks so nasty. When I use other shampoos, my hair looks shiny and normal. And yeah, the apple scent is gross. What a ripoff! $35 for a \\&quot;cleansing conditioner\\&quot; that makes your hair look filthy! Rolling around in the mud would be free.</li>
            <li> my fav of all the wen products, price stinks</li>
            <li> Love it although smell is strong</li>
            <li> Smells great, but made hair very greasy feeling!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless dryness is your problem!</li>
            <li> It smells weird, like a spice cake.  I had coworkers and strangers remarking on the odd smell.</li>
            <li> Love the product but the shipping time and charges were crazy</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  My hair stylist love it too,  She takes the extra time to wash and blow dry my hair just so she can smell it and fill the shop with this lovely scent.  I am not a fan of strong scents.  Some say this is too strong.............I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the reviews...followed directions, which I could HARDLY see, and I didn&#x27;t see much difference if any...I have to say that the smell is nice....but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.....seriously</li>
            <li> Bacon grease would do essentially the same thing this product makes your hair feel like! Over priced. If you like the \\&quot;greaser, flat hair\\&quot; look. Don&#x27;t Get this over blown, over priced junk!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this for several weeks now and I am pleased with how this product works. My hair isn&#x27;t as dry and doesn&#x27;t look oily. It is also easier to style and looks nicer. After saying that, this stuff smells HORRIBLE! The results are not worth dealing with the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it a friend of mine came over and asked what was that smell. I said it was my new shampoo and she told me to take it back. After a couple of uses, I was cuddling with my hubby when he looked at me and said \\&quot;I thought you were going to return that stuff.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up it smells like cheap dollar store potpourri that has been on the shelf way past its half life. My friend said it smells like the bowl of dusty potpourri that sits next to the bowl of old hard candy glued together on the coffee table at her grandmas nursing home. This sounds way harsh, but it is very true. I am a 35ish year old who stills wants to smell and look pretty, not remind someone of their grandma.</li>
            <li> Cleans and conditions well but didn&#x27;t care for the scent.</li>
            <li> I should know by now that if it&#x27;s a spice + something in Wen&#x27;s conditioners for scent, the spice will kill the something! This smells like pure maple syrup. I don&#x27;t smell any apple at all. I don&#x27;t know why they are so heavy handed with the spice and nothing on the fruit,in this case apple- last time pumpkin. Such a shame. Should have apple first then a hint of maple- now that would be a hit!</li>
            <li> Scent is nice but too strong.</li>
            <li> wife uses it all the time</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Love the scent!  Made my hair healthy!</li>
            <li> Love all wen products this smells great !</li>
            <li> I so wanted to love this...its way to heavy after the first few uses. If it had only remained like the first week, but after that, my hair went limp, not bouncy and clean feeling. That said, I use it once or twice a week as a break from my other shampoo with pretty good results. Just wish It would have been \\&quot;the one.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product. Smells really good. Worked nicely after the first 2 washes, after that my hair was left sooooo greasy and gross. Will never buy this again. I use it now once a month more as a deep conditioner so that it&#x27;s not a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Love this product</li>
            <li> The smell is awful awful awful. Half of my house smells like this weird nasty vaguely apple smell. I went and found my pumpkin hair spray (that went with last year&#x27;s shampoo) to overpower this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smelled like cough syrup in the bottle but I decided to give it a chance - BAD idea. Go back to pumpkin for fall forrrr sure.</li>
            <li> broke me out and made my hair oily it also stinks. this product sucks. it is not wortth the money. it smells like curry, bad curry.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! I have used this for six months and I am very happy with it!!! Much better than my old shampoo!</li>
            <li> i would recommend this to anyone, as long as they get a different scented bottle. smells like that generic apple spice that smells awful.</li>
            <li> WEN is brilliant and I actually like this scent (though it is really strong!), but that this flavor is sort of a brown/off red in color. I&#x27;m a light platinum blonde and I do think it has a toning effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> This is too thick and leaves my hair feeling heavy and lifeless.</li>
            <li> Reading these reviews and seeing the label, Chaz warns if products are not purchased from his official website, salon or QVC there is no guarantee it is the real deal. These prices seem too good to be true!</li>
            <li> I love the WEN hair product line.  Although this cleansing conditioner helped my hair to look and feel nice...it smells NOTHING like apples.  This cleanser definitely smells spicy...and not the apple pie kind.  My husband told me that my hair smells like curry.  It took two washes with the almond mint cleanser to get the scent out.  Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Wish i had listened to the reviews regarding the smell :( the smell is so overpowering, i can still smell today after washing in a different shampoo. Very disapponted with this WEN product.....</li>
            <li> Ive read reviews where people complained about the scent not being what they &amp;#34;thought it SHOULD be&amp;#34;.  Ive been a WEN user for 4 years, and feel very fortunate to have found a high quality product that actually helps my long, coarse, thick, curly hair.  I would describe the scent as a fall cinnamon scent that my husband actually complimented 2 hours after using.  I tried this product because the price was GREAT for a 16oz bottle, but now that I have it, Im LOVE it and will def order more.  Im glad WEN doesnt compromise quality to make the product smell like comfort food.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my fine hair and saves me time! I have tried lots of different products with no success. I won&#x27;t use anything else ever again!</li>
            <li> The Fall Apple Spice smells just wonderful and it works just as well as the Lavender Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wen Cleansing Conditioner works wonders for fine, dried out hair.  Highly recommend it,&lt;br /&gt;even it is costly.  I could tell the difference in only 2 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try to purchase more of this same fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love the WEN products but just dont like this smell in particular.  It smells like a candle I have burnt.  I will continue with the products just not this particular one.</li>
            <li> I have been using WEN for a while and I have noticed my hair seems thicker as it is growing in.  My hair seems to be back to what it was like 20 years ago.  Thx Chaz</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing but I felt this really dried out my color treated hair. I&#x27;m VERY disappointed as most of the wen products are amazing. Not actually sure this is 100% authentic since I&#x27;ve never had this problem before.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this formula.  The smell is amazing.  It even smells great on day 2!  It got my hair really clean and soft.  My hair seems to stay clean longer when I use the seasonal products.  This one is my favorite, hands down.  I have had several people tell me my hair smells amazing, even on day 2!!!  I will buy this any time they have it.  I got 2 bottles this season.</li>
            <li> This has the best scent of any WEN I have used.  I can now wash my naturally curly hair every other day, instead of daily, and it is nice and soft.  My color seems to stay true longer (not turn brassy).  I notice that the curl has relaxed some, but there is no frizziness at all.  Wish it was a little less expensive, though.</li>
            <li> The smell makes me nauseous.  It is so bad that I won&#x27;t use it and have wasted money on it.  I love Wen products usually as they do make my hair stronger and less prone to break.  But I cannot get past how bad this one smells.</li>
            <li> I love Wen, but this scent is awful.</li>
            <li> Great &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34;  I used it years ago when I didn&#x27;t have long hair.  I have long hair now, as my son and husband don&#x27;t want me to cut it.  I thought I would try it again; I liked it back then and still do.  I doesn&#x27;t have a lather like regular shampoo which I had forgotten.  Very soft and no tangles when I took the towel off.  Love the cinnamon smell.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and lingers on your hair all day long. Aside from the smell, wen is the best shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have used Wen Cleansing Conditioner continuously for at least a two years.  It is a great product for color-treated hair and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the Wen Cleansing Conditioner but the smell is horrible.  I will never buy the Fall Apple Spice scent again, I wish I could return.  It smells like burnt caramel and nothing like Apple!!  Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li> The smell was so strong and sickly sweet it literally made me sick.  Smelled more like chemicals, caramel and spice than apple.  Have liked other Wen products in the past. Should have trusted other reviews and passed on this item.</li>
            <li> Have already loved WEN cleansing conditioner, but I just love the smell of this one. The scent seems to stay longer than the others.</li>
            <li> I like it and it smells good. This is my 2nd time buying it.</li>
            <li> Love! Smells amazing and works wonders!</li>
            <li> Terrible smell. unfortunatelly I did not read de reviews before ordering it. My husband has asked me to stop using it. I hope the makers realize how bad it is and discontinue it.</li>
            <li> My favorite so far!! I will be buying more and hope to see more New scents in the near future</li>
            <li> I have used Wen for over 2 years now.  It is the only hair cleaner for me.  My hair is always looking shiny and lovely.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the great product. My hair is sooo soft and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> When I first opened it I was put off by the smell, but after it reached room temperature from shipment, it seemed to calm a bit. It is also thicker than the almond version, and I did like the smell after I washed my hair was not too strong, but still like the almond better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to start with I love WEN. I feel like its a great product and keeps my hair healthy. My negative review is because this &#x27;flavor&#x27; sent... whatever - STINKS. It smells exactly like an air freshener from a truck stop bathroom. Try WEN - but stick with the original scents.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why they even used &amp;#34;apple&amp;#34; as a description for this.  It smelled nothing like apples.  It was awful.  It smelled like a cheap holiday candle from the dollar store.  It was also thicker and oilier than the usual product.  I will not buy this scent again!  Buyer be warned...</li>
            <li> I am not totally convienced this is an authentic product by wen. I had been using Wen for over a year when I order this one. Once I used this my hair begin to break and become damaged. I used this in my son&#x27;s hair and noticed that it was a little lathering (something that Wen doesn&#x27;t do) so I then threw the rest of the bottle away.  This stuff smells great but sucks. Would not use it on a pet.</li>
            <li> I love WEN hair care products , they make my hair soft and easy to style.... I just do not like the scent of this product.</li>
            <li> Lovvveeee the smell i love love love the smell of cinnamon and this was perfect and this stuff is absolutely amazing for my hair!!!</li>
            <li> Everything was excellent, just as posted. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Excellent turn around time , product delivered as described.</li>
            <li> the directions are very small, hard to read, it is a very thick product, I think I have figured out how to use it, it replaces shampoo, conditioner and leave in conditioner, my hair seems a lot fuller after using it..have to wait and see how it continues to work, but so far I like it, love the smell on your hair, it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything but Wen shampoo conditioner.  Leaves your hair very silky smooth.  I have super long rather coarse hair and with Wen and straightener my hair feels awesome!</li>
            <li> I really like this scent. After using it, my husband complimented me on how nice my hair smelled. I love all WEN products.</li>
            <li> Love Wen Cleansing conditioner. Hate this scent! Kind of like cheap potpourri only lasts longer.  Stick with the mint almond. Just sayin</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to earlier reviews saying how bad this smelled, but I liked the Ginger Pumpkin and decided to give this one a try.  Big mistake!  I didn&#x27;t like it on the first use, and the second time it smelled even worse than the first, if that was possible.  I don&#x27;t know how to describe it - to me, it smells like an auto mechanics shop, petroleum-like.  I threw it away and ordered the Ginger Pumpkin, so I could celebrate Fall with a decent aroma.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful.  Not so much like apple spice, but more like maple syrup.  It kept me awake the first night I used it because the smell was amazing, but when I woke up my hair was silky smooth.  Usually it is a crazy mess if I go to sleep with it wet.  Can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents.  Looking at reviews I want to try the pumpkin one.  Just hoping it comes down in price.  Ugh!</li>
            <li> I love the product Wen, but not a fan of this one.  It is extra thick and heavy, and the scent is too much.  It&#x27;s definitely a spiced apple, but too strong of a spice scent.  It lingers in my hair for a couple of days.  It almost reminds me of a smoker who tried to cover up the cigarette smell in their hair with an apple cinnamon spray.  Too expensive to throw out, I can&#x27;t wait until the bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money ladies and gentlemen. It&#x27;s all hype because all this product does is cost a lot of money and make your hair like a limp biscuit. It&#x27;s an absolute fail for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using Wen so I can&#x27;t speak to its performance. However, the scent of this one just is just too much! I went for it despite other reviews because I love keeping with the seasons, but this makes my hair smell like one big yankee candle. It&#x27;s almost enough to give me  headache. The scent itself is okay, its just way to strong.</li>
            <li> Smells like fall&lt;br /&gt;Love wen</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love the smell.  So getting more.  Go Chaz!.</li>
            <li> Return was very smooth. Opened it up and couldn&#x27;t stand the smell so I didn&#x27;t even use.</li>
            <li> Was not for me but works nice. I did not care for the scent....it was very nutty.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair super greasy. Not a good product.</li>
            <li> Not your usual apple fragrance.  It has maple undertones to it.  I can&#x27;t use this product as it is designed, but I like it as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is much softer and smells awesome!!!! Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen products for a couple of years.  The Fall Apple Spice is my favorite</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that not only works well, but smells great and actually lasts.  I will definitely be ordering this again!!</li>
            <li> Great Item, fast shipping ....Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love wen and the reason I didn&#x27;t give this one 5 stars is because it has a very strong spiced smell which I don&#x27;t mind and its not strong once your hair is dry. But the spice is so strong that you don&#x27;t smell any apple in it so I was a little disappointed about that but still love this scent!</li>
            <li> Fragrance is great. Haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in my hair. Same with pumpkin fragrance.</li>
            <li> Used Wen for several years now.  I realize that this product is just what my hair needed.  Love it!  Decided to try a new fragrance with the Fall Apple Spice scent.</li>
            <li> The smell is sickening. I love WEN and the other scents are good, but this one is disgusting!! Hopefully I can return it without the cost and trouble not being prohibitive so that it is not worth it. I would actually like another one sent to replace it free of charge, because this one is so bad I cannot guess it&#x27;s just me that cant stand it! It should be taken out of circulation!!  :  ) I would like any other scent (almond, pomegranet, orange blossom, fig, cucumber, etc, ) instead of this!!</li>
            <li> Fabulous. Make hair feel full, shiny and soft. Can miss a day to wash hair too.</li>
            <li> OMG, it smells amazing. Wish all the Wen cleansers smelled as strong as this one. My husband says my hair smells like &amp;#34;fall&amp;#34;..he loved it. It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I have long, thin, brown hair but I have a lot of it and it tends to get greasy the day after a wash . I&#x27;ve been anxious to try this product for years now and I was very disappointed. My hair was SO greasy immediately after the first wash that it looked like I had Vaseline in it. I figured I&#x27;d give it 2 weeks but I never made it passed week 1 because my hair was so built up with grease and gunk it was disgusting! Happy for those of you this worked for.. Just wasn&#x27;t meant for me.</li>
            <li> I agree with others -- the fragrance is not good.  It smells like a bad attempt at caramel.  I can&#x27;t believe this company that charges so much for its products can&#x27;t get something as basic as fragrance right.  Otherwise, it works fine if you don&#x27;t mind the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing conditioner. The scent  is so wonderful, perfect for fall and winter.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like apples but more of a warm spice. I&#x27;ve had many compliments.  I have curly wavy hair that gets frizzy very easily.  With Wen I find that my hair stays hydrated, without being oily, even after I put products in it. My hair is soft and manageable. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING!! Leaves my hair nice and soft. :-) I use this as a conditioner after using Denorex (a must for me).</li>
            <li> My wife is very meticulous about her hair and this is a very important part of her routine.</li>
            <li> I have been using wen for years, but always peppermint or other flavors.  For some reason this one is way too strong on the smell and feels that it doesn&#x27;t clean my hair as well as other flavors.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews that said that sent was overwhelming but if rinsed well it&#x27;s fine.  My son even loves the product as well.  It&#x27;s fall aromatherapy... Love it!</li>
            <li> I live everything about this product....the conditioning, cleansing, does not dry out hair, love the scent.</li>
            <li> Love this and Fall Apple Spice it the BEST!</li>
            <li> That flavor was pretty good but I prefer other scents</li>
            <li> Works just like the rest of the Wen products, which is great.  But don&#x27;t really like the smell.  Although my family kept asking if I was baking something!  Too funny!</li>
            <li> This product is heavy on my hair I am not happy with the results feels like a wax coating on it. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love Wen products, but the smell of this one is not only sickening, but overwhelmingly strong.  I&#x27;ll stick to the lavender and mint.</li>
            <li> I love wen. I have used alot of them. I don&#x27;t like this one.  Smells great. Made my hair flate and greasy.  I love the summer mango coconut.  And alot others. All I use. Oh well.</li>
