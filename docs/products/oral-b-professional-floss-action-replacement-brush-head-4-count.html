            <li>great genuine replacements</li>
            <li>IMO - these are the absolute best brush heads for any Oral B toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B brush-head is a premium brand that gets the job done effectively  and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So these MIGHT work on your Vitality, but use at your own risk, and don&#x27;t blame me if your toothbrush overbrushes, or breaks, or something.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; is really nice.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Nice size head to reach all areas.</li>
            <li>Nice to have extras on hand so you can replace as needed.</li>
            <li>The knock offs broke in a variety of ways within weeks, and I&#x27;m not too sure how good the bristles were on my teeth.</li>
            <li>My dentist and hygienists are happy with the results and my teeth feel clean after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love being able to get replacement heads this way!</li>
            <li>In an ideal world he would like them to floss between all those brackets, but he knows that does not happen every day and wants them to use this type of brush head to maximize the cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once you own an Oral-B you will always want one because your mouth just feels so much better.</li>
            <li>The floss action brush is the best for me.  </li>
            <li>The flossing action is the best.</li>
            <li>Happy with this product price was just right for my budget&lt;</li>
            <li>brush is not a substitution for flossing but is more of a companion that helps to optimizes your cleaning experience for a more healthy and beautiful smile.</li>
            <li>VEry cheap also</li>
            <li>I have been using Oral-B for more than 10 years now</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I recommend to use it by amazon; everything was ok.</li>
            <li>The price is better here than at any store.</li>
            <li>I am always glad to see they are the Oral-B product I ordered.</li>
            <li>Better than the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>Purchases these for my Oral-B brush, fit perfectly and working well so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these Oral-B brushheads in my toothbrush for about a year, and they&#x27;re my favorite of all the replacements I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Either way, this is my favorite brush head for sure because it works so well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t decide which I like better.</li>
            <li>&quot; I find they do a better job cleaning my teeth after a meal, these heads do work away at food stuck in and between my teeth</li>
            <li>Love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure some people love them, my son likes them.</li>
            <li>and I love the way my teeth look.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>than most brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t eliminate the need to floss, but they do a respectable job of removing food particles from between teeth, as well as providing a thorough brushing.</li>
            <li>These are our favorite choice for the Oral-B toothbrushes we have.</li>
            <li>and these are my favorite.  </li>
            <li>We Love It.</li>
            <li>Bought the unit and I&#x27;ve used this product many times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush for more than 15 years.</li>
            <li>Under the price, where it says \\&quot;Sold By\\&quot; make sure that it says \\&quot;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com.\\</li>
            <li>I really love these.</li>
            <li>Not any more.</li>
            <li>These feel noticeably better and more durable.</li>
            <li>As well, they do not work on all models of Oral-B brushes, so be sure to check compatibility before buying.</li>
            <li>As well, they do not work on all models of Oral-B brushes, so be sure to check compatibility before buying.</li>
            <li>They deliver the nice, absolutely clean feeling that we all love and have come to expect from our Oral-B&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums get nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this item to anyone interested in getting a good deal.</li>
            <li>B003UKR67M Oral-B Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]], and as far as I can tell, it fits perfectly and works fine.  </li>
            <li>Royal fun !!  </li>
            <li>My oral-B electric brush continues to be great and I subscribe to these replacement heads to make sure I always have them on hand when the old one gets worn.  </li>
            <li>These are my favorite of all the oral-b brush heads - it just feels like these do a much better job of getting the teeth clean than the others do.</li>
            <li>I want to find the best bargain for my refill and really do not like having to pay a lot for a toothbrush refill.</li>
            <li>I also love Amazon&#x27;s Frustration Free packaging for these.</li>
            <li>The floss action does a great job at cleaning.</li>
            <li>Great price, liked being able to purchase several brush heads - more economical.  </li>
            <li>So it was good to find this for a reasonable price online.</li>
            <li>-- I&#x27;ve heard a lot of people say generics just aren&#x27;t as good as the &#x27;real&#x27; brand-name products they&#x27;re knocking off.</li>
            <li>It is cost effective to buy them in this four-packs rather than singly, so I would recommend this package on that alone if you are using an Oral-B brush that you are already happy with.</li>
            <li>We like the original heads better.  </li>
            <li>I have returned to the original manufacturer,  and am satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I recommend these brush heads for their excellent performance.ads is not exactly what anyone would call a bargain.</li>
            <li>Cleans thoroughly and at the end I am sure my teeth are clean.</li>
            <li>If your gums bleed easily or you prefer a softer bristle, just lighten up the pressure you use while brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>flossing brushes----stick in and out of your teeth helping to keep them clean and the gums healthy ....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for them, and it offers more choices to the consumer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for them, and it offers more choices to the consumer.</li>
            <li>The main thing is the price is quite good.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased, super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>They are fine.  </li>
            <li>These are by far the best brush heads I&#x27;ve ever used with my [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]].</li>
            <li>The electric tooth brush works great and these replacement toothbrushes, are easy to take out and put back in.  </li>
            <li>After using a couple of brushes over a longer period of time and then visiting my dentist for a check up, I will be in a position with information to judge them accurately.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap b/c they don&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li>:oDainst store generics simply isn&#x27;t justified.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product and see myself continuing to use them.</li>
            <li>These do such a GREAT job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>never again, the motor doesnt do any good if your brush is old.</li>
            <li>I prefer to combine the floss action with the soft head to get the best of both worlds...</li>
            <li>These brushes have a good firmness with the floss action component.</li>
            <li>These Oral B Professional Floss Action Brushes are an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t, look over on the right side of the page where it says, \\&quot;More Buying Choices,\\&quot; and see if you can find one that says Amazon.</li>
            <li>Atomic hot!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brush heads past three years and they are excellent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these floss-action heads since the day I got my first Oral B toothbrush, and I love them.</li>
            <li>The original manufacturers themselves make them, and then package those products specifically for each retailer who carries them.</li>
            <li>B008I2IKMW Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, there are are Sonicare brushes I&#x27;ve used that give me a deeper clean, though the difference is negligible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think that covers it all ... if you want a clean and healthy mouth you MUST floss regularly and you MUST have a well made powered toothbrush with effective heads.  </li>
            <li>The quality is exactly like the ones that I had previously experienced but with much lower price and very neat and clean package.</li>
            <li>These brush heads do not have any special \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; bristles ...</li>
            <li>These brush heads do not have any special \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; bristles ...</li>
            <li>The replacements are at a very good price and come within a few days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though not inexpensive, the Floss Action brush heads provide excellent cleaning action, but require a gentle touch to avoid tearing up your gums during use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though not inexpensive, the Floss Action brush heads provide excellent cleaning action, but require a gentle touch to avoid tearing up your gums during use.</li>
            <li>Good value overall.</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t bug me, but if you prefer full size, consider Oral B&#x27;s [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good enough for</li>
            <li>Not a bad price, for buying 4 at a time.</li>
            <li>My husbands teeth had lot of spots on them and these brushes are clearing them up quick.</li>
            <li>Everyone feels it cleans their teeth better than the standard head because it leaves our teeth feeling more polished and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are for sensitive teeth which you can&#x27;t find at the stores very easily.  </li>
            <li>The results are very evident whenever I go to my dentist and her hygienist.</li>
            <li>It may be that the \\&quot;paddles\\&quot; do get between teeth and below the gum line more effectively than the regular bristles, but only your dentist would be able to tell.</li>
            <li>Both the regular, and the Floss action brush heads do a good job, but the Floss action ones stimulate my gums a bit more, as well as cleaning better between teeth.  </li>
            <li>after using it, even after the first time your teeth feel so clean it makes you want to use it.</li>
            <li>Get four of them online while you can check your model number for the right kind and avoid that situation where you&#x27;re in the store knowing you need a new one (do you really?), but you can&#x27;t remember which one is the right one.</li>
            <li>Have to order the whitening brush heads too - but over all - a worth buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will purchase here again when I meed more Floss Action Replacement Brush heads.</li>
            <li>Worth the price for the Oral-B branded brush heads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The \\&quot;floss action\\&quot; of these really does seem to get into the crevices at the top of the teeth more, and I definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom Line - whether you&#x27;re buying Target&#x27;s generic version or the Oral-B name brand, these Floss Action brush heads do a great job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom Line - whether you&#x27;re buying Target&#x27;s generic version or the Oral-B name brand, these Floss Action brush heads do a great job.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Eb25-4 Floss Action replacement brush heads do a great job and are the same brush head that came with [[ASIN:B008PEMOV6 MY]]</li>
            <li>No problem so far, been more than a year.</li>
            <li>The Floss-Action heads fit most of the higher-end models, but not the lower-end, such as \\&quot;Vitality\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Our favorite brush head is this FLOSS ACTION</li>
            <li>THAT alone is quite worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>though, as I mentioned pricey, I think it is worth it for my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This is the right product at the right price.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B says right up front - these are not a replacement for flossing.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right ...</li>
            <li>Some of the Third Party Vendors are quite good and completely reputable, but I don&#x27;t think they are carefully monitored so, when in doubt, stick with Mother</li>
            <li>They do a great job of cleaning, are long lasting, comfortable, and do a very thorough job.</li>
            <li>Also nice bulk package, so came with no unnecessary extra wrapping/publicity.</li>
            <li>I love my electric toothbrush, and I really do notice a difference in how clean my teeth feel when I replace the brush heads regularly.</li>
            <li>The difference is mostly that the Floss Action is a bit elongated; the width seems pretty much</li>
            <li>The difference is mostly that the Floss Action is a bit elongated; the width seems pretty much</li>
            <li>I like this particular model better than the other Oral-B heads, though they all work OK</li>
            <li>And I am pleased with it in all possible ways.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, the extra cleaning this brush head affords makes the effort of switching the mode worthwhile.</li>
            <li>So you have more than enough for 4</li>
            <li>All we know is that we like it better than the standard head which is 100% bristles.</li>
            <li>Back in 2008, I thought this was more of an issue than I have found it to be in the years</li>
            <li>Here is a product that performs exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>He maintains that these clean the brace hardware more efficiently than other brush heads.  </li>
            <li>The hygienist told me on my last visit that she is always happy to see my name on the list for the day, as she knows my mouth will be easy to deal with, without excessive tarter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The little yellow extensions help clean hard-to-reach areas and do a great job of stimulating my gums.</li>
            <li>Most of the Oral B brushes that use these heads have a sensitive mode for those who have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I think that one of the Oral-B&#x27;s great strengths is that the small heads can be maneuvered in such a way that you can clean every surface of every tooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably more for adults and older teens --but not the younger kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Super penetrating action.  </li>
            <li>I do it on several products, and it&#x27;s an easy to use</li>
            <li>They certainly don&#x27;t replace flossing.  </li>
            <li>I give this very high ratings.  </li>
            <li>I only tend to floss every couple of weeks or so, and I can tell a huge difference when using these brush heads</li>
            <li>/&gt;Excellent cleaning action: The Floss action brush heads do a fantastic job cleaning.</li>
            <li>This one is reasonably priced and is an OME product.</li>
            <li>Spend the money for the real thing, like this one, as it always works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those ones are the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;Super recommended to you guys.</li>
            <li>I buy 4 at a time to get me through the whole year.  </li>
            <li>These replacement heads shipped fast and they were arrived as advertised.</li>
            <li>Very Please</li>
            <li>+ per head is just too much money.</li>
            <li>Target doesn&#x27;t always seem to have their generic floss action brush heads in stock, so I fluctuate between buying their more affordable generic version, and this brand name Oral-B, depending on what&#x27;s available when I need them.</li>
            <li>Either way, they came from the same source, so in my opinion, the stigma against store generics simply isn&#x27;t justified.</li>
            <li>Lastly, the description says that this doesn&#x27;t fit a Vitality.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;floss-action&#x27; really works.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s almost like I really don&#x27;t need to floss at all.  </li>
            <li>I think my teeth are much cleaner since switching.</li>
            <li>Both work very well.</li>
            <li>I really do like that you can identify which brush head is yours</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are well-constructed, and I&#x27;d only trust genuine Oral-B products in my mouth, that&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My visits are short and cavity free and my dentist says he loves my teeth.</li>
            <li>These are the real deal and will no cut you or have the floss</li>
            <li>It really did work and TBH</li>
            <li>I like the size better and believe it gets those back teeth far cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the floss action heads for a few years now and am amazed at how good of a job they do cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>SO WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Oral-B Professional Model Eb25-4 Floss Action Replacement Brush Heads are made to help clean between your teeth better than the standard brush heads including 4 rubber like strips that work into the gaps, they clearly state \\&quot; Does not replace flossing\\</li>
            <li>Over the next couple of visits, my charting numbers started to improve significantly -</li>
            <li>They come four individually packaged, and look and work just like the original toothbrush.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little big and rough, but used with the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brush mode they&#x27;re just perfect (for me).</li>
            <li>They are well designed of especially strong glass that can hold hot or cold drinks</li>
            <li>Yes,  it&#x27;s much more expensive,  but  lasts longer and is way better built.</li>
            <li>I am very suspect as to whether these have any real flossing action.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no secret warehouse in China where retailers are knocking off exact replicas of name-brand products and then placing them in national stores as &#x27;generics&#x27; while the real manufacturers just quietly twiddle their thumbs and say, &#x27;oh golly, they got us on that one.&#x27;</li>
            <li>highly recommend these replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>I originally reviewed the 3-pack of these brush heads back in 2008 ([[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]]).</li>
            <li>These seem to be original Oral-B Floss action toothbrush replacement heads, so, exactly what expected.</li>
            <li>The floss action brush seems to be a little more gentle on the gum line without sacrificing the cleaning power of bristles.  </li>
            <li>These are worth the money don&#x27;t buy the generic or you will regret it.</li>
            <li>I bought some of the knock off replacement heads, and then came back to these, and these are well worth their price.</li>
            <li>Also the circular motion of brushing with these is far better than the typical tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Limited Compatibility: The brushes they work on include Oral-B Triumph, Oral-B Smart Series, Oral-B Professional Care, Oral-B Vitality (except for Vitality Sonic) and Oral-B Pro-Health Power, but not Vitality Sonic, Sonic Complete, Pulsonic, CrossAction Power.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Limited Compatibility: The brushes they work on include Oral-B Triumph, Oral-B Smart Series, Oral-B Professional Care, Oral-B Vitality (except for Vitality Sonic) and Oral-B Pro-Health Power, but not Vitality Sonic, Sonic Complete, Pulsonic, CrossAction Power.</li>
            <li>Also, I am convinced the little plastic flossing paddles give you a bit more polishing action because my teeth seem a bit smoother when using them.  </li>
            <li>Items were new and unopened.  </li>
            <li>Even using them beyond the recommended time, you&#x27;re still looking at a new brush head say every 4 months, a 3-pack goes for over $15 here, so</li>
            <li>Even using them beyond the recommended time, you&#x27;re still looking at a new brush head say every 4 months, a 3-pack goes for over $15 here, so</li>
            <li>These are very soft and flexible.</li>
            <li>just be careful specially when you get to your lower jaw as it nicked the underside of my tongue one time</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Professional Model Eb23-4 Floss Action Replacement Heads is such a powerful brush and my teeth loves the way it feels</li>
            <li>original Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Head - as expected.</li>
            <li>They clean my teeth well, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve noticed any special \\&quot;floss action\\&quot; over a standard head.</li>
            <li>I used to buy the cheap knock-offs,  but they did not last long at all.  </li>
            <li>And be aware that the brush head is a bit elongated compared to the standard and sensitive heads.</li>
            <li>And be aware that the brush head is a bit elongated compared to the standard and sensitive heads.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, the generics might be identical to the original (save the packaging) and sometimes, there might be slight alterations.</li>
            <li>I love these toothbrushes for getting into hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I find this brush a bit intense on one of my sensitive back molars, and have to switch the mode on the toothbrush to \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; when using it on that tooth.  </li>
            <li>Also it feels really wierdly bumpy compared to regular Oral-B brushes.</li>
            <li>overused by old brush..</li>
            <li>I have used these Floss Action Replacement Brush Heads before and the seen to work well.</li>
            <li>I like the floss action brush heads even though they DO NOT eliminate the need for flossing.</li>
            <li>I like the really really soft bristles on the Oral B...or a hand held one I just got from Vine by oral B for \\&quot;mature mouths\\&quot; or something to that effect.</li>
            <li>I now use that handheld one in place of my electric Oral B - with or without floss action.</li>
            <li>Anyway, you can go with my review and avoid this brush if you have sensitive gums (and I&#x27;m a flosser) or go with my son, who has always preferred this style of brush over the others.</li>
            <li>the Oral-B Floss Action Replacement Headsand will always be a fan of them.</li>
            <li>I have been fond of the &#x27;dual action&#x27; brush heads for quite a while, but now I am completely hooked on these &#x27;floss-action&#x27; ones.  </li>
            <li>Three members of my family have been using the Oral B professional line for years.</li>
            <li>In the four plus years since then, I&#x27;ve changed my mind and now consider these Floss Action brushes my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But if your mouth is at all sensitive, give this a pass.</li>
            <li>I recently found a Target generic version that comes out to about $5 per head; not a huge savings, but certainly more reasonable.</li>
            <li>The small size lets you really brush the insides and back side of those teeth far better than the bigger Dual Action.  </li>
            <li>you first use them, they will feel pretty hard</li>
            <li>This is reminiscent of what Amazon calls \\&quot;frustration-free\\&quot; packaging for some of their other products, and I wonder if it might be a reaction to the counterfeiting issue.completely reputable, but I don&#x27;t think they are carefully monitored so, when in doubt, stick with Mother</li>
            <li>No other complaints except for price.  </li>
            <li>At first, they feel a little odd when you are used to normal brush fibers only, but they are really worth getting used to.  </li>
            <li>only drawback, as far as I am concerned, is that the brush head has been enlarged to accommodate the flossers.</li>
            <li>I purchase them only when they come directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>The Floss action brush head features longer bristles (blue indicator type) at the north and south ends (</li>
            <li>Brush Head with MicroPulse Bristles: If you view the comparison chart, the Floss Action brush head is the only one that contains the MicroPulse bristles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are different types of heads---but if you need the flossing action this would be for you..</li>
            <li>The replacement brush heads work as expected, and were available at much less than seen at stores.  </li>
            <li>Toothbrush replacements aren&#x27;t the original size heads and don&#x27;t last half as long. .</li>
            <li>Brush size is much smaller than the Dual Action allowing you to target those hard to clean teeth in the back.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B Cross flex double action flashback goomba model.</li>
            <li>Oral-B Cross flex double action flashback goomba model.</li>
            <li>I used them for several weeks right before my semi-annual professional cleaning, and the hygeinist, whom I have used for several years and whose performance is very consistent, spent noticeably less time cleaning than she usually does.</li>
            <li>I had been using the Oral-B Dual Action brush for a long time and decided to give these a try just for something different.</li>
            <li>The width is the same, but the height is about half again as large.</li>
            <li>With traditional brushes I was always feeling like to spend a little more time since I was never sure if I did my job with brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is Slightly Larger than the Standard and Sensitive Brush Heads: In case you are heavily invested in the tiny size of the standard or sensitive heads, the Floss Action is just a bit larger.</li>

            <li>They&#x27;re smaller than you might be used to, less than the surface area of a dime, but between their bristles and some rubbery pick points, they really feel like they&#x27;re getting further between my teeth</li>

            <li> IMO - these are the absolute best brush heads for any Oral B toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B brush-head is a premium brand that gets the job done effectively  and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So these MIGHT work on your Vitality, but use at your own risk, and don&#x27;t blame me if your toothbrush overbrushes, or breaks, or something.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; is really nice.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> Nice size head to reach all areas.</li>
            <li> Nice to have extras on hand so you can replace as needed.</li>
            <li> The knock offs broke in a variety of ways within weeks, and I&#x27;m not too sure how good the bristles were on my teeth.</li>
            <li> My dentist and hygienists are happy with the results and my teeth feel clean after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love being able to get replacement heads this way!</li>
            <li> In an ideal world he would like them to floss between all those brackets, but he knows that does not happen every day and wants them to use this type of brush head to maximize the cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once you own an Oral-B you will always want one because your mouth just feels so much better.</li>
            <li> The floss action brush is the best for me.  </li>
            <li> The flossing action is the best.</li>
            <li> Happy with this product price was just right for my budget&lt;</li>
            <li> brush is not a substitution for flossing but is more of a companion that helps to optimizes your cleaning experience for a more healthy and beautiful smile.</li>
            <li> VEry cheap also</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral-B for more than 10 years now</li>

            <li> The price is better here than at any store.</li>
            <li> I am always glad to see they are the Oral-B product I ordered.</li>
            <li> Better than the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> Purchases these for my Oral-B brush, fit perfectly and working well so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Oral-B brushheads in my toothbrush for about a year, and they&#x27;re my favorite of all the replacements I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Either way, this is my favorite brush head for sure because it works so well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t decide which I like better.</li>
            <li> &quot; I find they do a better job cleaning my teeth after a meal, these heads do work away at food stuck in and between my teeth</li>

            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> than most brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t eliminate the need to floss, but they do a respectable job of removing food particles from between teeth, as well as providing a thorough brushing.</li>
            <li> These are our favorite choice for the Oral-B toothbrushes we have.</li>
            <li> and these are my favorite.  </li>
            <li> We Love It.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush for more than 15 years.</li>
            <li> Under the price, where it says \\&quot;Sold By\\&quot; make sure that it says \\&quot;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com.\\</li>
            <li> I really love these.</li>
            <li> Not any more.</li>
            <li> These feel noticeably better and more durable.</li>
            <li> As well, they do not work on all models of Oral-B brushes, so be sure to check compatibility before buying.</li>

            <li> Royal fun !!  </li>
            <li> My oral-B electric brush continues to be great and I subscribe to these replacement heads to make sure I always have them on hand when the old one gets worn.  </li>
            <li> These are my favorite of all the oral-b brush heads - it just feels like these do a much better job of getting the teeth clean than the others do.</li>
            <li> I want to find the best bargain for my refill and really do not like having to pay a lot for a toothbrush refill.</li>

            <li> The floss action does a great job at cleaning.</li>
            <li> Great price, liked being able to purchase several brush heads - more economical.  </li>
            <li> So it was good to find this for a reasonable price online.</li>
            <li> -- I&#x27;ve heard a lot of people say generics just aren&#x27;t as good as the &#x27;real&#x27; brand-name products they&#x27;re knocking off.</li>
            <li> It is cost effective to buy them in this four-packs rather than singly, so I would recommend this package on that alone if you are using an Oral-B brush that you are already happy with.</li>
            <li> We like the original heads better.  </li>
            <li> I have returned to the original manufacturer,  and am satisfied.  </li>

            <li> I prefer to combine the floss action with the soft head to get the best of both worlds...</li>
            <li> These brushes have a good firmness with the floss action component.</li>
            <li> These Oral B Professional Floss Action Brushes are an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t, look over on the right side of the page where it says, \\&quot;More Buying Choices,\\&quot; and see if you can find one that says Amazon.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush heads past three years and they are excellent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these floss-action heads since the day I got my first Oral B toothbrush, and I love them.</li>
            <li> The original manufacturers themselves make them, and then package those products specifically for each retailer who carries them.</li>
            <li> B008I2IKMW Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, there are are Sonicare brushes I&#x27;ve used that give me a deeper clean, though the difference is negligible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think that covers it all ... if you want a clean and healthy mouth you MUST floss regularly and you MUST have a well made powered toothbrush with effective heads.  </li>
            <li> The quality is exactly like the ones that I had previously experienced but with much lower price and very neat and clean package.</li>
            <li> These brush heads do not have any special \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; bristles ...</li>
            <li> These brush heads do not have any special \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; bristles ...</li>
            <li> The replacements are at a very good price and come within a few days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though not inexpensive, the Floss Action brush heads provide excellent cleaning action, but require a gentle touch to avoid tearing up your gums during use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though not inexpensive, the Floss Action brush heads provide excellent cleaning action, but require a gentle touch to avoid tearing up your gums during use.</li>
            <li> Good value overall.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t bug me, but if you prefer full size, consider Oral B&#x27;s [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good enough for</li>
            <li> Not a bad price, for buying 4 at a time.</li>
            <li> My husbands teeth had lot of spots on them and these brushes are clearing them up quick.</li>
            <li> Everyone feels it cleans their teeth better than the standard head because it leaves our teeth feeling more polished and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are for sensitive teeth which you can&#x27;t find at the stores very easily.  </li>
            <li> The results are very evident whenever I go to my dentist and her hygienist.</li>
            <li> It may be that the \\&quot;paddles\\&quot; do get between teeth and below the gum line more effectively than the regular bristles, but only your dentist would be able to tell.</li>
            <li> Both the regular, and the Floss action brush heads do a good job, but the Floss action ones stimulate my gums a bit more, as well as cleaning better between teeth.  </li>
            <li> after using it, even after the first time your teeth feel so clean it makes you want to use it.</li>
            <li> Get four of them online while you can check your model number for the right kind and avoid that situation where you&#x27;re in the store knowing you need a new one (do you really?), but you can&#x27;t remember which one is the right one.</li>
            <li> Have to order the whitening brush heads too - but over all - a worth buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will purchase here again when I meed more Floss Action Replacement Brush heads.</li>
            <li> Worth the price for the Oral-B branded brush heads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The \\&quot;floss action\\&quot; of these really does seem to get into the crevices at the top of the teeth more, and I definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom Line - whether you&#x27;re buying Target&#x27;s generic version or the Oral-B name brand, these Floss Action brush heads do a great job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom Line - whether you&#x27;re buying Target&#x27;s generic version or the Oral-B name brand, these Floss Action brush heads do a great job.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Eb25-4 Floss Action replacement brush heads do a great job and are the same brush head that came with [[ASIN:B008PEMOV6 MY]]</li>
            <li> No problem so far, been more than a year.</li>
            <li> The Floss-Action heads fit most of the higher-end models, but not the lower-end, such as \\&quot;Vitality\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Our favorite brush head is this FLOSS ACTION</li>
            <li> THAT alone is quite worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> though, as I mentioned pricey, I think it is worth it for my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is the right product at the right price.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B says right up front - these are not a replacement for flossing.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right ...</li>
            <li> Some of the Third Party Vendors are quite good and completely reputable, but I don&#x27;t think they are carefully monitored so, when in doubt, stick with Mother</li>
            <li> They do a great job of cleaning, are long lasting, comfortable, and do a very thorough job.</li>
            <li> Also nice bulk package, so came with no unnecessary extra wrapping/publicity.</li>
            <li> I love my electric toothbrush, and I really do notice a difference in how clean my teeth feel when I replace the brush heads regularly.</li>
            <li> The difference is mostly that the Floss Action is a bit elongated; the width seems pretty much</li>
            <li> The difference is mostly that the Floss Action is a bit elongated; the width seems pretty much</li>
            <li> I like this particular model better than the other Oral-B heads, though they all work OK</li>
            <li> And I am pleased with it in all possible ways.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, the extra cleaning this brush head affords makes the effort of switching the mode worthwhile.</li>
            <li> So you have more than enough for 4</li>
            <li> All we know is that we like it better than the standard head which is 100% bristles.</li>
            <li> Back in 2008, I thought this was more of an issue than I have found it to be in the years</li>
            <li> Here is a product that performs exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li> He maintains that these clean the brace hardware more efficiently than other brush heads.  </li>
            <li> The hygienist told me on my last visit that she is always happy to see my name on the list for the day, as she knows my mouth will be easy to deal with, without excessive tarter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The little yellow extensions help clean hard-to-reach areas and do a great job of stimulating my gums.</li>
            <li> Most of the Oral B brushes that use these heads have a sensitive mode for those who have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I think that one of the Oral-B&#x27;s great strengths is that the small heads can be maneuvered in such a way that you can clean every surface of every tooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Probably more for adults and older teens --but not the younger kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Super penetrating action.  </li>
            <li> I do it on several products, and it&#x27;s an easy to use</li>
            <li> They certainly don&#x27;t replace flossing.  </li>
            <li> I give this very high ratings.  </li>
            <li> I only tend to floss every couple of weeks or so, and I can tell a huge difference when using these brush heads</li>
            <li> /&gt;Excellent cleaning action: The Floss action brush heads do a fantastic job cleaning.</li>
            <li> This one is reasonably priced and is an OME product.</li>
            <li> Spend the money for the real thing, like this one, as it always works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those ones are the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;Super recommended to you guys.</li>
            <li> I buy 4 at a time to get me through the whole year.  </li>
            <li> These replacement heads shipped fast and they were arrived as advertised.</li>
            <li> Very Please</li>
            <li> + per head is just too much money.</li>
            <li> Target doesn&#x27;t always seem to have their generic floss action brush heads in stock, so I fluctuate between buying their more affordable generic version, and this brand name Oral-B, depending on what&#x27;s available when I need them.</li>
            <li> Either way, they came from the same source, so in my opinion, the stigma against store generics simply isn&#x27;t justified.</li>
            <li> Lastly, the description says that this doesn&#x27;t fit a Vitality.  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;floss-action&#x27; really works.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost like I really don&#x27;t need to floss at all.  </li>
            <li> I think my teeth are much cleaner since switching.</li>
            <li> Both work very well.</li>
            <li> I really do like that you can identify which brush head is yours</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are well-constructed, and I&#x27;d only trust genuine Oral-B products in my mouth, that&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My visits are short and cavity free and my dentist says he loves my teeth.</li>
            <li> These are the real deal and will no cut you or have the floss</li>
            <li> It really did work and TBH</li>
            <li> I like the size better and believe it gets those back teeth far cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the floss action heads for a few years now and am amazed at how good of a job they do cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> SO WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Oral-B Professional Model Eb25-4 Floss Action Replacement Brush Heads are made to help clean between your teeth better than the standard brush heads including 4 rubber like strips that work into the gaps, they clearly state \\&quot; Does not replace flossing\\</li>
            <li> Over the next couple of visits, my charting numbers started to improve significantly -</li>
            <li> They come four individually packaged, and look and work just like the original toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little big and rough, but used with the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brush mode they&#x27;re just perfect (for me).</li>
            <li> They are well designed of especially strong glass that can hold hot or cold drinks</li>
            <li> Yes,  it&#x27;s much more expensive,  but  lasts longer and is way better built.</li>
            <li> I am very suspect as to whether these have any real flossing action.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no secret warehouse in China where retailers are knocking off exact replicas of name-brand products and then placing them in national stores as &#x27;generics&#x27; while the real manufacturers just quietly twiddle their thumbs and say, &#x27;oh golly, they got us on that one.&#x27;</li>
            <li> highly recommend these replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> I originally reviewed the 3-pack of these brush heads back in 2008 ([[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]]).</li>
            <li> These seem to be original Oral-B Floss action toothbrush replacement heads, so, exactly what expected.</li>
            <li> The floss action brush seems to be a little more gentle on the gum line without sacrificing the cleaning power of bristles.  </li>
            <li> These are worth the money don&#x27;t buy the generic or you will regret it.</li>
            <li> I bought some of the knock off replacement heads, and then came back to these, and these are well worth their price.</li>
            <li> Also the circular motion of brushing with these is far better than the typical tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Limited Compatibility: The brushes they work on include Oral-B Triumph, Oral-B Smart Series, Oral-B Professional Care, Oral-B Vitality (except for Vitality Sonic) and Oral-B Pro-Health Power, but not Vitality Sonic, Sonic Complete, Pulsonic, CrossAction Power.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Limited Compatibility: The brushes they work on include Oral-B Triumph, Oral-B Smart Series, Oral-B Professional Care, Oral-B Vitality (except for Vitality Sonic) and Oral-B Pro-Health Power, but not Vitality Sonic, Sonic Complete, Pulsonic, CrossAction Power.</li>
            <li> Also, I am convinced the little plastic flossing paddles give you a bit more polishing action because my teeth seem a bit smoother when using them.  </li>
            <li> Items were new and unopened.  </li>
            <li> Even using them beyond the recommended time, you&#x27;re still looking at a new brush head say every 4 months, a 3-pack goes for over $15 here, so</li>
            <li> Even using them beyond the recommended time, you&#x27;re still looking at a new brush head say every 4 months, a 3-pack goes for over $15 here, so</li>
            <li> These are very soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> just be careful specially when you get to your lower jaw as it nicked the underside of my tongue one time</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional Model Eb23-4 Floss Action Replacement Heads is such a powerful brush and my teeth loves the way it feels</li>
            <li> original Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Head - as expected.</li>
            <li> They clean my teeth well, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve noticed any special \\&quot;floss action\\&quot; over a standard head.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the cheap knock-offs,  but they did not last long at all.  </li>
            <li> And be aware that the brush head is a bit elongated compared to the standard and sensitive heads.</li>
            <li> And be aware that the brush head is a bit elongated compared to the standard and sensitive heads.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, the generics might be identical to the original (save the packaging) and sometimes, there might be slight alterations.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes for getting into hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I find this brush a bit intense on one of my sensitive back molars, and have to switch the mode on the toothbrush to \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; when using it on that tooth.  </li>
            <li> Also it feels really wierdly bumpy compared to regular Oral-B brushes.</li>
            <li> overused by old brush..</li>
            <li> I have used these Floss Action Replacement Brush Heads before and the seen to work well.</li>
            <li> I like the floss action brush heads even though they DO NOT eliminate the need for flossing.</li>
            <li> I like the really really soft bristles on the Oral B...or a hand held one I just got from Vine by oral B for \\&quot;mature mouths\\&quot; or something to that effect.</li>
            <li> I now use that handheld one in place of my electric Oral B - with or without floss action.</li>
            <li> Anyway, you can go with my review and avoid this brush if you have sensitive gums (and I&#x27;m a flosser) or go with my son, who has always preferred this style of brush over the others.</li>
            <li> the Oral-B Floss Action Replacement Headsand will always be a fan of them.</li>
            <li> I have been fond of the &#x27;dual action&#x27; brush heads for quite a while, but now I am completely hooked on these &#x27;floss-action&#x27; ones.  </li>
            <li> Three members of my family have been using the Oral B professional line for years.</li>
            <li> In the four plus years since then, I&#x27;ve changed my mind and now consider these Floss Action brushes my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if your mouth is at all sensitive, give this a pass.</li>
            <li> I recently found a Target generic version that comes out to about $5 per head; not a huge savings, but certainly more reasonable.</li>
            <li> The small size lets you really brush the insides and back side of those teeth far better than the bigger Dual Action.  </li>
            <li> you first use them, they will feel pretty hard</li>
            <li> This is reminiscent of what Amazon calls \\&quot;frustration-free\\&quot; packaging for some of their other products, and I wonder if it might be a reaction to the counterfeiting issue.completely reputable, but I don&#x27;t think they are carefully monitored so, when in doubt, stick with Mother</li>
            <li> No other complaints except for price.  </li>
            <li> At first, they feel a little odd when you are used to normal brush fibers only, but they are really worth getting used to.  </li>
            <li> only drawback, as far as I am concerned, is that the brush head has been enlarged to accommodate the flossers.</li>
            <li> I purchase them only when they come directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The Floss action brush head features longer bristles (blue indicator type) at the north and south ends (</li>
            <li> Brush Head with MicroPulse Bristles: If you view the comparison chart, the Floss Action brush head is the only one that contains the MicroPulse bristles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are different types of heads---but if you need the flossing action this would be for you..</li>
            <li> The replacement brush heads work as expected, and were available at much less than seen at stores.  </li>
            <li> Toothbrush replacements aren&#x27;t the original size heads and don&#x27;t last half as long. .</li>
            <li> Brush size is much smaller than the Dual Action allowing you to target those hard to clean teeth in the back.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B Cross flex double action flashback goomba model.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Cross flex double action flashback goomba model.</li>
            <li> I used them for several weeks right before my semi-annual professional cleaning, and the hygeinist, whom I have used for several years and whose performance is very consistent, spent noticeably less time cleaning than she usually does.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Oral-B Dual Action brush for a long time and decided to give these a try just for something different.</li>
            <li> The width is the same, but the height is about half again as large.</li>
            <li> With traditional brushes I was always feeling like to spend a little more time since I was never sure if I did my job with brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is Slightly Larger than the Standard and Sensitive Brush Heads: In case you are heavily invested in the tiny size of the standard or sensitive heads, the Floss Action is just a bit larger.</li>
            <li> is Slightly Larger than the Standard and Sensitive Brush Heads: In case you are heavily invested in the tiny size of the standard or sensitive heads, the Floss Action is just a bit larger.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re smaller than you might be used to, less than the surface area of a dime, but between their bristles and some rubbery pick points, they really feel like they&#x27;re getting further between my teeth</li>
            <li> gentle and a little abrasive.  </li>
            <li> If you watch, you will see the yellow flat rubber blades sticking into and staying in the spaces between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> The dentist wants us to use small heads and these are slightly larger.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This has a strip of flat silicone type material amid the bristles on the brush head.</li>
            <li> This is a long lasting product.</li>
            <li> These are \\&quot;the real thing\\&quot; and considerably less than you&#x27;d pay at a pharmacy or other place except maybe Costco</li>
            <li> In fact, this brush is half the size of the Dual Action.  </li>
            <li> (previously used the Floss Action head that came with the brush).</li>
            <li> There are 4 hard plastic \\&quot;flossing bristles\\&quot;, and once the brush is turned on, they whip around very vigorously.</li>
            <li> I brush my tongue as well, and those hard bristles have made it very tender and sore.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about you, but my hard-to-reach areas are in the back of the mouth, and the elongated head shape is helpful to getting back a little further.</li>
            <li> 2 rows, 2 wide), white bristles at the east and west ends (1 row, 2 deep), and a teal colored array of bristles at center (7 groups).</li>
            <li> I have been using the Oral B Professional Care electric toothbrush for a number of years now (at least long enough for three upgrades).</li>
            <li> They seem to last longer than other tooth brushes and brush heads</li>
            <li> and there definitely was with the other heads.  </li>
            <li> This is reminiscent of what Amazon calls \\&quot;frustration-free\\&quot; packaging for some of their other products, and I wonder if it might be a reaction to the counterfeiting issue.</li>
            <li> Ipad 1, 2, 3 ... not 1, 2, New.</li>
            <li> Ipad 1, 2, 3 ... not 1, 2, New.</li>
            <li> have been using a replacement Floss Action brush heads with an Oral-B SmartSeries 4000 brush for the past month</li>
            <li> As I said, the head is about half the surface area of a traditional manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> That is slightly (but only slightly) compromised here because of the larger size.</li>
            <li> (if you share with someone) with the little colored snap-on piece, so if that&#x27;s a concern for you, the Sonicare system doesn&#x27;t have any such way of identifying which head is yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lots of \\&quot;5\\&quot; pockets (that&#x27;s bad) with 4s and 3s making up most of the rest.  </li>
            <li> MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS WITH THE DELIVERY WHICH I HAD TO COLLECT PERSONALLY AT THE USPS</li>
            <li> just be careful when using i guess</li>
            <li> Compared with the standard, all-bristles head; this one seems a bit too firm.  </li>
            <li> The function of the units is exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> no cavities and minimal amount of work on the teeth.</li>
            <li> And 2 blue and green ones.</li>
            <li> you are considering these, do pay careful attention to which model Oral-B handle you have.  </li>
            <li> At the time, I preferred the regular, round non-flossing brushes to these.</li>
            <li> this is the way to buy refills for your Oral-B or other health and beauty products</li>
            <li> No complaints whatsoever, other than the steep price.</li>
            <li> but I am not sure I would pay extra for them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve continued to improve to the point where I&#x27;m back at the usual two visits a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more gingivitis, no more bleeding gums, and cleanings are a 15 minute breeze - last time I actually fell asleep while she was doing it ...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using Oral-B for more than 10 years now and I love it. This one is reasonably priced and is an OME product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the generic brands lure you into purchasing a generic head for the Oral B.  They&#x27;re cheap b/c they don&#x27;t work as well.  Spend the money for the real thing, like this one, as it always works.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, practical and match with my tooth brush and I recommend to use it by amazon; everything was ok.</li>
            <li> Unlike other bad fakes on the net that don&#x27;t vibrate well...&lt;br /&gt;Those ones are the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;Super recommended to you guys.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT IS PRECISSELY WHAT I HAD REQUESTED. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS WITH THE DELIVERY WHICH I HAD TO COLLECT PERSONALLY AT THE USPS</li>
            <li> The replacement brush heads work as expected, and were available at much less than seen at stores.  Good value overall.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST one we have tried (of MANY!), so it is here to stay!! Love that we can just replace the heads...!!!</li>
            <li> It took us a lot of research before we decided to buy this brush. And I am pleased with it in all possible ways. Cleans thoroughly and at the end I am sure my teeth are clean. With traditional brushes I was always feeling like to spend a little more time since I was never sure if I did my job with brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the replacement heads are good. My husbands teeth had lot of spots on them and these brushes are clearing them up quick. Have to order the whitening brush heads too - but over all - a worth buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend all the give it a try.</li>
            <li> We like the original heads better.  The dentist wants us to use small heads and these are slightly larger.  Also it feels really wierdly bumpy compared to regular Oral-B brushes.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads have save me a lot of money.. Very good and work well.  I will keep buying it..</li>
            <li> The electric tooth brush works great and these replacement toothbrushes, are easy to take out and put back in.  My teeth and gums get nice and clean.  Not a bad price, for buying 4 at a time.</li>
            <li> as entitled, very effective in cleaning. just be careful specially when you get to your lower jaw as it nicked the underside of my tongue one time and it bled a bit. just be careful when using i guess</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dental assistant so I know a great brush when I use one.  These are for sensitive teeth which you can&#x27;t find at the stores very easily.  I buy 4 at a time to get me through the whole year.  The price is better here than at any store.</li>
            <li> overused by old brush.. never again, the motor doesnt do any good if your brush is old. if you need to update amazon is the way to go. cant beat the prices</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for about 1.5 months, no problems whatsoever. I&#x27;m not too picky, but I would definitely notice if something was seriously wrong with my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These are \\&quot;the real thing\\&quot; and considerably less than you&#x27;d pay at a pharmacy or other place except maybe Costco</li>
            <li> The brushes are professial all the way, you can feel them taking all the stuff off your teeth, they are the best I had!!!! riles lane</li>
            <li> I give this very high ratings.  I want to find the best bargain for my refill and really do not like having to pay a lot for a toothbrush refill.</li>
            <li> Here we are with all the same toothbrush heads.  Nobody is complaining, that is amazing.  Fits well and cleans teeth.  All good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush heads past three years and they are excellent.  These items usually come in a 3-pack box.  I saw this 4-pack offer and ordered it.  When it came they were in individual pack but that is non issue.  These heads are also used by my kids.  These are good for teeth and gum.</li>
            <li> I replace my tooth brush head every 3-4 months. The product meets my needs, in that, I use this head every night before flossing. Use of this head (along with the regular one) has improved my dental health.</li>
            <li> I have bought several sizes of the Bodum Glasses. They are well designed of especially strong glass that can hold hot or cold drinks</li>
            <li> we always use thse ones.  these are a good deal.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the cheap knock-offs,  but they did not last long at all.  A couple of them had the rotating head break off soon after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have returned to the original manufacturer,  and am satisfied.  Yes,  it&#x27;s much more expensive,  but  lasts longer and is way better built.</li>
            <li> I bought these as replacement heads for my Oral-B toothbrush on the recommendation of thesweethome.com.  I&#x27;m really happy with them, and they do a great job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> Great price, liked being able to purchase several brush heads - more economical.  I don&#x27;t quite get the &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; part of the brush - doesn&#x27;t seem any different than regular bristles against the gumline/between teeth.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> They exceeded my expectations by delivering the very next day! Now that is a way to run a successful business.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased, super fast shipping!! this is the way to buy refills for your Oral-B or other health and beauty products</li>
            <li> I cannot always find these brush heads at a convenient local store.  So it was good to find this for a reasonable price online.</li>
            <li> I have used these Floss Action Replacement Brush Heads before and the seen to work well. Saved $$$ buy purchasing from vs. store prices. I will purchase here again when I meed more Floss Action Replacement Brush heads.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads shipped fast and they were arrived as advertised. I am always glad to see they are the Oral-B product I ordered. Very Please</li>
            <li> Better than the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; replacement brushes. You can also take a look at the the so-called whitening brushes with the yeelow cup in the middle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Oral-B brush and its different brush heads for over 4 years. The results are very evident whenever I go to my dentist and her hygienist. The replacements are at a very good price and come within a few days.</li>
            <li> These seem to be original Oral-B Floss action toothbrush replacement heads, so, exactly what expected. Also nice bulk package, so came with no unnecessary extra wrapping/publicity.</li>
            <li> Purchases these for my Oral-B brush, fit perfectly and working well so far. Worth the price for the Oral-B branded brush heads.</li>
            <li> Happy with this product price was just right for my budget&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Mercedes a Martinucci</li>
            <li> The kid&#x27;s orthodontist specifically ordered  me(it was not a suggestion, but a mandate) to buy this sort of brush head for their braces.  He maintains that these clean the brace hardware more efficiently than other brush heads.  In an ideal world he would like them to floss between all those brackets, but he knows that does not happen every day and wants them to use this type of brush head to maximize the cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them myself (along with flossing).  The hygienist told me on my last visit that she is always happy to see my name on the list for the day, as she knows my mouth will be easy to deal with, without excessive tarter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I find this brush a bit intense on one of my sensitive back molars, and have to switch the mode on the toothbrush to \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; when using it on that tooth.  With the \\&quot;precision clean\\&quot; I do not have to do this.  Nevertheless, the extra cleaning this brush head affords makes the effort of switching the mode worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Oral-B brushheads in my toothbrush for about a year, and they&#x27;re my favorite of all the replacements I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first use them, they will feel pretty hard so you have to use a gentle touch, but they soften up after a few weeks.  If your gums bleed easily or you prefer a softer bristle, just lighten up the pressure you use while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;floss action\\&quot; of these really does seem to get into the crevices at the top of the teeth more, and I definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> IMO - these are the absolute best brush heads for any Oral B toothbrush. I&#x27;ve been using these floss-action heads since the day I got my first Oral B toothbrush, and I love them. They do a really great job of cleaning my teeth, and even in-between teeth and along the gum-line. No complaints whatsoever, other than the steep price. $6+ per head is just too much money. I recently found a Target generic version that comes out to about $5 per head; not a huge savings, but certainly more reasonable. Target doesn&#x27;t always seem to have their generic floss action brush heads in stock, so I fluctuate between buying their more affordable generic version, and this brand name Oral-B, depending on what&#x27;s available when I need them. Either way, this is my favorite brush head for sure because it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Generic Myth (according to Kaio)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, let&#x27;s burst the &#x27;generic&#x27; myth here -- I&#x27;ve heard a lot of people say generics just aren&#x27;t as good as the &#x27;real&#x27; brand-name products they&#x27;re knocking off. But let&#x27;s inject a little reality here: grocery stores, drugstores, Target, Walmart, et al, are NOT in the manufacturing business; they&#x27;re in the business of retail sales. There&#x27;s no secret warehouse in China where retailers are knocking off exact replicas of name-brand products and then placing them in national stores as &#x27;generics&#x27; while the real manufacturers just quietly twiddle their thumbs and say, &#x27;oh golly, they got us on that one.&#x27; Manufacturers would file lawsuits up the wazoo against all these retailers for selling blatant counterfeit versions of their legit, patent pended, products. So, who is making all these generics? The original manufacturers themselves make them, and then package those products specifically for each retailer who carries them. Sometimes, the generics might be identical to the original (save the packaging) and sometimes, there might be slight alterations. Either way, they came from the same source, so in my opinion, the stigma against store generics simply isn&#x27;t justified. Manufacturers make these generics as a way of increasing their profits by offering a lower cost alternative to their flagship products; and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that. It&#x27;s good for them, and it offers more choices to the consumer. Keep in mind, I&#x27;m talking about reputable national retail store generics here, not mom and pop dollar store knockoffs, which likely are blatant counterfeits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line - whether you&#x27;re buying Target&#x27;s generic version or the Oral-B name brand, these Floss Action brush heads do a great job. I&#x27;ve been using them for over 5 years and don&#x27;t see myself changing anytime soon. My 2 cents; take it for what it is and have a good one. :oDainst store generics simply isn&#x27;t justified.

            <li> I have been using the Oral B Professional Care electric toothbrush for a number of years now (at least long enough for three upgrades). I like the floss action brush heads even though they DO NOT eliminate the need for flossing. My dentist and hygienists are happy with the results and my teeth feel clean after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any problems with stiffness irritating my gums and they tend to last me about 4 months based upon the indicator bristles (I was told to look for them to whiten halfway down the bristle as the indicator of a need to replace the brush). Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product and see myself continuing to use them. P-)</li>
            <li> These are good brush heads for teh Oral b products.  If you watch, you will see the yellow flat rubber blades sticking into and staying in the spaces between your teeth.  I am very suspect as to whether these have any real flossing action.  They certainly don&#x27;t replace flossing.  I would think the smaller bristles get farther in the crevices than these blades.  I don&#x27;t see any harm to the \\&quot;flosser\\&quot; but I am not sure I would pay extra for them.  I have one of these and also an Oral B sonic.  I can&#x27;t decide which I like better. I go back and forth.  One thing I know....use regular floss beforehand or you will be sorry.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Professional Model Eb25-4 Floss Action Replacement Brush Heads are made to help clean between your teeth better than the standard brush heads including 4 rubber like strips that work into the gaps, they clearly state \\&quot; Does not replace flossing\\&quot; I find they do a better job cleaning my teeth after a meal, these heads do work away at food stuck in and between my teeth but I still floss as it is needed to do the total job. These brush heads are the regular Oral-B heads that add 4 flossing rubber like yellow plastic flippers, I&#x27;m still using them and will add any updates that may change how I rate them.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best brush heads I&#x27;ve ever used with my [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]]. These do such a GREAT job of cleaning my teeth. The little yellow extensions help clean hard-to-reach areas and do a great job of stimulating my gums. I also love Amazon&#x27;s Frustration Free packaging for these. Great product!</li>
            <li> great genuine replacements</li>
            <li> My oral-B electric brush continues to be great and I subscribe to these replacement heads to make sure I always have them on hand when the old one gets worn.  I like this particular model better than the other Oral-B heads, though they all work OK</li>
            <li> I had been using the Oral-B Dual Action brush for a long time and decided to give these a try just for something different. This brush fits my Braun electric. Brush size is much smaller than the Dual Action allowing you to target those hard to clean teeth in the back.  The small size lets you really brush the insides and back side of those teeth far better than the bigger Dual Action.  In fact, this brush is half the size of the Dual Action.  I like the size better and believe it gets those back teeth far cleaner.  The floss action brush seems to be a little more gentle on the gum line without sacrificing the cleaning power of bristles.  Love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I used this brush for a few days, but it feels like torture. I&#x27;m sure some people love them, my son likes them. I gave them a go because he likes them, but I do not. I like the really really soft bristles on the Oral B...or a hand held one I just got from Vine by oral B for \\&quot;mature mouths\\&quot; or something to that effect. I now use that handheld one in place of my electric Oral B - with or without floss action. Anyway, you can go with my review and avoid this brush if you have sensitive gums (and I&#x27;m a flosser) or go with my son, who has always preferred this style of brush over the others. That&#x27;s why I gave it in the middle stars...it&#x27;s going to be a matter of preference on these.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional Model Eb23-4 Floss Action Replacement Heads is such a powerful brush and my teeth loves the way it feels and I love the way my teeth look. I can tell that bristles are getting into those tight spaces and cleaning my teeth. The Oral-B brush-head is a premium brand that gets the job done effectively  and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is not a substitution for flossing but is more of a companion that helps to optimizes your cleaning experience for a more healthy and beautiful smile. Once you own an Oral-B you will always want one because your mouth just feels so much better. I love the Oral-B Floss Action Replacement Headsand will always be a fan of them.</li>
            <li> I love these.  They&#x27;re smaller than you might be used to, less than the surface area of a dime, but between their bristles and some rubbery pick points, they really feel like they&#x27;re getting further between my teeth than most brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s Good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Super penetrating action.  They&#x27;re definitely not a substitute for flossing, but still great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- A good bargain.  If you replace your brush head every three months (as recommended), this pack will last you for a year, and you won&#x27;t spend three or four weeks with a gnarly brush, thinking that one of these days you will have to order a replacement.  (At least, not until next year, and not even then if you subscribe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- There are color strips in the bristles to help you remember when to change heads, and colored rings that you can interchange to tell your brush apart from your family members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Stuff to Consider:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- As I said, the head is about half the surface area of a traditional manual toothbrush.  That doesn&#x27;t bug me, but if you prefer full size, consider Oral B&#x27;s [[ASIN:B008I2IKMW Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Lastly, the description says that this doesn&#x27;t fit a Vitality.  Just as an experiment, I tried it on our spare brush, an [[ASIN:B003UKR67M Oral-B Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]], and as far as I can tell, it fits perfectly and works fine.  So these MIGHT work on your Vitality, but use at your own risk, and don&#x27;t blame me if your toothbrush overbrushes, or breaks, or something.</li>
            <li> Of course I recommend this products to everyone. The quality is exactly like the ones that I had previously experienced but with much lower price and very neat and clean package. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Compared with the standard, all-bristles head; this one seems a bit too firm.  I&#x27;m alternating using it with the others in case it causes extra wear on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Years of dental visits prove that these things work!  Your teeth feel like you&#x27;ve just come from the dental office with each use...</li>
            <li> The function of the units is exactly as I expected. They appear to cover all of the area intended and the function with the electric system is excellent. The longer term effect of these type of brushes is yet to be judged by me. After using a couple of brushes over a longer period of time and then visiting my dentist for a check up, I will be in a position with information to judge them accurately.</li>
            <li> original Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Head - as expected. The &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; is really nice. good replacement heads</li>
            <li> Everything just feel what I want and what I need. The main thing is the price is quite good. It is even lower than Sam&#x27;s club&#x27;s price when I bought it.</li>
            <li> This is either the second or third time I have purchased this product.  I prefer to combine the floss action with the soft head to get the best of both worlds...gentle and a little abrasive.  Ever since I have been using the Oral B Electric Tooth Brush, my trips to the dentist are the best in years...no cavities and minimal amount of work on the teeth.</li>
            <li> Work great and it is nice to get them delivered to your house.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Eb25-4 Floss Action replacement brush heads do a great job and are the same brush head that came with [[ASIN:B008PEMOV6 MY]] Oral-B brush, so I am happy with them. It is cost effective to buy them in this four-packs rather than singly, so I would recommend this package on that alone if you are using an Oral-B brush that you are already happy with. They seem to last longer than other tooth brushes and brush heads I&#x27;ve used too. They clean my teeth well, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve noticed any special \\&quot;floss action\\&quot; over a standard head. In fact, there are are Sonicare brushes I&#x27;ve used that give me a deeper clean, though the difference is negligible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that these are probably the best brush head available for Oral-B brushes. They don&#x27;t eliminate the need to floss, but they do a respectable job of removing food particles from between teeth, as well as providing a thorough brushing. If these suit your needs, find the best price you can don&#x27;t hesitate to get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
            <li> These are our favorite choice for the Oral-B toothbrushes we have. They do a great job of cleaning, are long lasting, comfortable, and do a very thorough job. Each head has 2 colors. You get 2 red yellow brushes. And 2 blue and green ones. So you have more than enough for 4 different colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like these because they are well balanced. Do a good job on teeth and gums and also good for whitening. Just a solid overall choice for an Oral-B brush.</li>
            <li> I have been fond of the &#x27;dual action&#x27; brush heads for quite a while, but now I am completely hooked on these &#x27;floss-action&#x27; ones.  The &#x27;floss-action&#x27; really works.  I only tend to floss every couple of weeks or so, and I can tell a huge difference when using these brush heads - it&#x27;s almost like I really don&#x27;t need to floss at all.  There seems to be no debris left between my teeth and there definitely was with the other heads.  Also, I am convinced the little plastic flossing paddles give you a bit more polishing action because my teeth seem a bit smoother when using them.  At first, they feel a little odd when you are used to normal brush fibers only, but they are really worth getting used to.  I think my teeth are much cleaner since switching.</li>
            <li> Atomic hot!!  Horseradish is the hottest around!&lt;br /&gt; Royal fun !!  Scooter is best for value compared to others in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Oral B Bummer!!!  Toothbrush replacements aren&#x27;t the original size heads and don&#x27;t last half as long. .</li>
            <li> The floss action brush is the best for me.  I slowly go up and down my teeth and the flossing material gets in between my teeth while the Oral-B unit I have does its thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> This is the right product at the right price.  I&amp;#34;ll buy these products again when these wear out next year</li>
            <li> No problem so far, been more than a year.</li>
            <li> For years I learned to expect bad news and lots of head-shaking when I visited the dentist and got my gums \\&quot;charted\\&quot;.  Lots of \\&quot;5\\&quot; pockets (that&#x27;s bad) with 4s and 3s making up most of the rest.  She was having me visit four times a year for cleaning because my gums needed it.  I did not floss regularly, but even when I did it didn&#x27;t seem to help a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for years, but always with the small round heads.  On a whim, I picked up a pack of the \\&quot;Floss Action\\&quot; heads and tried those for a few months.  Over the next couple of visits, my charting numbers started to improve significantly - what were 5s were now 3s, and I had lots of 1s (good). When I was asked what I had changed, the only thing was the switch to the Floss-Action brushes.  I&#x27;ve continued to improve to the point where I&#x27;m back at the usual two visits a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Oral-B says right up front - these are not a replacement for flossing.  But they do definitely help, especially with gums at the front and back of the teeth where you don&#x27;t floss anyway (rather than between teeth).  I&#x27;ve now been using these brush heads for three years, and I&#x27;m a believer. My dentist has even stopped trying to sell me on the mega-expensive Rotadent her practice offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife, however, can&#x27;t use these as she needs the \\&quot;extra soft\\&quot; bristles and the Floss-Action heads don&#x27;t come that way.  Too bad, as she has worse gums than I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering these, do pay careful attention to which model Oral-B handle you have.  The Floss-Action heads fit most of the higher-end models, but not the lower-end, such as \\&quot;Vitality\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had various Oral-B toothbrushes (and brush heads) for the last 10 years and these are my favorite.  They&#x27;re a little big and rough, but used with the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brush mode they&#x27;re just perfect (for me).</li>
            <li> These brush heads add a bit more cleaning power to the already excellent handset I&#x27;m using.  Both the regular, and the Floss action brush heads do a good job, but the Floss action ones stimulate my gums a bit more, as well as cleaning better between teeth.  I still floss, but I don&#x27;t need to work as hard at it!  Nice product.</li>
            <li> Three members of my family have been using the Oral B professional line for years. Our favorite brush head is this FLOSS ACTION head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a strip of flat silicone type material amid the bristles on the brush head. This is supposed to simulate flossing. All we know is that we like it better than the standard head which is 100% bristles. Everyone feels it cleans their teeth better than the standard head because it leaves our teeth feeling more polished and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We rate this brush head 5 stars &#x3D; We Love It.</li>
            <li> I have used both the Oral-B System and (currently) am using the Philips Sonicare toothbrush. Both work very well. If you&#x27;re going to use the Oral-B toothbrushes, these heads are just excellent. I really do like that you can identify which brush head is yours (if you share with someone) with the little colored snap-on piece, so if that&#x27;s a concern for you, the Sonicare system doesn&#x27;t have any such way of identifying which head is yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are well-constructed, and I&#x27;d only trust genuine Oral-B products in my mouth, that&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars out of 5.</li>
            <li> Bought the unit and I&#x27;ve used this product many times. Nice size head to reach all areas. Does the job!</li>
            <li> Delivered as advertised. Items were new and unopened.  I would recommend this item to anyone interested in getting a good deal.</li>
            <li> These are worth the money don&#x27;t buy the generic or you will regret it. The flossing action is the best.</li>
            <li> About 10 years ago I had gingivitis.  That&#x27;s right ... I must face the ugly confession.  Bi-annual dental cleanings were a painful, hour long bleeding session.  Then I started flossing twice per day, and switched to an electric toothbrush using these heads.  The result?  No more gingivitis, no more bleeding gums, and cleanings are a 15 minute breeze - last time I actually fell asleep while she was doing it ... I think that covers it all ... if you want a clean and healthy mouth you MUST floss regularly and you MUST have a well made powered toothbrush with effective heads.  If you don&#x27;t have this, you need this.</li>
            <li> They are fine.  You have several choices of heads to use.  I think they are a bit pricey though and you can also get replacements at your local grocery store.</li>
            <li> These brushes have a good firmness with the floss action component. Also the circular motion of brushing with these is far better than the typical tooth brush.  I won&#x27;t be going back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush for more than 15 years. I originally reviewed the 3-pack of these brush heads back in 2008 ([[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]]). At the time, I preferred the regular, round non-flossing brushes to these. In the four plus years since then, I&#x27;ve changed my mind and now consider these Floss Action brushes my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work well. They deliver the nice, absolutely clean feeling that we all love and have come to expect from our Oral-B&#x27;s. Braun embeds 4 small rubber \\&quot;paddles\\&quot; into the brush head to, according to them, get between the teeth giving the same benefit as Dental Floss. I can not detect any \\&quot;flossing\\&quot; from the brush, but that would be difficult to assess. It may be that the \\&quot;paddles\\&quot; do get between teeth and below the gum line more effectively than the regular bristles, but only your dentist would be able to tell. They cause no discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback, as far as I am concerned, is that the brush head has been enlarged to accommodate the flossers. Rather than being circular, like the regular heads, it is an oval. The width is the same, but the height is about half again as large. I think that one of the Oral-B&#x27;s great strengths is that the small heads can be maneuvered in such a way that you can clean every surface of every tooth. That is slightly (but only slightly) compromised here because of the larger size. Back in 2008, I thought this was more of an issue than I have found it to be in the years since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It amazes me, but there appears to be a *thriving* market in counterfeit Oral-B Brush Heads! I purchase them only when they come directly from Amazon. Under the price, where it says \\&quot;Sold By\\&quot; make sure that it says \\&quot;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com.\\&quot; If it doesn&#x27;t, look over on the right side of the page where it says, \\&quot;More Buying Choices,\\&quot; and see if you can find one that says Amazon. Some of the Third Party Vendors are quite good and completely reputable, but I don&#x27;t think they are carefully monitored so, when in doubt, stick with Mother Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the 3-pack, where the brushes come mounted together in a stiff cardboard package meant to hang on a display, these come as individually packaged brushes in a plain cardboard box. This is reminiscent of what Amazon calls \\&quot;frustration-free\\&quot; packaging for some of their other products, and I wonder if it might be a reaction to the counterfeiting issue.completely reputable, but I don&#x27;t think they are carefully monitored so, when in doubt, stick with Mother Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the 3-pack, where the brushes come mounted together in a stiff cardboard package meant to hang on a display, these come as individually packaged brushes in a plain cardboard box.

            <li> I really love these. I usually only brush, floss and gargle in the AM and gargle at bedtime. I have used these brush heads for several years. When I started to use them I used to have a lot of tarter build up between dentist visits I usually had a cavity or two also. Not any more. My visits are short and cavity free and my dentist says he loves my teeth. That&#x27;s good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a suggestion for those who say that the toothbrush is \\&quot;beating up\\&quot; your mouth. Most of the Oral B brushes that use these heads have a sensitive mode for those who have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes for getting into hard to reach areas.  I will continue to use them always.  Nice to have extras on hand so you can replace as needed.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite of all the oral-b brush heads - it just feels like these do a much better job of getting the teeth clean than the others do.</li>
            <li> I bought some of the knock off replacement heads, and then came back to these, and these are well worth their price. The knock offs broke in a variety of ways within weeks, and I&#x27;m not too sure how good the bristles were on my teeth. These feel noticeably better and more durable.</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads are a great way to have some on hand so you can replace them as often as you are supposed to--like every three months. I love my electric toothbrush, and I really do notice a difference in how clean my teeth feel when I replace the brush heads regularly. Get four of them online while you can check your model number for the right kind and avoid that situation where you&#x27;re in the store knowing you need a new one (do you really?), but you can&#x27;t remember which one is the right one. I love being able to get replacement heads this way!</li>
            <li> The Floss action brush head features longer bristles (blue indicator type) at the north and south ends (2 rows, 2 wide), white bristles at the east and west ends (1 row, 2 deep), and a teal colored array of bristles at center (7 groups). As well, at the NE, NW, SE, and SW positions are located the 4 yellow paddles that provide some extra cleaning and, I suspect, gum stimulation. These are very soft and flexible. The bristles all seem to be about the same stiffness, but the blue ones are the tallest (they&#x27;ll be going between teeth as you move along).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a replacement Floss Action brush heads with an Oral-B SmartSeries 4000 brush for the past month (previously used the Floss Action head that came with the brush). Here are my observations for the performance and features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent cleaning action: The Floss action brush heads do a fantastic job cleaning. I used them for several weeks right before my semi-annual professional cleaning, and the hygeinist, whom I have used for several years and whose performance is very consistent, spent noticeably less time cleaning than she usually does. THAT alone is quite worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Available as Subscribe and Save: If these are your brush heads of choice, you can save some coin by going the Subscribe and Save route. I do it on several products, and it&#x27;s an easy to use feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Brush Head with MicroPulse Bristles: If you view the comparison chart, the Floss Action brush head is the only one that contains the MicroPulse bristles. These are the ones that are supposed to get to hard-to-reach areas. I don&#x27;t know about you, but my hard-to-reach areas are in the back of the mouth, and the elongated head shape is helpful to getting back a little further. As well, those blue bristles on the end, being a bit longer, are the ones that are doing the reaching. The claim seems valid in my observation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: The price of these brush heads is not exactly what anyone would call a bargain. Even using them beyond the recommended time, you&#x27;re still looking at a new brush head say every 4 months, a 3-pack goes for over $15 here, so that&#x27;s the annual replacement cost for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Limited Compatibility: The brushes they work on include Oral-B Triumph, Oral-B Smart Series, Oral-B Professional Care, Oral-B Vitality (except for Vitality Sonic) and Oral-B Pro-Health Power, but not Vitality Sonic, Sonic Complete, Pulsonic, CrossAction Power. All these names get very confusing after a while. (Aside: Don&#x27;t you think sometimes that everything should just be numbered? Ipad 1, 2, 3 ... not 1, 2, New. Wha? Oral-B Cross flex double action flashback goomba model. Please. Simplicity. That&#x27;s what we want.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither Pro Nor Con:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gentle Touch Required: These brush heads do not have any special \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; bristles ... they all seem to be about the same stiffness. If you are a person who bears down, you must be prepared to lighten up your pressure or else these brush heads will make you quite sore. If you do use a lighter touch, you will be rewarded by great cleaning performance, in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Head is Slightly Larger than the Standard and Sensitive Brush Heads: In case you are heavily invested in the tiny size of the standard or sensitive heads, the Floss Action is just a bit larger. The difference is mostly that the Floss Action is a bit elongated; the width seems pretty much the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though not inexpensive, the Floss Action brush heads provide excellent cleaning action, but require a gentle touch to avoid tearing up your gums during use. As well, they do not work on all models of Oral-B brushes, so be sure to check compatibility before buying. And be aware that the brush head is a bit elongated compared to the standard and sensitive heads.

            <li> Here is a product that performs exactly as promised.  It does a superb job of maintaining gum health.  After three or four months of use, some of the bristles signal time for a replacement by a change in their color.  The \\&quot;Floss Action\\&quot; designation is a little misleading.  These brush heads do not replace use of regular dental floss for dental health.</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes are cheaper than I&#x27;ve found at Target. The floss action does a great job at cleaning. Repeat customer.</li>
            <li> These Oral B Professional Floss Action Brushes are an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are replacement heads so you need to have the machine portion to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These flossing brushes----stick in and out of your teeth helping to keep them clean and the gums healthy ....and they work perfectly for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeps your Dentist happy and your Gums the way they are supposed to be......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are different types of heads---but if you need the flossing action this would be for you..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably more for adults and older teens --but not the younger kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral B--Just seems to deliver excellence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same goes with these...</li>
            <li> I think for many people, this would be an excellent toothbrush. My teeth do feel cleaner after using it. But if your mouth is at all sensitive, give this a pass. There are 4 hard plastic \\&quot;flossing bristles\\&quot;, and once the brush is turned on, they whip around very vigorously. I find this to be uncomfortable, almost painful. I brush my tongue as well, and those hard bristles have made it very tender and sore.</li>
            <li> Good price for the brush heads.</li>
            <li> Think these work well, expensive though. No other complaints except for price.  I think it does a great job on the teeth, love Oral-B stuff...though, as I mentioned pricey, I think it is worth it for my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> my cleaning dental appointments went from every three months to six months.  after using it, even after the first time your teeth feel so clean it makes you want to use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the floss action heads for a few years now and am amazed at how good of a job they do cleaning my teeth. This is a long lasting product. If only you are using the brush heads, you should get 2 years or so out of the four, as indicated by the wear markers on the heads. You also have to BEWARE of imitations on eBay and other sites. These are the real deal and will no cut you or have the floss \\&quot;ribs\\&quot; come off after a few uses...</li>
            <li> I have never gotten a bad Oral-B Product, these brushes are durable (within the three month recommended  useful life period), and seem to be well designed, as described on Amazon&#x27;s website. Product arrived sooner than promised.</li>
            <li> Good price for the replacement toothbrushes for my Oral B toothbrush.  They come four individually packaged, and look and work just like the original toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect in my oral B toothbrush. Original heads and very good for cleanning tooth. Worth every penny. VEry cheap also</li>
            <li> I went to my dentist and he said, \\&quot;Have you been flossing\\&quot; and I was like \\&quot;No\\&quot; so then after awhile I said, \\&quot;Oh wait I did get the Oral B Flossing... thingy.\\&quot; SO WOW!!! It really did work and TBH I was a bit sketchy thinking it would work, but in the end it did. NOTE: It DOES NOT replace flossing.</li>
