            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this type of Tongue Cleaner in the stores for a couple years now!</li>
            <li>So glad I found it!</li>
            <li>Love it and nothing comes close to getting the job done!</li>
            <li>Strong material great for my breath.</li>

            <li>these work great and for the price, are worth trying!</li>
            <li>They very effectively get rid of any leftover plaque on my tongue and give me a really nice clean feeling.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy, nice and pro tongue brush.</li>
            <li>strong , durable all good here.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and do a good job.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>, so scraping is much more effective.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice to be able to choose the colours one is to receive.  </li>
            <li>This tongue cleaner is by far the best one that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shape, comfy handle and its super easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very comfortable  and sturdy tool.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t find that many products are made in USA.&lt;br</li>
            <li>no complains, works better than tooth brush</li>
            <li>Have tried all types of tongue scrapers and this is simply the best!  </li>
            <li>They work better than others because they are made of rigid, non-pliable plastic.</li>
            <li>A toothbrush works much better.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love these would recommend</li>
            <li>Buy this brand because it is sturdy and so much better than the ones you find in stores.</li>
            <li>This is my all-time favorite tongue scraper, been using them for years, but the plastic does break after a while.  </li>
            <li>Glad is was a set of three.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite scrapers.  </li>
            <li>Glad I got these.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad to have found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I like this one better than the OraSweet.</li>
            <li>Ok, prefer using brush</li>
            <li>My Son loves to use it and it safe for children</li>
            <li>Please use this your breath Will smell better</li>
            <li>I read that using a tongue cleaner is one of the best things you can do for your overall health.  </li>
            <li>This tongue scraper is so much better than the ones you buy at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>I own a tooth brush that on the apposite side of the bristles has a tongue cleaner and together with the scraper</li>
            <li>and it still works like magic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep hunting for a better one.</li>
            <li>Great seller, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Better to use before eating anything in the morning to prevent nausea and gagging.</li>
            <li>love the 3 pack.</li>
            <li>glad I found it on amazon.</li>
            <li>Used to buy them in store but no longer able to find them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll order more for my family and friends.</li>
            <li>It is very durable and does a great job.</li>
            <li>While one may think, why am I paying for 3 simple plastic molded tools, I believe that these scrapers are designed perfectly for most tongues.  </li>
            <li>I love these things.</li>
            <li>SHIPMENT CAME FAST, GREAT QUALITY AND PRICE.</li>
            <li>I love you Pureline, thenks for helping me fix what&#x27;s worong.</li>
            <li>This type of tongue scraper is my favorite (I have tried the ones on the backside of toothbrushes and ones that are plastic strips that you fold and then scrape)....</li>
            <li>(thank goodness) :)</li>
            <li>LOVE these.  </li>
            <li>We have used many tongue scrapers over the years which is how we know</li>
            <li>Once we realized how much better of a design</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought other brands and honestly, this one is the best.</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;ll hold up very nicely over time too which is really preferable.</li>
            <li>I definitely feel this product does a great job getting food buildup off the tongue and helps you to have much better breath!</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I gave one to each of my 3 sons!</li>
            <li>Shipped fast, item was packaged nicely and I would buy it again!  </li>
            <li>Use this item every day, even my grandaughter (7) likes to use it to keep her tongue clean after brushing!</li>
            <li>I am clean now!  </li>
            <li>still waiting to see if these will break or crack, but working fine for now, Thanx, I&#x27;ll get some more</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t feel I have a clean mouth in the morning unless I scrap my tongue!</li>
            <li>I have tried many other tongue scrapers and these were the best ever.  </li>
            <li>for this product itself, this has to be by far the best buy on Amazon for tongue cleaners; you get 3 for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The Pureline still cleans the best as the head it wide</li>
            <li>Great Product all that was promised, delivered early before date quoted,</li>
            <li>The wide shape is especially effective.</li>
            <li>i have had other tongue cleaners and this is the best one ever.  </li>
            <li>No bad breath here!</li>
            <li>my tongue is fresh &amp; clean throughout my morning &amp; evenings before I sleep, yay!!</li>
            <li>Best cleaner made for your tounge BUT starts to fall apart after a few months and you must buy more.</li>
            <li>and we love the ease of use and its clean effect.</li>
            <li>These work great and the scrapper is not sharp on the taste buds at all.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels very fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>The product works great, it cleans very well and are pretty colors.  </li>
            <li>Delivered quickly!</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and items were in a sealed package!</li>
            <li>I was very thankful to find these on Amazon and to get three is even better as I probably won&#x27;t need to ever buy another one again!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even fit these in my mouth.</li>
            <li>They work great to get all the way to the back of your tongue</li>
            <li>Great material, will last for ever.</li>
            <li>great for the extra effort in mouth health</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>All the ones in the store are cheap and bend.  </li>
            <li>for people with giant mouths lol</li>
            <li>They will eventually break near the crossbar after about two years, but provide good scraping in the meantime.</li>
            <li>But so far so good.  </li>
            <li>The scraper fits our tongues like a glove and really does a great job scraping the whole width of our tongues in each pass.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are better then the first ones I started using over 3 years ago ( firm/Rigid ).</li>
            <li>worth the money!</li>
            <li>Fresh Breath!</li>
            <li>I have to use these tongue scrapers or my tongue does not feel clean.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush just don&#x27;t get it as clean in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I like the way these clean the tongue.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t feel clean unless I scraped every day.</li>
            <li>Work well keeping my tongue clean thank you</li>
            <li>I had a plastic one then tried out the metal one that was flimsy and did clean as well.</li>
            <li>My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel clean without them,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>how clean your mouth feels after use.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it to anyone who likes a super fresh clean mouth!</li>
            <li>I love this product so much.</li>
            <li>Love it, fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>They last for a good time.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>After a good bit of use, the handle finally broke, and Wal-Mart had stopped carrying them in the stores.  </li>
            <li>only good tongue scraper I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>It really works and I&#x27;m glad I ordered a set.</li>
            <li>This three-pack is such a good deal.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down, the absolute best tongue scraper on the market.  </li>
            <li>They scrape away the bacteria and clean your tongue leaving your breath fresh and your mouth clean.  </li>
            <li>Helps clean the tongue to maintain fresh breath.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like my mouth is clean and fresh if I haven&#x27;t used my tongue cleaner.</li>
            <li>it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>They answered my question with lightning speed and my order got here just as quickly, I even was allowed to choose the colors I wanted..</li>
            <li>You will definitely get a clean tongue after using this amazing product.</li>
            <li>I like these better than the new fangled brush-like ones.</li>
            <li>I love these tongue cleaners cant live with out them.  </li>
            <li>Also, it never loses it&#x27;s shape, and comes in many fun colors.  </li>
            <li>but if this is your first tongue scraper be prepare to have yourself gagging!</li>
            <li>no complaints, exactly as pictured/described!  </li>
            <li>Exactly as describe, came right on time!</li>
            <li>Well worth it, and breath smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of anything i dislike about this product, and it comes in fun colors.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels cleaner and my breath feels fresh for longer periods now every day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually quite surprising how much scrapes off.  </li>
            <li>There are several different types of tongue cleaners out there, but these are my absolute favorite!!!  </li>
            <li>to clean under hot water, and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It also does a better scraping job than most other ones.  </li>
            <li>so I had to buy another one right away.</li>
            <li>Everyone should have one of these right alongside their toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My husband is a tongue cleaner and these are right up his alley -  one for every bathroom and to travel with.</li>
            <li>They have the right combination of size, stiffness and the right edge to scrape the tongue.  </li>
            <li>I could not remember the maker, but an amazon search popped it right up, and I got them in 2 days.</li>
            <li>This gets your tongue clean and your whole mouth will thank you because of this.</li>
            <li>Until you use one you will not imagine how much they clean your tongue.  </li>
            <li>Best tongue scraper around - wide enough for your whole tongue.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone who wants a clean tongue!</li>
            <li>It does a great job of cleaning and is sturdy enough to hold up to multiple uses a day.</li>
            <li>YOU VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li>They work great without hardly any of a gag effect</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought so many different kinds.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>how much I used it!</li>
            <li>As some reviewers have noted, this tongue cleaner is a larger size than most.</li>
            <li>This tongue cleaner works well, gets to the back of the tongue where most of the nasties hide.</li>
            <li>but this one is big and gets more of my tongue.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the first one</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>They are plastic, so they will eventually break after long-time use, but I still think they do a ten times better job than rubber-type tongue cleaners.</li>
            <li>I first found this product about 5 years ago, at a retail store, and used it for about 1&amp;1/2 -2yrs</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this</li>
            <li>Love this product and only can get on line</li>
            <li>and I recall they cleaned much better back then.</li>
            <li>Glad to finally find it online.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t convinced about buying a tongue cleaner, go to Wikipedia or any reputably sourced info webpage to see the benefits of cleaning your tongue properly, you will be astonished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First time using a tongue cleaner and it met my expectations.</li>
            <li>You can clean more of your tongue because it does not give you the &amp;#34;gagging&amp;#34; effect that you get from other tongue cleaners.  </li>
            <li>The length of the cleaner is just right as well, I have no problem reaching far back on my tongue without needing to put my hand inside my own</li>
            <li>When I went to get a new one, the only kind the retail stores carry now don&#x27;t work well at all.  </li>
            <li>so I would have liked to pick my colors, but other than that</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s larger size (compared to most Tongue cleaners) makes it very efficient.</li>
            <li>Good and sharp!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super flexible like some others as to where it won&#x27;t be able to really scrape your tongue clean.</li>
            <li>and I do 2 scrapes, certainly not as wide as my mouth, and I&#x27;m pretty sure a toddler would have no trouble putting this in his mouth.</li>
            <li>Simple, easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is the only one I will use as it is strong and does not bend and cleans remarkabley well.</li>
            <li>have seen a few posts about &amp;#34;life changing&amp;#34; results, with better health and no bad morning breath.</li>
            <li>Quite large.....</li>
            <li>They have a large head for cleaning the whole tongue in one swipe.</li>
            <li>a side note : If you smoke ( I don&#x27;t ) you REALLY NEED to get some of these.</li>
            <li>My whole mouth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li>Durable and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s really what you&#x27;re doing haha)</li>
            <li>when trying to scrape so it takes two strokes to cover the whole tongue.</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>Amazingly fast for &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; shipping.</li>
            <li>Seem to work very well.</li>
            <li>and I taped it together to keep using it, Fast shipping and nice seller, will definitely come back</li>
            <li>These work really well.  </li>
            <li>It really helps get all the gunk.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li>I got these at reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Very well made and</li>
            <li>In addition, its edges are smooth and do not scratch the tongue as some of the lesser quality ones out there.  </li>
            <li>I cannot stress how much a tongue scraper is needed in out society.</li>
            <li>This product really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>These are sturdy and hold up when applying pressure needed to really scrape the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>I appreciate the fast delivery.</li>
            <li>REALLY well.  </li>
            <li>Even our young Children use these!!!</li>
            <li>My original tongue scraper handle broke on me, but I used that son of gun until the actual scraper itself broke!!</li>
            <li>These work better than any of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Works way better than any other one I have tried.</li>
            <li>I bought this product originally years ago and then lost it, I could not find the same brand</li>
            <li>It is shaped correctly that it is easy to get to the back of the tongue and large enough to cover the whole tongue.  </li>
            <li>It is hard plastic and has kept a nice edge that really scrapes that stuff off.  </li>
            <li>Again, one lasted me half a decade :)</li>
            <li>They do eventually crack and break - typical life is 2 or 3 years of use, which seems OK.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m particular about colors</li>
            <li>At first these tounge cleaners did exactly what they were suppose to do and seemed as if they would last a while.</li>
            <li>Was very surprised at how much &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; I got off my tongue.</li>
            <li>I have tried several other tongue scrapers and hands down, these are by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this value pack to anyone looking to take care of their tongues.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a high school teacher.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This is a very important part of my everyday hygiene.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Most of the other ones I tried did not work nearly as well.</li>
            <li>: the head is a bit too large to reach the area near the throat</li>
            <li>My husband and I love this little piece of equipment.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if you really only wanted just a single cleaner there might be a more cost efficient product on Amazon with a similar if not the same design, however, with this deal, you would at least be able to have 2 backup cleaners which is always nice.</li>
            <li>If you are an adult, and have been brushing your teeth for your whole life, but want to do a little bit more, this might help a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So glad this type of tongue cleaner is available on Amazon as it&#x27;s hard to find them at the local drug store.</li>
            <li>I am really looking for an old fashion tongue scraper.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re extremely wide and the circumference is huge.</li>
            <li>Great no excellent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wider and more firm than the ones sold in stores.</li>
            <li>so they are well worth their low price.</li>
            <li>They still work well enough that it&#x27;s worth it to me to buy a new one every year or two.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it, my mouth feels so refreshed knowing</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without tongue cleaners........</li>
            <li>I only found the stainless steel ones here, but the plastic ones you sell works just as well and is very durable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty simple device, but it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;they are better than what we get in walmart with small heads.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the small ones that most stores are selling these days.</li>
            <li>Only thing I use for tongue cleaner.  Not flimsy.  Very durable!</li>
            <li>First off, if you&#x27;ve never used a standalone tongue cleaner, I would definitely recommend you to pick one up regardless of which it is.  </li>
            <li>better than the other smaller ones out there.</li>
            <li>This is almost certainly deliberate on the part of the design engineers; if the handle were stronger, the scraper would last forever and there would be no need to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>Just wide enough and &#x27;clean&#x27; very well.</li>
            <li>I have used one or two other ones in the past, but once I found this one I loved it.</li>
            <li>I always liked this style of tongue scraper but suddenly got hard to find.</li>
            <li>The plastic seems stronger than my old Pureline Tongue Cleaner, too, so I expect these will last me much longer.  </li>
            <li>My 2 old tongue scrapers broke, ( should have glued them )and</li>
            <li>I bought enough for the whole family.</li>
            <li>My tongue naturally V-shapes</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m around adults and young people all day.</li>
            <li>so far... I will recommend this item to my friends.</li>
            <li>Works as promised and makes me realize how gross the mouth really is.</li>
            <li>Old one broke and no one seems to carry these in the stores.  </li>
            <li>think I&#x27;ve tried every model available but since discovering this one a few years ago</li>
            <li>and I was informed of the shipping status directly by them.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it enough to find out how much I really llike it.  </li>
            <li>This cleans the tongue completely.</li>
            <li>There are no special features really to talk about as it is really a very efficient and simple design which does exactly what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li>Firstly, it is flexible, so it does not clean very well.  </li>
            <li>Since the scrapers are wide compared to some other tongue cleaners, it doesn&#x27;t really make you gag even if you reach a bit far back, however, you may still gag from time to time, that is only natural for most people.  </li>
            <li>Run over the tongue a few time until it rinses clean.</li>
            <li>My husband will only use this brand of tongue cleaner for the past 5 or more years and they stopped selling them in the pharmacy&#x27;s  here</li>
            <li>Pros: definitely decisive cleaning, for the main part of the tongue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I would give them 5 stars except for the fact that the handle has been cleverly designed to break after about 3-4 months of daily usage.</li>
            <li>This one is a nice big loop, and it makes me gag far less than other ones I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>last a long time, and I clean it regularly in the dishwasher -</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li>Go easy your first few times or your tongue can get raw and bleed.</li>
            <li>and we gave the other two away to friends who were interested in trying them out).  </li>
            <li>Still, the other tongue scrapers I&#x27;ve tried have been so woefully ineffective in comparison to this brand that I&#x27;m willing to order three or four of these every year.</li>
            <li>I think these are the best Tongue Cleaners on the market, however, I was disappointed that the seller sent three red ones instead of three different colors.</li>
            <li>The edge that you scrape against your tongue is not sharp or covered in ridges both of which we appreciate.</li>
            <li>Good oral care is important so that you can help to cut down on bad breath.  </li>
            <li>These are the only scrapers firm enough to actually scrape your tongue, others are flimsy and just glide along the top removing nothing.  </li>
            <li>We like how it is wide and covers a large amount of your tongue at one time.</li>
            <li>a little while to get used to, but definitely worth it</li>
            <li>great product would recommend - been using for 10+ years and gets rid of lots of bacteria and bad breath.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting and really scrape off the bacteria.</li>
            <li>They are made very well and last a long time</li>
            <li>Been using the same product, but I was not having too much luck trying to find same one locally.</li>
            <li>This one is much better than the other tongue scrapers I&#x27;ve used with the narrow heads and thin plastic that snaps or bends easily.</li>
            <li>It is a wounder full piece of tool for proper hygiene but is a little to big for kids under 12 years of age</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used many tongue scrapers, and most are either too small or inconvenient.</li>
            <li>This is hard plastic that allows you to scrape the tongue clean.  </li>
            <li>If you continue to use old one you could possibly choke on tiny plastic shards falling off.</li>
            <li>I first purchased one of these at Wal-Mart a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>It takes a few passes to get most of it though, and it can leave your tongue feeling a bit raw.</li>
            <li>Usually the handle is to long and flexes to much and the blade on most other scrapers is to narrow.</li>
            <li>Very solid, you&#x27;d really have to mess with these things to break them.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Have tried all types of tongue scrapers and this is simply the best!  </li>
            <li> They work better than others because they are made of rigid, non-pliable plastic.</li>
            <li> A toothbrush works much better.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Love these would recommend</li>
            <li> Buy this brand because it is sturdy and so much better than the ones you find in stores.</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite tongue scraper, been using them for years, but the plastic does break after a while.  </li>
            <li> Glad is was a set of three.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite scrapers.  </li>
            <li> Glad I got these.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad to have found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like this one better than the OraSweet.</li>
            <li> Ok, prefer using brush</li>
            <li> My Son loves to use it and it safe for children</li>
            <li> Please use this your breath Will smell better</li>
            <li> I read that using a tongue cleaner is one of the best things you can do for your overall health.  </li>
            <li> This tongue scraper is so much better than the ones you buy at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> I own a tooth brush that on the apposite side of the bristles has a tongue cleaner and together with the scraper</li>
            <li> and it still works like magic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep hunting for a better one.</li>
            <li> Great seller, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Better to use before eating anything in the morning to prevent nausea and gagging.</li>
            <li> love the 3 pack.</li>
            <li> glad I found it on amazon.</li>
            <li> Used to buy them in store but no longer able to find them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll order more for my family and friends.</li>
            <li> It is very durable and does a great job.</li>
            <li> While one may think, why am I paying for 3 simple plastic molded tools, I believe that these scrapers are designed perfectly for most tongues.  </li>
            <li> I love these things.</li>
            <li> SHIPMENT CAME FAST, GREAT QUALITY AND PRICE.</li>
            <li> I love you Pureline, thenks for helping me fix what&#x27;s worong.</li>
            <li> This type of tongue scraper is my favorite (I have tried the ones on the backside of toothbrushes and ones that are plastic strips that you fold and then scrape)....</li>
            <li> (thank goodness) :)</li>
            <li> LOVE these.  </li>
            <li> We have used many tongue scrapers over the years which is how we know</li>
            <li> Once we realized how much better of a design</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other brands and honestly, this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;ll hold up very nicely over time too which is really preferable.</li>
            <li> I definitely feel this product does a great job getting food buildup off the tongue and helps you to have much better breath!</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I gave one to each of my 3 sons!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, item was packaged nicely and I would buy it again!  </li>
            <li> Use this item every day, even my grandaughter (7) likes to use it to keep her tongue clean after brushing!</li>
            <li> I am clean now!  </li>
            <li> still waiting to see if these will break or crack, but working fine for now, Thanx, I&#x27;ll get some more</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t feel I have a clean mouth in the morning unless I scrap my tongue!</li>
            <li> I have tried many other tongue scrapers and these were the best ever.  </li>
            <li> for this product itself, this has to be by far the best buy on Amazon for tongue cleaners; you get 3 for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> The Pureline still cleans the best as the head it wide</li>
            <li> Great Product all that was promised, delivered early before date quoted,</li>
            <li> The wide shape is especially effective.</li>
            <li> i have had other tongue cleaners and this is the best one ever.  </li>
            <li> No bad breath here!</li>
            <li> my tongue is fresh &amp; clean throughout my morning &amp; evenings before I sleep, yay!!</li>
            <li> Best cleaner made for your tounge BUT starts to fall apart after a few months and you must buy more.</li>
            <li> and we love the ease of use and its clean effect.</li>
            <li> These work great and the scrapper is not sharp on the taste buds at all.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels very fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> The product works great, it cleans very well and are pretty colors.  </li>
            <li> Delivered quickly!</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and items were in a sealed package!</li>
            <li> I was very thankful to find these on Amazon and to get three is even better as I probably won&#x27;t need to ever buy another one again!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even fit these in my mouth.</li>
            <li> They work great to get all the way to the back of your tongue</li>
            <li> Great material, will last for ever.</li>
            <li> great for the extra effort in mouth health</li>
            <li> Cheap.</li>
            <li> All the ones in the store are cheap and bend.  </li>
            <li> for people with giant mouths lol</li>
            <li> They will eventually break near the crossbar after about two years, but provide good scraping in the meantime.</li>
            <li> But so far so good.  </li>
            <li> The scraper fits our tongues like a glove and really does a great job scraping the whole width of our tongues in each pass.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are better then the first ones I started using over 3 years ago ( firm/Rigid ).</li>
            <li> worth the money!</li>
            <li> Fresh Breath!</li>
            <li> I have to use these tongue scrapers or my tongue does not feel clean.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush just don&#x27;t get it as clean in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I like the way these clean the tongue.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t feel clean unless I scraped every day.</li>
            <li> Work well keeping my tongue clean thank you</li>
            <li> I had a plastic one then tried out the metal one that was flimsy and did clean as well.</li>
            <li> My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel clean without them,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> how clean your mouth feels after use.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it to anyone who likes a super fresh clean mouth!</li>
            <li> I love this product so much.</li>
            <li> Love it, fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> They last for a good time.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> After a good bit of use, the handle finally broke, and Wal-Mart had stopped carrying them in the stores.  </li>
            <li> only good tongue scraper I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> It really works and I&#x27;m glad I ordered a set.</li>
            <li> This three-pack is such a good deal.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down, the absolute best tongue scraper on the market.  </li>
            <li> They scrape away the bacteria and clean your tongue leaving your breath fresh and your mouth clean.  </li>
            <li> Helps clean the tongue to maintain fresh breath.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like my mouth is clean and fresh if I haven&#x27;t used my tongue cleaner.</li>
            <li> it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> They answered my question with lightning speed and my order got here just as quickly, I even was allowed to choose the colors I wanted..</li>
            <li> You will definitely get a clean tongue after using this amazing product.</li>
            <li> I like these better than the new fangled brush-like ones.</li>
            <li> I love these tongue cleaners cant live with out them.  </li>
            <li> Also, it never loses it&#x27;s shape, and comes in many fun colors.  </li>
            <li> but if this is your first tongue scraper be prepare to have yourself gagging!</li>
            <li> no complaints, exactly as pictured/described!  </li>
            <li> Exactly as describe, came right on time!</li>
            <li> Well worth it, and breath smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of anything i dislike about this product, and it comes in fun colors.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels cleaner and my breath feels fresh for longer periods now every day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually quite surprising how much scrapes off.  </li>
            <li> There are several different types of tongue cleaners out there, but these are my absolute favorite!!!  </li>
            <li> to clean under hot water, and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It also does a better scraping job than most other ones.  </li>
            <li> so I had to buy another one right away.</li>
            <li> Everyone should have one of these right alongside their toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My husband is a tongue cleaner and these are right up his alley -  one for every bathroom and to travel with.</li>
            <li> They have the right combination of size, stiffness and the right edge to scrape the tongue.  </li>
            <li> I could not remember the maker, but an amazon search popped it right up, and I got them in 2 days.</li>
            <li> This gets your tongue clean and your whole mouth will thank you because of this.</li>
            <li> Until you use one you will not imagine how much they clean your tongue.  </li>
            <li> Best tongue scraper around - wide enough for your whole tongue.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone who wants a clean tongue!</li>
            <li> It does a great job of cleaning and is sturdy enough to hold up to multiple uses a day.</li>
            <li> YOU VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li> They work great without hardly any of a gag effect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought so many different kinds.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> how much I used it!</li>
            <li> As some reviewers have noted, this tongue cleaner is a larger size than most.</li>
            <li> This tongue cleaner works well, gets to the back of the tongue where most of the nasties hide.</li>
            <li> but this one is big and gets more of my tongue.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the first one</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> They are plastic, so they will eventually break after long-time use, but I still think they do a ten times better job than rubber-type tongue cleaners.</li>
            <li> I first found this product about 5 years ago, at a retail store, and used it for about 1&amp;1/2 -2yrs</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this</li>
            <li> Love this product and only can get on line</li>
            <li> and I recall they cleaned much better back then.</li>
            <li> Glad to finally find it online.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t convinced about buying a tongue cleaner, go to Wikipedia or any reputably sourced info webpage to see the benefits of cleaning your tongue properly, you will be astonished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First time using a tongue cleaner and it met my expectations.</li>
            <li> You can clean more of your tongue because it does not give you the &amp;#34;gagging&amp;#34; effect that you get from other tongue cleaners.  </li>
            <li> The length of the cleaner is just right as well, I have no problem reaching far back on my tongue without needing to put my hand inside my own</li>
            <li> When I went to get a new one, the only kind the retail stores carry now don&#x27;t work well at all.  </li>
            <li> so I would have liked to pick my colors, but other than that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s larger size (compared to most Tongue cleaners) makes it very efficient.</li>
            <li> Good and sharp!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super flexible like some others as to where it won&#x27;t be able to really scrape your tongue clean.</li>
            <li> and I do 2 scrapes, certainly not as wide as my mouth, and I&#x27;m pretty sure a toddler would have no trouble putting this in his mouth.</li>
            <li> Simple, easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is the only one I will use as it is strong and does not bend and cleans remarkabley well.</li>
            <li> have seen a few posts about &amp;#34;life changing&amp;#34; results, with better health and no bad morning breath.</li>
            <li> Quite large.....</li>
            <li> They have a large head for cleaning the whole tongue in one swipe.</li>
            <li> a side note : If you smoke ( I don&#x27;t ) you REALLY NEED to get some of these.</li>
            <li> My whole mouth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li> Durable and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s really what you&#x27;re doing haha)</li>
            <li> when trying to scrape so it takes two strokes to cover the whole tongue.</li>
            <li> Works really well</li>
            <li> Amazingly fast for &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; shipping.</li>
            <li> Seem to work very well.</li>
            <li> and I taped it together to keep using it, Fast shipping and nice seller, will definitely come back</li>
            <li> These work really well.  </li>
            <li> It really helps get all the gunk.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> I got these at reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Very well made and</li>
            <li> In addition, its edges are smooth and do not scratch the tongue as some of the lesser quality ones out there.  </li>
            <li> I cannot stress how much a tongue scraper is needed in out society.</li>
            <li> This product really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> These are sturdy and hold up when applying pressure needed to really scrape the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> I appreciate the fast delivery.</li>
            <li> REALLY well.  </li>
            <li> Even our young Children use these!!!</li>
            <li> My original tongue scraper handle broke on me, but I used that son of gun until the actual scraper itself broke!!</li>
            <li> These work better than any of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Works way better than any other one I have tried.</li>
            <li> I bought this product originally years ago and then lost it, I could not find the same brand</li>
            <li> It is shaped correctly that it is easy to get to the back of the tongue and large enough to cover the whole tongue.  </li>
            <li> It is hard plastic and has kept a nice edge that really scrapes that stuff off.  </li>
            <li> Again, one lasted me half a decade :)</li>
            <li> They do eventually crack and break - typical life is 2 or 3 years of use, which seems OK.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m particular about colors</li>
            <li> At first these tounge cleaners did exactly what they were suppose to do and seemed as if they would last a while.</li>
            <li> Was very surprised at how much &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; I got off my tongue.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other tongue scrapers and hands down, these are by far the best.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this value pack to anyone looking to take care of their tongues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a high school teacher.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a very important part of my everyday hygiene.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Most of the other ones I tried did not work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> : the head is a bit too large to reach the area near the throat</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this little piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if you really only wanted just a single cleaner there might be a more cost efficient product on Amazon with a similar if not the same design, however, with this deal, you would at least be able to have 2 backup cleaners which is always nice.</li>
            <li> If you are an adult, and have been brushing your teeth for your whole life, but want to do a little bit more, this might help a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So glad this type of tongue cleaner is available on Amazon as it&#x27;s hard to find them at the local drug store.</li>
            <li> I am really looking for an old fashion tongue scraper.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re extremely wide and the circumference is huge.</li>
            <li> Great no excellent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wider and more firm than the ones sold in stores.</li>
            <li> so they are well worth their low price.</li>
            <li> They still work well enough that it&#x27;s worth it to me to buy a new one every year or two.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it, my mouth feels so refreshed knowing</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without tongue cleaners........</li>
            <li> I only found the stainless steel ones here, but the plastic ones you sell works just as well and is very durable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty simple device, but it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;they are better than what we get in walmart with small heads.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the small ones that most stores are selling these days.</li>
            <li> Only thing I use for tongue cleaner.  Not flimsy.  Very durable!</li>
            <li> First off, if you&#x27;ve never used a standalone tongue cleaner, I would definitely recommend you to pick one up regardless of which it is.  </li>
            <li> better than the other smaller ones out there.</li>
            <li> This is almost certainly deliberate on the part of the design engineers; if the handle were stronger, the scraper would last forever and there would be no need to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Just wide enough and &#x27;clean&#x27; very well.</li>
            <li> I have used one or two other ones in the past, but once I found this one I loved it.</li>
            <li> I always liked this style of tongue scraper but suddenly got hard to find.</li>
            <li> The plastic seems stronger than my old Pureline Tongue Cleaner, too, so I expect these will last me much longer.  </li>
            <li> My 2 old tongue scrapers broke, ( should have glued them )and</li>
            <li> I bought enough for the whole family.</li>
            <li> My tongue naturally V-shapes</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m around adults and young people all day.</li>
            <li> so far... I will recommend this item to my friends.</li>
            <li> Works as promised and makes me realize how gross the mouth really is.</li>
            <li> Old one broke and no one seems to carry these in the stores.  </li>
            <li> think I&#x27;ve tried every model available but since discovering this one a few years ago</li>
            <li> and I was informed of the shipping status directly by them.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough to find out how much I really llike it.  </li>
            <li> This cleans the tongue completely.</li>
            <li> There are no special features really to talk about as it is really a very efficient and simple design which does exactly what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> Firstly, it is flexible, so it does not clean very well.  </li>
            <li> Since the scrapers are wide compared to some other tongue cleaners, it doesn&#x27;t really make you gag even if you reach a bit far back, however, you may still gag from time to time, that is only natural for most people.  </li>
            <li> Run over the tongue a few time until it rinses clean.</li>
            <li> My husband will only use this brand of tongue cleaner for the past 5 or more years and they stopped selling them in the pharmacy&#x27;s  here</li>
            <li> Pros: definitely decisive cleaning, for the main part of the tongue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I would give them 5 stars except for the fact that the handle has been cleverly designed to break after about 3-4 months of daily usage.</li>
            <li> This one is a nice big loop, and it makes me gag far less than other ones I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> last a long time, and I clean it regularly in the dishwasher -</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> Go easy your first few times or your tongue can get raw and bleed.</li>
            <li> and we gave the other two away to friends who were interested in trying them out).  </li>
            <li> Still, the other tongue scrapers I&#x27;ve tried have been so woefully ineffective in comparison to this brand that I&#x27;m willing to order three or four of these every year.</li>
            <li> I think these are the best Tongue Cleaners on the market, however, I was disappointed that the seller sent three red ones instead of three different colors.</li>
            <li> The edge that you scrape against your tongue is not sharp or covered in ridges both of which we appreciate.</li>
            <li> Good oral care is important so that you can help to cut down on bad breath.  </li>
            <li> These are the only scrapers firm enough to actually scrape your tongue, others are flimsy and just glide along the top removing nothing.  </li>
            <li> We like how it is wide and covers a large amount of your tongue at one time.</li>
            <li> a little while to get used to, but definitely worth it</li>
            <li> great product would recommend - been using for 10+ years and gets rid of lots of bacteria and bad breath.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting and really scrape off the bacteria.</li>
            <li> They are made very well and last a long time</li>
            <li> Been using the same product, but I was not having too much luck trying to find same one locally.</li>
            <li> This one is much better than the other tongue scrapers I&#x27;ve used with the narrow heads and thin plastic that snaps or bends easily.</li>
            <li> It is a wounder full piece of tool for proper hygiene but is a little to big for kids under 12 years of age</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many tongue scrapers, and most are either too small or inconvenient.</li>
            <li> This is hard plastic that allows you to scrape the tongue clean.  </li>
            <li> If you continue to use old one you could possibly choke on tiny plastic shards falling off.</li>
            <li> I first purchased one of these at Wal-Mart a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few passes to get most of it though, and it can leave your tongue feeling a bit raw.</li>
            <li> Usually the handle is to long and flexes to much and the blade on most other scrapers is to narrow.</li>
            <li> Very solid, you&#x27;d really have to mess with these things to break them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My colours were rather dull, but its only colour, right?</li>
            <li> If you want to add a little extra oral hygiene into your nightly routine, it is a decent purchase.</li>
            <li> you may find it a bit large if you have a small mouth.</li>
            <li> These are hard plastic - exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Even after brushing my 7 year old&#x27;s teeth regularly, I wasn&#x27;t able to figure out the cause of bad breath.</li>
            <li> These are sturdy and will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Really does the trick, but are a little wide</li>
            <li> It was not the quality I expected based on an individual one with the same brand name that I had bought at a store</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different tongue scrapers and by far</li>
            <li> Ignore reviewers complaining about the size, these are a little less wide than my tongue, making them just about right</li>
            <li> These are just too dull and run over all the gunk without really getting it off.  </li>
            <li> I was a long time smoker (not anymore) and coffee drinker.</li>
            <li> The colors I received were pink, purple, and blue.</li>
            <li> Expected different colors</li>
            <li> so long</li>
            <li> thing was a lot bigger than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Been searching for these for a long time, had one that broke eyars ago</li>
            <li> I disinfect mine so it lasts a long time anyway.  </li>
            <li> I find the edge of it sharp enough to get that tongue grunge off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other tongue scrapers , PURLINE is the only one to work</li>
            <li> (The lady working the counter told me the other option was to refuse it, and they would send it back to the company to get the remaining shipping cost.)</li>
            <li> but I have found nearly all of them to be quite ineffective as they don&#x27;t scrape hard enough.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery, but the tongue scrapper is not good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an average size male.</li>
            <li> no particular condition or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tip is slightly angled which makes it easier to get in the back.</li>
            <li> i usually get 6months to a year&#x27;s worth of use as long as i don&#x27;t press down too hard.</li>
            <li> Toothbrushes and other small or soft tongue cleaners do nothing.</li>
            <li> EVERYONE needs to scrape their tongue prior to brushing their teeth (at least twice daily), &amp; brush their tongues as well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;delivery was longer than expected.</li>
            <li> The scraper is a bit wide for one&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li> so ladies be careful.</li>
            <li> I ended up with a green one which I do not like at all, but it still functions the same.  </li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> a bit wide a bit rough</li>
            <li> The blade is wider and handle is stiff so you can apply pressure to scrape all the gunk off the back of the tongue.</li>
            <li> They were just too sharp or something.</li>
            <li> So none of the other cleaners I tried (whether they made my tongue bleed or not) worked like these do.</li>
            <li> Only a few seconds for tongue cleaning now!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the other plastic tongue cleaners they sell at Walmart.  </li>
            <li> Bought this about 2 months ago to replace the other tongue cleaner.</li>
            <li> The other brands of tongue cleaners sold in stores cannot even begin to compare to these.</li>
            <li> Using the actual brush side is pointless as well.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t settle for any other brand.</li>
            <li> Other tongue scrapers we have used were sharper and some with ridges which tore up our tongues not exactly what we were hoping for.</li>
            <li> Simple, hard plastic tongue scraper that does the job.</li>
            <li> This product is below average.</li>
            <li> Tongue cleaners should be standard in households but they are not, at least from what I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> and so I bought a different brand, but never really liked it.</li>
            <li> I get tonsil stones, and using these tongue scrapers a couple times a day cuts their occurrence down to just maybe one or two a year.</li>
            <li> other cleaners made my tongue bleed!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy any other brand!</li>
            <li> The plastic is actually sharp and thin enough to scrape your tongue compared to other tongue scrapers you find at the store.</li>
            <li> My previous one has lasted for 3 or so years now, but I needed one for the dorms as well.</li>
            <li> A loop half this size would be optimal.</li>
            <li> Less gagging effect.</li>
            <li> Also, loops plastic edge is not that sharp thus provides mediocre scrapping action of tongue.</li>
            <li> The ones offered in my city are flimsy, and when it comes to oral health, you want your breath fresh, not strong enough to reach over and knock the crap outta a person six feet away</li>
            <li> They are too wide for the average tongue, which makes them hard to use.</li>
            <li> In a few weeks of using this device, as odd as it seems, I would agree.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite style of tongue scrapers, the others just don&#x27;t seem to do justice compared to these bad boys!</li>
            <li> They came in the little care packet from the orthodontist</li>
            <li> I have used it a few days and it seems to help a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Items are stronger than others sold elsewhere and are flexible, yet firm.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be the white tongued, plaque ridden, gross guy with the bad</li>
            <li> The ones I&#x27;ve found in stores lately are flexible and do not clean anything off your tongue.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately that also means they don&#x27;t last forever, as they eventually crack and break.</li>
            <li> This is a product that I have purchased in the past and have recommended this to friends of mine.</li>
            <li> One thing I was not pleased about was that I could not chose the colours.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these tongue scrapers for the past 5 or so years.  </li>
            <li> He has been using a broken one for 6 months and refuses to use any other brand out there.</li>
            <li> cleaner handle started pealing off leaving behind sharp edges on the handle which can poke if your not carefull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine had broken in half.</li>
            <li> Bad breath is a serious issue and if people could invest a few bucks, we might be able to save the ozone from bad breath.</li>
            <li> The plastic is rigid but not too hard that it hurts to use it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if all the tongue scrapers of today are extremely dull for safety reasons or</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a hard core tongue cleaner that gets all the germs off; then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I used it until it broke ( and that was at least 4-5 years).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not effective with scraping residue from your tongue.</li>
            <li> I use it at least 2 x day, would not be without it.</li>
            <li> I no longer wake up with that icky morning mouth feeling..</li>
            <li> How do you say something negative about a device that scrapes crud off your tongue...  </li>
            <li> Its just common sense to do so.</li>
            <li> if you know what I mean..</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> &quot; Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It has been impossible to find a comparable, or inferior, like product in the local stores.</li>
            <li> I obtained this information from a Dentist who is a Halitosis (Medical term for Bad Breath) Specialist.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used is a few times and am sad to say it makes me gag.</li>
            <li> Not Good at all.</li>
            <li> If you have a small mouth, which I do, these are difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> this was we looked at all the usual stores and were unable to find it.</li>
            <li> Other tongue cleaners are either too flimsy or are painful to use.</li>
            <li> Having bad breath is not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Yeah, weird, I know,</li>
            <li> You also get random colors.</li>
            <li> With three in a pack, you can&#x27;t go wrong at this price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazy about oral hygeine and use mine at every brush.  </li>
            <li> but it is frustrating!!  </li>
            <li> No more bad taste or/and bad breath!!</li>
            <li> too bad Walmart doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore</li>
            <li> Use it after each brushing or rinsing to help get rid of bad breath.</li>
            <li> Bacteria forms under this plaque layer, thus causing bad (sometimes toxic) breath.  </li>
            <li> If breath is really bad, rinse mouth w/ hydrogen peroxide (H202) after each brushing as well.  </li>
            <li> Bad choice</li>
            <li> No complaints about bad breath.  </li>
            <li> I have got some really bad scrapers over the years.  </li>
            <li> I hate the flimsy ones.</li>
            <li> I have used Dentek and HATE their design.  </li>
            <li> they also seem to be helping to prevent tonsil stones and bad breath (horrible things).</li>
            <li> BOOOOO for bad service!</li>
            <li> Nothing gets rid of bad breath like it!!!</li>
            <li> It is the #1 cause of bad breath!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is manufacture in USA.  You can&#x27;t find that many products are made in USA.&lt;br /&gt;It is durable and do the job.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great. Exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> Well... too big for my mouth.</li>
            <li> no complains, works better than tooth brush&lt;br /&gt;takes a little while to get used to, but definitely worth it&lt;br /&gt;delivery was longer than expected.</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many tongue scrapers, and most are either too small or inconvenient. This one is a nice big loop, and it makes me gag far less than other ones I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean under hot water, and very reasonably priced. Well worth it, and breath smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this tongue scraper.</li>
            <li> My 2 old tongue scrapers broke, ( should have glued them )and I could not find a ridged one at ANY of the brick and mortar stores in the Central Valley.&lt;br /&gt;These are better then the first ones I started using over 3 years ago ( firm/Rigid ). Very solid, you&#x27;d really have to mess with these things to break them.&lt;br /&gt;The soft/bendable ones just do not do the job properly. These things will take ALL of the \\&quot; STINKY GELATINOUS GOO \\&quot; off of your tongue, and that&#x27;s what you want.&lt;br /&gt;On a side note : If you smoke ( I don&#x27;t ) you REALLY NEED to get some of these. It will improve your overall mouth health. Then again, you could just stop smoking.&lt;br /&gt;I gave 5 stars because I couldn&#x27;t give six.</li>
            <li> Use this item every day, even my grandaughter (7) likes to use it to keep her tongue clean after brushing!</li>
            <li> Works so well.  I bought enough for the whole family.</li>
            <li> strong , durable all good here.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much. My whole mouth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li> This our the best tongue cleaners you&#x27;ll ever own. I&#x27;ve bought so many different kinds. You will definitely get a clean tongue after using this amazing product.</li>
            <li> The ones offered in my city are flimsy, and when it comes to oral health, you want your breath fresh, not strong enough to reach over and knock the crap outta a person six feet away lol!</li>
            <li> Very good...at scraping my tongue.</li>
            <li> The local stores  don&#x27;t carry the tongue scraper. Mine had broken in half. I&#x27;ve bought different styles &amp; i wouldn&#x27;t get the same results.</li>
            <li> Love the tongue cleaner! Durable and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Love it, fast shipping too. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is the only one I will use as it is strong and does not bend and cleans remarkabley well.</li>
            <li> Very nice and work great. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great item...too bad Walmart doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore</li>
            <li> My original tongue scraper handle broke on me, but I used that son of gun until the actual scraper itself broke!! That&#x27;s how good it is &amp; how much I used it! I&#x27;ve looked EVERYWHERE in my city and beyond for this specific scraper &amp; thank God I found it here! Nothing gets rid of bad breath like it!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best tongue scraper out there. Use it after each brushing or rinsing to help get rid of bad breath.</li>
            <li> I have to use these tongue scrapers or my tongue does not feel clean. They last for a good time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many tongue cleaners (metal, plastic, with bristles), but Pureline tongue cleaner works the best!</li>
            <li> I am really looking for an old fashion tongue scraper.  This wasn&#x27;t it.  I&#x27;ve used is a few times and am sad to say it makes me gag.</li>
            <li> I use this product for tongue cleaning. no particular condition or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily after brushing. I have used one or two other ones in the past, but once I found this one I loved it. I used it until it broke ( and that was at least 4-5 years).  I can&#x27;t think of anything i dislike about this product, and it comes in fun colors. I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore so I had to find it on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is great. Again, one lasted me half a decade :)</li>
            <li> Exactly as describe, came right on time! Very pleased</li>
            <li> Have tried all types of tongue scrapers and this is simply the best!  Buy the three pack, like everything else, they wear out and eventually break. Always good to have a spare.</li>
            <li> So I have been &#x27;scraping&#x27; my tongue for years. I was a long time smoker (not anymore) and coffee drinker. So yeah, cleaning my tongue was a must. I can&#x27;t imagine not having or using a tongue cleaner now. Once I discovered them years ago, I never looked back. The toothbrush just don&#x27;t get it as clean in my opinion. I scrape (yeah sounds gross but that&#x27;s really what you&#x27;re doing haha) my tongue before I brush my teeth. Then brush my teeth and tongue. My mouth feels very fresh and clean! I ended up breaking my tongue cleaner so I had to buy another one right away. But I couldn&#x27;t find this brand/type anywhere in the local stores anymore. So I just bought what I could get. Let me tell you..other cleaners made my tongue bleed! I&#x27;m not even joking. If I applied ANY pressure, they would make my tongue bleed. They were just too sharp or something. I would apply quite a bit of pressure with \\&quot;The Tongue Cleaner\\&quot; and that would NEVER happen. So none of the other cleaners I tried (whether they made my tongue bleed or not) worked like these do. So I decided I had to find a replacement. I started looking online and found it! I immediately ordered a 3 pack because my wife likes the same brand. They are the best out there in my opinion. Just wide enough and &#x27;clean&#x27; very well.</li>
            <li> I have used these for years and have not found anything I like as well. They work better than others because they are made of rigid, non-pliable plastic. Unfortunately that also means they don&#x27;t last forever, as they eventually crack and break. They still work well enough that it&#x27;s worth it to me to buy a new one every year or two.</li>
            <li> I am clean now!  Woohooooo!  It rocked my world.  Go easy your first few times or your tongue can get raw and bleed.</li>
            <li> A toothbrush works much better.</li>
            <li> These are the best tongue scrapers out there. I couldn&#x27;t find them in stores anymore. The plastic is actually sharp and thin enough to scrape your tongue compared to other tongue scrapers you find at the store. The colors I received were pink, purple, and blue.</li>
            <li> It seems to work. I have never used these before. My tongue naturally V-shapes when trying to scrape so it takes two strokes to cover the whole tongue. I will say that it does do what it is intended for. It visibly removes plaque build up on the tongue. It takes a few passes to get most of it though, and it can leave your tongue feeling a bit raw. I have used it a few days and it seems to help a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a few posts about &amp;#34;life changing&amp;#34; results, with better health and no bad morning breath. Those post are bull. If you never practiced oral hygiene before this will make a big difference. If you are an adult, and have been brushing your teeth for your whole life, but want to do a little bit more, this might help a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts. If you want to add a little extra oral hygiene into your nightly routine, it is a decent purchase. You won&#x27;t be upset with the price tage under 10$ too.</li>
            <li> great product would recommend - been using for 10+ years and gets rid of lots of bacteria and bad breath.  Everyone needs a tongue scraper for good hygiene.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve got to be kidding me. I can&#x27;t even fit these in my mouth. Seriously. I&#x27;m an average size male. 5&#x27;7\\&quot; Ridiculous. They&#x27;re extremely wide and the circumference is huge. Perfect for bulimics&#x27; I would imagine however...</li>
            <li> i usually get 6months to a year&#x27;s worth of use as long as i don&#x27;t press down too hard. you may find it a bit large if you have a small mouth.</li>
            <li> These are the only scrapers firm enough to actually scrape your tongue, others are flimsy and just glide along the top removing nothing.  Ignore reviewers complaining about the size, these are a little less wide than my tongue, making them just about right and I do 2 scrapes, certainly not as wide as my mouth, and I&#x27;m pretty sure a toddler would have no trouble putting this in his mouth.</li>
            <li> These tongue cleaners are made of sturdy plastic.  They work great to get all the way to the back of your tongue</li>
            <li> still waiting to see if these will break or crack, but working fine for now, Thanx, I&#x27;ll get some more</li>
            <li> Expected different colors</li>
            <li> These are the best tongue cleaners I have ever used. Highly recommended. One feedback to sellers: If someone is ordering a \\&quot;Set of 3\\&quot;, please realize that it is probably for their family and send different colors!</li>
            <li> As some reviewers have noted, this tongue cleaner is a larger size than most. However, it isn&#x27;t a problem for me, and it cleans wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best tongue scraper that i have ever used. Good quality and amazing performance. I love it</li>
            <li> Works really well, I prefer it to using the toothbrush on my tongue - which sometimes caused a gag reflex.</li>

            <li> Been meaning to get one of these. Does the job!</li>
            <li> Love these would recommend</li>
            <li> Simple, hard plastic tongue scraper that does the job. Very easy to use. My previous one has lasted for 3 or so years now, but I needed one for the dorms as well. Would highly recommend this value pack to anyone looking to take care of their tongues.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it, my mouth feels so refreshed knowing my tongue is fresh &amp; clean throughout my morning &amp; evenings before I sleep, yay!! love it, love it, love it!!</li>
            <li> caution... once you begin to use a quality tongue scraper you will never want to go a morning without using it.</li>
            <li> Great product! Delivered quickly!</li>
            <li> Best tongue scraper.  I will reorder again.</li>
            <li> This product is below average. It&#x27;s not effective with scraping residue from your tongue. The scraper is a bit wide for one&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li> good product but, they send me all same color....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a tongue scraper for years now, and consider it an essential part of oral hygiene.  It&#x27;s a pretty simple device, but it gets the job done.  I recommend everyone make tongue scraping a part of their oral cleanliness regimen, and this is an excellent product.  Don&#x27;t be the white tongued, plaque ridden, gross guy with the bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I know this is a product review and not a seller review, but nevertheless;  This order was made on the 8th of May, and I had the scrapers in hand on the 10th.  Amazingly fast for &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; shipping.</li>
            <li> Excellent! I definitely feel this product does a great job getting food buildup off the tongue and helps you to have much better breath! Just wish these were still for sale in the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I started using these and it is a habit now, my mouth just feels gross when I don&#x27;t.  They work great without hardly any of a gag effect they also seem to be helping to prevent tonsil stones and bad breath (horrible things).</li>
            <li> So glad this type of tongue cleaner is available on Amazon as it&#x27;s hard to find them at the local drug store. Product is sturdy and has a good size handle.</li>
            <li> I like the way these clean the tongue.  You can clean more of your tongue because it does not give you the &amp;#34;gagging&amp;#34; effect that you get from other tongue cleaners.  Helps clean the tongue to maintain fresh breath.</li>
            <li> Effective scraping..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do a good job.  They will eventually break near the crossbar after about two years, but provide good scraping in the meantime.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST TONGUE SCRAPER EVER!!  Everyone should have one of these right alongside their toothbrush.  I used to work in Dental, and plaque accumulates on EVERYONE&#x27;S tongues (yes, even Children!)  Bacteria forms under this plaque layer, thus causing bad (sometimes toxic) breath.  It is the #1 cause of bad breath!!!  EVERYONE needs to scrape their tongue prior to brushing their teeth (at least twice daily), &amp; brush their tongues as well.  If breath is really bad, rinse mouth w/ hydrogen peroxide (H202) after each brushing as well.  I obtained this information from a Dentist who is a Halitosis (Medical term for Bad Breath) Specialist.  This is hands down, the absolute best tongue scraper on the market.  Even our young Children use these!!!</li>
            <li> The best tongue scraper made!</li>
            <li> Buy this brand because it is sturdy and so much better than the ones you find in stores. I&#x27;ve had one for years &amp; still in perfect condition. Bought these for daughters &amp; they were the just a great addition to their Christmas stockings.</li>
            <li> They work great i was told that i should scrap my Tongue after  each meal..</li>
            <li> Toothbrushes and other small or soft tongue cleaners do nothing. This tongue cleaner works well, gets to the back of the tongue where most of the nasties hide. I use it at least 2 x day, would not be without it.</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite tongue scraper, been using them for years, but the plastic does break after a while.  Glad is was a set of three. It&#x27;s wider and more firm than the ones sold in stores.</li>
            <li> Not Good at all. Please do not buy these</li>
            <li> Good and sharp!!!  Really does the trick, but are a little wide so ladies be careful.</li>
            <li> These have been unavailable in stores around me for a while, I never thought to look on Amazon for them. These are my favorite style of tongue scrapers, the others just don&#x27;t seem to do justice compared to these bad boys!</li>
            <li> I have had one of these for a number of years and it finally broke.  When I went to get a new one, the only kind the retail stores carry now don&#x27;t work well at all.  I was very thankful to find these on Amazon and to get three is even better as I probably won&#x27;t need to ever buy another one again!  These work so well and last so long I think I&#x27;m set.</li>
            <li> I bought one from walmart years ago and it broke after a couple of years. I could never find them again. Until I found them on amazon... Best tongue cleaner ever!!!</li>
            <li> Only a few seconds for tongue cleaning now!</li>
            <li> These are my favorite scrapers.  Yeah, weird, I know, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> Was very surprised at how much &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; I got off my tongue. Glad I got these. Seem to work very well.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this tongue scraper a try after suffering from occasional tonsil stone. I immediately felt a difference. I no longer wake up with that icky morning mouth feeling..if you know what I mean.. Also the tonsil stones have ceased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing was a lot bigger than I had expected. I&#x27;ve got a pretty small mouth, but I make do. You also get random colors. I got two greens and a blue. I&#x27;m particular about colors so I would have liked to pick my colors, but other than that these work great and for the price, are worth trying!</li>
            <li> These things are amazing.  I&#x27;m crazy about oral hygeine and use mine at every brush.  It works! They stopped carrying them at my local health food store so I&#x27;m glad to have found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like this one better than the OraSweet. This is a product that I have purchased in the past and have recommended this to friends of mine. Excellent Poriduct.</li>
            <li> It was not the quality I expected based on an individual one with the same brand name that I had bought at a store</li>
            <li> on time delivery product was as listed.</li>
            <li> My husband will only use this brand of tongue cleaner for the past 5 or more years and they stopped selling them in the pharmacy&#x27;s  here so I searched online and found them at a great price here on Amazon. He has been using a broken one for 6 months and refuses to use any other brand out there. They have a large head for cleaning the whole tongue in one swipe. A good product for oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> I first purchased one of these at Wal-Mart a few years ago.  It worked beautifully.  After a good bit of use, the handle finally broke, and Wal-Mart had stopped carrying them in the stores.  I ordered a GUM brand tongue cleaner through Wal-Mart&#x27;s site to store for pick-up.  I did not like the GUM brand at all.  Firstly, it is flexible, so it does not clean very well.  Secondly, it has a much smaller head, and I was constantly gagging myself with it.  So, I ended up ordering a three pack of the Pureline Tongue Cleaner.  The Pureline still cleans the best as the head it wide and it does not flex, so scraping is much more effective.  The plastic seems stronger than my old Pureline Tongue Cleaner, too, so I expect these will last me much longer.  One thing I was not pleased about was that I could not chose the colours.  I ended up with a green one which I do not like at all, but it still functions the same.  It would be nice to be able to choose the colours one is to receive.  After all, if I were purchasing these in a store, I would choose the colours I like best.</li>
            <li> It is a wounder full piece of tool for proper hygiene but is a little to big for kids under 12 years of age</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years.  This brand is the best.  I&#x27;ve had smaller ones but this one is big and gets more of my tongue.  Don&#x27;t feel I have a clean mouth in the morning unless I scrap my tongue!</li>
            <li> Been searching for these for a long time, had one that broke eyars ago and I taped it together to keep using it, Fast shipping and nice seller, will definitely come back</li>
            <li> Items received in a timely manner and as described. Items are stronger than others sold elsewhere and are flexible, yet firm.</li>
            <li> These work really well.  I wouldn&#x27;t feel clean unless I scraped every day.</li>
            <li> Ok, prefer using brush</li>
            <li> Great size and item for teenagers to use.  Got it for my kid.  Excellent beginner hygiene item.</li>
            <li> these are the best tongue cleaners out there!</li>
            <li> One of the best tongue cleaners on the market. They used to sell these at Walmart here in Canada but no longer do, I buy mine online and ship to my US office when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They last a long time, and I clean it regularly in the dishwasher - I find the edge of it sharp enough to get that tongue grunge off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many kinds - this one is among the best.</li>
            <li> I use a tongue cleaner daily. I like these better than the new fangled brush-like ones.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, best tongue cleaner on the market.  I don&#x27;t like the other plastic tongue cleaners they sell at Walmart.  It&#x27;s just too flimsy.  This is hard plastic that allows you to scrape the tongue clean.  I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> These are great.  Easy to use and do a good job.  Substantial not flimsy.</li>
            <li> My Son loves to use it and it safe for children</li>
            <li> Work well keeping my tongue clean thank you I&#x27;ve tried other tongue scrapers , PURLINE is the only one to work well Thank you.</li>
            <li> I had a plastic one then tried out the metal one that was flimsy and did clean as well.If your crossing my review dont buy the metal kinds buy these ones*</li>
            <li> love them and recommend them to everyone! Please use this your breath Will smell better</li>
            <li> Great tongue scarper. Cheap and does the job perfectly!</li>
            <li> These tongue cleaners are the best. Long lasting and really scrape off the bacteria. Other tongue cleaners are either too flimsy or are painful to use.</li>
            <li> Strong material great for my breath.</li>
            <li> The worlds greatest ðŸ˜„ I&#x27;ve tried others ðŸ‘Ž</li>
            <li> These work better than any of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> The design is perfect. It really helps get all the gunk. I only wish I could have selected my colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a high school teacher. So I&#x27;m around adults and young people all day. Having bad breath is not very pleasant. Good oral care is important so that you can help to cut down on bad breath.  I&#x27;ve tried several different tongue scrapers for my oral care. Usually the handle is to long and flexes to much and the blade on most other scrapers is to narrow. I&#x27;ve used the Pureline scraper for several years now. The blade is wider and handle is stiff so you can apply pressure to scrape all the gunk off the back of the tongue. This scraper is the only one I will spend my money on...Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different tongue scrapers and by far but I like these the best. It&#x27;s not super flexible like some others as to where it won&#x27;t be able to really scrape your tongue clean. Can no longer find in store so I always order from Amazon</li>
            <li> using this cleaner has become part of my teeth brushing and flossing routine.  The plastic is rigid but not too hard that it hurts to use it.  My mouth feels cleaner and my breath feels fresh for longer periods now every day.  I read that using a tongue cleaner is one of the best things you can do for your overall health.  In a few weeks of using this device, as odd as it seems, I would agree.</li>
            <li> Love this product! This tongue scraper is so much better than the ones you buy at the drugstore.  I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> What can I say.  It is what it is.</li>
            <li> I always liked this style of tongue scraper but suddenly got hard to find. I got these at reasonable price. I&#x27;m still on the first one so obviously they hold up. Money well spent.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these in the store anywhere!  It was exactly what I was looking for.  Good quality and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Quite large.....and I have a big mouth....so I&#x27;m told. A loop half this size would be optimal. Also, loops plastic edge is not that sharp thus provides mediocre scrapping action of tongue.</li>
            <li> I am a dentist, and i like them for tongue cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;they are better than what we get in walmart with small heads.</li>
            <li> There are several different types of tongue cleaners out there, but these are my absolute favorite!!!  They are plastic, so they will eventually break after long-time use, but I still think they do a ten times better job than rubber-type tongue cleaners.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s larger size (compared to most Tongue cleaners) makes it very efficient.It also does a better scraping job than most other ones.  Also, it never loses it&#x27;s shape, and comes in many fun colors.  I first found this product about 5 years ago, at a retail store, and used it for about 1&amp;1/2 -2yrs before it disappeared off shelves. I loved it so much that I gave one to each of my 3 sons! I am thrilled to have found it again!  Most of the other ones I tried did not work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> Very well made and these are the larger tongue scrapers. I don&#x27;t care for the small ones that most stores are selling these days. I looked everywhere for these and finally found them on Amazon. With three in a pack, you can&#x27;t go wrong at this price.</li>
            <li> a bit wide a bit rough</li>
            <li> Best cleaner made for your tounge BUT starts to fall apart after a few months and you must buy more. If you continue to use old one you could possibly choke on tiny plastic shards falling off.</li>
            <li> Even after brushing my 7 year old&#x27;s teeth regularly, I wasn&#x27;t able to figure out the cause of bad breath. These tongue scrapers&lt;br /&gt;solved my issue . We all started using these and we love the ease of use and its clean effect.</li>
            <li> Great Product all that was promised, delivered early before date quoted,</li>
            <li> Very solid construction.. Tip is slightly angled which makes it easier to get in the back.</li>
            <li> This tongue cleaner is by far the best one that I have tried.  It is shaped correctly that it is easy to get to the back of the tongue and large enough to cover the whole tongue.  In addition, its edges are smooth and do not scratch the tongue as some of the lesser quality ones out there.  This is the only one I would buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these tongue scrapers for the past 5 or so years.  Great product.  I broke one once and bought a Gum brand one and it totally sucked.</li>
            <li> This was just what I was looking for in a tongue cleaner, works perfectly.  I had checked Walmart,Target, CVS, Walgreens and several grocery stores. I am very glad I found it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> Product works as advertized. I own a tooth brush that on the apposite side of the bristles has a tongue cleaner and together with the scraper I feel my mouth has never been cleaner or healthier.</li>
            <li> I cannot stress how much a tongue scraper is needed in out society. This gets your tongue clean and your whole mouth will thank you because of this. Bad breath is a serious issue and if people could invest a few bucks, we might be able to save the ozone from bad breath. Ha ha. Great no excellent.</li>
            <li> Best of its kind product</li>
            <li> Great material, will last for ever.</li>
            <li> These things are the bomb! Try them!</li>
            <li> Bought this about 2 months ago to replace the other tongue cleaner. Bad choice it&#x27;s so big it makes your gag reflexes start up Does get the job done and you do get used to it but if this is your first tongue scraper be prepare to have yourself gagging!</li>
            <li> My husband is a tongue cleaner and these are right up his alley -  one for every bathroom and to travel with.</li>
            <li> My wife has one that she&#x27;s had for years and it still works like magic.  I can&#x27;t find one like it.  It is hard plastic and has kept a nice edge that really scrapes that stuff off.  These are just too dull and run over all the gunk without really getting it off.  I don&#x27;t know if all the tongue scrapers of today are extremely dull for safety reasons or what but it is frustrating!!  I would not recommend these, but they are as good as they get now I guess.  I&#x27;ll keep hunting for a better one.</li>
            <li> I like it. This is my second times bought it. It does a good job. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> These scrapers work great for cleaning your tongue.  I cannot start my day without one.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good product, great price. Item as described. Great seller, fast shipping. Will buy from again.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other tongue scrapers and these were the best ever.  They work the best at getting stuff off your tongue.  No more bad taste or/and bad breath!!</li>
            <li> Thought we would give these a try, and no one in our household likes them. They are too wide for the average tongue, which makes them hard to use. We have gone back to brushing our tongue, and it works just as well.</li>
            <li> great for the extra effort in mouth health</li>
            <li> I bought it in June 2012 and definitely liking it. Best tongue cleaner so far... I will recommend this item to my friends.</li>
            <li> How do you say something negative about a device that scrapes crud off your tongue...  Works as promised and makes me realize how gross the mouth really is.</li>
            <li> Great Product and Seller!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this type of Tongue Cleaner in the stores for a couple years now! So glad I found it! Shipping was quick and items were in a sealed package! Very happy with purchase! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Best tongue cleaner. It does a great job of cleaning and is sturdy enough to hold up to multiple uses a day. The wide shape is especially effective. This one is much better than the other tongue scrapers I&#x27;ve used with the narrow heads and thin plastic that snaps or bends easily.</li>
            <li> Best ones out there. And I know</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this and i have to say it works great.  I only found the stainless steel ones here, but the plastic ones you sell works just as well and is very durable</li>
            <li> Love this product and only can get on line</li>
            <li> Pros: definitely decisive cleaning, for the main part of the tongue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the head is a bit too large to reach the area near the throat</li>
            <li> Awesome tool to keep your breath fresh. Better to use before eating anything in the morning to prevent nausea and gagging. Run over the tongue a few time until it rinses clean. Very comfortable  and sturdy tool. Each person should have one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it does anything.  I used tongue cleaners 10 years ago and I recall they cleaned much better back then.</li>
            <li> Old one broke and no one seems to carry these in the stores.  Glad to finally find it online. Best deal of all the ones sold.</li>
            <li> Simple, easy to use. Gets all contours of your tounge. Less gagging effect. Cheap. My colours were rather dull, but its only colour, right?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using tongue scrapers since I had braces as a kid. They came in the little care packet from the orthodontist and I&#x27;ve been hooked on them since. My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel clean without them,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ve tried every model available but since discovering this one a few years ago, I have been hooked. It&#x27;s a great shape, comfy handle and its super easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the 3 pack. I had bought them as spares for me but my boyfriend and sister ended up stealing them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and this shipper is great. My package practically teleported here and I was informed of the shipping status directly by them. Great service.</li>
            <li> Only thing I use for tongue cleaner.  Not flimsy.  Very durable!</li>
            <li> If you have a small mouth, which I do, these are difficult to use.  Work great for my husband!!</li>
            <li> This product really gets the job done.  If you&#x27;re looking for a hard core tongue cleaner that gets all the germs off; then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Item was what I have been looking for and is well made. It has been impossible to find a comparable, or inferior, like product in the local stores.</li>
            <li> Best tongue cleaner out there. I couldn&#x27;t find it stores, glad I found it on amazon. Fits the entire tongue and gets all the yuck off my tongue. I&#x27;ve bought other brands and honestly, this one is the best.</li>
            <li> These scrapers are awesome.  They used to sale them at wal-mart, but now I can&#x27;t find them anywhere.  All the ones in the store are cheap and bend.  These are sturdy and will last a long time.  Get that gunk outta your mouth!</li>
            <li> I have used these tongue scrapers for years before they stopped showing up in stores. They last forever too, if you wash them regularly. I get tonsil stones, and using these tongue scrapers a couple times a day cuts their occurrence down to just maybe one or two a year. About 3 months ago, I gave in and bought one of the crummy rubbery type scrapers you can buy at the grocery store, and I&#x27;ve had about 8 tonsil stones since. I&#x27;m never going back to those!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I rated this only with three stars is because they didn&#x27;t pay for all the shipping. In order to get it, I had to go to the post office and pay them 75 cents to get the package. (The lady working the counter told me the other option was to refuse it, and they would send it back to the company to get the remaining shipping cost.) I don&#x27;t mind having to pay the 75 cents, but getting to a post office during business hours is a bit of a pain for me. I&#x27;d rather they just charge me to begin with, so that I could just get it in my box. BOOOOO for bad service!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy any other brand!</li>
            <li> Gets the job done.  No bad breath here!</li>
            <li> Best tongue scraper around - wide enough for your whole tongue. The 3 pack was a great deal.</li>
            <li> no complaints, exactly as pictured/described!  I think they&#x27;ll hold up very nicely over time too which is really preferable. Cheers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these tongue cleaners for years. Used to buy them in store but no longer able to find them. Was so happy to find them online. This is a very important part of my everyday hygiene. They work great. They are made very well and last a long time so they are well worth their low price. You will be amazed at what comes off of your tongue with these and how clean your mouth feels after use. The other brands of tongue cleaners sold in stores cannot even begin to compare to these. The ones I&#x27;ve found in stores lately are flexible and do not clean anything off your tongue. I will always buy this brand.</li>
            <li> Love it and nothing comes close to getting the job done! Highly recommend to anyone who wants a clean tongue!</li>
            <li> These are hard plastic - exactly what I wanted. I hate the flimsy ones. These are sturdy and work great.</li>
            <li> the best tongue scraper there is! I recommend</li>
            <li> These are sturdy and hold up when applying pressure needed to really scrape the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good tongue scraper I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> At first these tounge cleaners did exactly what they were suppose to do and seemed as if they would last a while. After a month of using the tongue cleaner the plastic coating that covers the tounge cleaner handle started pealing off leaving behind sharp edges on the handle which can poke if your not carefull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This happened to all three of the tounge cleaners. They work great but they need to fix the platic on the handle area to lst longer.</li>
            <li> for people with giant mouths lol</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, but the tongue scrapper is not good.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other tongue scrapers and hands down, these are by far the best.  They have the right combination of size, stiffness and the right edge to scrape the tongue.  They do eventually crack and break - typical life is 2 or 3 years of use, which seems OK.</li>
            <li> Been using the same product, but I was not having too much luck trying to find same one locally. I finally found them here.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough to find out how much I really llike it.  But so far so good.  No complaints about bad breath.  Must be good!</li>
            <li> I have used Dentek and HATE their design.  I was so happy to find these Pureline tongue cleaners here.  These are the best tongue cleaners ever...and if you&#x27;ve never used one...you need to start!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy, nice and pro tongue brush. Simply does its job. Highly recommended. I&#x27;ll order more for my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, item was packaged nicely and I would buy it again!  Best tongue scraper ever.  Works way better than any other one I have tried.</li>
            <li> i have had other tongue cleaners and this is the best one ever.  It is very durable and does a great job.</li>
            <li> First off, if you&#x27;ve never used a standalone tongue cleaner, I would definitely recommend you to pick one up regardless of which it is.  Tongue cleaners should be standard in households but they are not, at least from what I&#x27;ve seen.  The back of your toothbrush sometimes has a tongue cleaner but I have found nearly all of them to be quite ineffective as they don&#x27;t scrape hard enough.  Using the actual brush side is pointless as well.  If you aren&#x27;t convinced about buying a tongue cleaner, go to Wikipedia or any reputably sourced info webpage to see the benefits of cleaning your tongue properly, you will be astonished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this product itself, this has to be by far the best buy on Amazon for tongue cleaners; you get 3 for a very reasonable price.  While one may think, why am I paying for 3 simple plastic molded tools, I believe that these scrapers are designed perfectly for most tongues.  Plus, your spouse/children can have their own since obviously you get the 3 (however, I can shamelessly admit that my wife and I share just one and we gave the other two away to friends who were interested in trying them out).  There are no special features really to talk about as it is really a very efficient and simple design which does exactly what it is supposed to.  The scraper fits our tongues like a glove and really does a great job scraping the whole width of our tongues in each pass.  Since the scrapers are wide compared to some other tongue cleaners, it doesn&#x27;t really make you gag even if you reach a bit far back, however, you may still gag from time to time, that is only natural for most people.  The length of the cleaner is just right as well, I have no problem reaching far back on my tongue without needing to put my hand inside my own mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a very good deal.  Perhaps if you really only wanted just a single cleaner there might be a more cost efficient product on Amazon with a similar if not the same design, however, with this deal, you would at least be able to have 2 backup cleaners which is always nice.</li>
            <li> These work great and the scrapper is not sharp on the taste buds at all.  This cleans the tongue completely.</li>
            <li> I love these tongue cleaners cant live with out them.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I love these things. I don&#x27;t feel like my mouth is clean and fresh if I haven&#x27;t used my tongue cleaner.</li>
            <li> SHIPMENT CAME FAST, GREAT QUALITY AND PRICE. VERY HAPPY OVERALL.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li> I bought this product originally years ago and then lost it, I could not find the same brand and so I bought a different brand, but never really liked it. I could not remember the maker, but an amazon search popped it right up, and I got them in 2 days. It works really well and I recommend it to anyone who likes a super fresh clean mouth!</li>
            <li> I incorporated tongue scraping as part of my dental hygiene process several years ago and I can&#x27;t imagine what my life would be without Pureline Tongue Scrapers. They very effectively get rid of any leftover plaque on my tongue and give me a really nice clean feeling.   I appreciate the fast delivery.</li>
            <li> First time using a tongue cleaner and it met my expectations. It really works and I&#x27;m glad I ordered a set.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t used to brush me teeth til I found these scapers and I don&#x27;t know, it give me motivations to work on mine hygene.  I love you Pureline, thenks for helping me fix what&#x27;s worong.</li>
            <li> These are the best tongue cleaners on the market right now. I would give them 5 stars except for the fact that the handle has been cleverly designed to break after about 3-4 months of daily usage. This is almost certainly deliberate on the part of the design engineers; if the handle were stronger, the scraper would last forever and there would be no need to buy a new one. Still, the other tongue scrapers I&#x27;ve tried have been so woefully ineffective in comparison to this brand that I&#x27;m willing to order three or four of these every year.</li>
            <li> This type of tongue scraper is my favorite (I have tried the ones on the backside of toothbrushes and ones that are plastic strips that you fold and then scrape).... It works REALLY well.  I always have brushed my tongue with my toothbrush, and still do, but using this scraper after the brushing scrapes off plenty of &#x27;ick&#x27;!  It&#x27;s actually quite surprising how much scrapes off.  I carry one of these with me on all trips, it is essential to my routine now.  This three-pack is such a good deal.  I disinfect mine so it lasts a long time anyway.  My boyfriend uses one now too (thank goodness) :)</li>
            <li> Does the job. Perfect for my family of 3. Seems like they will hold up for some time.</li>
            <li> LOVE these.  don&#x27;t settle for any other brand.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these in any store, but Amazon rocks.  I can&#x27;t live without tongue cleaners........Fresh Breath!</li>
            <li> I think these are the best Tongue Cleaners on the market, however, I was disappointed that the seller sent three red ones instead of three different colors. Its just common sense to do so.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this little piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> This is a great design for a tongue scraper. We have used many tongue scrapers over the years which is how we know this is a good design. We like how it is wide and covers a large amount of your tongue at one time. It is has a nice angle. The edge that you scrape against your tongue is not sharp or covered in ridges both of which we appreciate. Other tongue scrapers we have used were sharper and some with ridges which tore up our tongues not exactly what we were hoping for. Once we realized how much better of a design this was we looked at all the usual stores and were unable to find it. We were thankful to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love these. The best and cheapest way to clean your tongue</li>
            <li> The product works great, it cleans very well and are pretty colors.  I can not imagine,  not having these cleaners as a part of my daily oral care.  Until you use one you will not imagine how much they clean your tongue.  They scrape away the bacteria and clean your tongue leaving your breath fresh and your mouth clean.  I have used others..but I threw them all away, they didn&#x27;t work and these do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller is A++++ They answered my question with lightning speed and my order got here just as quickly, I even was allowed to choose the colors I wanted..perfect seller..will do buisness with them again soon..THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> Great product.  It works well.  I have got some really bad scrapers over the years.  This was not one if them.</li>
            <li> great product! better than the other smaller ones out there.</li>
