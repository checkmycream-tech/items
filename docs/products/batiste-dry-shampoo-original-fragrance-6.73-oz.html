            <li>I love the way it makes your hair feel and smell.</li>

            <li>This is an excellent dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>best dry shampoo out there!</li>
            <li>Great price and does not irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Light, fast-working, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>my roots are usually fine</li>
            <li>This really works and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>It smells fresh without being too perfume-y, overwhelming, or chemically.</li>
            <li>sometimes thats enough to make the top look good too, if not, i hold the can about 8-10 inches away and spray lightly and move the can around quickly</li>
            <li>but I took a chance on the original scent.</li>
            <li>dry shampoo also came in VERY handy when my mother was confined to a bed in a nursing home and washing her hair was a huge ordeal.  </li>
            <li>Makes getting ready so easy!  </li>
            <li>This is a great dry shampoo spray product.  </li>
            <li>and this works on it to make it look clean.</li>
            <li>and she is really picky with those products, she says this is the best because her hair is fresh and managable besides this dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave &amp;#34;white residues&amp;#34; like the others.</li>
            <li>My hair looks and smells clean and fresh, and I have twice the volume I had</li>
            <li>Just a quick, once-around-my-head spray.  </li>
            <li>Batiste Original Dry Shampoo is by far the ABSOLUTE best at removing oil.</li>
            <li>i can even use it on day 3 when i don&#x27;t have time for a shower first thing in the morning-your hair will look freshly washed!</li>
            <li>I actually like it better!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple dry shampoos and this one is the best!</li>
            <li>Now I can go 3 days without washing, saving the precious ends of my hair from getting stripped so frequently.</li>
            <li>This keeps my hair looking fresh for days.</li>
            <li>Keeps me from having to wash my hair all the time and has a fresh scent, like baby powder.</li>
            <li>Nice scent and there is actually a lot of product in the bottle unlike some of the high priced brands.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t simply spray it on top and go.</li>
            <li>more when my supply gets low!</li>
            <li>Hair looks great at least for 4 days.</li>
            <li>It absorbs the oil in my hair so I can run off to yoga first thing in the mornign without shampooing -</li>
            <li>It makes my hair full of volume after i use it and it feels brand new.</li>
            <li>Not only does it absorb the oil, but it gives me good volume &amp; doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch or feel gross.</li>
            <li>have to section it in order to make sure the dry shampoo gets to all the roots.</li>
            <li>this dry shampoo is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without this stuff!!</li>
            <li>my fine, short hair looks like I just washed it.</li>
            <li>I have very oily hair</li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t get it too much in one spot.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell at all</li>
            <li>Made her look and feel so much</li>
            <li>Of course it works very well to freshen greasy hair and its scent isn&#x27;t as overbearing as blush.</li>
            <li>My wife who has straight hair loves this, I purchased different kind of dry shampoos</li>
            <li>Then this trick: I use a clean, dry washcloth or hand towel (dedicated for this purpose) and gently rub the excess powder residue off my root sections, taking care to not tangle my hair too much.</li>
            <li>When i heard about dry shampoo, i immediately got really excited.</li>
            <li>The original fragrance smells lemony and is not too overpowering, as I felt the dry shampoo from Suave was.</li>
            <li>I would normally spend washing and styling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff in my life.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>Using this dry shampoo easily adds an extra day between washes.</li>
            <li>It can be a hassle to wash my long hair, and I really try to avoid washing it often, so dry shampoo is a huge time-saver (and hair-saver) for</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s great for freshening up hair when it&#x27;s not quite dirty but not quite in need of a wash yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dry shampoo sprays from Suave, Pssssst and another brand from the drugstore (can&#x27;t remember exactly which at the moment), and they tended to make my hair look clumpy and still greasy.</li>
            <li>Sprays in easily, absorbs oil very well, and brushes out well without leaving too much white residue behind.</li>
            <li>If I use a little of this on my roots on day 2 and 3 my hair looks like it was freshly washed by getting rid of any oily or greasy look.</li>
            <li>It looks normal, doesn&#x27;t turn my hair grey or flaky.</li>
            <li>The water where I live is too chlorinated/chemically to wash every day, plus it&#x27;s too time consuming to wash my long hair daily.</li>
            <li>I have a greasy scalp naturally and have tried all of the dry shampoos in the book....</li>

            <li> Usually leave it in for at least 15 minutes, the longer the better.  </li>
            <li> it gets a bit of a shine and becomes flat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hang my head upside down and spray it near my scalp all the way around my head.  </li>
            <li> I like this dry shampoo, but be warned it goes on very white.</li>
            <li> I usually only get a little oil on the roots of my hair daily, just enough to be noticeable but really not enough for a shampoo.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried several other brands, from 5 bucks to 50, can&#x27;t beat this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other dry shampoos, including Alterna, and NOTHING COMPARES TO BATISTE.</li>
            <li> I like to wait for the dry shampoo to soak into my hair for about 2 min before combing it out.</li>
            <li> I was washing my hair too often and getting a dry scalp.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t have time to wash on day 3, I use this dry shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clip the length back in a ponytail and put a thin plastic headband on to keep the front sections off my face, and apply makeup while allowing the dry shampoo time to work absorbing oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably tried every single brand of dry shampoo that exists today...</li>
            <li> Then with my head still upside down, I use the blow-dryer set on low for about one minute.  </li>
            <li> really works and does not leave my hair dull!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After my shower (use a shower cap to keep hair dry!)</li>
            <li> hair is fine-textured, dark blonde and highlighted (so any remaining white powder residue is not as obvious as it would be on someone with really dark hair), with roots that tend to be a bit oily, so I usually wash every other day.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of the greasiness, adds fluff and shine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have red hair, it&#x27;s not necessarily course, but its thick.</li>
            <li> I have long, black Asian hair, and I&#x27;ve never had trouble with rubbing in the spray and it disappearing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get powdery like other brands, doesn&#x27;t smell to sting either.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily hair.</li>
            <li> Although i dont think i would go past 3 days without finally washing it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this, and usually buy several cans at a time because I do use quite a bit in one go.hiny, not too matte.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this, and usually buy several cans at a time because I do use quite a bit in one go.</li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> There is no better dry shampoo for this price.</li>
            <li> I usually buy batiste blush dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I have to wash it everyday or it becomes extremely oily.</li>
            <li> With this product, less is more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (I have black hair</li>
            <li> it a bit time-consuming to take care to remove the excess powder and brushing it out, but all told, it&#x27;s still less time-consuming than washing and blow-drying.</li>
            <li> White and dusty, does not blend in hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it will work on dark hair.</li>
            <li> i cannot wash it everyday or it gets greasy</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money trying anything else.</li>
            <li> Waste of time &amp; $.</li>
            <li> I hated having to wash and dry just to look fresh.  </li>
            <li> product does leave a little bit of a dull &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; finish on my hair, so after I style it, I spray a little shine serum all over.  </li>
            <li> Lift up my hair, spray on just a little powder around my head, run my hands through my hair, and voila!</li>
            <li> but it does make the hair look sort of dull and powdery.</li>
            <li> Now im washing my hair 3x a week and using this stiff in between...love it!!</li>
            <li> used it the 2nd day after shampoo for a touch up and my head itched so badly that I had to wash it out.</li>
            <li> I use it multiple days in a row as well &amp; never have had bad results.</li>
            <li> It is not magic though: if your hair is downright dirty, like after a workout when you&#x27;ve sweat a lot, it&#x27;s not going to work.</li>
            <li> Then i randomly saw Batiste in the shampoo aisle of walgreens.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t bad.</li>

            <li> Works great! Doesn&#x27;t get powdery like other brands, doesn&#x27;t smell to sting either.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily hair. I have to wash it everyday or it becomes extremely oily. When i heard about dry shampoo, i immediately got really excited. I tried 5 different types and it did not work that well for me. Then i randomly saw Batiste in the shampoo aisle of walgreens. I tried it once and i was hooked! It makes my hair full of volume after i use it and it feels brand new. Although i dont think i would go past 3 days without finally washing it. I dont like the build-up. This is how i use it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to section it in order to make sure the dry shampoo gets to all the roots. You can&#x27;t simply spray it on top and go. Imagine if you were dying your roots, think of it as the same way. I like to wait for the dry shampoo to soak into my hair for about 2 min before combing it out. i feel that works best. If youre in a hurry though, do it at night before you sleep.</li>

            <li> White and dusty, does not blend in hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great dry shampoo spray product.  It makes hair look less shiny and the scent is decent.  I will definitely purchase this again.  I have blonde hair and it comes out as a white powder, which can be brushed through.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple dry shampoos and this one is the best! Lift up my hair, spray on just a little powder around my head, run my hands through my hair, and voila! my fine, short hair looks like I just washed it. Amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> This stuff is excellent. I have very oily hair and this works on it to make it look clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably tried every single brand of dry shampoo that exists today...these are BY FAR the best. Even beats out the products that cost 5x more!</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m not doing any strenuous physical activity I can do 3 days between washes. If I use a little of this on my roots on day 2 and 3 my hair looks like it was freshly washed by getting rid of any oily or greasy look. It is not magic though: if your hair is downright dirty, like after a workout when you&#x27;ve sweat a lot, it&#x27;s not going to work. But it&#x27;s great for freshening up hair when it&#x27;s not quite dirty but not quite in need of a wash yet.</li>
            <li> My wife who has straight hair loves this, I purchased different kind of dry shampoos and she is really picky with those products, she says this is the best because her hair is fresh and managable besides this dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave &amp;#34;white residues&amp;#34; like the others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried millions. Batiste Original Dry Shampoo is by far the ABSOLUTE best at removing oil. Saves me a day of oily hair. Perfect for the busy mom!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great to use when you just need to freshen up your hair between washings.&lt;br /&gt;It really works and does not leave my hair dull!  This is a must have product for me and I will be&lt;br /&gt;buying more when my supply gets low!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Not sure how it will work on dark hair. I have blond hair, and shampoo made my hair brighter. Hair looks great at least for 4 days.</li>
            <li> Great price and does not irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I like the result - I don&#x27;t like the fragrance.  It absorbs the oil in my hair so I can run off to yoga first thing in the mornign without shampooing - but it does make the hair look sort of dull and powdery.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without this stuff!! best dry shampoo out there! i&#x27;ve probably gone through about 5 cans this year! i&#x27;ve tried several other brands, from 5 bucks to 50, can&#x27;t beat this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have red hair, it&#x27;s not necessarily course, but its thick. i cannot wash it everyday or it gets greasy but sometimes those last couple hours of the workday on day 2 it gets a bit of a shine and becomes flat. plus, if i plan to go out after work i need a pick me up! i can even use it on day 3 when i don&#x27;t have time for a shower first thing in the morning-your hair will look freshly washed! i have this in the travel size too to carry in my purse with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i just lift about an inch of hair and spray this on the roots for some added volume. sometimes thats enough to make the top look good too, if not, i hold the can about 8-10 inches away and spray lightly and move the can around quickly so i don&#x27;t get it too much in one spot. let it set for about a minute and then comb it out with your fingers and you&#x27;re good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only con is that i wish it was fragrance. it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell at all and it will cover up smell in your hair but it would be nice to have some sort of \\&quot;shampoo smell\\&quot; to it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is freaking Amazeballs!!!!! I can&#x27;t live without this stuff in my life. I love the way it makes your hair feel and smell. I would totally take a lifetime supply of this stuff on a dessert island with me.</li>
            <li> There is no better dry shampoo for this price. Hands down.</li>
            <li> This is the best price I have found, although I did just see it at T.J. Maxx for pretty cheap, but that&#x27;s not constant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave residue, you just rub in the spray and there you go. If you like dry shampoo, try this one, it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> I have a greasy scalp naturally and have tried all of the dry shampoos in the book....this dry shampoo is FANTASTIC! Not only does it absorb the oil, but it gives me good volume &amp; doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch or feel gross. I use it multiple days in a row as well &amp; never have had bad results. With this product, less is more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Since I started using this, my life has vastly improved. Haven&#x27;t tried other brands. Got this after reading reviews on Amazon. I have long, black Asian hair, and I&#x27;ve never had trouble with rubbing in the spray and it disappearing. It looks normal, doesn&#x27;t turn my hair grey or flaky. I usually only get a little oil on the roots of my hair daily, just enough to be noticeable but really not enough for a shampoo. I hated having to wash and dry just to look fresh.  Now I can go 3 days without washing, saving the precious ends of my hair from getting stripped so frequently. Instant refresh, saves my mornings.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and there is actually a lot of product in the bottle unlike some of the high priced brands.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo ever.  Works on both blonde and brunette hair.  I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> It works great!  I don&#x27;t love the smell but it isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dry shampoo sprays from Suave, Pssssst and another brand from the drugstore (can&#x27;t remember exactly which at the moment), and they tended to make my hair look clumpy and still greasy. Glad to report that Batiste works GREAT! My hair actually looks refreshed, NOT oily, and has volume at the roots. This spray goes on white, but once you rub it into your hair, you can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s there at all. (I have black hair so this was one of my concerns.) I would definitely recommend this product. The original fragrance smells lemony and is not too overpowering, as I felt the dry shampoo from Suave was.</li>
            <li> This keeps my hair looking fresh for days. Best dry shampoo product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Light, fast-working, easy to use.  Keeps me from having to wash my hair all the time and has a fresh scent, like baby powder.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever!! I was washing my hair too often and getting a dry scalp. Now im washing my hair 3x a week and using this stiff in between...love it!! Smells good.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin/scalp but can&#x27;t wash my hair every day because I have 2 colors in it. I&#x27;ve tried several other dry shampoos, including Alterna, and NOTHING COMPARES TO BATISTE. Don&#x27;t waste your money trying anything else. It gets rid of the greasiness, adds fluff and shine.</li>
            <li> Great for quick cleaning when there is no time for a full wash.</li>
            <li> Works well as promised.</li>
            <li> This product is one of my must-have beauty items.  I use it several times a week to not only freshen my hair, but also to give it volume.  It can be a hassle to wash my long hair, and I really try to avoid washing it often, so dry shampoo is a huge time-saver (and hair-saver) for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hang my head upside down and spray it near my scalp all the way around my head.  Just a quick, once-around-my-head spray.  Then with my head still upside down, I use the blow-dryer set on low for about one minute.  My hair looks and smells clean and fresh, and I have twice the volume I had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does leave a little bit of a dull &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; finish on my hair, so after I style it, I spray a little shine serum all over.  This routine saves me several hours a week I would normally spend washing and styling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dry shampoo also came in VERY handy when my mother was confined to a bed in a nursing home and washing her hair was a huge ordeal.  Made her look and feel so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I like this dry shampoo, but be warned it goes on very white. It needs to be brushed in a lot to blend in the white color.  Smells good and works immediately.</li>
            <li> This really works and smells nice.  You get a shampooed,  refreshed look.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent dry shampoo. It smells fresh without being too perfume-y, overwhelming, or chemically. Adds body without leaving hair too &#x27;grabby&#x27; or coated feeling. Sprays in easily, absorbs oil very well, and brushes out well without leaving too much white residue behind. Does not make hair too matte, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine-textured, dark blonde and highlighted (so any remaining white powder residue is not as obvious as it would be on someone with really dark hair), with roots that tend to be a bit oily, so I usually wash every other day. The water where I live is too chlorinated/chemically to wash every day, plus it&#x27;s too time consuming to wash my long hair daily. Using this dry shampoo easily adds an extra day between washes. I wash my hair on day 1, on day 2 (depending on weather) my roots are usually fine and I can brush out and restyle my hair. If I don&#x27;t have time to wash on day 3, I use this dry shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my shower (use a shower cap to keep hair dry!) and before applying makeup, I brush my hair well before application to remove shed hair and knots, then spray this rather liberally all over my roots in sections. Clip the length back in a ponytail and put a thin plastic headband on to keep the front sections off my face, and apply makeup while allowing the dry shampoo time to work absorbing oil. Usually leave it in for at least 15 minutes, the longer the better.  Then this trick: I use a clean, dry washcloth or hand towel (dedicated for this purpose) and gently rub the excess powder residue off my root sections, taking care to not tangle my hair too much. Then flip hair over and brush, brush, brush from root to tip to remove the remaining powder residue, flip my hair back over to the front, style, and spray in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It it a bit time-consuming to take care to remove the excess powder and brushing it out, but all told, it&#x27;s still less time-consuming than washing and blow-drying. This product leaves my hair somewhat shiny, not too matte.  I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this, and usually buy several cans at a time because I do use quite a bit in one go.hiny, not too matte.  I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this, and usually buy several cans at a time because I do use quite a bit in one go.</li>
            <li> I usually buy batiste blush dry shampoo but I took a chance on the original scent. I actually like it better! Of course it works very well to freshen greasy hair and its scent isn&#x27;t as overbearing as blush.</li>
            <li> This stuff is gold in a can!  Makes getting ready so easy!  Extends your highlights too! Thanks for great product!</li>
            <li> Makes me look like I am in my 70&#x27;s - All white &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; in my hair...  Do not recommend this product.  Waste of time &amp; $.</li>
