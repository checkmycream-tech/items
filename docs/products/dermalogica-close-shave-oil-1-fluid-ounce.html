            <li>Great shave oil, razor just glides.</li>
            <li>smells very nice too.</li>
            <li>I have found better shave products out there but for someone like myself who travels a lot for work and hates to check bags, this is perfect for carry ons.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I converted my husbands brother, my own brother and my father!  </li>
            <li>Look around and find a good price.</li>
            <li>i am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This oil is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I use this all over my shave area on my face, then also add my store brand shaving cream, and it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>Not inexpensive, but effective.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s very easy to take on trips.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin and break out after shaving this is a perfect product for you.  </li>
            <li>Provides a very, very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>but I wish there was more in the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really am baffled by the great reviews.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, too.  </li>
            <li>But if your like me, and every penny counts, the net best thing is johnson baby oil gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing that you can use so little of this product and still get the best shave.  </li>
            <li>Best shave every single time.</li>
            <li>You do have to clean out your electric razor more often because it is an oil.</li>
            <li>It allows your razor to slide and glide easily.  </li>
            <li>blade glides over skin for smooth close shave</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic, and I purchased it as it was one of the highest recommended shaving oils.</li>
            <li>While he liked the oil, the container made it come out too fast.</li>
            <li>Have to make sure that the razor is not dull and also have to make sure to use your face with facewash and warm water first.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and have used it for 4 years and don&#x27;t intend to switch to anything else, definitely increases the blade life significantly and thus pays for itself since I don&#x27;t have to replace blades often.</li>
            <li>This just didn&#x27;t work all that well for the price, plus it was gone quickly.</li>
            <li>This smells pretty ok, and the bottle dispenses the right amount to cover a reasonable area.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Smells good, certainly not offensive as some have said, but that&#x27;s subjective.</li>
            <li>Seeing that the reviews for the Oil had an even higher rating than the cream, I thought I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li>No pre-shave this or that, just some hot water, 4 drops, and rinse blade after every pass.  </li>
            <li>It gives me a really close/smooth shave, without any irritation after.  </li>
            <li>It comes out too fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had more nicks and cuts with these products than any other product.</li>
            <li>Plus, it leaves my skin feeling nice and soft, albeit a little oily (it is shave oil).  </li>
            <li>If you still lather over the top of it, it&#x27;s less of a concern.</li>
            <li>You do pay a bit more money up front, but the bottle last for several months</li>
            <li>you have a steady paycheck, and you can be frivolous with your beauty product purchases, go for it</li>
            <li>Razor glide is smooth and absolutely no razor burn.  </li>
            <li>Not only do I now get a smooth, comfortable shave with this stuff, my razor blades are lasting 3 times as long!  </li>
            <li>It is hands-down better than ordinary shave gel.  </li>
            <li>I now use Johnson baby oil gel, gives the EXACT same cushioning, conditioning and razor protection a a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once upon a time I was concerned with the fact that it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34;, but if you consider how little product you are actually using, you realize the environmental impact is actually better.</li>
            <li>Only shaving oil that my wife will use, so it must work very well.</li>
            <li>For my skin/facial hair (asian), this product works really well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got very senstive skin and tried 20+ different shaving creams and gels, but none of them stopped the razor burn.  </li>
            <li>He has amazingly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It has made a serious difference in my skin and the shave is very close and smooth.</li>
            <li>My now husband used to walk out of the bathroom look like he and the razor had a major falling out.  </li>
            <li>said he boyfriend had the same sensitive skin issues and that this product changed his shaving routine and his life!  </li>
            <li>(I used them for years to help manage my teenage acne and today use many of their products  for my adult skin) and I happened upon this shave oil and the girl behind the desk</li>
            <li>I knew it was going to be small when I ordered it, but the true realization didn&#x27;t hit me until I got it.  </li>
            <li>I have coarse hair, sensitive skin, and use a double edge razor with astra or feather blades.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not very vigilant with your razor, this can clog a head past the ability to clean save for a power washer.</li>

            <li> It does last a long time</li>
            <li> Small bottle, highly concentrated.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say she was right!  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s a complaint about oil in general, not this product.</li>
            <li> I tried this along with some other Dermalogica products.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine that I can&#x27;t recreate the effect with some other oil, like almond or jojoba.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and find this product to help in getting a close shave without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> But at like 12-30 bux a pop per BOTTLE&lt;br /&gt;its almost not worth it.</li>
            <li> how well my thick facial hair is shaved with ease without irritation.</li>
            <li> A little to heavy and oily feel for me.</li>
            <li> All in all still a god price, but a little confusing.</li>
            <li> Does very little to make shaving any easier.</li>
            <li> This small size is too small.  </li>
            <li> It really is small for what you get.  </li>
            <li> and I hate it so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little confused on the pricing.  Shows $7 per ounce, this is a 1 ounce bottle, but it&#x27;s $14.00?</li>
            <li> and my husband has quite thick hair and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I just have a really tough beard.</li>
            <li> Essentially really expensive baby oil.</li>
            <li> Sad to say</li>
            <li> How expensive could it be to make?&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is VERY expensive but does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely awful.</li>

            <li> this is a very good product that i like to use !  also very good shipping to the Netherlands.  i am very pleased.  best regards</li>
            <li> Essentially really expensive baby oil. Does very little to make shaving any easier.</li>
            <li> Only shaving oil that my wife will use, so it must work very well. She loves it!  Not inexpensive, but effective.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing.  It is hands-down better than ordinary shave gel.  Razor glide is smooth and absolutely no razor burn.  Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I have been using this with my electric shaver for 3 years. It does last a long time but I wish there was more in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It is VERY expensive but does not irritate my skin. You do have to clean out your electric razor more often because it is an oil.</li>
            <li> Great product...blade glides over skin for smooth close shave</li>
            <li> For my skin/facial hair (asian), this product works really well.  It gives me a really close/smooth shave, without any irritation after.  Plus, it leaves my skin feeling nice and soft, albeit a little oily (it is shave oil).  Plus, it&#x27;s very easy to take on trips.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible!  I&#x27;ve got very senstive skin and tried 20+ different shaving creams and gels, but none of them stopped the razor burn.  Not only do I now get a smooth, comfortable shave with this stuff, my razor blades are lasting 3 times as long!  I will never use anything else again.</li>
            <li> I am a woman shaver.... Sad to say and I hate it so much! But I tried this oil a few years back when I was having real issues with my facial skin and was depressed because of the bumps and darkness that I was experiencing. I was introduced to this item in Ulta and I&#x27;ve been using it and ordering it ever since. It has made a serious difference in my skin and the shave is very close and smooth. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Dermalogica shave cream that comes in a tube. Seeing that the reviews for the Oil had an even higher rating than the cream, I thought I&#x27;d try it. Absolutely awful. My razor did not glide. I felt as though I could have just used soap and water and achieved the same results. Since it&#x27;s invisible on the skin, you don&#x27;t quite know where it&#x27;s been applied. I really am baffled by the great reviews. Perhaps I just have a really tough beard. If this stuff sold for $3 instead of $23 I still would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> BEST THING EVER! I no longer get razor burn / bumps / ingrown hairs - and this is the only thing I added.  I use this all over my shave area on my face, then also add my store brand shaving cream, and it&#x27;s amazing how well my thick facial hair is shaved with ease without irritation.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and have used it for 4 years and don&#x27;t intend to switch to anything else, definitely increases the blade life significantly and thus pays for itself since I don&#x27;t have to replace blades often.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin and break out after shaving this is a perfect product for you.  It allows your razor to slide and glide easily.  It creates a protective barrier between your skin and the razor while giving a close shave.</li>
            <li> I tried this along with some other Dermalogica products.  I have coarse hair, sensitive skin, and use a double edge razor with astra or feather blades.  I&#x27;ve had more nicks and cuts with these products than any other product.</li>
            <li> See my title! The best way to shave. Been using oil for years and will never go back to cream in an aerosol can!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and find this product to help in getting a close shave without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> Small bottle, highly concentrated.  Provides a very, very smooth shave.  I love the scent, too.  I like the style of the bottle, too.</li>
            <li> I have found better shave products out there but for someone like myself who travels a lot for work and hates to check bags, this is perfect for carry ons.</li>
            <li> Great shave oil, razor just glides. Look around and find a good price. It&#x27;s worth it. Smells good, certainly not offensive as some have said, but that&#x27;s subjective. It does tend to clog your razor a bit faster, especially if you use this along. If you still lather over the top of it, it&#x27;s less of a concern.</li>
            <li> ... I&#x27;m a little confused on the pricing.  Shows $7 per ounce, this is a 1 ounce bottle, but it&#x27;s $14.00? All in all still a god price, but a little confusing.</li>
            <li> My now husband used to walk out of the bathroom look like he and the razor had a major falling out.  He has amazingly sensitive skin.  I worked with him for over a year to create a shaving routine that would reduced the amount of razor burn he would get, but nothing seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a local salon, I happened to be looking at a rack of Dermalogica products (I used them for years to help manage my teenage acne and today use many of their products  for my adult skin) and I happened upon this shave oil and the girl behind the desk said he boyfriend had the same sensitive skin issues and that this product changed his shaving routine and his life!  Needless to say she was right!  My husband has been using the Close Shave Oil for almost 5 years and he hasn&#x27;t touched another shaving product since.  Additionally, I converted my husbands brother, my own brother and my father!  My brother then proceeded to convert all his friends.  You do pay a bit more money up front, but the bottle last for several months and my husband has quite thick hair and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Like all oil products, this has some reaction on the skin that either causes it to condense and thicken, or the debris on your skin to do so. If you&#x27;re not very vigilant with your razor, this can clog a head past the ability to clean save for a power washer. But that&#x27;s a complaint about oil in general, not this product. This product is fantastic, and I purchased it as it was one of the highest recommended shaving oils. I&#x27;ll never use another type to shave with: foam, gel, lotion, etc. can&#x27;t compare to the experience provided by oil. This smells pretty ok, and the bottle dispenses the right amount to cover a reasonable area.</li>
            <li> A little to heavy and oily feel for me.</li>
            <li> This small size is too small.  It comes out too fast.  My husband is used to using this brand of cream shave.  While he liked the oil, the container made it come out too fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing that you can use so little of this product and still get the best shave.  4-5 drops is all.  No pre-shave this or that, just some hot water, 4 drops, and rinse blade after every pass.  Once upon a time I was concerned with the fact that it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34;, but if you consider how little product you are actually using, you realize the environmental impact is actually better.</li>
            <li> Its just silicone and eucalyptus oil. How expensive could it be to make?&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works as promised. I get the best shave EVER. EVER!!!! But at like 12-30 bux a pop per BOTTLE&lt;br /&gt;its almost not worth it. Which is why I had to switch. I now use Johnson baby oil gel, gives the EXACT same cushioning, conditioning and razor protection a a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have a steady paycheck, and you can be frivolous with your beauty product purchases, go for it, this is the best your money can buy and it smells great. But if your like me, and every penny counts, the net best thing is johnson baby oil gel. Works just the same just a diff fragrance.</li>
            <li> I use this oil when I need to shave time shaving. it is a great shaving oil! smells very nice too. Best shave every single time. Have to make sure that the razor is not dull and also have to make sure to use your face with facewash and warm water first.</li>
            <li> The stuff is awesome. I will never use shaving cream or gel again.</li>
            <li> I knew it was going to be small when I ordered it, but the true realization didn&#x27;t hit me until I got it.  It really is small for what you get.  I can&#x27;t imagine that I can&#x27;t recreate the effect with some other oil, like almond or jojoba.  I haven&#x27;t tried, but I&#x27;m quite tempted to.  This just didn&#x27;t work all that well for the price, plus it was gone quickly.</li>
