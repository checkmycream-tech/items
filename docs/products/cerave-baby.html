            <li>This is the perfect lotion for after shaves, too, even on very sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>but I love this more than the CeraVe non-baby formula, lotion and cream!  </li>
            <li>So, I thought it would be perfect for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Recommended by my pediatrician and I completely agree - great baby lotion!</li>
            <li>My baby has sensitive skin and this is the perfect moisturizer for him.</li>
            <li>The lotion is not oily feeling and absorbs very quickly!</li>
            <li>I have loved CeraVe products for myself for years and was so excited to see that they have products for babies too.  </li>
            <li>I like it; it seems to be a lighter version of the cream we love.  </li>
            <li>Still, I did not give up on this lotion and I tried three more times...</li>
            <li>I love this for me</li>
            <li>So, I searched Amazon and read many reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue using it until I discover something better.</li>
            <li>im glad I got it with the add on discount</li>
            <li>I do love the CereVe moisturizers and have used over a dozen containers of lotions and creams.  </li>
            <li>I am  also glad it is offered in subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this stuff.</li>

            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>This version has helped cut back on the excess grease on my face which makes me very happy.</li>
            <li>People with sensitivity to smells would love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Smooth after a day of use!</li>
            <li>love this product use it for me and my two boys.</li>
            <li>so it stays on better.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is mild and effective, with no detectable added scent.  </li>
            <li>As one reviewer stated, the formula feels extremely elegant and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>love Cerave cream and was excited to try this.  </li>
            <li>The baby lotion is more of a cream than the original</li>
            <li>I love just about every Cerave Product, I really cant find a Better product at a Better price..</li>
            <li>It is scent-free, and dries to a smooth, non-greasy finish.  </li>
            <li>Our daughter has skin issues and this was such a great lotion for her.</li>
            <li>It goes on light and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or scent.</li>
            <li>My household includes no babies, but this lotion is so amazing that I can&#x27;t really use anything else.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled when this came out because it&#x27;s a much gentler, baby-friendly version that doesn&#x27;t have some of the ingredients that I was conflicted about in the original formulation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried the original lotion</li>
            <li>Have subscribed to this because I love it so much!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion for my whole family!  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin on my hands and am always looking for the  next best thing.  </li>
            <li>It works great for me after showers and on dry patches as well.  </li>
            <li>Use a handheld mixer and I have the most perfect night cream that is fluffy and light with a barely detectable fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this...</li>
            <li>I use a full bottle of this and 4 oz of the vitamin e cream and 4 oz of the Vaseline.  </li>
            <li>We love it so much.</li>
            <li>Not too greasy but makes a difference in her sweet skin.</li>
            <li>I love the Cerave line of products, and I trust it to be gentle on my baby.</li>
            <li>This product is a true family product everyone can use it including newborns.</li>
            <li>Good produc but the Expiration date is short</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s paraben free and sulfate free, unlike the regular CeraVe line.  </li>
            <li>Not very expensive and works great with babies dry skin.</li>
            <li>My baby&#x27;s skin was getting sensitive to most lotions, even the unscented ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved and trusted Cerave cream for 4 years through dry winters and eczema flairs on my whole family, age newborn and up.  </li>
            <li>I love this brand generally</li>
            <li>It dries non-greasy and is quite effective on his dry skin.</li>
            <li>Our pediatrician recommended CeraVe for our baby with eczema back before this line was available, and now I feel comfortable buying it.  </li>
            <li>It left my kids fine hair clean, but some conditioner was needed to avoid tangles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I do wish they offered it in a larger, more cost efficient size.  </li>
            <li>and this really seems to make a difference!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a gentle moisturizer you should give this a shot!</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference!</li>
            <li>Its better than the regular CeraVe lotion as it doesn&#x27;t contain parabens</li>
            <li>Nothing they tested him for was positive.  </li>
            <li>As long as I&#x27;m diligent in applying it, her skin is okay.</li>
            <li>The smell is very mild and it sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li>It is soft and soaks in quickly.  </li>
            <li>the ingredients are mild for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>After reading so many reviews, skin is still so dry.</li>
            <li>I really, really did.  </li>
            <li>My skin is calm, but sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I switched to Burt&#x27;s Bees and didn&#x27;t notice much improvement.</li>
            <li>However, the lotion moisturized his normal skin pretty well.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be much more moisturizing than it is.</li>
            <li>I love how light it feels and the smell is subtle.</li>
            <li>and this helps him better than any other lotion we&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Lotion was ok but can find it cheaper other places.  </li>
            <li>so love that it has no added fragrance and that the other ingredients have no offensive smell.  </li>
            <li>This is mild and gentle enough that I can put on baby a couple times a day.</li>
            <li>It seems like it is absorbed instantly in my son&#x27;s skin, and it doesn&#x27;t feel very moisturized afterwards.</li>
            <li>I then switched to a different product and her skin was soft and smooth within a week.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My babies get eczema and this makes their skin so soft and very moisturized.</li>
            <li>This proves that the formula is different (unlike Aquaphor ointment that is just repackaged).  </li>
            <li>The active ingredient, dimethicone, is rated a &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; by EWG, but it seems pretty effective to me (in a way that other 0/1 EWG baby moisturizers are not)</li>
            <li>so I can live with that.  </li>
            <li>Not the baby smooth that it was for so long, but not rough either.</li>
            <li>Much better and her red rough cheeks?</li>
            <li>My husband has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my fifties and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If you have normal/combo/oily skin you can just use it directly from the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have used the adult version on my face for years and was overjoyed when CeraVe started making a baby version.</li>
            <li>I purchased it for my 3 yr old son to use</li>
            <li>It did not leave a rash on my 3 month old though</li>
            <li>and they did a scratch test on our 4 month old .  </li>
            <li>Our daughter has had really sensitive skin since day one.</li>
            <li>I fully recommend this for sensitive skin use.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that even Aveeno&#x27;s baby lotion was drying her skin.</li>
            <li>It protects my sensitive skin while eliminating dryness without harmful ingredients or an offensive scent.</li>
            <li>It sinks right into my face with no greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>This one exceeds my expectations, my hands were super soft and my son&#x27;s legs stayed softer and less scaly longer after applying.  </li>
            <li>It really does the trick--and it lasts for a long time on the skin.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this lotion over their regular moisturizing lotion that I normally use on my face because my skin was getting greasy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little cheaper than the Calendula cream and has a mild smell too.  </li>
            <li>Shortly after our son turned 2 months old, he developed eczema patches on both cheeks, his scalp and his ankle.  </li>
            <li>and I have since purchased two bottles for me and a few in gift bags for my pregnant friends.</li>
            <li>Those worked pretty good but a little expensive for the amount you got.</li>
            <li>2 applications a day have really helped calm his dry skin down!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, but if you have major dry skin or  severe eczema, I&#x27;d recommend the cream in a jar over the pump lotion.</li>
            <li>but I noticed my hands are extra soft after applying lotion on him.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not heavy even if used as a facial moisturiser</li>
            <li>Skin sucks this right up!</li>
            <li>I have had extremely sensitive skin and it has been so dry and irritated this winter.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my son&#x27;s dry, sensitive skin well-moisturized without feeling sticky/greasy.</li>
            <li>She has developed some dry patches despite daily use.</li>
            <li>My 11 month old started getting extremely dry patches of skin a couple months back.</li>

            <li> so love that it has no added fragrance and that the other ingredients have no offensive smell.  </li>
            <li> This is mild and gentle enough that I can put on baby a couple times a day.</li>
            <li> It seems like it is absorbed instantly in my son&#x27;s skin, and it doesn&#x27;t feel very moisturized afterwards.</li>
            <li> I then switched to a different product and her skin was soft and smooth within a week.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My babies get eczema and this makes their skin so soft and very moisturized.</li>
            <li> This proves that the formula is different (unlike Aquaphor ointment that is just repackaged).  </li>
            <li> The active ingredient, dimethicone, is rated a &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; by EWG, but it seems pretty effective to me (in a way that other 0/1 EWG baby moisturizers are not)</li>
            <li> so I can live with that.  </li>
            <li> Not the baby smooth that it was for so long, but not rough either.</li>
            <li> Much better and her red rough cheeks?</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my fifties and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> If you have normal/combo/oily skin you can just use it directly from the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have used the adult version on my face for years and was overjoyed when CeraVe started making a baby version.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my 3 yr old son to use</li>
            <li> It did not leave a rash on my 3 month old though</li>
            <li> and they did a scratch test on our 4 month old .  </li>
            <li> Our daughter has had really sensitive skin since day one.</li>
            <li> I fully recommend this for sensitive skin use.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that even Aveeno&#x27;s baby lotion was drying her skin.</li>
            <li> It protects my sensitive skin while eliminating dryness without harmful ingredients or an offensive scent.</li>
            <li> It sinks right into my face with no greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> This one exceeds my expectations, my hands were super soft and my son&#x27;s legs stayed softer and less scaly longer after applying.  </li>
            <li> It really does the trick--and it lasts for a long time on the skin.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this lotion over their regular moisturizing lotion that I normally use on my face because my skin was getting greasy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little cheaper than the Calendula cream and has a mild smell too.  </li>
            <li> Shortly after our son turned 2 months old, he developed eczema patches on both cheeks, his scalp and his ankle.  </li>
            <li> and I have since purchased two bottles for me and a few in gift bags for my pregnant friends.</li>
            <li> Those worked pretty good but a little expensive for the amount you got.</li>
            <li> 2 applications a day have really helped calm his dry skin down!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, but if you have major dry skin or  severe eczema, I&#x27;d recommend the cream in a jar over the pump lotion.</li>
            <li> but I noticed my hands are extra soft after applying lotion on him.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not heavy even if used as a facial moisturiser</li>
            <li> Skin sucks this right up!</li>
            <li> I have had extremely sensitive skin and it has been so dry and irritated this winter.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my son&#x27;s dry, sensitive skin well-moisturized without feeling sticky/greasy.</li>
            <li> She has developed some dry patches despite daily use.</li>
            <li> My 11 month old started getting extremely dry patches of skin a couple months back.</li>
            <li> I choose it when on the go at the sink with dry hands, or for a squirming child who doesn&#x27;t need the extra moisture from the cream.  </li>
            <li> Baby&#x27;s skin has definitely benefited from it in our dry climate.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on myself and it didn&#x27;t work well even on my regular dry skin.</li>
            <li> We have tried multiple steroid creams very very briefly because they are not designed for children his age nor or they for typical facial use.  </li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin, I would recommend a different lotion.</li>
            <li> I wish they sold it in a larger bottle - it is expensive and we go through it quickly.</li>
            <li> I found a raw shea and cocoa butter cream in a tub at local big red circle retailer....</li>
            <li> It seems to be helping, but she still has dry patches.</li>
            <li> If I forget to use the lotion after a bath, I notice she&#x27;s really dry.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;ll apply Aquaphor to her really dry spots and that does wonders.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help the existing eczema at all - the patches felt dry and not moisturized just a couple of hours after applying the lotion.</li>
            <li> This was the lotion my pediatrician recommended for my baby&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
            <li> We have extremely dry &amp; rough KP skin</li>
            <li> My baby had a few red rough patches from dry winter air or something.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion but the pump doesn&#x27;t work :(</li>
            <li> I will never use the other baby products I was so used to.</li>
            <li> She did not has a reaction to it like other baby lotions.</li>
            <li> so I do not believe it burns him like some of the other lotions did.</li>
            <li> Even my toddler does not object to it, like he does to almost any other lotion that he can detect immediately after application.  </li>
            <li> My babies skin would get rashes with any other product except for this.</li>
            <li> He has some eczema and this prevents the little dry patches from forming.</li>
            <li> The following over the counter items did nothing at all or actually made it worse.  </li>
            <li> No more dry bumps like they had with other product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my little one had a few dry spots on her arms.</li>
            <li> Oatmeal baths just made a mess and didn&#x27;t help his itching at all.  </li>
            <li> in all, I prefer Mustela Stelatopia cream cleanser for the skin, and a mild shampoo for the hair, but I&#x27;d choose this during bad eczema flairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmm.  </li>
            <li> Our little guy has eczema and his dermatologist recommended CeraVe baby.</li>
            <li> Alas, it broke me out in little red cystic acne bumps just a few hours application.  </li>
            <li> One thing you must know about my skin is that it almost never breaks out or behaves badly save for the rare hormonal pimple.  </li>
            <li> there is an ingredient there that might be a stimulant, my baby skin bled after a few uses</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my rosacea, and also doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the only one we found over the counter that did not seem to make the weeping of the eczema worse.  </li>
            <li> It also has a strange odor that is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> Soft healing for this tough cold winter we had.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with this lotion.</li>
            <li> and it made the redness worse.</li>
            <li> lotion didn&#x27;t cure baby&#x27;s rash, and may have made it worse.  </li>
            <li> I am a CeraVe die hard fan, and I&#x27;m honestly disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> The bottle is so dirty.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved and trusted Cerave cream for 4 years through dry winters and eczema flairs on my whole family, age newborn and up.  This cleanser is mild and effective, with no detectable added scent.  My eczematous babies had no issue with it, and I like that it can serve as a shampoo if desired.  It left my kids fine hair clean, but some conditioner was needed to avoid tangles.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I prefer Mustela Stelatopia cream cleanser for the skin, and a mild shampoo for the hair, but I&#x27;d choose this during bad eczema flairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmm.  I can&#x27;t seem to review the wash and the lotion separately -- so here&#x27;s a review of the lotion:&lt;br /&gt;I love Cerave cream and was excited to try this.  I like it; it seems to be a lighter version of the cream we love.  It is scent-free, and dries to a smooth, non-greasy finish.  I choose it when on the go at the sink with dry hands, or for a squirming child who doesn&#x27;t need the extra moisture from the cream.  I highly recommend this, but if you have major dry skin or  severe eczema, I&#x27;d recommend the cream in a jar over the pump lotion.</li>
            <li> there is an ingredient there that might be a stimulant, my baby skin bled after a few uses</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this... I really, really did.  As one reviewer stated, the formula feels extremely elegant and comfortable.  This lotion contains a wealth of beneficial ingredients.  So, I thought it would be perfect for my sensitive skin.  Alas, it broke me out in little red cystic acne bumps just a few hours application.  One thing you must know about my skin is that it almost never breaks out or behaves badly save for the rare hormonal pimple.  My skin is calm, but sensitive.  Still, I did not give up on this lotion and I tried three more times... I broke out each time within minutes. Such a shame!</li>
            <li> I wish they sold it in a larger bottle - it is expensive and we go through it quickly. She has developed some dry patches despite daily use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Only lotion that I can use and I&#x27;m no baby.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my pediatrician and I completely agree - great baby lotion!</li>
            <li> Love the lotion but the pump doesn&#x27;t work :(</li>
            <li> I love this for me and I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s!  Best moisturizer I have found for the face.  I have had extremely sensitive skin and it has been so dry and irritated this winter.  I use this whipped with Vaseline and vitamin e cream by Fruit of the Earth as my night cream.  I use a full bottle of this and 4 oz of the vitamin e cream and 4 oz of the Vaseline.  Use a handheld mixer and I have the most perfect night cream that is fluffy and light with a barely detectable fragrance.  It sinks right into my face with no greasy residue.  Better then department store brands too!  I use it in the morning before my sunscreen too but will probably not need to once the summer months come.  If you have normal/combo/oily skin you can just use it directly from the bottle.  I&#x27;ve never tried the original lotion but this one is perfect so unless they stop making it, I will use this forever!  I trust Cerave and now I know what the fuss is all about!</li>
            <li> My 11 month old started getting extremely dry patches of skin a couple months back. At the time I was using Aveeno baby lotion. I switched to Burt&#x27;s Bees and didn&#x27;t notice much improvement. So, I searched Amazon and read many reviews. CeraVe Baby Lotion received excellent reviews. I love how light it feels and the smell is subtle. It seems to be helping, but she still has dry patches. If I forget to use the lotion after a bath, I notice she&#x27;s really dry. As long as I&#x27;m diligent in applying it, her skin is okay. Not the baby smooth that it was for so long, but not rough either. Sometimes I&#x27;ll apply Aquaphor to her really dry spots and that does wonders. Overall I like it. I&#x27;ll continue using it until I discover something better.</li>
            <li> my baby is somehow allergic or it just doesn&#x27;t agree with his eczema at all. ive been using for me and it feels amazing. im glad I got it with the add on discount</li>
            <li> Excellent Lotion for your Face!  Skin sucks this right up!</li>
            <li> Our daughter has skin issues and this was such a great lotion for her. We love it so much. Not too greasy but makes a difference in her sweet skin.</li>
            <li> Good lotions for the kids.</li>
            <li> I have loved CeraVe products for myself for years and was so excited to see that they have products for babies too.  We are on our second bottle at 4 months of age and use it every night after bath time.  It is soft and soaks in quickly.  Baby&#x27;s skin has definitely benefited from it in our dry climate.  Have subscribed to this because I love it so much!</li>
            <li> Not very expensive and works great with babies dry skin. I got a sample from the doctor&#x27;s office and I have since purchased two bottles for me and a few in gift bags for my pregnant friends.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! My baby has sensitive skin and this is the perfect moisturizer for him. It goes on light and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or scent. I have used the adult version on my face for years and was overjoyed when CeraVe started making a baby version. Great product!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this is possible but I love this more than the CeraVe non-baby formula, lotion and cream!  I purchased it for my 3 yr old son to use but I noticed my hands are extra soft after applying lotion on him.  This proves that the formula is different (unlike Aquaphor ointment that is just repackaged).  The list of ingredients also is different.  I have sensitive skin on my hands and am always looking for the  next best thing.  I do love the CereVe moisturizers and have used over a dozen containers of lotions and creams.  This one exceeds my expectations, my hands were super soft and my son&#x27;s legs stayed softer and less scaly longer after applying.  The pump bottle is smaller than the regular size so I do wish they offered it in a larger, more cost efficient size.  I am  also glad it is offered in subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this stuff. Soft healing for this tough cold winter we had. Not greasy. Great</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, works and no rashes!</li>
            <li> I love just about every Cerave Product, I really cant find a Better product at a Better price.. all there products are exceptional</li>
            <li> Best Lotion on the market for Feet, Hands, Face and everywhere else you have skin. Apply Vaniply Ointment over this and you are set. Apply ThinkSport / Think Sport Sun block to exposed skin and you are set for the sun.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion for my whole family!  We have extremely dry &amp; rough KP skin and this really seems to make a difference!  It blends in to skin no problem, does not have any odor, is not greasy, and most of all I love that it does not have parabens, pthalates or SLS!!</li>
            <li> Love the Cerave cream in a jar and I love this as well.  Being that it&#x27;s for babies the ingredients are mild for sensitive skin.  My husband and I both use and love it!</li>
            <li> I will never use the other baby products I was so used to. My babies get eczema and this makes their skin so soft and very moisturized. It truly helps their skin. No more dry bumps like they had with other product.</li>
            <li> I tried this for my son&#x27;s eczema. It didn&#x27;t help the existing eczema at all - the patches felt dry and not moisturized just a couple of hours after applying the lotion. However, the lotion moisturized his normal skin pretty well.</li>
            <li> This was the lotion my pediatrician recommended for my baby&#x27;s dry skin. She did not has a reaction to it like other baby lotions. The lotion is not oily feeling and absorbs very quickly!</li>
            <li> I am a CeraVe die hard fan, and I&#x27;m honestly disappointed with this. I expected it to be much more moisturizing than it is. It seems like it is absorbed instantly in my son&#x27;s skin, and it doesn&#x27;t feel very moisturized afterwards. I&#x27;m going to switch back to the regular CeraVe cream on him.</li>
            <li> My nephew still using it for his ezema i think it will takes a while to work..</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever. My husband has very sensitive skin and this helps him better than any other lotion we&#x27;ve ever tried. This is the perfect lotion for after shaves, too, even on very sensitive areas. My household includes no babies, but this lotion is so amazing that I can&#x27;t really use anything else. It really does the trick--and it lasts for a long time on the skin. I&#x27;m no dermatologist, but I can say that it seems to do everything the label claims.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my rosacea, and also doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and heavy. If you&#x27;re looking for a gentle moisturizer you should give this a shot!</li>
            <li> Lotion was ok but can find it cheaper other places.  It also has a strange odor that is not pleasant. I will not purchase again from this seller. It did not leave a rash on my 3 month old though</li>
            <li> I bought this because my little one had a few dry spots on her arms. I used it every night for a month and it didn&#x27;t help at all. I then switched to a different product and her skin was soft and smooth within a week.</li>
            <li> awesome moisturizer!! I&#x27;m in my fifties and have very sensitive skin. my dermatologist recommended this. love it. She said for me to use all over including my face, but I do have a separate facial, and neck cream. This moisturizer isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs well. highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this lotion over their regular moisturizing lotion that I normally use on my face because my skin was getting greasy.  This version has helped cut back on the excess grease on my face which makes me very happy.</li>
            <li> I love the Cerave line of products, and I trust it to be gentle on my baby. This is mild and gentle enough that I can put on baby a couple times a day. It dries non-greasy and is quite effective on his dry skin.</li>
            <li> Shortly after our son turned 2 months old, he developed eczema patches on both cheeks, his scalp and his ankle.  We tried everything that we could think of.  The following over the counter items did nothing at all or actually made it worse.  Baby lotions various, baby creams various, baby oils with aloe and vit e, aveeno lotions for eczema, cetaphill, aquaphor, vaseline, lanolin.  Oatmeal baths just made a mess and didn&#x27;t help his itching at all.  We saw the pediatrician multiple times, saw an allergy doc and they did a scratch test on our 4 month old .  Nothing they tested him for was positive.  We have tried multiple steroid creams very very briefly because they are not designed for children his age nor or they for typical facial use.  We finally got Elidel approved through our insurance only to find it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  Currently, he is on zyrtec in the morning and hydroxyzine at night.  This lotion is the only one we found over the counter that did not seem to make the weeping of the eczema worse.  He also doesn&#x27;t cry when I put it on him so I do not believe it burns him like some of the other lotions did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a baby with eczema and our Derm suggested we use the regular CeraVe for him.  I was thrilled when this came out because it&#x27;s a much gentler, baby-friendly version that doesn&#x27;t have some of the ingredients that I was conflicted about in the original formulation.  Baby likes it, and I do too!</li>
            <li> Our daughter has had really sensitive skin since day one. We tried everything and we resorted to using the calendula creams. Those worked pretty good but a little expensive for the amount you got. Just started using Cerave and noticed an immediate improvement! It&#x27;s a little cheaper than the Calendula cream and has a mild smell too.  People with sensitivity to smells would love this lotion. I fully recommend this for sensitive skin use. It really makes a difference!</li>
            <li> No nasties and allergies noted after a week of usage! And it&#x27;s not heavy even if used as a facial moisturiser</li>
            <li> My baby had a few red rough patches from dry winter air or something. I tried this and it made the redness worse. I tried it on myself and it didn&#x27;t work well even on my regular dry skin. And dimethicone?! Bleh wish it wasn&#x27;t in this... I found a raw shea and cocoa butter cream in a tub at local big red circle retailer.... Much better and her red rough cheeks? Smooth after a day of use!</li>
            <li> lotion didn&#x27;t cure baby&#x27;s rash, and may have made it worse.  I love this brand generally but not this one for my baby.  Went with aveeno baby excema cream, which is great.</li>
            <li> This has got the be the best baby lotion ever!! My baby&#x27;s skin was getting sensitive to most lotions, even the unscented ones. I was surprised to find that even Aveeno&#x27;s baby lotion was drying her skin. CereVe Baby is perfect and did the job of moisturing her skin. I&#x27;m so glad her doctor introduced us to this!</li>
            <li> excellent. delivered on time</li>
            <li> I keep this at work and use it as a hand lotion., I like it and it does stand up to multiple hand washings. The smell is very mild and it sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li> The bottle is so dirty. Just like someone used it.</li>
            <li> Its better than the regular CeraVe lotion as it doesn&#x27;t contain parabens</li>
            <li> This product reminds me that I&#x27;m somebody&#x27;s baby. It protects my sensitive skin while eliminating dryness without harmful ingredients or an offensive scent. This product is a true family product everyone can use it including newborns. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> love this product use it for me and my two boys. I have very sensitive skin and this works well.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with this lotion. After reading so many reviews, skin is still so dry. If you have very dry skin, I would recommend a different lotion.</li>
            <li> Good produc but the Expiration date is short</li>
            <li> Thrilled to have found this product.  Works well.  Non-greasy, soaks in almost immediately (can&#x27;t detect after 1-2min).  Even my toddler does not object to it, like he does to almost any other lotion that he can detect immediately after application.  And most importantly, it works great for him -- moisturizes his sensitive/eczema skin and is non-irritating.  It works great for me after showers and on dry patches as well.  I&#x27;m scent-sensitive so love that it has no added fragrance and that the other ingredients have no offensive smell.  Love that it&#x27;s paraben free and sulfate free, unlike the regular CeraVe line.  The active ingredient, dimethicone, is rated a &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; by EWG, but it seems pretty effective to me (in a way that other 0/1 EWG baby moisturizers are not) so I can live with that.  Our pediatrician recommended CeraVe for our baby with eczema back before this line was available, and now I feel comfortable buying it.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> Our little guy has eczema and his dermatologist recommended CeraVe baby. The baby lotion is more of a cream than the original CeraVe so it stays on better. We&#x27;ve tried both and I definitely prefer the BABY lotion. 2 applications a day have really helped calm his dry skin down!</li>
            <li> Keeps my son&#x27;s dry, sensitive skin well-moisturized without feeling sticky/greasy. He has some eczema and this prevents the little dry patches from forming.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for babies. My babies skin would get rashes with any other product except for this. Love it!!</li>
            <li> not as good as curel itch defense.</li>
    </ol>
