            <li>so I feel it is a good value.</li>
            <li>I bought it because of all the good reviews it has gotten but trust me.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s good...</li>
            <li>Shipping was good, but felt like the toner did nothing for my face.</li>

            <li>Very refreshing - I will buy again</li>
            <li>I have zero irritation with this product and it&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
            <li>This toner is not as drying as many others, but it does a great job of removing residual gunk from my face after cleansing.</li>
            <li>I am now prepared to buy more of the Etude House products because this one has worked out so well!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really refreshing too!</li>

            <li>Refreshing and nice scent!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Not as amazing as some say  Update:</li>
            <li>Amazon has amazing customer service, btw.  </li>
            <li>I was using another Korean toner, which was nice</li>
            <li>My skin feels nice when it dries too.</li>
            <li>Feels nice.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>Nice toner</li>
            <li>It did come in its own box, which had a tape seal over that.</li>
            <li>but I found it takes my makeup off nicely..</li>
            <li>Great Great Great product I have combination T-zone face with large stubborn pores, and this product does minimize pores without drying out face, and also a a nice fresh scent ( no me</li>
            <li>Love love !</li>
            <li>and I love love the results I&#x27;m getting!</li>
            <li>I heard good things about this being good for large pores and blackheads</li>
            <li>This product has a good PH balancing effect and helps clean off any excess oil/makeup/sweat/etc.</li>
            <li>So great to get it at a very comparable price in the States!</li>
            <li>So wait, my skin is clear, smooth, looks great, feels great, and no adverse reactions?</li>
            <li>This one is just lovely.</li>
            <li>but this one is better.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, keep it in the fridge and it will close your pores even better.</li>
            <li>but I think the product is still doing it thing and needs more time to get rid of the blackheads.</li>
            <li>The best toner I&#x27;ve used compared to American drugstore toners!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It made my skin break even more, visible effects after about 2 uses.</li>
            <li>My favorite tonic.</li>
            <li>and I love what it does for my skin.  </li>
            <li>There are better options out there.</li>
            <li>After reading so many rave reviews, I thought it was time I did something to reduce the size of my pores.</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It feels softer and smoother as well, which I love.</li>
            <li>This has become one of my favorite toners.</li>
            <li>Give it a try, I love it (I use it after I wash my face with a foam cleanser).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternatives?</li>
            <li>When I do, I will update this post with any differences between the authentic product and what I got today.  </li>
            <li>Used up most of the bottle and used it once per day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep trying it, because its so cute &amp; I like etude house...</li>
            <li>I LOVE this toner.</li>
            <li>The bottle is cute, but I thought this bottle would have the pump applicator.</li>
            <li>Love this product :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d order this again for sure.</li>
            <li>and it works okay for me</li>
            <li>but I am looking into something more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>but I love the package design</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really cute ^-^</li>
            <li>It contains isopropyl alcohol but it doesn&#x27;t sting nor does it smell strong, it smells very light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love that it balances my skin&#x27;s PH, as this is a huge benefit to helping maintain the moisture barrier.</li>
            <li>I bought two bottles and so far the product has been great.</li>
            <li>Great toner for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very quick and reliable.</li>
            <li>It has a strong scent and stings.</li>
            <li>But worked fine.</li>
            <li>My husband has huge pores and would do a nose strip every 2 weeks</li>
            <li>It really feels nice when you use it--</li>
            <li>(the original formula)</li>
            <li>First of all, the packaging is adorable.</li>
            <li>The one good thing is that when you use it, you can see on the cotton pad that there is almost always a little gunk/discoloration even when you think your skin is clean, so as a cleanser for your pores, it seems to be effective.</li>
            <li>So far my favorite toner :)</li>
            <li>Make use you wash face clean before using toner.</li>
            <li>However, right after i stop using it, right away my skin looked better already.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not noticeably special.</li>
            <li>This toner is great because it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, it dries quickly without feeling sticky, has a light pleasant smell, and I haven&#x27;t had a single zit since I started using this 4 weeks ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more gentle for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since before my teenage years!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read people say how much they love the smell of this product, but mine has no scent</li>
            <li>It does not smell like alcohol, in fact it smells really fresh and light.</li>
            <li>Pretty strong alcohol scent though.  </li>
            <li>i have mild acne and oily skin</li>
            <li>my causing mild but visible inflammation.</li>
            <li>But adore this product very much!</li>
            <li>The ingredients are gentle on the skin and its easy to remove residues from skin.  </li>
            <li>I guess if you have dry skin, this is good for you, but this makes my face SO oily, like I&#x27;ve been sweating.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing my pores look smaller</li>
            <li>i like it and will see if this toner is worth $18 and the smell is not overbearing like some toners can be........</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel fresh when I use it.</li>
            <li>gives you a fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>If you want a more natural toner don&#x27;t get this one unless you want to smell like vodka.</li>
            <li>skin texture is very noticeably finer, my pores are significantly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I started using it right away when it arrived two days ago.</li>
            <li>It really does clean my pores.</li>
            <li>I use this about twice a day as a toner, and it really makes my oily face feel clean.</li>
            <li>I would suspect some of the less satisfied reviews of most of the Korean products are from people using them standalone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it every evening and once in the morning (if I remember to); it has a slight clean, astringent scent and feels nice when</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>This toner is great if you have oily skin because it is strong enough to help reign in the oil but not so harsh that it dries your skin out.</li>
            <li>this makes me feel fresh and clean so far</li>
            <li>I am completely impressed and have already recommended the Wonder Pore Freshner to my bestie who is dealing with some major breakouts lately.</li>
            <li>I think this product really does help with clearing and minimizing your pores!</li>
            <li>This bottle will definitely last me a long time and for the price I feel it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely repurchase this!</li>
            <li>I was a bit dissatisfied at first</li>
            <li>You can see the benefits from the first use.</li>
            <li>I did notice more sebum control and smaller pores.</li>
            <li>Well I just washed my face with it and it smells like straight alcohol!</li>
            <li>I will probably try another toner and maybe come back to this if I can&#x27;t find anything better.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it advertises.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying to get rid of my blackheads since they first started appearing on my nose at the onset of puberty, with a litany of mud masks, charcoal scrubs, facial steaming, and pore strips (which are probably the most rubbish of all the purported pore cleansing products).</li>
            <li>As for my pores, they are simultaneously looking smaller, but more gunk is coming out of them.</li>
            <li>This toner seem to work good on the first few weeks.</li>
            <li>Smells a little &amp;#34;alcoholy&amp;#34; other than that great :)</li>
            <li>Works well even on my super sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Recieved it pretty fast</li>
            <li>It is gentle, feels really good on the skin, and my pores actually look smaller since I started using it.</li>
            <li>I was expecting some really tingly stuff to clean my pores, but it was as soft and gentle as water.</li>
            <li>I can barely keep from touching my skin, it is baby soft.</li>
            <li>Used it to balance the pH level of my skin and minimize large pores.</li>
            <li>Kind of a mess.</li>
            <li>This product feels very nice going on my face, it definitely cuts down on the oil and shine on my face as well as prepping my face for the rest of my routine.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, it doesn&#x27;t burn, and it makes my skin feel really fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my mom, she has huge open pores and told me she loves it and that it had helped her control oil and close pores.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really minimize pores.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel the alcohol so in that way it was gentle.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my husband, his skin is much oilier.</li>
            <li>and I really like the pump design.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do much, I use it as a pH adjusting toner.</li>
            <li>There has been soooo much hype about this product.</li>
            <li>This one really does work for me.</li>
            <li>Item as described packaged nicely, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It really helps control shines and oiliness</li>
            <li>Gag-worthy, really.</li>
            <li>They also gave me 3 free samples of different Korean products.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin with a very oily t-zone, and I see results after using it for about 6 days.</li>
            <li>I just got this today, and I&#x27;m sure it would have been fantastic, but the bottle was open on the inside of the package, soaking through a lot of my other bought items.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend for anyone that is looking to try a toner for the first time or wanting to try something new.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any significant change with the size of my pores but it did overall leave my face looking brighter and feeling softer.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure it was this product that caused my skin break out because I also just changed my other skin care products.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on my sensitive skin, and it helps with clearing my acne and redness from acne scars.</li>
            <li>After the first day of use, I noticed my large pores were definitely smaller and much cleaner looking!</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily with large pores, acne prone, and sensitive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the smell can be off putting to some people, I&#x27;m okay with it because my previous toner was way worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The big bottle will last you about a year :)</li>
            <li>and yea highly recommend &amp;#62;0&amp;#60;</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>my skin feels so soft and looks much clearer.</li>
            <li>I was hoping so much this product would help clear my skin.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that it arrived slightly uncapped so I lost about 10ml of product, but luckily it shipped VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>This product may work for people with normal skin but for those who are acne prone, please take this warning into consideration before purchasing.</li>
            <li>Anyone like me knows you can only find anti-aging or anti-acne, nothing in the US that claims to do both is worth a damn.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not sure how these got such good reviews.</li>
            <li>Any tiny blemishes left are easily covered with make up and clear up fast.</li>
            <li>I am having less pimples after I started to use this product! :)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really seem different from any other toner - it did clean my skin pretty well</li>
            <li>though I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in my pores as compared to other brands (the porefessional).</li>
            <li>and i live in Hawaii.....</li>
            <li>I did receive the new 10 in 1 version instead of the 7 in 1.</li>
            <li>I think I would recommend it to anyone looking for a new toner.</li>
            <li>I have SUPER dry, skin with breakouts and medium sized pores on my t-zone area for reference.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure I needed one, wasn&#x27;t sure they did anything, and most of the American brands I tried were too harsh and actually made my skin worse.</li>
            <li>(and they weren&#x27;t big in the first place)&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my opinion I don&#x27;t really like it because I have skin that barely brakes out</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and bright and although I&#x27;m not sure if my pores are smaller, they&#x27;re definitely cleaner and therefore much less noticeable.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;oreal has a pretty decent toner (similar to this but lacking the pore reducing benefits) and it&#x27;s only 5 bucks.</li>
            <li>and I notice that it has really reduced the number of white heads that I have.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this toner was not harsh at all.</li>
            <li>My pores are nearly invisible, and crud has purged from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised to see this on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After so much hype from different bloggers, I thought I give it a try</li>
            <li>Its only been 2 days, but I really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Not for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>A bit too much alcohol in it for my skin, made it red after application</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for several weeks and haven&#x27;t really seen any difference at all in my pores.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>It is not harsh or drying at all.</li>
            <li>Leaves face feeling soft but not oily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s work ok but not amazing.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin, not dry or oily.</li>
            <li>however I have been using this for a month and have noticed a very small difference in the size of my pores, maybe it would work better with a complimenting pore minimizing lotion, serum ect.</li>
            <li>I am very skeptical and did not believe the product did what it did but glad to say that all the rave about everything it does is true indeed.</li>
            <li>and this is the first time that I had a strong gut feeling that I got a fake product.  </li>
            <li>In the last few weeks using it morning and night, I have noticed break outs decrease significantly.</li>
            <li>but so little product is used each time that it may be worth it), or silkworm cocoon.</li>
            <li>First and only toner that didn&#x27;t dry my skin out!</li>
            <li>However, you would get the same effect from using a classic rosewater/witch hazel toner and I haven&#x27;t seen any overall difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I exclusively use Korean skincare and makeup and generally like Etude House</li>
            <li>actually it surprise me how well this product works,help my acne skin allot, clear my pore like it say</li>
            <li>There are equal chemical toners here in America like rapid clear.</li>
            <li>cuz help clear up my back acne</li>
            <li>Be especially cautious if you have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It may seem pricey, but how much money have I already spent on junk remedies?</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and glowing,  foundation is unnecessary,  and I&#x27;m not a grease monkey even though I put so many layers on now.  </li>
            <li>My cotton ball was 100% clean after wiping - seriously?  </li>
            <li>My pores aren&#x27;t as large, and I definitely see less acne than I had before.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Really great on face makes skin smoother and softer</li>
            <li> Packaging and shipping was great.</li>
            <li> I understand even a great product is not for everybody when it comes to skincare products.</li>
            <li> This product, regardless of the great reviews, are not for me.</li>
            <li> and there are no problems there which is great.  </li>
            <li> My skin is just so happy.</li>
            <li> It smells like the product contains witch hazel which is great for soothing skin and clearing blemishes.</li>
            <li> Work great.</li>
            <li> I think it would be great for those with oily or combination skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say more!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, also purchased the foaming cleanser from the Etude House Wonder Pore line!</li>
            <li> Nice toner!</li>
            <li> This makes a good pH adjusting toner for me.  </li>
            <li> so I feel it is a good value.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of all the good reviews it has gotten but trust me.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but it didn&#x27;t make a difference in my skin...</li>
            <li> Product seems good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good...</li>
            <li> Shipping was good, but felt like the toner did nothing for my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Etude house products are great; reasonably priced and awesome quality.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing - I will buy again</li>
            <li> I have zero irritation with this product and it&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
            <li> This toner is not as drying as many others, but it does a great job of removing residual gunk from my face after cleansing.</li>
            <li> I am now prepared to buy more of the Etude House products because this one has worked out so well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really refreshing too!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this!</li>
            <li> Refreshing and nice scent!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Not as amazing as some say  Update:</li>
            <li> Amazon has amazing customer service, btw.  </li>
            <li> I was using another Korean toner, which was nice</li>
            <li> My skin feels nice when it dries too.</li>
            <li> Feels nice.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> Nice toner</li>
            <li> It did come in its own box, which had a tape seal over that.</li>
            <li> but I found it takes my makeup off nicely..</li>
            <li> Great Great Great product I have combination T-zone face with large stubborn pores, and this product does minimize pores without drying out face, and also a a nice fresh scent ( no me</li>
            <li> Love love !</li>
            <li> and I love love the results I&#x27;m getting!</li>
            <li> I heard good things about this being good for large pores and blackheads</li>
            <li> This product has a good PH balancing effect and helps clean off any excess oil/makeup/sweat/etc.</li>
            <li> So great to get it at a very comparable price in the States!</li>
            <li> So wait, my skin is clear, smooth, looks great, feels great, and no adverse reactions?</li>
            <li> This one is just lovely.</li>
            <li> but this one is better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, keep it in the fridge and it will close your pores even better.</li>
            <li> but I think the product is still doing it thing and needs more time to get rid of the blackheads.</li>
            <li> The best toner I&#x27;ve used compared to American drugstore toners!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> It made my skin break even more, visible effects after about 2 uses.</li>
            <li> My favorite tonic.</li>
            <li> and I love what it does for my skin.  </li>
            <li> There are better options out there.</li>
            <li> After reading so many rave reviews, I thought it was time I did something to reduce the size of my pores.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It feels softer and smoother as well, which I love.</li>
            <li> This has become one of my favorite toners.</li>
            <li> Give it a try, I love it (I use it after I wash my face with a foam cleanser).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternatives?</li>
            <li> When I do, I will update this post with any differences between the authentic product and what I got today.  </li>
            <li> Used up most of the bottle and used it once per day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep trying it, because its so cute &amp; I like etude house...</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toner.</li>
            <li> The bottle is cute, but I thought this bottle would have the pump applicator.</li>
            <li> Love this product :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d order this again for sure.</li>
            <li> and it works okay for me</li>
            <li> but I am looking into something more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> but I love the package design</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really cute ^-^</li>
            <li> It contains isopropyl alcohol but it doesn&#x27;t sting nor does it smell strong, it smells very light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love that it balances my skin&#x27;s PH, as this is a huge benefit to helping maintain the moisture barrier.</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles and so far the product has been great.</li>
            <li> Great toner for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very quick and reliable.</li>
            <li> It has a strong scent and stings.</li>
            <li> But worked fine.</li>
            <li> My husband has huge pores and would do a nose strip every 2 weeks</li>
            <li> It really feels nice when you use it--</li>
            <li> (the original formula)</li>
            <li> First of all, the packaging is adorable.</li>
            <li> The one good thing is that when you use it, you can see on the cotton pad that there is almost always a little gunk/discoloration even when you think your skin is clean, so as a cleanser for your pores, it seems to be effective.</li>
            <li> So far my favorite toner :)</li>
            <li> Make use you wash face clean before using toner.</li>
            <li> However, right after i stop using it, right away my skin looked better already.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not noticeably special.</li>
            <li> This toner is great because it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, it dries quickly without feeling sticky, has a light pleasant smell, and I haven&#x27;t had a single zit since I started using this 4 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more gentle for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since before my teenage years!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read people say how much they love the smell of this product, but mine has no scent</li>
            <li> It does not smell like alcohol, in fact it smells really fresh and light.</li>
            <li> Pretty strong alcohol scent though.  </li>
            <li> i have mild acne and oily skin</li>
            <li> my causing mild but visible inflammation.</li>
            <li> But adore this product very much!</li>
            <li> The ingredients are gentle on the skin and its easy to remove residues from skin.  </li>
            <li> I guess if you have dry skin, this is good for you, but this makes my face SO oily, like I&#x27;ve been sweating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing my pores look smaller</li>
            <li> i like it and will see if this toner is worth $18 and the smell is not overbearing like some toners can be........</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel fresh when I use it.</li>
            <li> gives you a fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> If you want a more natural toner don&#x27;t get this one unless you want to smell like vodka.</li>
            <li> skin texture is very noticeably finer, my pores are significantly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I started using it right away when it arrived two days ago.</li>
            <li> It really does clean my pores.</li>
            <li> I use this about twice a day as a toner, and it really makes my oily face feel clean.</li>
            <li> I would suspect some of the less satisfied reviews of most of the Korean products are from people using them standalone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it every evening and once in the morning (if I remember to); it has a slight clean, astringent scent and feels nice when</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> This toner is great if you have oily skin because it is strong enough to help reign in the oil but not so harsh that it dries your skin out.</li>
            <li> this makes me feel fresh and clean so far</li>
            <li> I am completely impressed and have already recommended the Wonder Pore Freshner to my bestie who is dealing with some major breakouts lately.</li>
            <li> I think this product really does help with clearing and minimizing your pores!</li>
            <li> This bottle will definitely last me a long time and for the price I feel it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely repurchase this!</li>
            <li> I was a bit dissatisfied at first</li>
            <li> You can see the benefits from the first use.</li>
            <li> I did notice more sebum control and smaller pores.</li>
            <li> Well I just washed my face with it and it smells like straight alcohol!</li>
            <li> I will probably try another toner and maybe come back to this if I can&#x27;t find anything better.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it advertises.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying to get rid of my blackheads since they first started appearing on my nose at the onset of puberty, with a litany of mud masks, charcoal scrubs, facial steaming, and pore strips (which are probably the most rubbish of all the purported pore cleansing products).</li>
            <li> As for my pores, they are simultaneously looking smaller, but more gunk is coming out of them.</li>
            <li> This toner seem to work good on the first few weeks.</li>
            <li> Smells a little &amp;#34;alcoholy&amp;#34; other than that great :)</li>
            <li> Works well even on my super sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Recieved it pretty fast</li>
            <li> It is gentle, feels really good on the skin, and my pores actually look smaller since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting some really tingly stuff to clean my pores, but it was as soft and gentle as water.</li>
            <li> I can barely keep from touching my skin, it is baby soft.</li>
            <li> Used it to balance the pH level of my skin and minimize large pores.</li>
            <li> Kind of a mess.</li>
            <li> This product feels very nice going on my face, it definitely cuts down on the oil and shine on my face as well as prepping my face for the rest of my routine.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, it doesn&#x27;t burn, and it makes my skin feel really fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mom, she has huge open pores and told me she loves it and that it had helped her control oil and close pores.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really minimize pores.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t feel the alcohol so in that way it was gentle.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my husband, his skin is much oilier.</li>
            <li> and I really like the pump design.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much, I use it as a pH adjusting toner.</li>
            <li> There has been soooo much hype about this product.</li>
            <li> This one really does work for me.</li>
            <li> Item as described packaged nicely, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It really helps control shines and oiliness</li>
            <li> Gag-worthy, really.</li>
            <li> They also gave me 3 free samples of different Korean products.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with a very oily t-zone, and I see results after using it for about 6 days.</li>
            <li> I just got this today, and I&#x27;m sure it would have been fantastic, but the bottle was open on the inside of the package, soaking through a lot of my other bought items.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend for anyone that is looking to try a toner for the first time or wanting to try something new.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any significant change with the size of my pores but it did overall leave my face looking brighter and feeling softer.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure it was this product that caused my skin break out because I also just changed my other skin care products.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on my sensitive skin, and it helps with clearing my acne and redness from acne scars.</li>
            <li> After the first day of use, I noticed my large pores were definitely smaller and much cleaner looking!</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily with large pores, acne prone, and sensitive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the smell can be off putting to some people, I&#x27;m okay with it because my previous toner was way worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The big bottle will last you about a year :)</li>
            <li> and yea highly recommend &amp;#62;0&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> my skin feels so soft and looks much clearer.</li>
            <li> I was hoping so much this product would help clear my skin.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that it arrived slightly uncapped so I lost about 10ml of product, but luckily it shipped VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> This product may work for people with normal skin but for those who are acne prone, please take this warning into consideration before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Anyone like me knows you can only find anti-aging or anti-acne, nothing in the US that claims to do both is worth a damn.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure how these got such good reviews.</li>
            <li> Any tiny blemishes left are easily covered with make up and clear up fast.</li>
            <li> I am having less pimples after I started to use this product! :)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really seem different from any other toner - it did clean my skin pretty well</li>
            <li> though I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in my pores as compared to other brands (the porefessional).</li>
            <li> and i live in Hawaii.....</li>
            <li> I did receive the new 10 in 1 version instead of the 7 in 1.</li>
            <li> I think I would recommend it to anyone looking for a new toner.</li>
            <li> I have SUPER dry, skin with breakouts and medium sized pores on my t-zone area for reference.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure I needed one, wasn&#x27;t sure they did anything, and most of the American brands I tried were too harsh and actually made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> (and they weren&#x27;t big in the first place)&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my opinion I don&#x27;t really like it because I have skin that barely brakes out</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and bright and although I&#x27;m not sure if my pores are smaller, they&#x27;re definitely cleaner and therefore much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal has a pretty decent toner (similar to this but lacking the pore reducing benefits) and it&#x27;s only 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> and I notice that it has really reduced the number of white heads that I have.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this toner was not harsh at all.</li>
            <li> My pores are nearly invisible, and crud has purged from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised to see this on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After so much hype from different bloggers, I thought I give it a try</li>
            <li> Its only been 2 days, but I really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Not for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> A bit too much alcohol in it for my skin, made it red after application</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for several weeks and haven&#x27;t really seen any difference at all in my pores.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> It is not harsh or drying at all.</li>
            <li> Leaves face feeling soft but not oily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s work ok but not amazing.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin, not dry or oily.</li>
            <li> however I have been using this for a month and have noticed a very small difference in the size of my pores, maybe it would work better with a complimenting pore minimizing lotion, serum ect.</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical and did not believe the product did what it did but glad to say that all the rave about everything it does is true indeed.</li>
            <li> and this is the first time that I had a strong gut feeling that I got a fake product.  </li>
            <li> In the last few weeks using it morning and night, I have noticed break outs decrease significantly.</li>
            <li> but so little product is used each time that it may be worth it), or silkworm cocoon.</li>
            <li> First and only toner that didn&#x27;t dry my skin out!</li>
            <li> However, you would get the same effect from using a classic rosewater/witch hazel toner and I haven&#x27;t seen any overall difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I exclusively use Korean skincare and makeup and generally like Etude House</li>
            <li> actually it surprise me how well this product works,help my acne skin allot, clear my pore like it say</li>
            <li> There are equal chemical toners here in America like rapid clear.</li>
            <li> cuz help clear up my back acne</li>
            <li> Be especially cautious if you have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It may seem pricey, but how much money have I already spent on junk remedies?</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and glowing,  foundation is unnecessary,  and I&#x27;m not a grease monkey even though I put so many layers on now.  </li>
            <li> My cotton ball was 100% clean after wiping - seriously?  </li>
            <li> My pores aren&#x27;t as large, and I definitely see less acne than I had before.</li>
            <li> For reference, I chose the 250 ml from the drop down menu (not the 250 ml NEW).  </li>
            <li> I could only use this for a couple days before my skin started getting really dry.</li>
            <li> I spent too many hours today searching online for ways to spot a fake Wonder Pore (couldn&#x27;t find anything).  </li>
            <li> As I mentioned before, other products shrunk my pores so much that they trapped the oil and dirt</li>
            <li> When I apply it to a cotton ball and sweep it over my skin (in the t-zone, particularly), I can see the little black dots of crud that have come up from deep within my pores on the cotton after I&#x27;m done (eewww!).  </li>
            <li> More than half of the bottle was Empty!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Unlike American toners which dry out the skin, Korean toners help to add back moister and prep skin for other products.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a crazy difference as suggested by many users.</li>
            <li> Came in a quicker then expected (a week later).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the fence about toners for a long time.</li>
            <li> Like much better than the expensive TV brand we were using!</li>
            <li> smells like alcohol and my skin feels so dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> Clinique has toners for oily or dry skin</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> The toner did not have a sealing cap or lid which makes me believe that the product is not new as advertised by the seller.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that it would be very helpful for my sensitive face, but after reading other reviews I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Personally I prefer less alcohol-y toners.</li>
            <li> use this after my double or single cleansing (Face shop rice water and Tony moly egg pore soap) as a toner, on a cotton round.</li>
            <li> Thankfully only a little escaped.</li>
            <li> I expected to recieve the 7 in 1 bottle, but instead I recieved the 10 in 1 bottle.</li>
            <li> (my skin is kinda rough)</li>
            <li> They helped to make my pores look smaller but the dirt and oil were still trapped inside.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is burning my skin like other toners that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Extremely dissatisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> There are other sites that you can get this though</li>
            <li> What else can I say that has not been said from other reviewers.</li>
            <li> The ribbon image on the front of the bottle is very pink, but in all photos I&#x27;ve seen (including on Etude House&#x27;s website)</li>
            <li> Its an average toner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a total Korean beauty kick lately and this product is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I use it before my acid toners to cut down on wait time in my routine.</li>
            <li> It has also helped tone down my oily face, and my pores look healthier.</li>
            <li> Breakouts have slowed down since using.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s from &amp;#34;Etude House&amp;#34; and all, but try some other stuff than this!</li>
            <li> 90% of the bottle is gone and a few other things I bought were damaged a bit.</li>
            <li> Though I do have to mention the slight smell it brought.</li>
            <li> I also feel like my skin gets less oily during the day when I use this.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using it, my face is noticeably smoother and less porous.</li>
            <li> I order this product, as my bottle was slightly unscrewed so some of the contents leaked out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about half of the 250ml bottle in one month, so I will be reordering soon.</li>
            <li> Exfoliate every few days with Freeman Charcoal Black Sugar Dual Mask Scrub, Cure Aqua Gel (also pricey</li>
            <li> I have been using the wonder pore for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 35, oily skin (greasy grimy gopher guts in the summer), acne prone, dark spots, and maybe the beginnings of some small wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt cleaner and tighter without being dried out or irritated in any way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sham.</li>
            <li> ITS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gunna stick to my gnarly whale green tea toner.</li>
            <li> My enlarged pores have shrunk and I also have less blackheads!</li>
            <li> I also did not expect the bottle to be so small, but that was my fault as I did not see the price.</li>
            <li> So when i got this i expected it to help heal my acne...not make it worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My nose, chin, and cheeks are usually a minefield of clogged pores,  bumps, and roughness.</li>
            <li> No more.</li>
            <li> After day two, all of the redness that I usually have in my cheeks and t-zone is GONE.</li>
            <li> Am I just using it wrong or is this product totally not for me.</li>
            <li> It arrived leaking and messy in the package - yuck!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product works because I just began to use it</li>
            <li> When I received it, it was already leaking due to the poor packaging.</li>
            <li> My t zone has the worst clogging, but while it hasn&#x27;t completely unclogged, the pores are definitely smaller and clearer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was the other way around.</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of items on Amazon - I mean A LOT -</li>
            <li> This was a big waste of money :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not happy to find alcohol in this toner and not sure if it lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li> I stopped using after two tries because I am afraid this is unregulated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d seen this toner on Amazon months ago but after using a very expensive toner from Mary Kay that actually made my skin worse, I chickened out of using toners anymore.</li>
            <li> Zip... except for making me break out which is even worse.</li>
            <li> but alas, it did not.  </li>
            <li> Unless am reading it wrong but it seem my product arrived with an expiration date of 6/17/2014 .</li>
            <li> But the product itself is a no match for me, sadly.</li>
            <li> Alcohol as the second ingredient...just awful for your skin!  </li>
            <li> It was also in the box  (with a see-through front) facing the wrong direction.</li>
            <li> And its expensive...</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad but not good either.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately this product was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> I got my 10 in 1 Wonder Pore (8.45 oz / 250 ml) today and am very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This one is just lovely. I was expecting some really tingly stuff to clean my pores, but it was as soft and gentle as water. I was using another Korean toner, which was nice but this one is better. In the last few weeks using it morning and night, I have noticed break outs decrease significantly. My t zone has the worst clogging, but while it hasn&#x27;t completely unclogged, the pores are definitely smaller and clearer. Any tiny blemishes left are easily covered with make up and clear up fast. Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> although i only just got this two days and only used it three times i already notice a difference. my skin feels so soft and looks much clearer. i have mild acne and oily skin this makes me feel fresh and clean so far i like it and will see if this toner is worth $18 and the smell is not overbearing like some toners can be........It took three days to ship and i live in Hawaii..... i will update my review in about a month</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles and so far the product has been great. However, both bottles I received were passed the expiration date, which is upsetting.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing - I will buy again</li>
            <li> I bought this after using an American toner (Neutrogena) that stung my eyes and nose. It&#x27;s much more gentle for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the smell can be off putting to some people, I&#x27;m okay with it because my previous toner was way worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-really gentle&lt;br /&gt;-pores shrunk  (and they weren&#x27;t big in the first place)&lt;br /&gt;-not drying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-kinda pricey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would but this again, but probably from Etudes website. So far my favorite toner :)</li>
            <li> Love,love,love,love,LOVE! I can&#x27;t say more!! It&#x27;s amazing my pores look smaller and my face absorbs  my serums and creams like silk. Will definitely repurchase.  Though I do have to mention the slight smell it brought. It wasn&#x27;t bad but not good either.</li>
            <li> I like this for what I use it for. Pretty strong alcohol scent though.  This makes a good pH adjusting toner for me.  I use it before my acid toners to cut down on wait time in my routine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s work ok but not amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought these in Korea. So great to get it at a very comparable price in the States!</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel refreshed for awhile :D</li>
            <li> It really does clean my pores. I like it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Came in a quicker then expected (a week later). But adore this product very much!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, keep it in the fridge and it will close your pores even better.</li>
            <li> I think this product really does help with clearing and minimizing your pores! I saw results instantly. I have been using this product for about two weeks now and I notice that it has really reduced the number of white heads that I have. I still have big pores and blackheads but I think the product is still doing it thing and needs more time to get rid of the blackheads. I would recommend this product if you have a lot of white heads. My skin feels nice when it dries too. Not sticky at all and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is burning my skin like other toners that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Used it to balance the pH level of my skin and minimize large pores. Didn&#x27;t really minimize pores.  It doesn&#x27;t really seem different from any other toner - it did clean my skin pretty well and I didn&#x27;t feel the alcohol so in that way it was gentle.</li>
            <li> The best toner I&#x27;ve used compared to American drugstore toners! Helped shrink my pores and keep my pores dirt-free. My only issue is that it arrived slightly uncapped so I lost about 10ml of product, but luckily it shipped VERY quickly. It contains isopropyl alcohol but it doesn&#x27;t sting nor does it smell strong, it smells very light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical and did not believe the product did what it did but glad to say that all the rave about everything it does is true indeed.</li>
            <li> This toner is great if you have oily skin because it is strong enough to help reign in the oil but not so harsh that it dries your skin out. I didn&#x27;t notice any significant change with the size of my pores but it did overall leave my face looking brighter and feeling softer. It&#x27;s also great value and I would recommend for anyone that is looking to try a toner for the first time or wanting to try something new.</li>
            <li> I have seen great reviews on this product and decided to give it a try. Within a week or two I noticed a difference in my pores and complexion. I have sensitive skin and this toner was not harsh at all. This bottle will definitely last me a long time and for the price I feel it&#x27;s a great deal. I recommend applying a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> I could only use this for a couple days before my skin started getting really dry. I gave it to my husband, his skin is much oilier.</li>
            <li> Really great on face makes skin smoother and softer</li>
            <li> To the people who see the bottom and think its an expiration date it is actually the manufacturing date.</li>
            <li> I just got this today, and I&#x27;m sure it would have been fantastic, but the bottle was open on the inside of the package, soaking through a lot of my other bought items. 90% of the bottle is gone and a few other things I bought were damaged a bit.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. It did nothing.</li>
            <li> Unless am reading it wrong but it seem my product arrived with an expiration date of 6/17/2014 . Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Works well even on my super sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Feels nice. Smells nice.</li>
            <li> This freshens my face and prepares it for my skin care regimen. I love that it balances my skin&#x27;s PH, as this is a huge benefit to helping maintain the moisture barrier. My pores have shrunk in size too. I will absolutely repurchase this!</li>
            <li> I expected to recieve the 7 in 1 bottle, but instead I recieved the 10 in 1 bottle. I was a bit dissatisfied at first but I heard that they are essentially the same. I also did not expect the bottle to be so small, but that was my fault as I did not see the price. Recieved it pretty fast so I guess that makes up for it.</li>
            <li> Meh. It&#x27;s okay. Not as amazing as some say  Update: Second time I bought this. I&#x27;m going to give it another try, for the price. I got the bigger bottle this time and I really like the pump design.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much, I use it as a pH adjusting toner.</li>
            <li> Packaging and shipping was great. But the product itself is a no match for me, sadly. I have combination acne prone skin. I was hoping so much this product would help clear my skin. Unfortunately it was the other way around. It made my skin break even more, visible effects after about 2 uses. I wasn&#x27;t too sure it was this product that caused my skin break out because I also just changed my other skin care products. However, right after i stop using it, right away my skin looked better already. I understand even a great product is not for everybody when it comes to skincare products. This product, regardless of the great reviews, are not for me. Probably because the amount of alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> My favorite tonic. It has helped to control blackheads, oiliness and tighten pores. You can see the benefits from the first use.</li>
            <li> There has been soooo much hype about this product. So when i got this i expected it to help heal my acne...not make it worse. This product may work for people with normal skin but for those who are acne prone, please take this warning into consideration before purchasing. My sister and i both broke out almost immediately. This was a big waste of money :(</li>
            <li> I used it once and the next morning i had breakout and rashes all over the face. :X :X</li>
            <li> actually it surprise me how well this product works,help my acne skin allot, clear my pore like it say and yea highly recommend &amp;#62;0&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> I have been using the wonder pore for a few weeks and I love what it does for my skin.  I have very sensitive skin and there are no problems there which is great.  I will buy this product again and again. Love love !</li>
            <li> This is the best toner I have ever used. It makes my skin feel fresh when I use it. Also it&#x27;s not drying at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a recent Korean skincare convert. I wish I had tried sooner. I&#x27;m 35, oily skin (greasy grimy gopher guts in the summer), acne prone, dark spots, and maybe the beginnings of some small wrinkles around my eyes.  Anyone like me knows you can only find anti-aging or anti-acne, nothing in the US that claims to do both is worth a damn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that my review is with Wonder Pore as the toner step in a 10-step Korean skincare routine.  I would suspect some of the less satisfied reviews of most of the Korean products are from people using them standalone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this is not sealed, and some product was lost on delivery from a loosened cap in transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this after my double or single cleansing (Face shop rice water and Tony moly egg pore soap) as a toner, on a cotton round. It is nothing like US toners. Zero stinging, no redness, drying, or peeling. This puts your skin pH back where it needs to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nose, chin, and cheeks are usually a minefield of clogged pores,  bumps, and roughness. No more. I can barely keep from touching my skin, it is baby soft. My pores are nearly invisible, and crud has purged from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the spots on my face are pre-korean routine and are healing. I had 1 bump on my chin that vanished in a day or two - this never happens.  My skin is soft and glowing,  foundation is unnecessary,  and I&#x27;m not a grease monkey even though I put so many layers on now.  My skin is just so happy.</li>
            <li> First and only toner that didn&#x27;t dry my skin out! I like it very much. I use it after the &amp;#34;whipipng foaming&amp;#34; cleanser</li>
            <li> smells like alcohol and my skin feels so dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the fence about toners for a long time. Wasn&#x27;t sure I needed one, wasn&#x27;t sure they did anything, and most of the American brands I tried were too harsh and actually made my skin worse. My skin is very oily with large pores, acne prone, and sensitive. This one really does work for me. It is gentle, feels really good on the skin, and my pores actually look smaller since I started using it. I also feel like my skin gets less oily during the day when I use this. It seems like this bottle will last me awhile too so I feel it is a good value. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Item as described packaged nicely, fast shipping. Nice toner</li>
            <li> Extremely dissatisfied with my purchase. I received a defective product in the mail today. The toner did not have a sealing cap or lid which makes me believe that the product is not new as advertised by the seller.</li>
            <li> It actually works! My husband has huge pores and would do a nose strip every 2 weeks but now he only has to do it once a month. He says he&lt;br /&gt;definitely sees a difference.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are gentle on the skin and its easy to remove residues from skin.  I&#x27;m just not happy to find alcohol in this toner and not sure if it lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li> Wow. I&#x27;d seen this toner on Amazon months ago but after using a very expensive toner from Mary Kay that actually made my skin worse, I chickened out of using toners anymore. Last week on a whim, I decided that I&#x27;d give toner a try again and Amazon matched me up with this product from Etude House yet again. I was skeptical that it would be very helpful for my sensitive face, but after reading other reviews I decided to give it a try. I started using it right away when it arrived two days ago. I could instantly feel a difference. My skin felt cleaner and tighter without being dried out or irritated in any way. After the first day of use, I noticed my large pores were definitely smaller and much cleaner looking! After day two, all of the redness that I usually have in my cheeks and t-zone is GONE. So wait, my skin is clear, smooth, looks great, feels great, and no adverse reactions? I almost don&#x27;t know how to react. I have literally never tried any sort of cleanser that worked out this well. I am completely impressed and have already recommended the Wonder Pore Freshner to my bestie who is dealing with some major breakouts lately. I am now prepared to buy more of the Etude House products because this one has worked out so well! Thank you, Etude House, for the renewed confidence! My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since before my teenage years!</li>
            <li> Alcohol as the second ingredient...just awful for your skin!  There are better options out there. Clinique has toners for oily or dry skin and I also like Derma E Soothing Toner and Evenly Radiant Brightening Toner</li>
            <li> I did notice more sebum control and smaller pores. Would recommend to use a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> Am I just using it wrong or is this product totally not for me. After reading so many rave reviews, I thought it was time I did something to reduce the size of my pores. However, this did nothing for me. Nada. Zip... except for making me break out which is even worse. Not a product for everyone. Be especially cautious if you have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> ALL WAYS CHECK THE EXPIRATION DATE. IT ALSO HAS A USE OF ONLY 12 MONTHS.</li>
            <li> Smells a little &amp;#34;alcoholy&amp;#34; other than that great :)</li>
            <li> I discovered this when I lived abroad in South Korea. There are other sites that you can get this though but it will cost nearly double. I was so surprised to see this on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff. There is no alcohol. Since I&#x27;ve been using it (over a year now) I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is not oily anymore and my pores shrunk. It&#x27;s really refreshing too! Highly recommend. The big bottle will last you about a year :)</li>
            <li> Amazing! Reminds me of the discontinued Neutrogena AHA/BHA toner. I have zero irritation with this product and it&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
            <li> More than half of the bottle was Empty!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells and feels great! I use this about twice a day as a toner, and it really makes my oily face feel clean. My skin is softer and I feel like my redness is going away too. It really feels nice when you use it--gives you a fresh feeling. I&#x27;m using this alongside an exfoliating face scrub.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using it, my face is noticeably smoother and less porous. It feels softer and smoother as well, which I love. I use it every evening and once in the morning (if I remember to); it has a slight clean, astringent scent and feels nice when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again- if I ever run out! The bottle has lasted quite a while as you only need to use a tiny amount!</li>
            <li> After so much hype from different bloggers, I thought I give it a try and I just got it today. When I received it, it was already leaking due to the poor packaging. Well I just washed my face with it and it smells like straight alcohol! Since I threw away the package it came with I can&#x27;t return it so I have to stick to it.  If you want a more natural toner don&#x27;t get this one unless you want to smell like vodka.</li>
            <li> This has become one of my favorite toners. My daughters and I use it. What else can I say that has not been said from other reviewers. I have already purchased a second bottle.</li>
            <li> For the longest time I have been a regular user, and buyer, of Clinique&#x27;s Clarifying Lotion for my combination/oily skin.  It really helps control shines and oiliness however it is quite expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Etude house products are great; reasonably priced and awesome quality. Give it a try, I love it (I use it after I wash my face with a foam cleanser).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternatives? L&#x27;oreal has a pretty decent toner (similar to this but lacking the pore reducing benefits) and it&#x27;s only 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. It works as a toner, and a wake up call but that&#x27;s it. My face is combination. I dabbed onto my face after my wash and by the end of the day, my face is just an oil stick. My pores didn&#x27;t get smaller, blackheads didn&#x27;t go out, and it worsened my acne as well. Guys, don&#x27;t buy it. It&#x27;s a sham. I bought it because of all the good reviews it has gotten but trust me. ITS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. I know it&#x27;s from &amp;#34;Etude House&amp;#34; and all, but try some other stuff than this! Especially their lipsticks, but that&#x27;s not the point! Please, do not get it.</li>
            <li> Its an average toner. I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and it&#x27;s not noticeably special. Personally I prefer less alcohol-y toners. It has a strong scent and stings. I&#x27;m gunna stick to my gnarly whale green tea toner. There are equal chemical toners here in America like rapid clear.</li>
            <li> just i start to use it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a crazy difference as suggested by many users. But worked fine.</li>
            <li> Unlike American toners which dry out the skin, Korean toners help to add back moister and prep skin for other products. I like this toner for that purpose however I have been using this for a month and have noticed a very small difference in the size of my pores, maybe it would work better with a complimenting pore minimizing lotion, serum ect. I will probably try another toner and maybe come back to this if I can&#x27;t find anything better. I have SUPER dry, skin with breakouts and medium sized pores on my t-zone area for reference.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! The best freshner I&#x27;ve ever used! Very gentle on my sensitive skin, and it helps with clearing my acne and redness from acne scars. It has also helped tone down my oily face, and my pores look healthier. Very good at removing all the dirt and whatnot accumulated throughout the day. My product did not come with a &amp;#34;safety seal&amp;#34;, unless you call a strip of tape over the cap a seal. I will choose a different seller next time I order this product, as my bottle was slightly unscrewed so some of the contents leaked out. It did come in its own box, which had a tape seal over that. But I still got a leaked bottle. Thankfully only a little escaped. I did receive the new 10 in 1 version instead of the 7 in 1.</li>
            <li> I got my 10 in 1 Wonder Pore (8.45 oz / 250 ml) today and am very disappointed.  It arrived leaking and messy in the package - yuck!  There was no tape or seal on the bottle.  It was also in the box  (with a see-through front) facing the wrong direction. The ribbon image on the front of the bottle is very pink, but in all photos I&#x27;ve seen (including on Etude House&#x27;s website) the ribbon is orange-brown. I&#x27;ve read people say how much they love the smell of this product, but mine has no scent but there is an alcohol-y chemically burn in my nostrils when I sniff it. Hesitantly, I did try it on my face.  I saw in a review someone saying it felt tingly, but I felt nothing - it was like dabbing water on my skin.  My cotton ball was 100% clean after wiping - seriously?  Not even a speck of dirt?  My skin also didn&#x27;t look any different after I put it on.  I buy a lot of items on Amazon - I mean A LOT - and this is the first time that I had a strong gut feeling that I got a fake product.  Since I&#x27;ve never tried this product before, I can only go by my gut.  While I have no definitive proof, I just can&#x27;t shake the feeling that something is &amp;#34;off.  I spent too many hours today searching online for ways to spot a fake Wonder Pore (couldn&#x27;t find anything).  So, I just talked to Amazon and I&#x27;m returning it.  Amazon has amazing customer service, btw.  For reference, I chose the 250 ml from the drop down menu (not the 250 ml NEW).  I was hoping that would get me the 7 in 1 (the original formula) but alas, it did not.  On the 250 ml bottle, there is no pumper cap like there is on the 500 ml (based on my research online).  I will probably buy Wonder Pore in the future, but from the official Etude House website.  When I do, I will update this post with any differences between the authentic product and what I got today.  I hope my review helps someone out there!c product and what I got today.  I hope my review helps someone out there!</li>
            <li> I heard good things about this being good for large pores and blackheads but it did next to nothing for me. Used up most of the bottle and used it once per day. Didn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin though.</li>
            <li> It did make a difference to my face! I am having less pimples after I started to use this product! :)</li>
            <li> Great Great Great product I have combination T-zone face with large stubborn pores, and this product does minimize pores without drying out face, and also a a nice fresh scent ( no me, everyone is different). Make use you wash face clean before using toner.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but it didn&#x27;t make a difference in my skin...</li>
            <li> I guess if you have dry skin, this is good for you, but this makes my face SO oily, like I&#x27;ve been sweating. Gag-worthy, really. I have normal skin, not dry or oily. No difference in pore size. Its only been 2 days, but I really don&#x27;t like it. I&#x27;ll keep trying it, because its so cute &amp; I like etude house... And its expensive... But goodness I will never repurchase or recommend.</li>
            <li> Not sure how these got such good reviews. Has alcohol! Also, does nothing in terms of shrinking the pores.</li>
            <li> My pores are definetly smaller. They also gave me 3 free samples of different Korean products.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and nice scent! I&#x27;m 45 sharing this with my teens as I still getting breakouts! Nice toner! Breakouts have slowed down since using. Like much better than the expensive TV brand we were using!</li>
            <li> Not for those with sensitive skin. A bit too much alcohol in it for my skin, made it red after application ( not a big deal went away). I just think it suits skin that is oily and prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toner. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, it doesn&#x27;t burn, and it makes my skin feel really fresh and clean. I have combination skin with a very oily t-zone, and I see results after using it for about 6 days. My pores aren&#x27;t as large, and I definitely see less acne than I had before. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> In my opinion I don&#x27;t really like it because I have skin that barely brakes out and when ever I used this  a pimple just happened to pop up so yeah ..(my skin is kinda rough) but I found it takes my makeup off nicely..</li>
            <li> I exclusively use Korean skincare and makeup and generally like Etude House but unfortunately this product was a disappointment. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for several weeks and haven&#x27;t really seen any difference at all in my pores. The one good thing is that when you use it, you can see on the cotton pad that there is almost always a little gunk/discoloration even when you think your skin is clean, so as a cleanser for your pores, it seems to be effective. However, you would get the same effect from using a classic rosewater/witch hazel toner and I haven&#x27;t seen any overall difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it advertises.  When I apply it to a cotton ball and sweep it over my skin (in the t-zone, particularly), I can see the little black dots of crud that have come up from deep within my pores on the cotton after I&#x27;m done (eewww!).  It deep cleans without drying you out.&lt;br /&gt;My skin texture is very noticeably finer, my pores are significantly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;This one&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mom, she has huge open pores and told me she loves it and that it had helped her control oil and close pores.</li>
            <li> Wow. This is the best toner I have every used.  It does not smell like alcohol, in fact it smells really fresh and light. It&#x27;s like I can feel it cleansing my face when I use it. I use it before I go to bed every night. I think I would recommend it to anyone looking for a new toner.</li>
            <li> This is my wonder product. I have been trying to get rid of my blackheads since they first started appearing on my nose at the onset of puberty, with a litany of mud masks, charcoal scrubs, facial steaming, and pore strips (which are probably the most rubbish of all the purported pore cleansing products). I also used pore-reducing cleansers and toners like Neutrogena Pore Refining cleanser and toner (which I recommend if you have gunk-less pores to shrink). They helped to make my pores look smaller but the dirt and oil were still trapped inside. This toner is great because it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, it dries quickly without feeling sticky, has a light pleasant smell, and I haven&#x27;t had a single zit since I started using this 4 weeks ago. As for my pores, they are simultaneously looking smaller, but more gunk is coming out of them. As I mentioned before, other products shrunk my pores so much that they trapped the oil and dirt but this product is allowing that stuff to come out, and my skin and pores are rapidly improving. I&#x27;ve used about half of the 250ml bottle in one month, so I will be reordering soon. It may seem pricey, but how much money have I already spent on junk remedies? I shudder to think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference I am using La Roche Posay Effaclar Purifying Foaming Gel as a cleanser (used with a rotating brush), Etude House Wonder Pore Freshner as a toner, and Mizon Snail Recovery Gel Cream as a moisturizer, AM and PM. Exfoliate every few days with Freeman Charcoal Black Sugar Dual Mask Scrub, Cure Aqua Gel (also pricey but so little product is used each time that it may be worth it), or silkworm cocoon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as a toner for about 3 weeks now and I love love the results I&#x27;m getting! My enlarged pores have shrunk and I also have less blackheads! Amazing product, also purchased the foaming cleanser from the Etude House Wonder Pore line! I shall see how that goes!</li>
            <li> Product seems good but it had no seal on the bottle, nor was the plastic &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; it came in sealed so about a quarter of it leaked out into the box onto the rest of the stuff. Kind of a mess.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for me...  Wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> Great toner for sensitive skin. It smells like the product contains witch hazel which is great for soothing skin and clearing blemishes. The bottle is cute, but I thought this bottle would have the pump applicator. This bottle just has a cap, so you have to squeeze the product into a cotton pad. I think the larger sizes of this product have the pump applicator though. Next time I will get the 500ml bottle with the pump applicator! Love this product :)</li>
            <li> Love this! It is not harsh or drying at all.</li>
            <li> This toner is not as drying as many others, but it does a great job of removing residual gunk from my face after cleansing. It also helps drop the ph of my skin to prep it for next steps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good at cleaning my face + neck, although I think I&#x27;ll have to use it for a couple of weeks to see if it does minimize pores.</li>
            <li> Leaves face feeling soft but not oily</li>
            <li> What is in this stuff???  It makes you pores appear smaller my causing mild but visible inflammation. I stopped using after two tries because I am afraid this is unregulated. Seller, please provide an ingredient list to prove this does not contain carcinogenic ingredients !!!</li>
            <li> This toner seem to work good on the first few weeks. does make me break out, so I stop. Maybe because I was on my period. But I still used this for my back acne. Work great. Reason I give 4 stars cuz help clear up my back acne</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good... though I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in my pores as compared to other brands (the porefessional).</li>
            <li> This product feels very nice going on my face, it definitely cuts down on the oil and shine on my face as well as prepping my face for the rest of my routine.</li>
            <li> Shipping was good, but felt like the toner did nothing for my face.</li>
            <li> Very quick and reliable.</li>
            <li> First of all, the packaging is adorable. I&#x27;ve been on a total Korean beauty kick lately and this product is one of my favorites. My skin feels smooth and bright and although I&#x27;m not sure if my pores are smaller, they&#x27;re definitely cleaner and therefore much less noticeable. I&#x27;d order this again for sure.</li>
            <li> This product has a good PH balancing effect and helps clean off any excess oil/makeup/sweat/etc. This is not a moisturizing toner. I have dry skin and it works okay for me but I am looking into something more moisturizing. I think it would be great for those with oily or combination skin.</li>
            <li> Seems to cleanse my face well. I like the way my face feels after I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product works because I just began to use it but I love the package design it&#x27;s really cute ^-^</li>
            <li> Sent expired product!</li>
