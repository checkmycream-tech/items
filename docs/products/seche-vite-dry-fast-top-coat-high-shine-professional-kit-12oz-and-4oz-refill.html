            <li>We love to boat and play in the outdoors.  </li>
            <li>I have had the hardest time finding a top coat that will stay on through all the activity.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve painted my nails at night just to wake up with hair prints all over my nails.</li>
            <li>My fingers have a tightness feeling once have this top coat on.</li>
            <li>but I guess it won&#x27;t cause more harm since they did research on it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this topcoat.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to get about 6-8 hours out of a mani before it chipped.</li>
            <li>I love this top coat.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite is my holy grail top coat.  </li>
            <li>But for top coat, don&#x27;t get anything else...  </li>
            <li>I love this top coat, but it doesn&#x27;t work with all polishes.</li>
            <li>This is my Top Coat of choice</li>
            <li>This is a much better price, it falls within my budget and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>

            <li>My daughters love to paint their nails</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle because it was an emergency, I needed some top coat to give as a gift</li>
            <li>It dries in like 5 min, and you cannot top that.</li>
            <li>It does fast just like it says it does which is great, but that&#x27;s not the reason I love it.</li>
            <li>I have never seen a shinier top coat.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply the best.</li>
            <li>I received the envelope with the top literally ripped off.</li>
            <li>The top piece of the enveloped was hanging by a piece of tape.</li>
            <li>I am just glad nothing got lost on the way.</li>
            <li>It holds a shine better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and dries in a minute or 2.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this top coat..</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different brands but Seche is the best.</li>
            <li>I must say the duration of your manicure also depends on the nail polish you have underneath the top coat.  </li>

            <li>all end all of top coats.</li>
            <li>I love switching my colors after just a day or so,</li>
            <li>but ever since this top coat came crashing into my life like the gift it is to the Polish world, I&#x27;ve kept my colors on longer and have enjoyed them more (if that&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Nail polish wouldn&#x27;t stay on for more than 48 hours no matter how many coats I would use.</li>
            <li>I used the Seche Vite top coat because I couldn&#x27;t find anything else.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite top coat.&lt;br</li>

            <li>sold I love it.its shiny</li>
            <li>Purchased this because so many nail techs rave about it.</li>
            <li>i love the seche vite product and its all i use on my nails</li>
            <li>This is such a great buy!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the big bottle of refill as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then at 90%, give your wrist a twist, just like pouring oil or wine, to make sure the solution doesn&#x27;t drip out side the opening.</li>
            <li>love the look it gives my manies and pedies.</li>
            <li>I like to use a lot of top coat and one drop from the brush</li>
            <li>so I use a lot of top coat.</li>
            <li>Regret buying so many.  </li>
            <li>I love love love Seche Vite</li>
            <li>Overall this is an awesome product and no manicure should be without it!</li>
            <li>This top coat is the end of all my nail polish woes.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, and after using it, I can&#x27;t even imagine using anything else.  </li>
            <li>I usually love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this - and it&#x27;s much better than paying 6.99 every couple of months at CVS</li>
            <li>Just doesn&#x27;t get any better than Seche</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Then I found this top coat.</li>
            <li>You could use the crappiest, cheapest quality nail polish and nobody would know the difference if you put this on top.</li>
            <li>I just use it to laquer jewelery :)</li>
            <li>wear nail polish a lot more often now because gone is the frustration of a ruined manicure because I couldn&#x27;t sit not using my hands for anything at all for two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love this stuff.it dries super quick and this is a great deal</li>
            <li>possibly a life time amount of top coat for me!!!</li>
            <li>It smoothes beautifully, dries super fast and shiny, and keeps a mani fresh and gel-perfect for a good 2 weeks -</li>
            <li>Fast Top Coat High Shine is the most awesome nail top coat ever invented.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pick up color from my nails, it retains its clear color, it doesn&#x27;t smear my polish no matter how many colors I&#x27;m using on each nail, and works great as a protective top coat.  </li>
            <li>As much as I like Seche Vite&#x27;s product, which is an excellent laquer, I have to complain and warn people about this large refill size - it&#x27;s in GLASS</li>
            <li>This is one of the best purchases that I&#x27;ve made in a long time!</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny - I&#x27;d say GET IT !!</li>
            <li>and I own the perfect finish and quick dry to Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>Dries extremely quickly and leaves nails with a nice shine.</li>
            <li>the best fst dry ever</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good deal if you do your nails a lot and go through top coat fast, have already bought a bottle of SV before and KNOW how to use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying it for about a year now, 0.5 oz bottle at a time, and I&#x27;ve been impressed every single application.</li>
            <li>really is a great product, but I guess the key to a great manicure is first and foremost taking care of your nails.</li>
            <li>And the very best thing of all is that it is dry to the touch in about 2 minutes!</li>
            <li>Excellent on being a fast ship, quick dry, self leveling and a great shine.  </li>
            <li>I can get away with a cheaper nail polish but NOT a base and top coat.</li>
            <li>Whatever sins were during painting this top will fix and the finish will be smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Works great one clear nail polish too.</li>
            <li>This is by far the absolute best top coat I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Great for those who frequently get mani/pedicures.  </li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve got it figured out, though, it&#x27;s fantastic to be able to refill whenever you need it.</li>
            <li>glad i did cause the stuff is genuine.</li>
            <li>It can cause some shrinkage, but it is a fantastic top coat.</li>
            <li>This is a good fast drying polish but it has a smell that I can&#x27;t stand.  </li>
            <li>Seche Vite is hands down the best top coat I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Awesome quick dry top coat.</li>
            <li>this is so much more worth the money!</li>
            <li>star because Seche Vite as a brand and product is awesome, and the other star is for the seller&#x27;s prompt response time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, with all the other wonderful reviews, I never felt compelled to add a review, I had nothing to add...</li>
            <li>It is the best one out there and gives nails and nice, hard, glossy finish.</li>
            <li>The kit also comes with a funnel thingy for easy refills.  </li>
            <li>So smoooth and does not chip easily.</li>
            <li>I am always using my hands and my polish peels off so easily.</li>
            <li>I love this topcoat, and this is such a great deal.</li>
            <li>and my nails remain strong.</li>
            <li>I liked this when I first got it</li>
            <li>Just make sure you also get some along the edge of your nail because if you don&#x27;t, you run the risk of it peeling (although this is true of any polish).</li>
            <li>good price for a product that works, nice smooth glossy finish that actually lasts.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite is hands down the best topcoat I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Ideally, I do my nail polish sometime before bed, let it dry for about 15 minutes and after that I can go to bed and not get sheet marks.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s super shiny!</li>
            <li>I go threw this top coat so quickly.</li>
            <li>It is quick drying and seals the polish in so well!</li>
            <li>Super glossy!</li>
            <li>Fast Top Coat High Shine nail polish works great.</li>
            <li>I have used many quick dry top coats, seche vite is by far the best top coat ever.</li>
            <li>This is the best fast dry top coat I have tried.</li>
            <li>This is the best top coat fast dry nail polish ive ever owned!</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of DIY manis / pedis and used to use the OPI topcoat.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t go light with the Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>The Price Is fantastic and I have been telling everyone to get it from this sellers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is by far the best top coat I have used in the last 30 years.  </li>
            <li>It applies evenly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I filled a bottle for my friend</li>
            <li>Okay, I rarely do this</li>
            <li>My wife and my daughter really enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>Great purchase since individual bottles cost upwards of 4.99 at some retailers.</li>
            <li>so if you lightly tap it or smudge it, it will stay put.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t have any available in my country</li>
            <li>Great value and it last for months!</li>
            <li>Second time buying this &amp; its a great deal.</li>
            <li>Very quick-drying; nice glossy shine.</li>
            <li>This is the best transparent coat I&#x27;ve use in many years working professionally and personally on nails.</li>
            <li>Great price and product, I really like how fast it dries.</li>
            <li>Love it, almost as much as H K Girl Top coat.  </li>
            <li>This product looks so good, that everyone comments and believes I went to the salon to have my nails professionally done.</li>
            <li>It works amazingly well, dries super fast, and leaves a glossy finish!</li>
            <li>Some nail polishes will peel right off no matter what top coat you use.  </li>
            <li>It makes my nail polish dry very quickly and the shine Is great.</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best fast-dry top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I had seen a lot of great reviews for this product, but it wasn&#x27;t until I got to try it myself, that I realized its true potential!</li>
            <li>I love Seche Vite because it dries so quickly and keeps my manicures in good shape (better than other topcoats I&#x27;ve tried, including Orly Won&#x27;t Chip).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this top coat!</li>
            <li>Love this nail polish makes it shine and drys very fast</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t own this I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Live love love this product.</li>
            <li>BEST WAY TO BUY THE SECHE&#x27; VITE DRY FAST TOPCOAT...</li>
            <li>I was dubious about seche vite at first thinking this top coat may not be the god send that everyone claims.  </li>
            <li>My favorite fast drying topcoat!  </li>
            <li>This is soooo worth every cent!</li>
            <li>so I added a second coat on top of the top coat and put the top coat over that.</li>
            <li>#34;clean up&amp;#34; the lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>Here is my review when I bought my first 0.5 oz Top Coat: &amp;</li>
            <li>If you use this top coat I recommend this product because it will save you so much money &amp; time!</li>
            <li>I recently decided to start doing my own manicures again, and I had to get Seche Vite top coat.</li>
            <li>But the biggest downside to seche vite however is that it shrinks most of my nail polishes (mainly essie and sinful colors), it seems to do fine with my opi&#x27;s though.</li>
            <li>Has funnel included, but just as easy to pour right to bottle.</li>
            <li>Great for people who can&#x27;t wait around for nails to dry like me!</li>
            <li>Amazing top coat super shiny and drys almost instantly.</li>
            <li>nothing special about it,</li>
            <li>Right now we&#x27;re at about 45 min since I applied, and I can press my polish with one of my fingernails and it doesn&#x27;t give at all!</li>
            <li>for a first time user of this product its way more then i expected i love the top coat!</li>
            <li>Super protective when I want to have fun with my nails!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years and love how fast it dries.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully you will try it (if you haven&#x27;t already) and love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how fast it dries.</li>
            <li>contacted Amazon regarding this and offered as a solution/compromise for the inconvenience, I&#x27;d accept a refund for the difference in price from the time I purchased it ($19.50) to the current price ($16.28) which the rep agreed would be fair and communicated this to the seller.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller responded to say they do not price match and processed a full refund - never even addressed the fact that they hadn&#x27;t even bothered to ship my item yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is a fast drying top coat it literally creates strings from it</li>
            <li>It is very affordable and you get more bang for your buck if you purchase the 4oz refill bottle.</li>
            <li>I brought this product after looking for fast drying top coats</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m inlove with this fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li>Manicure is in good condition all week even when working physically.</li>
            <li>It dries very very quick and keeps your nail polish nice for several days.  </li>
            <li>There is no other top coat that compare to this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails for years and consider a quick dry top coat a necessity.  </li>
            <li>It protects nail art with an incredibly shiny layer of \\&quot;armor\\&quot;, quickly reaches a dry-to-the-touch stage and, unlike most other top coats, doesn&#x27;t streak the acrylic paint often used in nail designs (once the paint is dry, of course).</li>
            <li>Nails dry really quick and adds a nice shine!</li>
            <li>But the product drys out quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and protects my polish.</li>
            <li>Dries nails so quickly plus makes them super shiny.</li>
            <li>putting on this top coat actually makes nail art look better.</li>
            <li>Shiny and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>also received it quickly and of course the price is right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries SO FAST and leaves such a great shine.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite top coat, so why not order the giant bottle?</li>
            <li>Would highly highly recommend this product if you are one for top coats.</li>
            <li>It truly is incredible how fast it drys and with such a large refill bottle you won&#x27;t have to worry about running out for a while.</li>
            <li>Dries pretty quick, even if I do my nails before bedtime and keeps them shinny chip free for over a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat for many years, and I have to say it&#x27;s my favorite nail product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This top coat makes your nails so shiny, dries extremely fast (with is super important with a toddler), and just makes your manicure really come together.  </li>
            <li>compared to OPI its light and applies consistently and evenly.</li>
            <li>Its true that this polish can be used on top of not so dry polish as a top coat</li>
            <li>I ran out and went to the drug store and bought a top coat for while I waited to get my new bottle</li>
            <li>The best quick dry ever in a larger bottle</li>
            <li>Quickly dries polish minimizing dings and smudges, keeps polish looking fresh and helps minimize chips.</li>
            <li>the product would make the nail polish underneath more brittle so that my polish chipped a lot faster than if I didn&#x27;t use the quick dry top coat at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not dry out and the brush has a nice fan to it when applying the polish.</li>
            <li>This kit is well worth it because I can see me going through it fairly quick.</li>
            <li>I love this top coat it leaves my nails for a long time</li>
            <li>This set is the best value as well (compared to paying at least $10 just for the .5 oz bottle)!</li>
            <li>Ordered this refill set as a replacement for my past bottle of Seche Vite, just as good as ever!  </li>
            <li>did recently ruin a fresh manicure because I made the bed within about 20 minutes of applying Seche Vite, which smooshed the polish at the tips, so I now have a pretty good idea what I can</li>
            <li>My clients are always on the go , so I am  glad to help them be on their way with a speed dry top coat.</li>
            <li>Perfect for me, I have a toddler &amp; infant I don&#x27;t have time to sit around and wait for my nails to dry, plus it helps my polish last longer.</li>
            <li>Second, the price is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have naturally long lashes, but they are not too full, so these provide a great natural look for me.</li>
            <li>9 bottles worth of product cheaper than 2 anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Seche Restore is a must for any polish loving female out there.</li>
            <li>It makes your nails feel like they have gel or a professional manicure, and it really helps keep yuur nails looking nice for longer</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this top coat and am ecstatic that I found a refill online for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love a good deal and I&#x27;m obsessed with this top coat.  </li>
            <li>So worth every dollar....</li>
            <li>Reapply often to keep manicure fresh.  </li>
            <li>The polish itself is by far my favorite topcoat, but the refilling is a bit tricky since the refill bottle is glass, so you can&#x27;t squeeze it like it feels like you need to.</li>
            <li>and so glad I got the professional size.</li>
            <li>I swear no matter what top coat I picked up my nails never dried.</li>
            <li>By far my favoite top coat.</li>
            <li>This is a 4oz bottle for refills, plus a .5oz bottle, so it&#x27;s basically worth $63.</li>
            <li>Entirely worth it.</li>
            <li>It is why most people still think I am getting my nails done professionally.  </li>
            <li>(you will be amazed, trust me), and it rarely, rarely chips.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite top coat because of its high shine &amp; super fast drying time.</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best top coat I have ever used, and I have used a lot of different brands (from drug store to premier department store brands).</li>
            <li>, I gotta say it totally became my favorite top coat, but the price was really high, even on sale over $5 a bottle</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this Seche Vite Dry-fast top coat for my last three manicures and it consistently keeps my nails chip-free for over a week -- regardless of whether I use a &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; brand or cheap brand.  </li>
            <li>Only give 4 because I thought these would look a bit more like another pair of wispies that I have, more dramatic for special occasions, but these are still great.</li>
            <li>I love it because it&#x27;s really fast drying and for its high shine result.</li>
            <li>I can do my nails right before bed</li>
            <li>However if you use it under the polish it will peel right off...</li>
            <li>It will also just peel right off.</li>
            <li>The Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat High Shine Professional Kit is a great value.</li>
            <li>Very strong smell but doesn&#x27;t really last any longer</li>
            <li>There is NO other top coat.</li>
            <li>This has prolonged my manicures like no other top coat has before.</li>
            <li>Good value and Dry fast.</li>
            <li>it dries super quick and has a high gloss shine.</li>
            <li>in this case there is some products here which apparently are not so healthy.</li>
            <li>For the price of a half ounce bottle I got the equivalent of five bottles, plus a handy funnel top that screws onto the refill bottle for tidy refilling of my half ounce bottle.</li>
            <li>I, at first, blamed it on the seche vite, but this year, my nails started growing out strong, probably because of these new vitamins I am taking.</li>
            <li>I think the packaging could be a little different, but overall I will still give it 5 stars because its a great product for an amazing value!</li>
            <li>I love it that it can be applied to nail polish that is not completely dry yet,</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super high quality containers!  </li>
            <li>And the shine lasts for days, most top coats need to be reapplied every few days to keep the shine.</li>
            <li>you really have to cut the funnel wide to get a good flow when you want to refill.</li>
            <li>It makes your manicure look like gel polish and dries super fast.</li>
            <li>This refill kit gives you 9 bottles worth for only $5 more.</li>
            <li>It dries my nails in only a few minutes and gives it that perfect shine.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Dries them SUPER fast.</li>
            <li>It dries quick and is very glossy.</li>
            <li>and it is my favorite one so far and since the bottle finishes pretty fast</li>
            <li>It keeps my polish on longer, stronger and more vibrant than any other top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>very fast drying.  </li>
            <li>This kit is an amazing deal, considering a single bottle can cost me $10!</li>
            <li>First off, I love this stuff, it makes even a gel coat dry quickly.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to anything else because this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that not only creates a beautiful shine, but truly dries quickly!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m only buying this kit from here on out, such an amazing deal!</li>
            <li>I can not talk highly enough about this top coat.</li>
            <li>Nice &amp; thick which is an absolute must in a TOP coat.</li>
            <li>And it really does drive fully in five minutes!</li>
            <li>will be back for more.</li>
            <li>Definitely won&#x27;t work with Julep, but I&#x27;ve yet to find a top coat that doesn&#x27;t make the polish come off in one piece yet.</li>
            <li>My manicure holds up better when I do it myself at home, and I would bet that it&#x27;s because the salons use a lesser quality topcoat.  </li>
            <li>and I thought the recipient would like a bigger bottle better than the .5 oz seche, and tried this</li>
            <li>It would be better to receive the packages in an actual box instead of an envelope.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the only top coat I&#x27;ll use on my nails.</li>
            <li>Thank u for the fast shopping!</li>
            <li>Funny thing happened.</li>
            <li>I went on U Tube and read the 5 things to make your nail polish look great and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Only top coat I use.</li>
            <li>Exactly what is pictured.</li>
            <li>I know that is actually fast drying and has loads of shine!</li>
            <li>Bought the Restore Thinner so that I&#x27;ll be able to use every last drop.</li>
            <li>Fast and reliable seller and delivery!</li>
            <li>It makes your mani rock solid in five minutes, no matter how many layers of polish you have on your nail.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s FREAKY FAST!</li>
            <li>I am going on my second week and most of my nails still look perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Photo 2 &#x3D; Day 10 (no retouching or second application of top</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t love about it is the smell</li>
            <li>I have tried many others but this one is not only Affordable its reliable!  </li>
            <li>and I only use Seche Vite top coat.</li>
            <li>I paint my nails every two days and still have tons of top coat left.</li>
            <li>It really hardens the nails in a way that allows you to keep your manicure fresh for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Bottle &amp; refill lasted me a whole year!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to do the gel you definitely should go with this top coat.  </li>
            <li>First off, in my area a 0.5 ounce bottle of Seche goes for about $6</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be sure to follow the instructions and refill the smaller container as soon as it gets to be 3/4.  </li>
            <li>so it seems like you could attach it to the top of the big bottle,</li>
            <li>This stuff dries so quickly, is lovely and glossy, and after doing my nails one night, I didn&#x27;t wake up the next morning with sheet prints on my nails!</li>
            <li>My only dislike is that this polish turns white tips with acrylic yellow but over polish it is wonderful.</li>
            <li>materials\\&quot; especially since the stink of toluene, butyl and phthalate was overwhelming -</li>
            <li>it works fabulous and dries super quick and with a high gloss....will definitely order again</li>
            <li>This is a great deal for frequent users -- I go through this bottle in about 5 months if I paint my nails every day, half if pedicures are included.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast Dry top coats have a tendency to get goopy because of their fast dry nature, and the Seche Restore will keep the consistency good as you refill your bottle</li>
            <li>this is what nail salons use to make your nails perfect and last a long time and dry quickly.</li>
            <li>Only down side is the smell but this top coat is soo amazing</li>
            <li>, I usually polish right before going to bed and wake up smudge free :)</li>
            <li>It is the only fast drying top coat</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re brand loyal as I am  you won&#x27;t be disappointed with getting a pretty generous supply of THE best quick drying topcoat ever.  </li>
            <li>The only fast drying top coat that I will use.  </li>
            <li>The price was also great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issue(s): Very strong smell, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li>Pretty much text book results for me.</li>
            <li>Investing in the refill is pretty much required if you are like me.</li>
            <li>It leaves a gorgeous, slick shine too.</li>
            <li>The low price and quick delivery are also super.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several high end top coats ( from Dior to Chanel) and nothing in comparison to this one.</li>
            <li>Very glossy, dries very fast and extends my DIY manicures very well.</li>
            <li>It shrinks a little bit, so if you make a mistake while polishing, the top coat will fix it for you!  </li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t need to buy more for a very long time.</li>
            <li>so I took an empty OPI top coat bottle (I clean out my old bottles when they run out</li>
            <li>This does have a tendency to dry out a bit, but adding more to the bottle fixes that problem.</li>
            <li>My polish is dry to the touch within seconds of applying the top coat.  </li>
            <li>Put a fairly large bead on the nail and almost push it around with the brush rather than painting it on like polish.</li>
            <li>I recommend buying Seche Restore (a thinner) to go with it since the bottle is large and it will thicken before you are finished.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it dries multiple layers very quickly and leaves your nails with a very high gloss finish.  </li>
            <li>My go to fast dry top coat when Im in a hurry....</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve tried Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat, I&#x27;m done looking at anything else.</li>
            <li>ONE OF THE RULES WAS TO USE SECHE VITE FAST DRY TOP COAT</li>
            <li>Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat is a must-have for the hobby nail artist.</li>
            <li>I use seche vite dry fast top coat</li>
            <li>cant paint my nails without a fast dry top coat.</li>
            <li>Other than that and some lower quality polishes, this works perfectly and helps my manis last as long as I let them.</li>
            <li>does have a strong scent, but man does it dry fast!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, every single thing!</li>
            <li>And this set is a huge bargain, especially if you paint your nails as often as I do!</li>
            <li>And it dries FAST too.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Seche Vite</li>
            <li>And very glossy too.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use it while your nail polish is still wet so that you don&#x27;t get any shrinkage.</li>
            <li>You really have to glob it on though.</li>
            <li>They have really fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;0)</li>
            <li>Really finishes a manicure.</li>
            <li>Shipped in a reasonable amount of time and heck</li>

            <li>Def dries fast</li>
            <li>It also shrinks the nail polish so much that after one day you can just pull the polish off in one pull.</li>
            <li>and it dries fast.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>and they absolutely swear by this product.</li>
            <li>, I found out it was MUCH cheaper here even with shipping</li>
            <li>you face any issues with shrinkage at the tip of the nail as the formula thickens over time, take a second to run the brush over the free edge of the nail, reducing visible tipwear.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m absolutely blown away by this topcoat.  </li>
            <li>My polish stays on so much longer as well.  </li>
            <li>I like the way it dries fast.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Dries fast and shiny.</li>
            <li>I go thru it so fast.</li>
            <li>Either the straight topcoat or the start to finish top&amp;base coat.</li>
            <li>It turns out to be the real deal</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Takes all the flaws out of your manicure and dries so fast.</li>
            <li>Saves money and you don&#x27;t have to reorder so much.</li>
            <li>It dries super fast and helps everything underneath dry quickly to(if</li>
            <li>I really like Seche Vite topcoat</li>
            <li>Fast drying...</li>
            <li>Now I can refill my bottles for sooo much lessss than buying a 1/2 ounce bottle at the store.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore Seche Vite and have used it for a couple years now.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.  </li>
            <li>It dries so fast and leaves the shiniest shine.</li>
            <li>the bottles are not broken.</li>
            <li>Lasts forever, drys fast, and no chipping.</li>
            <li>Dries fast but still have to wait awhile</li>
            <li>Dries as fast as they claim.</li>
            <li>Use plastic, like the rest of the modern world of chemical supplies.</li>
            <li>Dries super fast and there is no other that shines like</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a new fast dry top coat, your answer is here</li>
            <li>Completely revitalizes old polish to its original state.</li>
            <li>This one is easy to use, dry fast.</li>
            <li>Would never use any other top coat.</li>
            <li>It smooths out my polish, is ultra glossy, and dries nails faster than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Lasts longer and other top coat I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>then other top coats I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>For nailheads like me, having access to an endless supply of Seche Vite (or their favorite fast-dry topcoat) is required.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wasting my time on other top coats.</li>
            <li>I will never use any other top coat again.</li>
            <li>I have to say it does smell very strongly, but that little downfall doesn&#x27;t last long and is a very minimal consequence for this amazing top coat.</li>
            <li>Very quick dry.</li>
            <li>I use this mainly because of how fast the drying time is.</li>
            <li>They only thing is that you&#x27;ll need the Seche Restore to keep this topcoat fresh (the ingredient that makes it fast drying also evaporates very easily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just got into doing nails and was looking for a decent top coat to help my pretty designs stay on as long as possible.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes, if I want my polish to last a little longer, I&#x27;ll add another coat of the top coat mid-week (3-4 days after the original application).</li>
            <li>and it is like having a brand new bottle!</li>
            <li>I have gone through 2 bottles of SV Dry Fast Top Coat and finally decided to go ahead and invest in the large refill bottle because I know I&#x27;ll use it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally I also use orly bonder(rubber base coat), but I too always have flawless home done nails that I am able to change every 3-4 days, even with 5 kids, since I can be done in 10min flat-</li>
            <li>product arrived with a slight delay from the shipper, but was safely packaged and unopened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>Having this kit makes it almost possible and for the prices on Amazon, it makes a much better deal than buying individual bottles of Seche Vite!</li>
            <li>surprised how cheap this was that i actually became a bit suspicious but placed the order anyhow.</li>
            <li>This is 4.5 fl oz&#x27;s overall and is only 4 dollars more.</li>
            <li>the end of the little bottle, the top coat mite get a little thick, so i recommend using nail polish thinner or just refilling the bottle :D</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used bargain brands and insanely high priced products.</li>
            <li>Definitely highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I used to buy the .5 ounce size(at a somewhat high price) before I knew about this economy size of 4 ounces.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>It gives a high gloss shine.</li>
            <li>It dries ALL the layers of polish unlike other fast dry top coats which just dry the top coat.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t get thick and clumpy as some fast dry top coats tend to get.</li>
            <li>It was better than I expected!!!</li>
            <li>I am surprised how fast it dries.</li>
            <li>I am by no means a professional, but I go through so much of this stuff that this kit saved me a ton of money.</li>
            <li>The economy size refill is worth every fluid oz.</li>
            <li>I chose to purchase from this seller because a bottle is about $10 in stores and for a few dollars more</li>
            <li>10 dollars for SV when I normally purchase the .5 fl oz bottle.</li>
            <li>This stuff really protects a fresh nail polish job far beyond what I thought possible.</li>
            <li>It can still get some dents and deformities if heavily stressed in the first couple of hours, but within a few minutes, the finish is virtually impervious to most light dings and bumps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick too.</li>
            <li>It stays super shiny for at least a full week straight without having to touch up.</li>
            <li>I applied Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat over a Julep polish, and I would say within 5 min it was dry to the touch.</li>
            <li>It offers a deep wet look that dries quickly (doesn&#x27;t need uv light) and offers chip proof protection for days and days.</li>
            <li>so I still considered buying the other one when I could because its cheap</li>
            <li>Nearly ruined my brush messing with the funnel, finally threw it away and just poured straight from the bottle, took a whole 5 seconds!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product.  </li>
            <li>if you have a little one that wants pretty nails, this product is a MUST!!</li>
            <li>It smooths everything out (which is great if you do nail art because layering nail polish can get quite clumpy), dries crazy fast</li>
            <li>But regarding the finish - tremendous, inm out the door is not even close neither in dry speed nor in gloss power.</li>
            <li>quick dry polish I&#x27;ve ever used, and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m set for awhile with this quick dry.</li>
            <li>way it works for me is if my apply it to tacky slightly wet polish and wrap the tips (with the last coat of polish and the top</li>
            <li>so I just carefully poured it without the special tip, no problems at all.</li>
            <li>I order this several times a year because it&#x27;s simply the best topcoat out there, but can be a bit expensive depending on where you live.</li>
            <li>Looks professional for days!  </li>
            <li>Nothing else beats the quick dry and shine and finish that this gives!  </li>
            <li>So glad I bought the package instead of just the small bottle.  </li>
            <li>Nails look professional and shiny!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested to see if the big refill bottle will thicken like seche vite is known to do.</li>
            <li>Apply a second top coat during the second day of manicure to make it last  2wks with no chipping.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong</li>
            <li>it dries wet polish so fast and lasts so long, I now have 2 drawers full of COLOR and loooove it!</li>
            <li>It dries lightening fast and really protects the polish for a long time - 1 month for toes and 10 days for nails.  </li>
            <li>but it sets quickly enough that you can get going much faster than normal.</li>
            <li>The actual box the refill is in is good but the way it was packaged to be delivered to my house was not good at all.</li>
            <li>I bought this brand for a few reasons, mostly because Sally was out of my usual product Speed Demon by Nail Life because it was on sale and whenever they run a sale it just flies off the shelf because people like me buy like 3 bottles, and Seche Vite was also on sale but available and my stamp blogger friends recommended this for stamping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i read some review here where the person is ranting about the bottles being broken for SURE!</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty strong and appalling as well.</li>
            <li>Love this product and love that there is a refill available because it was starting to get a bit expensive buying the small bottles all the time.</li>
            <li>I got this large bottle plus a regular bottle!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see this on Amazon, I almost fell over in shock to see that I could get a 4oz bottle and a 1/2oz polish bottle with brush for LESS than what I pay for just the 1/2oz bottle at the salon.  </li>
            <li>guess losing a little over $20 made more sense to the seller than just refunding the $3.22 difference and following through with shipping my item.</li>
            <li>I take my nail regimen pretty seriously and this is the ONLY top coat I use.</li>
            <li>Over time, the smaller bottle will start to thicken up and get kind of stringy, as what usually happens with any polish that gets used often, especially when its a quick dry product, and the Vite Revive does what it says.  </li>
            <li>if using more than one color on a nail, the colors would smear into each other, even if the nail polish was dry to the touch, and 3.</li>
            <li>By the time you get done with one foot the other is already dry, feel free to polish nails before bed now!</li>
            <li>I had an older bottle that i&#x27;ve been struggling to get every last drop out of, and once i opened the new stuff</li>
            <li>I am a busy mom of 4 boys and a girl all involved in sports and outdoors.  </li>
            <li>It is frequently used in salons.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing nails for nearly 40 years now.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how much it improves any nail color you use, no matter the price.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>I change my polish frequently</li>
            <li>This is very affordable especially when you buy the bottle plus the 4oz refill.</li>
            <li>Dries amazingly fast and has made my manicures last five times longer than they were before!</li>
            <li>Drys fast and keeps my pedicure lasting for weeks.</li>
            <li>It is shiny, dries fast and keeps my nail polish on several days longer.</li>
            <li>IF you buy it in the store you will pay the price for this whole set for the tiny bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have 2 young daughters(3 &amp; 2)  </li>
            <li>Buying this bottle is much much much cheaper than buying individual bottles.</li>
            <li>Dries extra fast to the touch</li>
            <li>made my manicure last much longer.</li>
            <li>just because it thickens fast enough.</li>
            <li>Very fast dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super shiny, and keeps my manicures looking good for  at least 5 days without chips (hard to know if they last longer than this because I change my nails a lot).</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t shied away from using my nails to pry open battery covers or scrape off sink smudges or do anything I would normally do.</li>
            <li>It came in like 3 business days and compared to how much a .5 oz regular bottle is where I live</li>
            <li>It really brings out the color in my polish and helps it dry faster.</li>
            <li>It really does dry all your fingernail polish all at once.</li>
            <li>So much easier than waiting 30 minutes for a completely dry nail.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s healthy for long term use</li>
            <li>The bonus is it&#x27;s ability to allow multiple coats of different brands of lacquer to dry ever so quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is too expensive at the drug store, so the refill supply is a fantastic and economical idea.</li>
            <li>With this stuff, I can put two coats of OPI (or another brand with similar coverage / consistency), top it with a coat of Seche Vite and in 60 seconds or less I can go on with my day (or go to sleep) without risking a single smudge / sheet mark on my nails.  </li>
            <li>Polish is expensive and this investment makes sure it lasts!</li>
            <li>If do my nail at home, it will help me to achieve the same effect as professional nail salon!</li>
            <li>the refill bottle is a major savings.</li>
            <li>Refilling my little bottle the first time was a pain!</li>
            <li>By the time I&#x27;m painting the last nail, the first one I painted is dry.</li>
            <li>You just add a few drops to the smaller bottle and it returns the polish to its original condition.  </li>
            <li>The amount of nail polish you use may push that time up or down a little bit, but still much better than others I have tried.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic tip</li>
            <li>I have never used any top coat that dried this fast and this hard.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more brands than I can remember, some good, some bad, but all of them had three things in common</li>
            <li>I generally have to use 8-10.</li>
            <li>so I use my hands a lot and am not careful about my nails.  </li>
            <li>people put there butter knife in to get it to pour, I even cut the end and it barely drips out</li>
            <li>I am an indie polish maker, and I use Seche Vite over nearly all of my manicures.</li>
            <li>so I had to order it online, and I have no regrets.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m currently participating in a twice-weekly nail art challenge, so I change my nail polish frequently.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apparent my postal carrier hates me because I report her every time she mis-delivers or damages my mail - so now she apparently uses my packages as a football..</li>
            <li>Product is OK but poorly packaged.  </li>
            <li>After 80% is filled up, slowly decrease the amount of speed, by lifting the bottle up gradually.</li>
            <li>I used to think no nail polish was truly &amp;#34;chip-resistant&amp;#34; no matter how expensive or how popular the brand was.</li>
            <li>I have tried several other brands and this one is the only one I have found that stays high gloss, truly dries fast, protects my polish, stays on and adds thickness to my nails .</li>
            <li>it does exactly what it says, nails stay super shiny and they dry in like a minute seriously.</li>
            <li>Overall I like it for its fast dry and glossy look.</li>
            <li>I have zero bad things to say about this top coat!!</li>
            <li>It is long lasting and dry very fast, under 5 minutes for 2 coats of color nail polish.</li>
            <li>Helps nail color dry extremely quickly (2 minutes or less).</li>
            <li>Thinking that it probably will never dry now..</li>
            <li>I keep two small bottles one for when I do reds the other I keep clear for light colors.</li>
            <li>so , forget about waiting forever to have your nail polish dry completely.</li>
            <li>When I refilled the first time, I ended up having to poke a few holes in the plastic nozzle to allow for airflow for proper pouring.</li>
            <li>but it is also way cheaper to buy it in this large size and refill the little bottle.</li>
            <li>High shine, quick dry and adds some thickness to my weak nails.</li>
            <li>It gives you a mirror shine finish every time, dries super fast, can be used over nail art such as Konad and other products (it wont cause the nail art to bleed), it works with fake or real nails and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>Any gal with a large collection of polishes is bound to have a few go \\&quot;lumpy\\</li>
            <li>Manicures that would normally take 20 mins to dry are completely dry in 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s better than Sally Hansen&#x27;s topcoat, this one seems to dry slower, and is definitely less glossy.</li>
            <li>one thing I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered it is that the large bottle is glass and even though it comes with that handy spout thing, it&#x27;s useless when you put it on the bottle because you can&#x27;t squeeze glass and the seche vite is so thick it will not come out with the spout on.</li>

            <li> Will never buy another top coast ever again.</li>
            <li> We love to boat and play in the outdoors.  </li>
            <li> I have had the hardest time finding a top coat that will stay on through all the activity.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve painted my nails at night just to wake up with hair prints all over my nails.</li>
            <li> My fingers have a tightness feeling once have this top coat on.</li>
            <li> but I guess it won&#x27;t cause more harm since they did research on it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this topcoat.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to get about 6-8 hours out of a mani before it chipped.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is my holy grail top coat.  </li>
            <li> But for top coat, don&#x27;t get anything else...  </li>
            <li> I love this top coat, but it doesn&#x27;t work with all polishes.</li>
            <li> This is my Top Coat of choice</li>
            <li> This is a much better price, it falls within my budget and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Great fast drying top coat</li>
            <li> like 30 years ago :)</li>
            <li> Such a awesome price too!</li>
            <li> I love painting my nails.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for years and so do many nail salons.  </li>
            <li> Extrodinary thing, works magically.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the great reviews, I bought this product.  </li>
            <li> it is strictly a top coat.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...</li>
            <li> definitely the best top coat that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> IT LOVE</li>
            <li> IT LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I use this as my go to top coat.</li>
            <li> My daughters love to paint their nails</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle because it was an emergency, I needed some top coat to give as a gift</li>
            <li> It dries in like 5 min, and you cannot top that.</li>
            <li> It does fast just like it says it does which is great, but that&#x27;s not the reason I love it.</li>
            <li> I have never seen a shinier top coat.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply the best.</li>
            <li> I received the envelope with the top literally ripped off.</li>
            <li> The top piece of the enveloped was hanging by a piece of tape.</li>
            <li> I am just glad nothing got lost on the way.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different brands but Seche is the best.</li>

            <li> all end all of top coats.</li>
            <li> I love switching my colors after just a day or so,</li>
            <li> but ever since this top coat came crashing into my life like the gift it is to the Polish world, I&#x27;ve kept my colors on longer and have enjoyed them more (if that&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Nail polish wouldn&#x27;t stay on for more than 48 hours no matter how many coats I would use.</li>
            <li> I used the Seche Vite top coat because I couldn&#x27;t find anything else.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite top coat.&lt;br</li>

            <li> i love the seche vite product and its all i use on my nails</li>
            <li> This is such a great buy!  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with the big bottle of refill as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then at 90%, give your wrist a twist, just like pouring oil or wine, to make sure the solution doesn&#x27;t drip out side the opening.</li>
            <li> love the look it gives my manies and pedies.</li>
            <li> I like to use a lot of top coat and one drop from the brush</li>
            <li> so I use a lot of top coat.</li>
            <li> Regret buying so many.  </li>
            <li> I love love love Seche Vite</li>
            <li> Overall this is an awesome product and no manicure should be without it!</li>
            <li> This top coat is the end of all my nail polish woes.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and after using it, I can&#x27;t even imagine using anything else.  </li>
            <li> I usually love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this - and it&#x27;s much better than paying 6.99 every couple of months at CVS</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t get any better than Seche</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Then I found this top coat.</li>
            <li> You could use the crappiest, cheapest quality nail polish and nobody would know the difference if you put this on top.</li>
            <li> I just use it to laquer jewelery :)</li>
            <li> wear nail polish a lot more often now because gone is the frustration of a ruined manicure because I couldn&#x27;t sit not using my hands for anything at all for two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> love this stuff.it dries super quick and this is a great deal</li>
            <li> possibly a life time amount of top coat for me!!!</li>
            <li> It smoothes beautifully, dries super fast and shiny, and keeps a mani fresh and gel-perfect for a good 2 weeks -</li>
            <li> Fast Top Coat High Shine is the most awesome nail top coat ever invented.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pick up color from my nails, it retains its clear color, it doesn&#x27;t smear my polish no matter how many colors I&#x27;m using on each nail, and works great as a protective top coat.  </li>
            <li> As much as I like Seche Vite&#x27;s product, which is an excellent laquer, I have to complain and warn people about this large refill size - it&#x27;s in GLASS</li>
            <li> This is one of the best purchases that I&#x27;ve made in a long time!</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny - I&#x27;d say GET IT !!</li>
            <li> and I own the perfect finish and quick dry to Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> Dries extremely quickly and leaves nails with a nice shine.</li>
            <li> the best fst dry ever</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a good deal if you do your nails a lot and go through top coat fast, have already bought a bottle of SV before and KNOW how to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying it for about a year now, 0.5 oz bottle at a time, and I&#x27;ve been impressed every single application.</li>
            <li> really is a great product, but I guess the key to a great manicure is first and foremost taking care of your nails.</li>
            <li> And the very best thing of all is that it is dry to the touch in about 2 minutes!</li>
            <li> Excellent on being a fast ship, quick dry, self leveling and a great shine.  </li>
            <li> I can get away with a cheaper nail polish but NOT a base and top coat.</li>
            <li> Whatever sins were during painting this top will fix and the finish will be smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Works great one clear nail polish too.</li>
            <li> This is by far the absolute best top coat I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Great for those who frequently get mani/pedicures.  </li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve got it figured out, though, it&#x27;s fantastic to be able to refill whenever you need it.</li>
            <li> glad i did cause the stuff is genuine.</li>
            <li> It can cause some shrinkage, but it is a fantastic top coat.</li>
            <li> This is a good fast drying polish but it has a smell that I can&#x27;t stand.  </li>
            <li> Seche Vite is hands down the best top coat I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Awesome quick dry top coat.</li>
            <li> this is so much more worth the money!</li>
            <li> star because Seche Vite as a brand and product is awesome, and the other star is for the seller&#x27;s prompt response time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, with all the other wonderful reviews, I never felt compelled to add a review, I had nothing to add...</li>
            <li> It is the best one out there and gives nails and nice, hard, glossy finish.</li>
            <li> The kit also comes with a funnel thingy for easy refills.  </li>
            <li> So smoooth and does not chip easily.</li>
            <li> I am always using my hands and my polish peels off so easily.</li>
            <li> I love this topcoat, and this is such a great deal.</li>
            <li> and my nails remain strong.</li>
            <li> I liked this when I first got it</li>
            <li> Just make sure you also get some along the edge of your nail because if you don&#x27;t, you run the risk of it peeling (although this is true of any polish).</li>
            <li> good price for a product that works, nice smooth glossy finish that actually lasts.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is hands down the best topcoat I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Ideally, I do my nail polish sometime before bed, let it dry for about 15 minutes and after that I can go to bed and not get sheet marks.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s super shiny!</li>
            <li> I go threw this top coat so quickly.</li>
            <li> It is quick drying and seals the polish in so well!</li>
            <li> Super glossy!</li>
            <li> Fast Top Coat High Shine nail polish works great.</li>
            <li> I have used many quick dry top coats, seche vite is by far the best top coat ever.</li>
            <li> This is the best fast dry top coat I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat fast dry nail polish ive ever owned!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of DIY manis / pedis and used to use the OPI topcoat.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go light with the Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> The Price Is fantastic and I have been telling everyone to get it from this sellers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is by far the best top coat I have used in the last 30 years.  </li>
            <li> It applies evenly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I filled a bottle for my friend</li>
            <li> Okay, I rarely do this</li>
            <li> My wife and my daughter really enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> Great purchase since individual bottles cost upwards of 4.99 at some retailers.</li>
            <li> so if you lightly tap it or smudge it, it will stay put.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t have any available in my country</li>
            <li> Great value and it last for months!</li>
            <li> Second time buying this &amp; its a great deal.</li>
            <li> Very quick-drying; nice glossy shine.</li>
            <li> This is the best transparent coat I&#x27;ve use in many years working professionally and personally on nails.</li>
            <li> Great price and product, I really like how fast it dries.</li>
            <li> Love it, almost as much as H K Girl Top coat.  </li>
            <li> This product looks so good, that everyone comments and believes I went to the salon to have my nails professionally done.</li>
            <li> It works amazingly well, dries super fast, and leaves a glossy finish!</li>
            <li> Some nail polishes will peel right off no matter what top coat you use.  </li>
            <li> It makes my nail polish dry very quickly and the shine Is great.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best fast-dry top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I had seen a lot of great reviews for this product, but it wasn&#x27;t until I got to try it myself, that I realized its true potential!</li>
            <li> I love Seche Vite because it dries so quickly and keeps my manicures in good shape (better than other topcoats I&#x27;ve tried, including Orly Won&#x27;t Chip).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this top coat!</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish makes it shine and drys very fast</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t own this I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Live love love this product.</li>
            <li> BEST WAY TO BUY THE SECHE&#x27; VITE DRY FAST TOPCOAT...</li>
            <li> I was dubious about seche vite at first thinking this top coat may not be the god send that everyone claims.  </li>
            <li> My favorite fast drying topcoat!  </li>
            <li> This is soooo worth every cent!</li>
            <li> so I added a second coat on top of the top coat and put the top coat over that.</li>
            <li> #34;clean up&amp;#34; the lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Here is my review when I bought my first 0.5 oz Top Coat: &amp;</li>
            <li> If you use this top coat I recommend this product because it will save you so much money &amp; time!</li>
            <li> I recently decided to start doing my own manicures again, and I had to get Seche Vite top coat.</li>
            <li> But the biggest downside to seche vite however is that it shrinks most of my nail polishes (mainly essie and sinful colors), it seems to do fine with my opi&#x27;s though.</li>
            <li> Has funnel included, but just as easy to pour right to bottle.</li>
            <li> Great for people who can&#x27;t wait around for nails to dry like me!</li>
            <li> Amazing top coat super shiny and drys almost instantly.</li>
            <li> nothing special about it,</li>
            <li> Right now we&#x27;re at about 45 min since I applied, and I can press my polish with one of my fingernails and it doesn&#x27;t give at all!</li>
            <li> for a first time user of this product its way more then i expected i love the top coat!</li>
            <li> Super protective when I want to have fun with my nails!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years and love how fast it dries.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully you will try it (if you haven&#x27;t already) and love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how fast it dries.</li>
            <li> contacted Amazon regarding this and offered as a solution/compromise for the inconvenience, I&#x27;d accept a refund for the difference in price from the time I purchased it ($19.50) to the current price ($16.28) which the rep agreed would be fair and communicated this to the seller.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller responded to say they do not price match and processed a full refund - never even addressed the fact that they hadn&#x27;t even bothered to ship my item yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is a fast drying top coat it literally creates strings from it</li>
            <li> It is very affordable and you get more bang for your buck if you purchase the 4oz refill bottle.</li>
            <li> I brought this product after looking for fast drying top coats</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m inlove with this fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li> Manicure is in good condition all week even when working physically.</li>
            <li> It dries very very quick and keeps your nail polish nice for several days.  </li>
            <li> There is no other top coat that compare to this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails for years and consider a quick dry top coat a necessity.  </li>
            <li> It protects nail art with an incredibly shiny layer of \\&quot;armor\\&quot;, quickly reaches a dry-to-the-touch stage and, unlike most other top coats, doesn&#x27;t streak the acrylic paint often used in nail designs (once the paint is dry, of course).</li>
            <li> Nails dry really quick and adds a nice shine!</li>
            <li> But the product drys out quickly.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and protects my polish.</li>
            <li> Dries nails so quickly plus makes them super shiny.</li>
            <li> putting on this top coat actually makes nail art look better.</li>
            <li> Shiny and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> also received it quickly and of course the price is right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries SO FAST and leaves such a great shine.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite top coat, so why not order the giant bottle?</li>
            <li> Would highly highly recommend this product if you are one for top coats.</li>
            <li> It truly is incredible how fast it drys and with such a large refill bottle you won&#x27;t have to worry about running out for a while.</li>
            <li> Dries pretty quick, even if I do my nails before bedtime and keeps them shinny chip free for over a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat for many years, and I have to say it&#x27;s my favorite nail product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This top coat makes your nails so shiny, dries extremely fast (with is super important with a toddler), and just makes your manicure really come together.  </li>
            <li> compared to OPI its light and applies consistently and evenly.</li>
            <li> Its true that this polish can be used on top of not so dry polish as a top coat</li>
            <li> I ran out and went to the drug store and bought a top coat for while I waited to get my new bottle</li>
            <li> The best quick dry ever in a larger bottle</li>
            <li> Quickly dries polish minimizing dings and smudges, keeps polish looking fresh and helps minimize chips.</li>
            <li> the product would make the nail polish underneath more brittle so that my polish chipped a lot faster than if I didn&#x27;t use the quick dry top coat at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not dry out and the brush has a nice fan to it when applying the polish.</li>
            <li> This kit is well worth it because I can see me going through it fairly quick.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat it leaves my nails for a long time</li>
            <li> This set is the best value as well (compared to paying at least $10 just for the .5 oz bottle)!</li>
            <li> Ordered this refill set as a replacement for my past bottle of Seche Vite, just as good as ever!  </li>
            <li> did recently ruin a fresh manicure because I made the bed within about 20 minutes of applying Seche Vite, which smooshed the polish at the tips, so I now have a pretty good idea what I can</li>
            <li> My clients are always on the go , so I am  glad to help them be on their way with a speed dry top coat.</li>
            <li> Perfect for me, I have a toddler &amp; infant I don&#x27;t have time to sit around and wait for my nails to dry, plus it helps my polish last longer.</li>
            <li> Second, the price is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have naturally long lashes, but they are not too full, so these provide a great natural look for me.</li>
            <li> 9 bottles worth of product cheaper than 2 anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Seche Restore is a must for any polish loving female out there.</li>
            <li> It makes your nails feel like they have gel or a professional manicure, and it really helps keep yuur nails looking nice for longer</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this top coat and am ecstatic that I found a refill online for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love a good deal and I&#x27;m obsessed with this top coat.  </li>
            <li> So worth every dollar....</li>
            <li> Reapply often to keep manicure fresh.  </li>
            <li> The polish itself is by far my favorite topcoat, but the refilling is a bit tricky since the refill bottle is glass, so you can&#x27;t squeeze it like it feels like you need to.</li>
            <li> and so glad I got the professional size.</li>
            <li> I swear no matter what top coat I picked up my nails never dried.</li>
            <li> By far my favoite top coat.</li>
            <li> This is a 4oz bottle for refills, plus a .5oz bottle, so it&#x27;s basically worth $63.</li>
            <li> Entirely worth it.</li>
            <li> It is why most people still think I am getting my nails done professionally.  </li>
            <li> (you will be amazed, trust me), and it rarely, rarely chips.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite top coat because of its high shine &amp; super fast drying time.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best top coat I have ever used, and I have used a lot of different brands (from drug store to premier department store brands).</li>
            <li> , I gotta say it totally became my favorite top coat, but the price was really high, even on sale over $5 a bottle</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this Seche Vite Dry-fast top coat for my last three manicures and it consistently keeps my nails chip-free for over a week -- regardless of whether I use a &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; brand or cheap brand.  </li>
            <li> Only give 4 because I thought these would look a bit more like another pair of wispies that I have, more dramatic for special occasions, but these are still great.</li>
            <li> I love it because it&#x27;s really fast drying and for its high shine result.</li>
            <li> I can do my nails right before bed</li>
            <li> However if you use it under the polish it will peel right off...</li>
            <li> It will also just peel right off.</li>
            <li> The Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat High Shine Professional Kit is a great value.</li>
            <li> Very strong smell but doesn&#x27;t really last any longer</li>
            <li> There is NO other top coat.</li>
            <li> This has prolonged my manicures like no other top coat has before.</li>
            <li> Good value and Dry fast.</li>
            <li> it dries super quick and has a high gloss shine.</li>
            <li> in this case there is some products here which apparently are not so healthy.</li>
            <li> For the price of a half ounce bottle I got the equivalent of five bottles, plus a handy funnel top that screws onto the refill bottle for tidy refilling of my half ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> I, at first, blamed it on the seche vite, but this year, my nails started growing out strong, probably because of these new vitamins I am taking.</li>
            <li> I think the packaging could be a little different, but overall I will still give it 5 stars because its a great product for an amazing value!</li>
            <li> I love it that it can be applied to nail polish that is not completely dry yet,</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super high quality containers!  </li>
            <li> And the shine lasts for days, most top coats need to be reapplied every few days to keep the shine.</li>
            <li> you really have to cut the funnel wide to get a good flow when you want to refill.</li>
            <li> It makes your manicure look like gel polish and dries super fast.</li>
            <li> This refill kit gives you 9 bottles worth for only $5 more.</li>
            <li> It dries my nails in only a few minutes and gives it that perfect shine.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Dries them SUPER fast.</li>
            <li> It dries quick and is very glossy.</li>
            <li> and it is my favorite one so far and since the bottle finishes pretty fast</li>
            <li> It keeps my polish on longer, stronger and more vibrant than any other top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> very fast drying.  </li>
            <li> This kit is an amazing deal, considering a single bottle can cost me $10!</li>
            <li> First off, I love this stuff, it makes even a gel coat dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to anything else because this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that not only creates a beautiful shine, but truly dries quickly!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m only buying this kit from here on out, such an amazing deal!</li>
            <li> I can not talk highly enough about this top coat.</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; thick which is an absolute must in a TOP coat.</li>
            <li> And it really does drive fully in five minutes!</li>
            <li> will be back for more.</li>
            <li> Definitely won&#x27;t work with Julep, but I&#x27;ve yet to find a top coat that doesn&#x27;t make the polish come off in one piece yet.</li>
            <li> My manicure holds up better when I do it myself at home, and I would bet that it&#x27;s because the salons use a lesser quality topcoat.  </li>
            <li> and I thought the recipient would like a bigger bottle better than the .5 oz seche, and tried this</li>
            <li> It would be better to receive the packages in an actual box instead of an envelope.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the only top coat I&#x27;ll use on my nails.</li>
            <li> Thank u for the fast shopping!</li>
            <li> Funny thing happened.</li>
            <li> I went on U Tube and read the 5 things to make your nail polish look great and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Only top coat I use.</li>
            <li> Exactly what is pictured.</li>
            <li> I know that is actually fast drying and has loads of shine!</li>
            <li> Bought the Restore Thinner so that I&#x27;ll be able to use every last drop.</li>
            <li> Fast and reliable seller and delivery!</li>
            <li> It makes your mani rock solid in five minutes, no matter how many layers of polish you have on your nail.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s FREAKY FAST!</li>
            <li> I am going on my second week and most of my nails still look perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Photo 2 &#x3D; Day 10 (no retouching or second application of top</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t love about it is the smell</li>
            <li> I have tried many others but this one is not only Affordable its reliable!  </li>
            <li> and I only use Seche Vite top coat.</li>
            <li> I paint my nails every two days and still have tons of top coat left.</li>
            <li> It really hardens the nails in a way that allows you to keep your manicure fresh for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Bottle &amp; refill lasted me a whole year!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to do the gel you definitely should go with this top coat.  </li>
            <li> First off, in my area a 0.5 ounce bottle of Seche goes for about $6</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be sure to follow the instructions and refill the smaller container as soon as it gets to be 3/4.  </li>
            <li> so it seems like you could attach it to the top of the big bottle,</li>
            <li> This stuff dries so quickly, is lovely and glossy, and after doing my nails one night, I didn&#x27;t wake up the next morning with sheet prints on my nails!</li>
            <li> My only dislike is that this polish turns white tips with acrylic yellow but over polish it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> materials\\&quot; especially since the stink of toluene, butyl and phthalate was overwhelming -</li>
            <li> it works fabulous and dries super quick and with a high gloss....will definitely order again</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for frequent users -- I go through this bottle in about 5 months if I paint my nails every day, half if pedicures are included.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast Dry top coats have a tendency to get goopy because of their fast dry nature, and the Seche Restore will keep the consistency good as you refill your bottle</li>
            <li> this is what nail salons use to make your nails perfect and last a long time and dry quickly.</li>
            <li> Only down side is the smell but this top coat is soo amazing</li>
            <li> , I usually polish right before going to bed and wake up smudge free :)</li>
            <li> It is the only fast drying top coat</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re brand loyal as I am  you won&#x27;t be disappointed with getting a pretty generous supply of THE best quick drying topcoat ever.  </li>
            <li> The only fast drying top coat that I will use.  </li>
            <li> The price was also great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issue(s): Very strong smell, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Pretty much text book results for me.</li>
            <li> Investing in the refill is pretty much required if you are like me.</li>
            <li> It leaves a gorgeous, slick shine too.</li>
            <li> The low price and quick delivery are also super.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several high end top coats ( from Dior to Chanel) and nothing in comparison to this one.</li>
            <li> Very glossy, dries very fast and extends my DIY manicures very well.</li>
            <li> It shrinks a little bit, so if you make a mistake while polishing, the top coat will fix it for you!  </li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t need to buy more for a very long time.</li>
            <li> so I took an empty OPI top coat bottle (I clean out my old bottles when they run out</li>
            <li> This does have a tendency to dry out a bit, but adding more to the bottle fixes that problem.</li>
            <li> My polish is dry to the touch within seconds of applying the top coat.  </li>
            <li> Put a fairly large bead on the nail and almost push it around with the brush rather than painting it on like polish.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying Seche Restore (a thinner) to go with it since the bottle is large and it will thicken before you are finished.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it dries multiple layers very quickly and leaves your nails with a very high gloss finish.  </li>
            <li> My go to fast dry top coat when Im in a hurry....</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve tried Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat, I&#x27;m done looking at anything else.</li>
            <li> ONE OF THE RULES WAS TO USE SECHE VITE FAST DRY TOP COAT</li>
            <li> Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat is a must-have for the hobby nail artist.</li>
            <li> I use seche vite dry fast top coat</li>
            <li> cant paint my nails without a fast dry top coat.</li>
            <li> Other than that and some lower quality polishes, this works perfectly and helps my manis last as long as I let them.</li>
            <li> does have a strong scent, but man does it dry fast!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, every single thing!</li>
            <li> And this set is a huge bargain, especially if you paint your nails as often as I do!</li>
            <li> And it dries FAST too.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Seche Vite</li>
            <li> And very glossy too.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you use it while your nail polish is still wet so that you don&#x27;t get any shrinkage.</li>
            <li> You really have to glob it on though.</li>
            <li> They have really fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;0)</li>
            <li> Really finishes a manicure.</li>
            <li> Shipped in a reasonable amount of time and heck</li>

            <li> Def dries fast</li>
            <li> It also shrinks the nail polish so much that after one day you can just pull the polish off in one pull.</li>
            <li> and it dries fast.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast</li>
            <li> and they absolutely swear by this product.</li>
            <li> , I found out it was MUCH cheaper here even with shipping</li>
            <li> you face any issues with shrinkage at the tip of the nail as the formula thickens over time, take a second to run the brush over the free edge of the nail, reducing visible tipwear.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m absolutely blown away by this topcoat.  </li>
            <li> My polish stays on so much longer as well.  </li>
            <li> I like the way it dries fast.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Dries fast and shiny.</li>
            <li> I go thru it so fast.</li>
            <li> Either the straight topcoat or the start to finish top&amp;base coat.</li>
            <li> It turns out to be the real deal</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Takes all the flaws out of your manicure and dries so fast.</li>
            <li> Saves money and you don&#x27;t have to reorder so much.</li>
            <li> It dries super fast and helps everything underneath dry quickly to(if</li>
            <li> I really like Seche Vite topcoat</li>
            <li> Fast drying...</li>
            <li> Now I can refill my bottles for sooo much lessss than buying a 1/2 ounce bottle at the store.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore Seche Vite and have used it for a couple years now.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast.  </li>
            <li> It dries so fast and leaves the shiniest shine.</li>
            <li> the bottles are not broken.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever, drys fast, and no chipping.</li>
            <li> Dries fast but still have to wait awhile</li>
            <li> Dries as fast as they claim.</li>
            <li> Use plastic, like the rest of the modern world of chemical supplies.</li>
            <li> Dries super fast and there is no other that shines like</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a new fast dry top coat, your answer is here</li>
            <li> Completely revitalizes old polish to its original state.</li>
            <li> This one is easy to use, dry fast.</li>
            <li> Would never use any other top coat.</li>
            <li> It smooths out my polish, is ultra glossy, and dries nails faster than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Lasts longer and other top coat I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> then other top coats I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> For nailheads like me, having access to an endless supply of Seche Vite (or their favorite fast-dry topcoat) is required.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wasting my time on other top coats.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other top coat again.</li>
            <li> I have to say it does smell very strongly, but that little downfall doesn&#x27;t last long and is a very minimal consequence for this amazing top coat.</li>
            <li> Very quick dry.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly because of how fast the drying time is.</li>
            <li> They only thing is that you&#x27;ll need the Seche Restore to keep this topcoat fresh (the ingredient that makes it fast drying also evaporates very easily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just got into doing nails and was looking for a decent top coat to help my pretty designs stay on as long as possible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes, if I want my polish to last a little longer, I&#x27;ll add another coat of the top coat mid-week (3-4 days after the original application).</li>
            <li> and it is like having a brand new bottle!</li>
            <li> I have gone through 2 bottles of SV Dry Fast Top Coat and finally decided to go ahead and invest in the large refill bottle because I know I&#x27;ll use it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally I also use orly bonder(rubber base coat), but I too always have flawless home done nails that I am able to change every 3-4 days, even with 5 kids, since I can be done in 10min flat-</li>
            <li> product arrived with a slight delay from the shipper, but was safely packaged and unopened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> Having this kit makes it almost possible and for the prices on Amazon, it makes a much better deal than buying individual bottles of Seche Vite!</li>
            <li> surprised how cheap this was that i actually became a bit suspicious but placed the order anyhow.</li>
            <li> This is 4.5 fl oz&#x27;s overall and is only 4 dollars more.</li>
            <li> the end of the little bottle, the top coat mite get a little thick, so i recommend using nail polish thinner or just refilling the bottle :D</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used bargain brands and insanely high priced products.</li>
            <li> Definitely highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the .5 ounce size(at a somewhat high price) before I knew about this economy size of 4 ounces.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> It gives a high gloss shine.</li>
            <li> It dries ALL the layers of polish unlike other fast dry top coats which just dry the top coat.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t get thick and clumpy as some fast dry top coats tend to get.</li>
            <li> It was better than I expected!!!</li>
            <li> I am surprised how fast it dries.</li>
            <li> I am by no means a professional, but I go through so much of this stuff that this kit saved me a ton of money.</li>
            <li> The economy size refill is worth every fluid oz.</li>
            <li> I chose to purchase from this seller because a bottle is about $10 in stores and for a few dollars more</li>
            <li> 10 dollars for SV when I normally purchase the .5 fl oz bottle.</li>
            <li> This stuff really protects a fresh nail polish job far beyond what I thought possible.</li>
            <li> It can still get some dents and deformities if heavily stressed in the first couple of hours, but within a few minutes, the finish is virtually impervious to most light dings and bumps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and thick too.</li>
            <li> It stays super shiny for at least a full week straight without having to touch up.</li>
            <li> I applied Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat over a Julep polish, and I would say within 5 min it was dry to the touch.</li>
            <li> It offers a deep wet look that dries quickly (doesn&#x27;t need uv light) and offers chip proof protection for days and days.</li>
            <li> so I still considered buying the other one when I could because its cheap</li>
            <li> Nearly ruined my brush messing with the funnel, finally threw it away and just poured straight from the bottle, took a whole 5 seconds!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product.  </li>
            <li> if you have a little one that wants pretty nails, this product is a MUST!!</li>
            <li> It smooths everything out (which is great if you do nail art because layering nail polish can get quite clumpy), dries crazy fast</li>
            <li> But regarding the finish - tremendous, inm out the door is not even close neither in dry speed nor in gloss power.</li>
            <li> quick dry polish I&#x27;ve ever used, and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m set for awhile with this quick dry.</li>
            <li> way it works for me is if my apply it to tacky slightly wet polish and wrap the tips (with the last coat of polish and the top</li>
            <li> so I just carefully poured it without the special tip, no problems at all.</li>
            <li> I order this several times a year because it&#x27;s simply the best topcoat out there, but can be a bit expensive depending on where you live.</li>
            <li> Looks professional for days!  </li>
            <li> Nothing else beats the quick dry and shine and finish that this gives!  </li>
            <li> So glad I bought the package instead of just the small bottle.  </li>
            <li> Nails look professional and shiny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m interested to see if the big refill bottle will thicken like seche vite is known to do.</li>
            <li> Apply a second top coat during the second day of manicure to make it last  2wks with no chipping.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong</li>
            <li> it dries wet polish so fast and lasts so long, I now have 2 drawers full of COLOR and loooove it!</li>
            <li> It dries lightening fast and really protects the polish for a long time - 1 month for toes and 10 days for nails.  </li>
            <li> but it sets quickly enough that you can get going much faster than normal.</li>
            <li> The actual box the refill is in is good but the way it was packaged to be delivered to my house was not good at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this brand for a few reasons, mostly because Sally was out of my usual product Speed Demon by Nail Life because it was on sale and whenever they run a sale it just flies off the shelf because people like me buy like 3 bottles, and Seche Vite was also on sale but available and my stamp blogger friends recommended this for stamping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i read some review here where the person is ranting about the bottles being broken for SURE!</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty strong and appalling as well.</li>
            <li> Love this product and love that there is a refill available because it was starting to get a bit expensive buying the small bottles all the time.</li>
            <li> I got this large bottle plus a regular bottle!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see this on Amazon, I almost fell over in shock to see that I could get a 4oz bottle and a 1/2oz polish bottle with brush for LESS than what I pay for just the 1/2oz bottle at the salon.  </li>
            <li> guess losing a little over $20 made more sense to the seller than just refunding the $3.22 difference and following through with shipping my item.</li>
            <li> I take my nail regimen pretty seriously and this is the ONLY top coat I use.</li>
            <li> Over time, the smaller bottle will start to thicken up and get kind of stringy, as what usually happens with any polish that gets used often, especially when its a quick dry product, and the Vite Revive does what it says.  </li>
            <li> if using more than one color on a nail, the colors would smear into each other, even if the nail polish was dry to the touch, and 3.</li>
            <li> By the time you get done with one foot the other is already dry, feel free to polish nails before bed now!</li>
            <li> I had an older bottle that i&#x27;ve been struggling to get every last drop out of, and once i opened the new stuff</li>
            <li> I am a busy mom of 4 boys and a girl all involved in sports and outdoors.  </li>
            <li> It is frequently used in salons.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing nails for nearly 40 years now.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how much it improves any nail color you use, no matter the price.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> I change my polish frequently</li>
            <li> This is very affordable especially when you buy the bottle plus the 4oz refill.</li>
            <li> Dries amazingly fast and has made my manicures last five times longer than they were before!</li>
            <li> Drys fast and keeps my pedicure lasting for weeks.</li>
            <li> It is shiny, dries fast and keeps my nail polish on several days longer.</li>
            <li> IF you buy it in the store you will pay the price for this whole set for the tiny bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have 2 young daughters(3 &amp; 2)  </li>
            <li> Buying this bottle is much much much cheaper than buying individual bottles.</li>
            <li> Dries extra fast to the touch</li>
            <li> made my manicure last much longer.</li>
            <li> just because it thickens fast enough.</li>
            <li> Very fast dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super shiny, and keeps my manicures looking good for  at least 5 days without chips (hard to know if they last longer than this because I change my nails a lot).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t shied away from using my nails to pry open battery covers or scrape off sink smudges or do anything I would normally do.</li>
            <li> It came in like 3 business days and compared to how much a .5 oz regular bottle is where I live</li>
            <li> It really brings out the color in my polish and helps it dry faster.</li>
            <li> It really does dry all your fingernail polish all at once.</li>
            <li> So much easier than waiting 30 minutes for a completely dry nail.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s healthy for long term use</li>
            <li> The bonus is it&#x27;s ability to allow multiple coats of different brands of lacquer to dry ever so quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is too expensive at the drug store, so the refill supply is a fantastic and economical idea.</li>
            <li> With this stuff, I can put two coats of OPI (or another brand with similar coverage / consistency), top it with a coat of Seche Vite and in 60 seconds or less I can go on with my day (or go to sleep) without risking a single smudge / sheet mark on my nails.  </li>
            <li> Polish is expensive and this investment makes sure it lasts!</li>
            <li> If do my nail at home, it will help me to achieve the same effect as professional nail salon!</li>
            <li> the refill bottle is a major savings.</li>
            <li> Refilling my little bottle the first time was a pain!</li>
            <li> By the time I&#x27;m painting the last nail, the first one I painted is dry.</li>
            <li> You just add a few drops to the smaller bottle and it returns the polish to its original condition.  </li>
            <li> The amount of nail polish you use may push that time up or down a little bit, but still much better than others I have tried.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic tip</li>
            <li> I have never used any top coat that dried this fast and this hard.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more brands than I can remember, some good, some bad, but all of them had three things in common</li>
            <li> I generally have to use 8-10.</li>
            <li> so I use my hands a lot and am not careful about my nails.  </li>
            <li> people put there butter knife in to get it to pour, I even cut the end and it barely drips out</li>
            <li> I am an indie polish maker, and I use Seche Vite over nearly all of my manicures.</li>
            <li> so I had to order it online, and I have no regrets.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m currently participating in a twice-weekly nail art challenge, so I change my nail polish frequently.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparent my postal carrier hates me because I report her every time she mis-delivers or damages my mail - so now she apparently uses my packages as a football..</li>
            <li> Product is OK but poorly packaged.  </li>
            <li> After 80% is filled up, slowly decrease the amount of speed, by lifting the bottle up gradually.</li>
            <li> I used to think no nail polish was truly &amp;#34;chip-resistant&amp;#34; no matter how expensive or how popular the brand was.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other brands and this one is the only one I have found that stays high gloss, truly dries fast, protects my polish, stays on and adds thickness to my nails .</li>
            <li> it does exactly what it says, nails stay super shiny and they dry in like a minute seriously.</li>
            <li> Overall I like it for its fast dry and glossy look.</li>
            <li> I have zero bad things to say about this top coat!!</li>
            <li> It is long lasting and dry very fast, under 5 minutes for 2 coats of color nail polish.</li>
            <li> Helps nail color dry extremely quickly (2 minutes or less).</li>
            <li> Thinking that it probably will never dry now..</li>
            <li> I keep two small bottles one for when I do reds the other I keep clear for light colors.</li>
            <li> so , forget about waiting forever to have your nail polish dry completely.</li>
            <li> When I refilled the first time, I ended up having to poke a few holes in the plastic nozzle to allow for airflow for proper pouring.</li>
            <li> but it is also way cheaper to buy it in this large size and refill the little bottle.</li>
            <li> High shine, quick dry and adds some thickness to my weak nails.</li>
            <li> It gives you a mirror shine finish every time, dries super fast, can be used over nail art such as Konad and other products (it wont cause the nail art to bleed), it works with fake or real nails and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> Any gal with a large collection of polishes is bound to have a few go \\&quot;lumpy\\</li>
            <li> Manicures that would normally take 20 mins to dry are completely dry in 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s better than Sally Hansen&#x27;s topcoat, this one seems to dry slower, and is definitely less glossy.</li>
            <li> one thing I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered it is that the large bottle is glass and even though it comes with that handy spout thing, it&#x27;s useless when you put it on the bottle because you can&#x27;t squeeze glass and the seche vite is so thick it will not come out with the spout on.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well that will work when the large bottle gets low in supply</li>
            <li> I had trouble with the &amp;#34;nozzle&amp;#34; thingie, but found if I just set it upside down on the smaller bottle, I could dump the larger bottle into the funnel and it goes right</li>
            <li> I did not receive the smaller cap though to make pouring easier, and instead of a clear .5 oz polish I got a really dark nail lacquer.</li>
            <li> If you put this on nail polish that is not completely dry, it will bond with the nail polish and make it dry quicker.  </li>
            <li> My nails last four a long time,</li>
            <li> I recommend this for a long lasting topcoat.will not peel or chip on acrilic nails.</li>
            <li> IT LAST SOOOOO LONG...</li>
            <li> A base coat and a top coat really help my manicures last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> It actually does dry quickly, but be careful not to dent your manicure for at least 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this product, I read other reviews saying that it was a little thick and tacky for them..</li>
            <li> I end up just pouring it straight from the glass bottle to the small bottle and so far I have luckily not had any messes.</li>
            <li> key is to use it before your nails are completely dry.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re dry almost instantly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wear color because of the time it took to dry each coat and the almost guaranteed chipping the next day.</li>
            <li> When you move to paint the next hand the one you finished is dry 💅</li>
            <li> Definitely helps nailpolish to dry faster.</li>
            <li> weak point is it also quick dry in the bottle.</li>
            <li> then you&#x27;ll be holding the refill bottle upside down for a long time with very little success.</li>
            <li> I am very impatient when I do intricate nail art with stamps or tape, so I apply a coat of SV and a few minutes later my nail is dry enough to do fun stuff.</li>
            <li> Penetrates through 2 coats of polish to dry your nails in 5 minutes flat.</li>
            <li> I am an 8 year nail tech , but have been doing nails for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to try this.  </li>
            <li> It also gives my nails some much-needed strength and they&#x27;re growing so long now.</li>
            <li> As long as Seche Vite is in production, I&#x27;ll never use another brand again.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t polished my nails in so long</li>
            <li> 2 coats of opi Minnie mouse pink, a coat of seche vite and off they go in under 5min, with a &amp;#34;manicure&amp;#34; that will last 3-5 days even with the abuse of a toddler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since the filter can get clogged up, by the old solution dried up residue.</li>
            <li> I find that the thick band helps make the lashes last, especially when cleaning off old glue to reuse.</li>
            <li> This is authentic Seche Vite - I&#x27;m not going to lie, I was a little skeptical due to the low price.</li>
            <li> Small bottles are much more expensive at local beauty stores.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Dries to a hard, high gloss finish</li>
            <li> Seche Vite Dry</li>
            <li> it topped off with this Seche Vite Dry</li>
            <li> Just wait it dry for 1-2 minutes!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a mommy of 3, I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to wait for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li> I decided to JUST put THE SECHE dry Coat over it to EVEN out the POLISH.</li>
            <li> and it still wouldn&#x27;t be dry.</li>
            <li> It DOES dry</li>
            <li> it is dry all the way through.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t already dry).</li>
            <li> It starts drying within seconds of applying and its completely dry within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> NO CHIPPING and the dry time is virtually 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;d always leave that dry for 20 minutes or so before I did anything.  </li>
            <li> (i was worried it would be a leaky plastic bottle that would dry out.)</li>
            <li> The product seems a bit old, it is definitely on the thick side.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine buying a single bottle of Seche Vite ever again.</li>
            <li> Single.</li>
            <li> Although the texture is thick and needs to be thinned out halfway through the bottle, it helps dry polish on hands, keep it glossy and shiny, and seals the polish so it doesn&#x27;t chip as quickly as it normally would.  </li>
            <li> I threw my old bottle out and now I notice it comes without a brush for the small bottle</li>
            <li> The only down side is the price.</li>
            <li> it was around $5 different, and the other site didn&#x27;t even include shipping in that price!</li>
            <li> Seriously, couldn&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
            <li> Your nails are literally dry to the touch in 30 seconds!</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle over a year ago and I still have half of it left.</li>
            <li> In local stores, a half ounce bottle retails for around $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This seems to be a different formula than what I have used previously.  </li>
            <li> If you ping it it gives a little, but dry enough so that I am not chained to my desk.</li>
            <li> I use a coat of this every single time I paint my nails!</li>
            <li> I got over-confident because it felt completely dry to the touch, but actually it remains a little soft for a few hours while it cures, so you still need to be a little careful.</li>
            <li> This does dry your nail polish quickly, but it also causes my nail polish to completely come off in two days tops.  &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> For those nail artists/enthusiasts that like the wet look</li>
            <li> Received on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t believe I could put it on over wet polish but tried it anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After it&#x27;s dried is what makes it different from all the others.</li>
            <li> Apply over wet color, dries almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> Just patiently and carefully pour it in.</li>
            <li> Your polish will not chip for days especially if you reapply it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot about Seche Vite but never really saw it in stores</li>
            <li> I always like to keep some on stock base and top coat is an essential item to me</li>
            <li> This came with a little box which only have the 1/2 oz in it and like other review here who gave 1 star.</li>
            <li> I usually get the Restore thinner and thin it out a bit as it is extremely thick, but that is a small price to pay for how amazingly this works.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any other brand since Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> And the results are instant - nail polish is hardened and the gloss is unbelievable, like the glass itself.</li>
            <li> the funnel top is useless its like the dumb glass ketchup bottles in restaurants</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t recommend using it in a closed space!</li>
            <li> At our local Walmart, one small bottle runs around $8.  </li>
            <li> I do my nails about every other day</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use the filter plastic thing to transfer the solution from the big bottle to the small bottle.</li>
            <li> I like to place the funnel tip into the small bottle and then pour into the funnel from the big bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, yet dries so fast with a glass-like, hard as diamonds, finish.</li>
            <li> After that time, you still need to be little careful of extreme scratches or don&#x27;t sleep on your nails because the under layers are still drying.</li>
            <li> This product has made my life easier, i no longer have to wait hours sitting and waiting for my nails to properly dry, however if you are using tape designs i will advise that you wait about an hour or little longer to ensure the base coat does not peel off, Love this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seche Vite needs to get a clue and sell this product in PLASTIC like every other modern chemical supplier, especially if they&#x27;re going to ship it via USPS (which is probably illegal anyway, being a highly flammable and dangerous chemical concoction.) :PPPP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always hated painting my nails because other top coats took forever to dry.</li>
            <li> If you are skeptical that it dries fast</li>
            <li> Considering the average price of this on Amazon is around $14-15 for 4 ounces, you can do the math and see the value this is for any &amp;#34;Laquerista&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only negative thing about it is it doesn&#x27;t work with all my polishes.</li>
            <li> I globbed it on a little heavy, but it was still dry to the touch in a minute or so.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other topcoat!</li>
            <li> Very odd logic and not very professional.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will say about half way through the bottle It does start to shrink the manicure.</li>
            <li> This was introduced to me probably about a year and a half ago, and I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it before that.</li>
            <li> The refill though has little dark specks don&#x27;t know what they are</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t mess the designs.</li>
            <li> I found that about half way through the .5 oz bottle, it does tend to thicken, but its nothing a little nail polish thinner can&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> (I let each layer dry for at least 5 minutes),</li>
            <li> It did spill a little</li>
            <li> it makes it way easier to refill the little bottle.</li>
            <li> Add a few drops with the included dropper and shake the aging polish up.</li>
            <li> Still dried and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A total game changer for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails for years and the drying time is always horrible.  </li>
            <li> If it does, I guess I&#x27;ll be purchasing some seche restore to thin it back out.</li>
            <li> last time I grew my nails out, I would have given it a poor rating that the product did not deserve.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You do need to learn how to use it though because it might shrink if you apply to dried</li>
            <li> After it is dried, it gives a glass/gel finish.</li>
            <li> LESS then five!</li>
            <li> Before, I could barely go a day without chipping a nail, and now I can go an average of at least a week (usually, I get tired of the color by then).</li>
            <li> Chemistry is a complicated subject and this should be checked prior purchase.</li>
            <li> I take this product to the nail salon for my manicurist to use now as it preserves my manicure for a few days longer than usual.</li>
            <li> It sounds weird (and feels weird at first!)</li>
            <li> I was so tired of waiting for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li> WHILE YOUR NAILS ARE STILL WET!!!!</li>
            <li> They forgot to ship the small bottle and responded within hours and shipped it out.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure if it is the product orsomething in my hand soap  </li>
            <li> 2: I didn&#x27;t get the plastic thing to refill the small bottle easier.</li>
            <li> My daughter hates the small</li>
            <li> I usually apply two coats.</li>
            <li> I gave away the small bottle of SV to my sister so she didn&#x27;t keep using mine.</li>
            <li> So, I can either wait a few hours while the refill drips one painfully slow drop at a time to refill the small brush jar..</li>
            <li> You can use Restore to thin other nail polishes that have thickened too.</li>
            <li> Also leaves a hard and shiny surface.  </li>
            <li> but its become sticky and hard to use.</li>
            <li> I recommend Sally Hansen&#x27;s Hard as Nails which is about 3 or 4 dollars</li>
            <li> Dries rock hard in like 3 minutes, touchable after about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Shiny and hard as glass.  </li>
            <li> Nail polish dries within minutes to a hard shine.</li>
            <li> If you smudge it hard it will wrinkle, at least until an hour or two have passed and</li>
            <li> It does tend to get very thick about half way through the bottle!</li>
            <li> Now I get at least 3 days, sometimes 4.</li>
            <li> In terms of beauty at least.</li>
            <li> This product preserves my nail polish for  at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> but I much prefer Nail Tek Xtra or OPI Nail Envy as my base coat.  </li>
            <li> I have had it for over a year and it has not become thick or clumpy.  </li>
            <li> The box was wrapped in a thick sheet of bubble wrap and stuffed into a paper envelope....</li>
            <li> Gives that thick gel-ish look, smooths over glitter polishes.</li>
            <li> SV also adds a thick layer to set your manicure and protect your nails.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> You can also buy the Seche Restore drops if it gets too thick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, but it&#x27;s usually $10 for a small bottle, and difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about the quick-dry claims, but it performs as advertised.  </li>
            <li> But it gets expensive buying the little bottles.</li>
            <li> I am also going to try a different base coat because the Revlon Colorstay Gel-Smooth Base Coat got very thick very fast.</li>
            <li> Too bad they don&#x27;t hold the same priority level for shipping.</li>
            <li> I do nail designs on my nails and would get so frustrated when I take the time to do designs and they chip 2 days later.</li>
            <li> i mean seriously!</li>
            <li> I HATED the drug store bottle and threw it away as soon as my new bottle of seche vite came in.</li>
            <li> It is a game changer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Where my thinner says to use 3-4 drops to thin</li>
            <li> Now be warned if you go slowly applying this product you will get weird stringy stuff going on(because</li>
            <li> Bottle was broken and dripped all over the porch, foyer, etc.  </li>
            <li> I was properly using base coats and everything, but nothing would stay on my nails.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve grown tired of paying $7 for every bottle.</li>
            <li> And so, this glass arrived broken.</li>
            <li> Seriously, finding Seche Vite changed the nail game for me!</li>
            <li> Seriously?!  </li>
            <li> I do think this is a fake product as well.</li>
            <li> Or did I just bought a fake Seche Vite?</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> i believe this is a fake.</li>
            <li> What a mess!!!!!</li>
            <li> And pls amazon take this fake seller out of your website!</li>
            <li> I get bored with my toe nail color before it where&#x27;s off!</li>
            <li> but it was not to bad.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I tried Seche Vite&#x27;s Base Coat and it&#x27;s just</li>
            <li> The Seche Vite Restore product helps fix that issue, but it can be annoying.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t poke the holes (I used a safety pin, and made three holes in a triangular pattern toward the base of the nozzle)</li>
            <li> nails, rub with alcohol+cotton swab, Seche Vite base coat, 2-3 layers of polish</li>
            <li> Awful</li>
            <li> : the packaging is horrible.</li>

            <li> This is my favorite top coat!! It holds so well and gives nails an incredible shine. Plus it is a great price for the amount you get!</li>
            <li> People are not kidding when they praise this top coat. It is a game changer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is to use it before your nails are completely dry. Put a fairly large bead on the nail and almost push it around with the brush rather than painting it on like polish. It sounds weird (and feels weird at first!) but it sets quickly enough that you can get going much faster than normal.</li>
            <li> Very quick dry. But the product drys out quickly.</li>
            <li> The best quick dry ever in a larger bottle so i can refill my smaller bottles.  The price is un believable</li>
            <li> I am an 8 year nail tech , but have been doing nails for as long as I can remember. I have used many quick dry top coats, seche vite is by far the best top coat ever. My clients are always on the go , so I am  glad to help them be on their way with a speed dry top coat. They love it, and I will continue to purchase this wonderful product. Thanks, the price is great too.</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish makes it shine and drys very fast</li>
            <li> I was dubious about seche vite at first thinking this top coat may not be the god send that everyone claims.  I am now a believer!  This top coat drys in MINUTES! Not twenty minutes, not ten minutes...LESS then five! And the finish is so glossy it looks like glass.  For those nail artists/enthusiasts that like the wet look this is a must have!</li>
            <li> First off, I love this stuff, it makes even a gel coat dry quickly. Second, the price is amazing. What I have here is the equivalent of 9 bottles for the price of about 2 bottles in the beauty supply store. This is one of the best purchases that I&#x27;ve made in a long time!</li>
            <li> One of the best top coats out there. The shine is AWESOME and it LASTS. And it dries FAST too.</li>
            <li> I can not talk highly enough about this top coat. It is amazing. It keeps my polish on longer, stronger and more vibrant than any other top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. Would highly highly recommend this product if you are one for top coats. Nobody enjoys painting their nails and a day later seeing chipping or peeling. This top coat keeps just that from happening.</li>
            <li> This came with a little box which only have the 1/2 oz in it and like other review here who gave 1 star. I do think this is a fake product as well. I have been using their product for years and this one is just not the same. Don&#x27;t buy! And pls amazon take this fake seller out of your website! All those 5 star comments could be hired writer too!</li>
            <li> My favorite top coat.  It dries quickly and protects my polish.</li>
            <li> Will never buy another top coast ever again. Amazing!</li>
            <li> Received on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Great quality top coat that&#x27;s super shiny! Nice &amp; thick which is an absolute must in a TOP coat. I can get away with a cheaper nail polish but NOT a base and top coat.</li>
            <li> I always hated painting my nails because other top coats took forever to dry. I heard people rave about seche vite and have not switched since. Amazon does an amazing job giving its customers the best bargains and this is not an exception. 9 bottles worth of product cheaper than 2 anywhere else. I have to say it does smell very strongly, but that little downfall doesn&#x27;t last long and is a very minimal consequence for this amazing top coat. If you are looking for a new fast dry top coat, your answer is here</li>
            <li> I am a busy mom of 4 boys and a girl all involved in sports and outdoors.  We love to boat and play in the outdoors.  I have had the hardest time finding a top coat that will stay on through all the activity.  This has seemed to be the best I have tried and the company was great to work with.  They forgot to ship the small bottle and responded within hours and shipped it out.  Great customer service.</li>
            <li> Works as well as it claims!</li>
            <li> Great price and product, I really like how fast it dries.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any other brand since Seche Vite. It really brings out the color in my polish and helps it dry faster. My polish also lasts longer with Seche vite.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve painted my nails at night just to wake up with hair prints all over my nails. Not anymore!!! Thanks to Seche Vite I can do my nails right before bed and they&#x27;re dry almost instantly. By the time I&#x27;m painting the last nail, the first one I painted is dry. This stuff really is amazing! Do yourself a favor and just buy it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat High Shine is the most awesome nail top coat ever invented.  I had an older bottle that i&#x27;ve been struggling to get every last drop out of, and once i opened the new stuff my faith and love in this product was doubled--not that it was ever lagging in the first place, but how great to fall in love all over again with something you already love?  *swoon!*</li>
            <li> I am surprised how fast it dries. And very glossy too. My fingers have a tightness feeling once have this top coat on. I guess that&#x27;s from the ingredient they use to quicken the drying. Not sure if it&#x27;s healthy for long term use but I guess it won&#x27;t cause more harm since they did research on it. Overall I like it for its fast dry and glossy look.</li>
            <li> Best top coat! Just make sure you use it while your nail polish is still wet so that you don&#x27;t get any shrinkage.</li>
            <li> I will repurchase once I start running low on product. Would never use any other top coat. I LOVE this topcoat. Item was well packaged and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This topcoat is amazing! And it really does drive fully in five minutes! Do not hesitate to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Great top coat!  I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years and love how fast it dries.  Also leaves a hard and shiny surface.  Looks professional for days!  It does tend to get very thick about half way through the bottle!</li>
            <li> I used to be able to get about 6-8 hours out of a mani before it chipped. Now I get at least 3 days, sometimes 4. And that&#x27;s with me doing several loads of dishes by hand daily. You really have to glob it on though. Don&#x27;t go light with the Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat. Its the only one I use now. The Price Is fantastic and I have been telling everyone to get it from this sellers.&lt;br /&gt;It will keep your nail art design looking great for over 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I will be back for more. They have really fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;0)</li>
            <li> Good value and Dry fast. I love it that it can be applied to nail polish that is not completely dry yet, so , forget about waiting forever to have your nail polish dry completely. But it can shrink the nail polish at the tip(applying nail polish at the tip may help/avoid the shrinkage issue).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, but it&#x27;s usually $10 for a small bottle, and difficult to find.  It is an excellent, fast-drying top coat - and shiny.  It is frequently used in salons.  You will recognize the &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; of it.  Really finishes a manicure.</li>
            <li> Seche Restore is a must for any polish loving female out there. Any gal with a large collection of polishes is bound to have a few go \\&quot;lumpy\\&quot; after awhile. And in comes Seche Restore! Add a few drops with the included dropper and shake the aging polish up. Wa-lah! Completely revitalizes old polish to its original state. Polish is expensive and this investment makes sure it lasts!</li>
            <li> I do my own mani n pedi at home all the time.  I bought this value set a couple years ago and it&#x27;s still going strong! Seche Vite is my holy grail top coat.  Nothing else beats the quick dry and shine and finish that this gives!  I tried Seche Vite&#x27;s Base Coat and it&#x27;s just okay/nothing special about it, but I much prefer Nail Tek Xtra or OPI Nail Envy as my base coat.  But for top coat, don&#x27;t get anything else...  Seche Vite Top Coat is the way to go, no question! :)</li>
            <li> This one is easy to use, dry fast. If do my nail at home, it will help me to achieve the same effect as professional nail salon!</li>
            <li> In my opinion there isn&#x27;t a nail polish drying product out there that is as awesome as Seche Vite. I will continue to use this product for a very long time. Hopefully you will try it (if you haven&#x27;t already) and love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Love this product and love that there is a refill available because it was starting to get a bit expensive buying the small bottles all the time.</li>
            <li> My favorite fast drying topcoat!  It makes your nails feel like they have gel or a professional manicure, and it really helps keep yuur nails looking nice for longer</li>
            <li> Insanely good value for what you get - I can&#x27;t imagine buying a single bottle of Seche Vite ever again. I love this top coat, but it doesn&#x27;t work with all polishes. Definitely won&#x27;t work with Julep, but I&#x27;ve yet to find a top coat that doesn&#x27;t make the polish come off in one piece yet. Other than that and some lower quality polishes, this works perfectly and helps my manis last as long as I let them.</li>
            <li> As a top coat (as it is intended) this product is amazing.  Keeps the polish going for days and days.  However if you use it under the polish it will peel right off...taking all the polish with it.  Also don&#x27;t try using it alone just for shine.  It will also just peel right off.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Seche Vite! It smooths out my polish, is ultra glossy, and dries nails faster than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used. I use a coat of this every single time I paint my nails! Seriously, finding Seche Vite changed the nail game for me! I found that about half way through the .5 oz bottle, it does tend to thicken, but its nothing a little nail polish thinner can&#x27;t help. And this set is a huge bargain, especially if you paint your nails as often as I do!</li>
            <li> This is my Top Coat of choice</li>
            <li> great product and an even better price</li>
            <li> This is soooo worth every cent! It came well protected and wrapped. Shipped in a reasonable amount of time and heck it works great. I&#x27;m in nail top coat heaven!</li>
            <li> Live love love this product. High shine, quick dry and adds some thickness to my weak nails. The only problem I have had in the last year of using se he vite is that some times if I add a second coat a couole days later it will bubble up around the edges. Im not sure if it is the product orsomething in my hand soap  that is doing that though. I will continue to buy it and will absolutely refer my friends to it. I have tried several other brands and this one is the only one I have found that stays high gloss, truly dries fast, protects my polish, stays on and adds thickness to my nails .</li>
            <li> Love this top coat!  It is the best one out there and gives nails and nice, hard, glossy finish.</li>
            <li> Love it, almost as much as H K Girl Top coat.  This is a much better price, it falls within my budget and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Great fast drying top coat</li>
            <li> The best top coat, ever. Quickly dries polish minimizing dings and smudges, keeps polish looking fresh and helps minimize chips.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t believe I could put it on over wet polish but tried it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;It worked. One nail I didn&#x27;t like the coverage of the color so I added a second coat on top of the top coat and put the top coat over that. Still dried and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I found this product sooner...like 30 years ago :)</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat fast dry nail polish ive ever owned! Im so happy i found this huge amount. Such a awesome price too! I go threw this top coat so quickly. I love painting my nails. So happy!</li>
            <li> What an amazing buy for the price....My go to fast dry top coat when Im in a hurry.... Will purchase again, when I finally run out.</li>
            <li> Def dries fast but i haven&#x27;t found that it lessens chipping.</li>
            <li> This does as it says and dries fast and gives the polish a beautiful shine. I love this product.</li>
            <li> The worlds best top coat!  I have used this stuff for years and so do many nail salons.  I was so excited to see this on Amazon, I almost fell over in shock to see that I could get a 4oz bottle and a 1/2oz polish bottle with brush for LESS than what I pay for just the 1/2oz bottle at the salon.  The kit also comes with a funnel thingy for easy refills.  The kit recommends using Vite Revive when you refill, so I recommend ordering that as well.  I didn&#x27;t know it was recommended so I didn&#x27;t order it with the kit and had to order it separately, so keep that in mind when you order.  Over time, the smaller bottle will start to thicken up and get kind of stringy, as what usually happens with any polish that gets used often, especially when its a quick dry product, and the Vite Revive does what it says.  You just add a few drops to the smaller bottle and it returns the polish to its original condition.  You do this before you refill and it is like having a brand new bottle! I highly recommend this product.  It gives you a mirror shine finish every time, dries super fast, can be used over nail art such as Konad and other products (it wont cause the nail art to bleed), it works with fake or real nails and is long lasting. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  Dries immediately.</li>
            <li> Extrodinary thing, works magically. Once any polish is painted just immediately seche vite can be used. And the results are instant - nail polish is hardened and the gloss is unbelievable, like the glass itself. Whatever sins were during painting this top will fix and the finish will be smooth and shiny. But there is always something - in this case there is some products here which apparently are not so healthy. Chemistry is a complicated subject and this should be checked prior purchase. But regarding the finish - tremendous, inm out the door is not even close neither in dry speed nor in gloss power.</li>
            <li> I liked this when I first got it but its become sticky and hard to use. It also shrinks the nail polish so much that after one day you can just pull the polish off in one pull. Awful</li>
            <li> This is bar none the best top coat quick dry polish I&#x27;ve ever used, and the refill bottle is a major savings. This is worth every penny - I&#x27;d say GET IT !!</li>
            <li> Thanks to the great reviews, I bought this product.  It is by far the best top coat I have used in the last 30 years.  It applies evenly and smoothly.  I have had it for over a year and it has not become thick or clumpy.  I did buy the thinner just in case but have not had to use it yet.  It dries lightening fast and really protects the polish for a long time - 1 month for toes and 10 days for nails.  I&#x27;m a mom so I use my hands a lot and am not careful about my nails.  This helps them look manicured longer.</li>
            <li> This topcoat leaves my nails glossy, glossy, glossy. The bonus is it&#x27;s ability to allow multiple coats of different brands of lacquer to dry ever so quickly.  The economy size refill is worth every fluid oz.</li>
            <li> Works great one clear nail polish too. I recommend Sally Hansen&#x27;s Hard as Nails which is about 3 or 4 dollars it topped off with this Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat High Shine nail polish works great. Its true that this polish can be used on top of not so dry polish as a top coat and it dries fast. In case anyone is wondering no it doesn&#x27;t work as just nail polish it is strictly a top coat. It doesn&#x27;t turn a yellow color and stays on nails through things like dish washing and hand washing etc.... Lasts longer and other top coat I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff... definitely the best top coat that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is literally the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used!  And this kit was a great deal!  Shipped fast and it&#x27;s super high quality containers!  LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Good product, excellent value. I use this as my go to top coat. Shipped in good time. I would recommend this to anyone who keeps up a manicure.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Good size. Great price.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great value! My daughters love to paint their nails and they absolutely swear by this product. The only drawback is that it is spendy, when purchasing by the bottle. We were thrilled to find a cheaper option out there.</li>
            <li> Best topcoat in the history of ever.  I swear by Seche Vite for over ten years.  My manicure holds up better when I do it myself at home, and I would bet that it&#x27;s because the salons use a lesser quality topcoat.  I can&#x27;t find a salon that uses Seche Vite.  This is a helluva deal too.  I shouldn&#x27;t need to buy more for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have gone through 2 bottles of SV Dry Fast Top Coat and finally decided to go ahead and invest in the large refill bottle because I know I&#x27;ll use it.  Dries rock hard in like 3 minutes, touchable after about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Very strong smell but doesn&#x27;t really last any longer then other top coats I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I bought this brand for a few reasons, mostly because Sally was out of my usual product Speed Demon by Nail Life because it was on sale and whenever they run a sale it just flies off the shelf because people like me buy like 3 bottles, and Seche Vite was also on sale but available and my stamp blogger friends recommended this for stamping. I bought a bottle because it was an emergency, I needed some top coat to give as a gift and I only had one bottle of speed demon on hand I always like to keep some on stock base and top coat is an essential item to me and when I see a sale or a bulk size bottle or a great price I stock up, so I gave the stuff on hand away because it was a 1 oz bottle and I thought the recipient would like a bigger bottle better than the .5 oz seche, and tried this, I gotta say it totally became my favorite top coat, but the price was really high, even on sale over $5 a bottle so I still considered buying the other one when I could because its cheap, I accidentally came across this while searching for something else and I figured I&#x27;ll buy it from amazon with my gift card, I found out it was MUCH cheaper here even with shipping it was around $5 different, and the other site didn&#x27;t even include shipping in that price! I filled a bottle for my friend I figured its only like $2 to fill her up a .5 oz bottle so I gave her one plus I wanted to see how it poured so I took an empty OPI top coat bottle (I clean out my old bottles when they run out so I can mix my own colors) the funnel top is useless its like the dumb glass ketchup bottles in restaurants people put there butter knife in to get it to pour, I even cut the end and it barely drips out so I just carefully poured it without the special tip, no problems at all. I am guessing its because the refill bottle is made of glass. I think the packaging could be a little different, but overall I will still give it 5 stars because its a great product for an amazing value!</li>
            <li> Very fast dry. Save time for manicure. Just wait it dry for 1-2 minutes!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The weak point is it also quick dry in the bottle. What should i do?</li>
            <li> This is such a money saver! It came in like 3 business days and compared to how much a .5 oz regular bottle is where I live this is so much more worth the money!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle in a bottle.  It dries virtually instantly.  I have never used any top coat that dried this fast and this hard.  It leaves a gorgeous, slick shine too.</li>
            <li> Amazing top coat super shiny and drys almost instantly. Perfect for me, I have a toddler &amp; infant I don&#x27;t have time to sit around and wait for my nails to dry, plus it helps my polish last longer. My nails are always chipping since I&#x27;m constantly washing bottles and such. Definitely repurchasing.!</li>
            <li> Best fast top coat!  I use this all of the time!  Nails dry really quick and adds a nice shine!</li>
            <li> For nailheads like me, having access to an endless supply of Seche Vite (or their favorite fast-dry topcoat) is required.  Having this kit makes it almost possible and for the prices on Amazon, it makes a much better deal than buying individual bottles of Seche Vite!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several high end top coats ( from Dior to Chanel) and nothing in comparison to this one. This is the best top coat EVER! It dries in like 5 min, and you cannot top that. I put it on, put on my jacket and then out the door in no time without messing up my polishes. It stays super shiny for at least a full week straight without having to touch up. If this company ever discontinue this product, I will die.</li>
            <li> I threw my old bottle out and now I notice it comes without a brush for the small bottle &#x3D; doh!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing nails for nearly 40 years now. I&#x27;ve used bargain brands and insanely high priced products. Now that I&#x27;ve tried Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat, I&#x27;m done looking at anything else. It does fast just like it says it does which is great, but that&#x27;s not the reason I love it. After it&#x27;s dried is what makes it different from all the others. I have never seen a shinier top coat. It has to be seen to be believed. And the shine lasts for days, most top coats need to be reapplied every few days to keep the shine. Not with Seche Vite. I can&#x27;t say enough about how much it improves any nail color you use, no matter the price.</li>
            <li> I order this several times a year because it&#x27;s simply the best topcoat out there, but can be a bit expensive depending on where you live. This is a great deal for frequent users -- I go through this bottle in about 5 months if I paint my nails every day, half if pedicures are included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you face any issues with shrinkage at the tip of the nail as the formula thickens over time, take a second to run the brush over the free edge of the nail, reducing visible tipwear.</li>
            <li> This product makes your nails shine like a gel manicure. It truly is incredible how fast it drys and with such a large refill bottle you won&#x27;t have to worry about running out for a while.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal. I&#x27;m set for awhile with this quick dry.</li>
            <li> My nails are growing because I can keep the polish on for 5-7 days without the polish chipping.  Very happy with this product</li>
            <li> very fast drying.  you really have to cut the funnel wide to get a good flow when you want to refill.</li>
            <li> Okay, I rarely do this but I&#x27;m absolutely blown away by this topcoat.  Take it from a girl that at one point had over 100 bottles of nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this Seche Vite Dry-fast top coat for my last three manicures and it consistently keeps my nails chip-free for over a week -- regardless of whether I use a &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; brand or cheap brand.  While the lustre starts to fade by about Day 3 or 4, I haven&#x27;t managed to chip it yet. I haven&#x27;t shied away from using my nails to pry open battery covers or scrape off sink smudges or do anything I would normally do. Nothing phases this topcoat! Just be careful when you apply it to completely avoid your cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As everyone else has mentioned, this topcoat does have a bit of shrinkage, but I actually like it.  It helps &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34; the lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> There is no other top coat that compare to this! Your nails are literally dry to the touch in 30 seconds! The smell is a little strong so I don&#x27;t recommend using it in a closed space!</li>
            <li> Good product at affordable price.  My wife and my daughter really enjoy it.  Buy it on Amazon they have the best prices !</li>
            <li> The BEST top coat! Seriously, couldn&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
            <li> A total game changer for me. I didn&#x27;t wear color because of the time it took to dry each coat and the almost guaranteed chipping the next day. I read about Seche Vite on a friend&#x27;s, sister&#x27;s nail blog (the daily nail) and decided to try it. WOW it dries wet polish so fast and lasts so long, I now have 2 drawers full of COLOR and loooove it! I will say about half way through the bottle It does start to shrink the manicure. The Seche Vite Restore product helps fix that issue, but it can be annoying.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to try this.  Nothing works as well.  I now use this 2 or 3 times a week.  Helps my mani and pedi&#x27;s last.</li>
            <li> I read good reviews about this top coat, so decided to buy it and try it out.  As a mommy of 3, I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to wait for my nails to dry. This is by far the best top coat I have ever used.  My polish stays on so much longer as well.  Love it.  So glad I bought the package instead of just the small bottle.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great purchase since individual bottles cost upwards of 4.99 at some retailers. get the thinner too, to expand your savings</li>
            <li> I am on my 6th *Yes, SIXTH ProKit+Refill with another box in the closet on stand-by. I paint my nails 4+ times per week and finish with Seche Vite Every. Single. Time.  And with a 800+ collection of polishes I can attest that it goes with every type of glitter/jelly/metallic/creme/holo-whatever without a problem and improves the shine on all of them. It&#x27;s simply the best. There is NO other top coat. PERIOD.</li>
            <li> I bought mine on Mimi H&amp;B Supply. I love it because it&#x27;s really fast drying and for its high shine result. But after 2-3 days, it always chips. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my nails who has the problem. Because I am always having this problem with any kind of nail polish. My nail polish always tend to chip once in a while. Does anybody know how can I prevent it? Or did I just bought a fake Seche Vite?</li>
            <li> The product seems a bit old, it is definitely on the thick side. Where my thinner says to use 3-4 drops to thin I generally have to use 8-10.</li>
            <li> This product looks so good, that everyone comments and believes I went to the salon to have my nails professionally done.</li>
            <li> I love love love this top coat! My nails last four a long time, and when I use it on my tire nails, it lasts forever! I get bored with my toe nail color before it where&#x27;s off!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this top coat and am ecstatic that I found a refill online for such a reasonable price. There are two reasons though as to why I am rating 4 stars. 1: the packaging is horrible. The actual box the refill is in is good but the way it was packaged to be delivered to my house was not good at all. The box was wrapped in a thick sheet of bubble wrap and stuffed into a paper envelope.... -.- I received the envelope with the top literally ripped off. The top piece of the enveloped was hanging by a piece of tape. I am just glad nothing got lost on the way. It would be better to receive the packages in an actual box instead of an envelope. And don&#x27;t lose the bubble wrap! That&#x27;s what saved my refill from getting lost. 2: I didn&#x27;t get the plastic thing to refill the small bottle easier. Now I have to try to invent something for that. But besides those two reasons I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It holds a shine better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and dries in a minute or 2.  I love it</li>
            <li> I love this top coat..so shiny and dries in seconds</li>
            <li> I like the way it dries fast. But it causes the nail polish to peel the same day. Sorry but I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat! Never had anything like it. It&#x27;s thick, yet dries so fast with a glass-like, hard as diamonds, finish. Pretty much text book results for me. Recommended!</li>
            <li> this is the best topcoat in the world. If you have never heard of this, you need to try it ASAP. it&#x27;s magic. this is what nail salons use to make your nails perfect and last a long time and dry quickly. it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Good value and dries nails quickly</li>
            <li> I love this product it&#x27;s the only top coat I&#x27;ll use on my nails. Drys within minutes. Thank u for the fast shopping! Would order again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, every single thing!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this top coat. I ran out and went to the drug store and bought a top coat for while I waited to get my new bottle and it had forever changed my idea of what a top coat SHOULD be. I HATED the drug store bottle and threw it away as soon as my new bottle of seche vite came in. I absolutely love how fast it dries. It&#x27;s just amazing</li>
            <li> Great product- possibly a life time amount of top coat for me!!! definitely great.&lt;br /&gt;towards the end of the little bottle, the top coat mite get a little thick, so i recommend using nail polish thinner or just refilling the bottle :D</li>
            <li> Great product. Shipping was fast. It did spill a little but it was not to bad.</li>
            <li> Funny thing happened. I noticed that as I was on my second coat was starting to look bumpy. I decided to JUST put THE SECHE dry Coat over it to EVEN out the POLISH. Thinking that it probably will never dry now.. I went on U Tube and read the 5 things to make your nail polish look great and last a long time. ONE OF THE RULES WAS TO USE SECHE VITE FAST DRY TOP COAT WHILE YOUR NAILS ARE STILL WET!!!! It bonds with the Nail polish! I am also going to try a different base coat because the Revlon Colorstay Gel-Smooth Base Coat got very thick very fast. I read reviews and Orly is supposed to be the best.</li>
            <li> This is authentic Seche Vite - I&#x27;m not going to lie, I was a little skeptical due to the low price. It works amazingly well, dries super fast, and leaves a glossy finish! Highly recommend! Item came in about a week after order.</li>
            <li> Perfect for Konad nail system fans. Won&#x27;t mess the designs. Dries fast and shiny. It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Only top coat I use. Gives that thick gel-ish look, smooths over glitter polishes. I change my polish frequently (5-7days) but I haven&#x27;t had any chips with this top coat. I had to buy the refill bottle- I go thru it so fast.</li>
            <li> Title says it all. I&#x27;ve been wasting my time on other top coats. I&#x27;ve used OPI like a religion. Either the straight topcoat or the start to finish top&amp;base coat. I would sit with my hands under a desk fan for sometimes over an hour and it still wouldn&#x27;t be dry. I applied Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat over a Julep polish, and I would say within 5 min it was dry to the touch. If you ping it it gives a little, but dry enough so that I am not chained to my desk. Right now we&#x27;re at about 45 min since I applied, and I can press my polish with one of my fingernails and it doesn&#x27;t give at all! Love this product, I read other reviews saying that it was a little thick and tacky for them.. compared to OPI its light and applies consistently and evenly.</li>
            <li> I love seche. It&#x27;s toxic and causes cancer so use outside with gloves and I don&#x27;t use it as nail polish but I do use it and it works well. My daughter hates the small so I work away from the house.</li>
            <li> Look nail techs out there...this is a MUST HAVE product....it works fabulous and dries super quick and with a high gloss....will definitely order again</li>
            <li> I was kinda hesitant on buying this for my wife because didn&#x27;t know if this would be another knock off item.  It turns out to be the real deal and my wife loves it.  If she&#x27;s happy and satisfied, then my work is done and I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> This is a great value if you divide out cost per ounce! I would totally reccommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every drug store top coat, plus some expensive brands from Sally beauty supply. None compare to this! Dries nails so quickly plus makes them super shiny. This is very affordable especially when you buy the bottle plus the 4oz refill. Just don&#x27;t sniff it children.</li>
            <li> I love a good deal and I&#x27;m obsessed with this top coat.  At our local Walmart, one small bottle runs around $8.  This WILL thicken after a while so I did buy the thinner as well.  This top coat makes your nails so shiny, dries extremely fast (with is super important with a toddler), and just makes your manicure really come together.  Definitely highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product 10 stars I totally would! This is by far the absolute best top coat I have ever tried. It evens itself out to make the smoothest finish on my nails. If I do any kind of nail art and finish with this, it also smooths that out so you don&#x27;t see the edges. And the very best thing of all is that it is dry to the touch in about 2 minutes! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I use Seche Vite on a regular basis. It seals in 3D nail art, sets rhinestones, and has a wonderful shiny clear coat. SV also adds a thick layer to set your manicure and protect your nails. I am an indie polish maker, and I use Seche Vite over nearly all of my manicures.I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had seen a lot of great reviews for this product, but it wasn&#x27;t until I got to try it myself, that I realized its true potential! It really does dry all your fingernail polish all at once. It is such a relief. putting on this top coat actually makes nail art look better. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This topcoat makes even inexpensive nailpolish look fabulous!  It is protective and provides an outstanding shine.  It DOES dry fast!I can polish my nails just before bedtime and not have them smear.  In the morning my nails are perfect.  I used to buy the .5 ounce size(at a somewhat high price) before I knew about this economy size of 4 ounces.  It saves me a lot of money!</li>
            <li> Exactly what is pictured. I recently decided to start doing my own manicures again, and I had to get Seche Vite top coat. It is the only fast drying top coat I know that is actually fast drying and has loads of shine!</li>
            <li> Dries amazingly fast and has made my manicures last five times longer than they were before! Before, I could barely go a day without chipping a nail, and now I can go an average of at least a week (usually, I get tired of the color by then). It also gives my nails some much-needed strength and they&#x27;re growing so long now.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is my go to top coat. It offers a deep wet look that dries quickly (doesn&#x27;t need uv light) and offers chip proof protection for days and days.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re brand loyal as I am  you won&#x27;t be disappointed with getting a pretty generous supply of THE best quick drying topcoat ever.  Great for those who frequently get mani/pedicures.  Great value.</li>
            <li> The only fast drying top coat that I will use.  Absolutely fabulous product!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite yopcoat</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever.  Drys fast and keeps my pedicure lasting for weeks.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is hands down the best top coat I have ever used. It smoothes beautifully, dries super fast and shiny, and keeps a mani fresh and gel-perfect for a good 2 weeks - and I work with my hands. I give the product 10 stars if I could. However this review is for the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on the 5th. They provided bogus tracking info that has been quoting that the item is still on it&#x27;s way to the carrier since the 6th for delivery on the 9th. It is now the 14th and the status hasn&#x27;t changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Amazon regarding this and offered as a solution/compromise for the inconvenience, I&#x27;d accept a refund for the difference in price from the time I purchased it ($19.50) to the current price ($16.28) which the rep agreed would be fair and communicated this to the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller responded to say they do not price match and processed a full refund - never even addressed the fact that they hadn&#x27;t even bothered to ship my item yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess losing a little over $20 made more sense to the seller than just refunding the $3.22 difference and following through with shipping my item. Very odd logic and not very professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star because Seche Vite as a brand and product is awesome, and the other star is for the seller&#x27;s prompt response time. Too bad they don&#x27;t hold the same priority level for shipping.</li>
            <li> My favorite top coat polish now.. I will never use anything else... I sooooo recommend it to anyone. So worth every dollar....</li>
            <li> Great deal and convenient</li>
            <li> Product came just as advertisement pictured and described. The product name speaks for itself and is an excellent value for the price.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about the quick-dry claims, but it performs as advertised.  I globbed it on a little heavy, but it was still dry to the touch in a minute or so.  Nice and shiny, and great to have the refill capability.  I love it!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve heard about Seche Vite you know it is everyone&#x27;s favorite. It creates a protective barrier over the semi-dry polish so if you lightly tap it or smudge it, it will stay put. If you smudge it hard it will wrinkle, at least until an hour or two have passed and it is dry all the way through. I am totally hooked on this product, it is not to be beat. It dries very shiny and looks great over anything. And for this price, it is way cheaper than buying it in a store. I recommend buying Seche Restore (a thinner) to go with it since the bottle is large and it will thicken before you are finished. You can use Restore to thin other nail polishes that have thickened too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails for years and the drying time is always horrible.  I read through blogs and there seemed to be a cult following for this product.  They didn&#x27;t have any available in my country so I had to order it online, and I have no regrets.  This is the only topcoat I use now.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best investment I have made. In terms of beauty at least. I bought this bottle over a year ago and I still have half of it left. I do my nails probably about 2 times a week. This is also the best to coat by far. But it gets expensive buying the little bottles. This size is a must for any nail enthusiast. Would recommend buying the thinner too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat for many years, and I have to say it&#x27;s my favorite nail product I&#x27;ve ever used. It is shiny, dries fast and keeps my nail polish on several days longer. The low price and quick delivery are also super. What more can I say? It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product.  Takes all the flaws out of your manicure and dries so fast.</li>
            <li> Saves money and you don&#x27;t have to reorder so much. I go through a lot of this so I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> Makes my nails feel like I just came back from a nail salon. So smoooth and does not chip easily. I don&#x27;t need the best nail polishes as long as I have the best top coat. Will buy again if I run out.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. It makes your manicure look like gel polish and dries super fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails for years and consider a quick dry top coat a necessity.  I&#x27;ve tried more brands than I can remember, some good, some bad, but all of them had three things in common: 1. they&#x27;d pick up color from my nail polish (the brush would turn whatever color my nail polish was, and the product in the bottle would change color over time), 2. if using more than one color on a nail, the colors would smear into each other, even if the nail polish was dry to the touch, and 3. the product would make the nail polish underneath more brittle so that my polish chipped a lot faster than if I didn&#x27;t use the quick dry top coat at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of that happens with Seche Vite.  It doesn&#x27;t pick up color from my nails, it retains its clear color, it doesn&#x27;t smear my polish no matter how many colors I&#x27;m using on each nail, and works great as a protective top coat.  Additionally, it dries multiple layers very quickly and leaves your nails with a very high gloss finish.  As long as Seche Vite is in production, I&#x27;ll never use another brand again.</li>
            <li> I adore this top coat. I just got into doing nails and was looking for a decent top coat to help my pretty designs stay on as long as possible. I did some research and everywhere I looked pointed at this product. Then I did some price comparisons. This is the best deal. IF you buy it in the store you will pay the price for this whole set for the tiny bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to using the product. This product doesn&#x27;t smear anything underneath. It dries super fast and helps everything underneath dry quickly to(if it wasn&#x27;t already dry). Now be warned if you go slowly applying this product you will get weird stringy stuff going on(because this is a fast drying top coat it literally creates strings from it drying).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall This is the best Top Coat I could have ever hoped for. I love it and will purchase again when I run out!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  It dries very very quick and keeps your nail polish nice for several days.  I usually apply two coats.</li>
            <li> I really like Seche Vite topcoat and it is my favorite one so far and since the bottle finishes pretty fast it is good to get it with the refill bottle.</li>
            <li> My holy grail top coat. I won&#x27;t do my nails without it and this was a great price!</li>
            <li> Love this product I will buy it again. This product preserves my nail polish for  at least 2 weeks. I am always using my hands and my polish peels off so easily. I take this product to the nail salon for my manicurist to use now as it preserves my manicure for a few days longer than usual.</li>
            <li> Product is OK but poorly packaged.  Bottle was broken and dripped all over the porch, foyer, etc.  What a mess!!!!!</li>
            <li> this is an amazing product if you love to do your nails. it does exactly what it says, nails stay super shiny and they dry in like a minute seriously. great product, must buy!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while now. Here is my review when I bought my first 0.5 oz Top Coat: &amp;#34;It truly saves me time and protects my nail polish so good! I often get compliments in my nails and I own the perfect finish and quick dry to Seche Vite. It starts drying within seconds of applying and its completely dry within 5 minutes. After that time, you still need to be little careful of extreme scratches or don&#x27;t sleep on your nails because the under layers are still drying. The amount of nail polish you use may push that time up or down a little bit, but still much better than others I have tried.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic tip it makes it way easier to refill the little bottle. I will continue to get this product.</li>
            <li> Fast drying...awesome deal.</li>
            <li> Always use this brand for top coat. works great dries fast and does not smudge if doing nail art.</li>
            <li> The best top coat I ever try</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product and the price is fantastic but one thing I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered it is that the large bottle is glass and even though it comes with that handy spout thing, it&#x27;s useless when you put it on the bottle because you can&#x27;t squeeze glass and the seche vite is so thick it will not come out with the spout on. I end up just pouring it straight from the glass bottle to the small bottle and so far I have luckily not had any messes. Not sure how well that will work when the large bottle gets low in supply but I guess we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Now I can refill my bottles for sooo much lessss than buying a 1/2 ounce bottle at the store. Bought the Restore Thinner so that I&#x27;ll be able to use every last drop. Would recommend buying on here vs. the store any day of the week.</li>
            <li> Apply over wet color, dries almost immediately.  Reapply often to keep manicure fresh.  Shiny and hard as glass.  Has funnel included, but just as easy to pour right to bottle.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat is a must-have for the hobby nail artist. It protects nail art with an incredibly shiny layer of \\&quot;armor\\&quot;, quickly reaches a dry-to-the-touch stage and, unlike most other top coats, doesn&#x27;t streak the acrylic paint often used in nail designs (once the paint is dry, of course). The only down side is the price. In local stores, a half ounce bottle retails for around $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently participating in a twice-weekly nail art challenge, so I change my nail polish frequently. The Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat High Shine Professional Kit is a great value. For the price of a half ounce bottle I got the equivalent of five bottles, plus a handy funnel top that screws onto the refill bottle for tidy refilling of my half ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Nail polish dries within minutes to a hard shine.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Quality is great. Shiny and dries quickly. Best top coat.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this top coat! Great purchase &amp; fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I love Seche Vite (honestly - if you haven&#x27;t tried it, it&#x27;ll rock your world!). Manicures that would normally take 20 mins to dry are completely dry in 5-10 minutes. It&#x27;s super shiny, and keeps my manicures looking good for  at least 5 days without chips (hard to know if they last longer than this because I change my nails a lot). They only thing is that you&#x27;ll need the Seche Restore to keep this topcoat fresh (the ingredient that makes it fast drying also evaporates very easily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is a superb deal. The larger bottle is the equivalent of 8 regular (0.5 oz) bottle of Seche. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> Excellent on being a fast ship, quick dry, self leveling and a great shine.  Great value and it last for months!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different brands but Seche is the best. It makes my nail polish last longer.  I must say the duration of your manicure also depends on the nail polish you have underneath the top coat.  Some nail polishes will peel right off no matter what top coat you use.  If you use a quality nail polish + Seche you are looking at 2-3 weeks of great looking nails!</li>
            <li> The polish itself is by far my favorite topcoat, but the refilling is a bit tricky since the refill bottle is glass, so you can&#x27;t squeeze it like it feels like you need to. When I refilled the first time, I ended up having to poke a few holes in the plastic nozzle to allow for airflow for proper pouring. If you don&#x27;t poke the holes (I used a safety pin, and made three holes in a triangular pattern toward the base of the nozzle) then you&#x27;ll be holding the refill bottle upside down for a long time with very little success. Once you&#x27;ve got it figured out, though, it&#x27;s fantastic to be able to refill whenever you need it. I recommend also buying some nail polish thinner to revive the polish that is remaining in the bottle you&#x27;re refilling.</li>
            <li> Fast and reliable seller and delivery! Product is authentic aswell.&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used this top coat, you need to! It is the be all end all of top coats. It is quick drying and seals the polish in so well! Nails look professional and shiny!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best top coat ever. I recommend this for a long lasting topcoat.will not peel or chip on acrilic nails.</li>
            <li> Yay!!! I have zero bad things to say about this top coat!! I&#x27;ve been buying it for about a year now, 0.5 oz bottle at a time, and I&#x27;ve been impressed every single application. My manis last 4/5 days NO CHIPPING and the dry time is virtually 5 seconds. When you move to paint the next hand the one you finished is dry 💅 I&#x27;m a Polish whore who needs rehab, but I don&#x27;t even care lol I love switching my colors after just a day or so, but ever since this top coat came crashing into my life like the gift it is to the Polish world, I&#x27;ve kept my colors on longer and have enjoyed them more (if that&#x27;s even possible).&lt;br /&gt;Do you like nail polish??? Then buy this now and thank me later.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore Seche Vite and have used it for a couple years now. It makes your mani rock solid in five minutes, no matter how many layers of polish you have on your nail. This kit is an amazing deal, considering a single bottle can cost me $10! This refill kit gives you 9 bottles worth for only $5 more. I will never buy seche vite in a drugstore again, I&#x27;m only buying this kit from here on out, such an amazing deal! I&#x27;m interested to see if the big refill bottle will thicken like seche vite is known to do. If it does, I guess I&#x27;ll be purchasing some seche restore to thin it back out.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff! I won&#x27;t use any other topcoat!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best top coat I have ever used and so glad I got the professional size. If you are skeptical that it dries fast I&#x27;m telling you it&#x27;s FREAKY FAST! By the time you get done with one foot the other is already dry, feel free to polish nails before bed now!</li>
            <li> I use seche vite dry fast top coat and it&#x27;s a very good way to always have it, leaving my nails impecable!</li>
            <li> Small bottles are much more expensive at local beauty stores. Save yourself some money and purchase the larger size.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This really is the best topcoat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Good product and service</li>
            <li> This is great for nails in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had reviewed this a year ago, last time I grew my nails out, I would have given it a poor rating that the product did not deserve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year ago, I was changing my polish 2 times a week, and my nails were brittle. Nail polish wouldn&#x27;t stay on for more than 48 hours no matter how many coats I would use. I was properly using base coats and everything, but nothing would stay on my nails. I, at first, blamed it on the seche vite, but this year, my nails started growing out strong, probably because of these new vitamins I am taking. I decided to polish them brown and gold for Thanksgiving. I used the Seche Vite top coat because I couldn&#x27;t find anything else. I hadn&#x27;t polished my nails in so long I didn&#x27;t remember where anything was. I am going on my second week and most of my nails still look perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is a great product, but I guess the key to a great manicure is first and foremost taking care of your nails.</li>
            <li> This does dry your nail polish quickly, but it also causes my nail polish to completely come off in two days tops.  &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I take my nail regimen pretty seriously and this is the ONLY top coat I use. Even if I&#x27;m going to get my nails done at a salon, I bring this with me. Dries pretty quick, even if I do my nails before bedtime and keeps them shinny chip free for over a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Routine:&lt;br /&gt;Clean nails, rub with alcohol+cotton swab, Seche Vite base coat, 2-3 layers of polish (I let each layer dry for at least 5 minutes), Seche Vite top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photo 1 &#x3D; Day 1 of application&lt;br /&gt;Photo 2 &#x3D; Day 10 (no retouching or second application of top coat)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, if I want my polish to last a little longer, I&#x27;ll add another coat of the top coat mid-week (3-4 days after the original application).</li>
            <li> This is a great topcoat feels smooth but durable . The refill though has little dark specks don&#x27;t know what they are</li>
            <li> I was so tired of waiting for my nails to dry. I swear no matter what top coat I picked up my nails never dried. So one day I asked the woman who does my nails what she would recommend. She told me straight up that Seche Vite was the best stuff. She said that she bought it in bulk. I went online and read the reviews and found that everyone swore by it too. Now I&#x27;m one of those people. I can&#x27;t rave enough about this stuff. It dries my nails in only a few minutes and gives it that perfect shine. The only thing I don&#x27;t love about it is the smell but it&#x27;s something I can overlook because it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Gina</li>
            <li> Arrived fast.  Only down side is the smell but this top coat is soo amazing</li>
            <li> This product is the best! I have tried many others but this one is not only Affordable its reliable!  My manicures last all week and my nails remain strong. I will never use any other top coat again.</li>
            <li> I do my nails about every other day and I only use Seche Vite top coat. It dries so fast and leaves the shiniest shine. I am very impatient when I do intricate nail art with stamps or tape, so I apply a coat of SV and a few minutes later my nail is dry enough to do fun stuff. So much easier than waiting 30 minutes for a completely dry nail.  Needless to say, I go through  A LOT of top coat. Investing in the refill is pretty much required if you are like me. It&#x27;s a hell of a lot cheaper than buying individual bottles every time. I gave away the small bottle of SV to my sister so she didn&#x27;t keep using mine. If you buy this though, you should include the SV thinner. I left a review for that as well, so check it out.</li>
            <li> I think this was a very great deal, will be purchasing again, and the product works great is as described</li>
            <li> I JUST NOW FINALLY DID MY REFILLS TO BY SMALLER REGULAR SIZED BOTTLES.. BEST WAY TO BUY THE SECHE&#x27; VITE DRY FAST TOPCOAT... IT LAST SOOOOO LONG... LOOKS LIKE A TOPCOAT OF GLASS... THANX &amp; GOD BLESS :D :D</li>
            <li> cant paint my nails without a fast dry top coat. surprised how cheap this was that i actually became a bit suspicious but placed the order anyhow. glad i did cause the stuff is genuine. also received it quickly and of course the price is right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i read some review here where the person is ranting about the bottles being broken for SURE! i mean seriously! when was the last time u ordered something online?!! it comes wrapped in bubble wrap to protect it. the bottles are not broken.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite top coat of all time! Dries to a hard, high gloss finish and I think it smells soooo good! It&#x27;s nice and thick too. I like to buy it like this because I go through LOTS of it but it is also way cheaper to buy it in this large size and refill the little bottle. I love Seche Vite!</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is hands down the best topcoat I&#x27;ve ever used.  I am a huge fan of DIY manis / pedis and used to use the OPI topcoat.  However, I&#x27;d always leave that dry for 20 minutes or so before I did anything.  With this stuff, I can put two coats of OPI (or another brand with similar coverage / consistency), top it with a coat of Seche Vite and in 60 seconds or less I can go on with my day (or go to sleep) without risking a single smudge / sheet mark on my nails.  It dries SO FAST and leaves such a great shine.  I hope this is never discontinued, because I&#x27;m officially a fan for life!!</li>
            <li> Almost my favorite top coat</li>
            <li> By far my favoite top coat. Lasts forever, drys fast, and no chipping. I paint my nails every two days and still have tons of top coat left. The bottle will last me a while.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat ever. It dries almost instantly. It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t get thick and clumpy as some fast dry top coats tend to get. It really hardens the nails in a way that allows you to keep your manicure fresh for a couple of weeks. It keeps your polish from chipping and cracking. It is very affordable and you get more bang for your buck if you purchase the 4oz refill bottle. This was a great discovery for me and I will never go back to using any of the former brands that I have tried. And I consider myself a nail polish enthusiast!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!! I have been using this product for years, love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with all the other wonderful reviews, I never felt compelled to add a review, I had nothing to add...until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 young daughters(3 &amp; 2)  that want manicures like mommy and big sister(14), but aren&#x27;t quite as patient as they need to be. Enter seche vite...2 coats of opi Minnie mouse pink, a coat of seche vite and off they go in under 5min, with a &amp;#34;manicure&amp;#34; that will last 3-5 days even with the abuse of a toddler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I also use orly bonder(rubber base coat), but I too always have flawless home done nails that I am able to change every 3-4 days, even with 5 kids, since I can be done in 10min flat-WITH nail art. Plus I can go to bed an hour later without getting &amp;#34;sheet marks&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have a little one that wants pretty nails, this product is a MUST!!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. Love this top coat. Second time buying this &amp; its a great deal. Bottle &amp; refill lasted me a whole year!</li>
            <li> This has prolonged my manicures like no other top coat has before. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Dries extremely quickly and leaves nails with a nice shine. I do nail designs on my nails and would get so frustrated when I take the time to do designs and they chip 2 days later. I no longer have that problem when using this! A base coat and a top coat really help my manicures last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> excellent value for the money</li>
            <li> My favorite top coat and love the refill size.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat! It is too expensive at the drug store, so the refill supply is a fantastic and economical idea.</li>
            <li> Dries fast but still have to wait awhile it you&#x27;ll mark it , so not as great as I thought</li>
            <li> I brought this product after looking for fast drying top coats so I came on amazon found this wonderful procduct after using one bottle I loved so much I brought the biggest bottle amazon sold I love it.its shiny it&#x27;s thick it&#x27;s drys in seconds  and it  last months after just one coat I&#x27;m inlove with this fast drying top coat. Greatest buy ever</li>
            <li> for a first time user of this product its way more then i expected i love the top coat! at the end you end up with alot of shine</li>
            <li> Use in my salon all the time. Drys well in damp weather too. Does not dry out and the brush has a nice fan to it when applying the polish.</li>
            <li> Very quick-drying; nice glossy shine.</li>
            <li> Purchased this because so many nail techs rave about it. I never take people&#x27;s word I have to try myself and I&#x27;m very glad I did. Very glossy, dries very fast and extends my DIY manicures very well. This kit is well worth it because I can see me going through it fairly quick. If you don&#x27;t want to do the gel you definitely should go with this top coat.  It is great!</li>
            <li> First off, in my area a 0.5 ounce bottle of Seche goes for about $6+ (USD).  Considering the average price of this on Amazon is around $14-15 for 4 ounces, you can do the math and see the value this is for any &amp;#34;Laquerista&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My product arrived with a slight delay from the shipper, but was safely packaged and unopened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both botttles are glass, so be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be sure to follow the instructions and refill the smaller container as soon as it gets to be 3/4.  I had trouble with the &amp;#34;nozzle&amp;#34; thingie, but found if I just set it upside down on the smaller bottle, I could dump the larger bottle into the funnel and it goes right in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great bargain for an awesome product, and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just now getting into nail polish and have never had a great top coat. This stuff is amazing. Super glossy!</li>
            <li> Best SHINING top coat ever! I always carry it to the nail salon to make my manicures last.  Apply a second top coat during the second day of manicure to make it last  2wks with no chipping.</li>
            <li> Awesome like a mirror better than out the door</li>
            <li> Makes my polish last longer. Dries them SUPER fast. It dries ALL the layers of polish unlike other fast dry top coats which just dry the top coat. You do need to learn how to use it though because it might shrink if you apply to dried polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best way it works for me is if my apply it to tacky slightly wet polish and wrap the tips (with the last coat of polish and the top coat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing about it is it doesn&#x27;t work with all my polishes. For those polishes, I use Out the Door instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good deal if you do your nails a lot and go through top coat fast, have already bought a bottle of SV before and KNOW how to use it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this top coat! I will never go back to anything else because this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that not only creates a beautiful shine, but truly dries quickly! Super protective when I want to have fun with my nails! This set is the best value as well (compared to paying at least $10 just for the .5 oz bottle)!</li>
            <li> Loving these lashes. I ordered the lashes in style 5. I have naturally long lashes, but they are not too full, so these provide a great natural look for me. The price was great, and these are good quality. I find that the thick band helps make the lashes last, especially when cleaning off old glue to reuse. Over all very pleased. Only give 4 because I thought these would look a bit more like another pair of wispies that I have, more dramatic for special occasions, but these are still great.</li>
            <li> i love the seche vite product and its all i use on my nails but this was not it . i have no idea what it is but its completely different from the seche vite i but in stores. beware seche vite lovers i believe this is a fake.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this. It is a great top coat and very fast drying.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, correct price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> the best fst dry ever</li>
            <li> I love this!! I use it all the time over my customers who choose regular polish. Refilling my little bottle the first time was a pain! Nearly ruined my brush messing with the funnel, finally threw it away and just poured straight from the bottle, took a whole 5 seconds!</li>
            <li> This is such a great buy!  I will by buying again!  This is the best top coat on the market!  Dries super fast and there is no other that shines like this top coat does!</li>
            <li> This is the best transparent coat I&#x27;ve use in many years working professionally and personally on nails. It is long lasting and dry very fast, under 5 minutes for 2 coats of color nail polish. I suggest waiting for 10 minutes, if you have art painted on. After it is dried, it gives a glass/gel finish. I am very happy with the big bottle of refill as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP TIP TIP: Don&#x27;t use the filter plastic thing to transfer the solution from the big bottle to the small bottle. Just patiently and carefully pour it in. Since the filter can get clogged up, by the old solution dried up residue. After 80% is filled up, slowly decrease the amount of speed, by lifting the bottle up gradually. Then at 90%, give your wrist a twist, just like pouring oil or wine, to make sure the solution doesn&#x27;t drip out side the opening.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite top coat! It dries quick and is very glossy. The price was also great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issue(s): Very strong smell, but that is to be expected. You&#x27;ll also want to purchase the Seche Restore.</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery!</li>
            <li> good price for a product that works, nice smooth glossy finish that actually lasts. even the refill bottle is glass (i was worried it would be a leaky plastic bottle that would dry out.) love the look it gives my manies and pedies. cant wait to try the seche plus.</li>
            <li> I loved this product I kept hearing about it and had to try it. It was better than I expected!!!</li>
            <li> I love Seche Vite because it dries so quickly and keeps my manicures in good shape (better than other topcoats I&#x27;ve tried, including Orly Won&#x27;t Chip). But I&#x27;ve grown tired of paying $7 for every bottle. This is a 4oz bottle for refills, plus a .5oz bottle, so it&#x27;s basically worth $63. It&#x27;s a must-have if you do your nails often!</li>
            <li> If you put this on nail polish that is not completely dry, it will bond with the nail polish and make it dry quicker.  It&#x27;s great for nail art too.  This does have a tendency to dry out a bit, but adding more to the bottle fixes that problem. You can also buy the Seche Restore drops if it gets too thick.  Buying this bottle is much much much cheaper than buying individual bottles.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.it dries super quick and this is a great deal</li>
            <li> Ordered this refill set as a replacement for my past bottle of Seche Vite, just as good as ever!  Dries extra fast to the touch, I usually polish right before going to bed and wake up smudge free :)</li>
            <li> does have a strong scent, but man does it dry fast!  Great for people who can&#x27;t wait around for nails to dry like me!</li>
            <li> This top coat is as good as or better than that used by salons...made my manicure last much longer.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best top coat I have ever used, and I have used a lot of different brands (from drug store to premier department store brands). I like to use a lot of top coat and one drop from the brush is perfect for each finger. It actually does dry quickly, but be careful not to dent your manicure for at least 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having the refill is great because I paint my nails 2-4 times a week so I use a lot of top coat. The funnel has threads so it seems like you could attach it to the top of the big bottle, but that didn&#x27;t allow for good flow. I like to place the funnel tip into the small bottle and then pour into the funnel from the big bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat that I have ever used. It dries your nail polish quickly and leaves a beautiful shine. Your polish will not chip for days especially if you reapply it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot about Seche Vite but never really saw it in stores so I could pick it up that way. Finally decided just to get it and see for myself. I bought the professional kit with the 1/2 oz bottle and the 4 oz refill bottle because of the awesome price, and I&#x27;m not disappointed! This stuff dries so quickly, is lovely and glossy, and after doing my nails one night, I didn&#x27;t wake up the next morning with sheet prints on my nails! A++++ in my book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the big bottle of the polish, you do need to get a bottle of the Seche Restore as well. Fast Dry top coats have a tendency to get goopy because of their fast dry nature, and the Seche Restore will keep the consistency good as you refill your bottle or if it gets goopy in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I loved that this all came in a glass bottle. Will definitely buy again when I run out!</li>
            <li> The best top coat ever.</li>
            <li> This product has made my life easier, i no longer have to wait hours sitting and waiting for my nails to properly dry, however if you are using tape designs i will advise that you wait about an hour or little longer to ensure the base coat does not peel off, Love this product</li>
            <li> I use this mainly because of how fast the drying time is. The shine it gives is also amazing, almost gel like. It also works wonderfully to fix most imperfections made from eneven nail polish painting and whatnot. But the biggest downside to seche vite however is that it shrinks most of my nail polishes (mainly essie and sinful colors), it seems to do fine with my opi&#x27;s though. The smell is pretty strong and appalling as well.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat it leaves my nails for a long time</li>
            <li> I love this topcoat, and this is such a great deal. I did not receive the smaller cap though to make pouring easier, and instead of a clear .5 oz polish I got a really dark nail lacquer.</li>
            <li> Love seche! This is an awesome deal and has lasted me forever. I will definitely order again. My only dislike is that this polish turns white tips with acrylic yellow but over polish it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is a good fast drying polish but it has a smell that I can&#x27;t stand.  Regret buying so many.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again and only because of the smell.  Makes me lightheaded.</li>
            <li> The products were great. That is the best top coat I have ever used. And would reccommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The product works just as described. It makes my nail polish dry very quickly and the shine Is great.</li>
            <li> I love love love Seche Vite and I use it EVERY time I do my nails, which is 2-3 times a week! I chose to purchase from this seller because a bottle is about $10 in stores and for a few dollars more I got this large bottle plus a regular bottle! Overall this is an awesome product and no manicure should be without it!</li>
            <li> Woah, this is such a great product at a great price! I am by no means a professional, but I go through so much of this stuff that this kit saved me a ton of money. This is by far my favorite top coat because of its high shine &amp; super fast drying time. If you use this top coat I recommend this product because it will save you so much money &amp; time!</li>
            <li> Seriously?!  This top coat is the end of all my nail polish woes.  My polish is dry to the touch within seconds of applying the top coat.  It shrinks a little bit, so if you make a mistake while polishing, the top coat will fix it for you!  I love this stuff, and after using it, I can&#x27;t even imagine using anything else.  Also, one of my friends is a religious user of this product and says that this set is a STEAL for the price.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is the best top coat. Although the texture is thick and needs to be thinned out halfway through the bottle, it helps dry polish on hands, keep it glossy and shiny, and seals the polish so it doesn&#x27;t chip as quickly as it normally would.  I gave it a 4* just because it thickens fast enough.</li>
            <li> This was introduced to me probably about a year and a half ago, and I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it before that. This is seriously the best fast-dry top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. I usually get the Restore thinner and thin it out a bit as it is extremely thick, but that is a small price to pay for how amazingly this works.</li>
            <li> I usually love this product.  This seems to be a different formula than what I have used previously.  Would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> 10 dollars for SV when I normally purchase the .5 fl oz bottle. This is 4.5 fl oz&#x27;s overall and is only 4 dollars more. Entirely worth it.</li>
            <li> Great to have to use do your nails often like me. By the way this is the best top coat in the market.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product.  It is why most people still think I am getting my nails done professionally.  It gives a high gloss shine. I keep two small bottles one for when I do reds the other I keep clear for light colors.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat ever! If you don&#x27;t own this I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Awesome quick dry top coat. Penetrates through 2 coats of polish to dry your nails in 5 minutes flat.</li>
            <li> I love this - and it&#x27;s much better than paying 6.99 every couple of months at CVS</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t get any better than Seche</li>
            <li> This is my favorite top coat, so why not order the giant bottle?</li>
            <li> Do not lose shine.Manicure is in good condition all week even when working physically.It does not change the color of the paint manicure, does not yellow over time.</li>
            <li> This fast-dry top coat is awesome! Helps nail color dry extremely quickly (2 minutes or less). Gives a nice sheen and works great as a top coat on nail art stickers. I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Its a good price for a lot of product. Great top coat it dries super quick and has a high gloss shine. It can cause some shrinkage, but it is a fantastic top coat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent kit, you get a lot for what you pay, so if you like seche vite, this is a great option for you.&lt;br /&gt;This top coat is nice, and doesn&#x27;t alter the finish of nail polish. Definitely helps nailpolish to dry faster. However, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s better than Sally Hansen&#x27;s topcoat, this one seems to dry slower, and is definitely less glossy.</li>
            <li> I used to think no nail polish was truly &amp;#34;chip-resistant&amp;#34; no matter how expensive or how popular the brand was. Then I found this top coat. You could use the crappiest, cheapest quality nail polish and nobody would know the difference if you put this on top. It smooths everything out (which is great if you do nail art because layering nail polish can get quite clumpy), dries crazy fast (you will be amazed, trust me), and it rarely, rarely chips. Just make sure you also get some along the edge of your nail because if you don&#x27;t, you run the risk of it peeling (although this is true of any polish). This product will change the way you view painting your nails!</li>
            <li> Dries as fast as they claim. Great product!</li>
            <li> LIFE CHANGING! Looks like if i would have gotten a gel manicure 😃</li>
            <li> As much as I like Seche Vite&#x27;s product, which is an excellent laquer, I have to complain and warn people about this large refill size - it&#x27;s in GLASS so good luck getting a bottle shipped without breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprised the Post Office didn&#x27;t raise a royal stink about shipping \\&quot;hazardous materials\\&quot; especially since the stink of toluene, butyl and phthalate was overwhelming - (and people put this on their skin?? I just use it to laquer jewelery :) - I knew the package was damaged before even opening it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparent my postal carrier hates me because I report her every time she mis-delivers or damages my mail - so now she apparently uses my packages as a football..And so, this glass arrived broken. Way to go union labor, can&#x27;t ever get rid of incompetents (and they wonder why people have turned against the unions?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seche Vite needs to get a clue and sell this product in PLASTIC like every other modern chemical supplier, especially if they&#x27;re going to ship it via USPS (which is probably illegal anyway, being a highly flammable and dangerous chemical concoction.) :PPPP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finally getting an unbroken bottle delivered, I now come upon the problem of - the bottle is GLASS so it cannot be squeezed... So, I can either wait a few hours while the refill drips one painfully slow drop at a time to refill the small brush jar..Or I can bang the glass...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, Seche Vite. Use plastic, like the rest of the modern world of chemical supplies.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost too good to be true. This stuff really protects a fresh nail polish job far beyond what I thought possible. It can still get some dents and deformities if heavily stressed in the first couple of hours, but within a few minutes, the finish is virtually impervious to most light dings and bumps. Absolutely amazing stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear nail polish a lot more often now because gone is the frustration of a ruined manicure because I couldn&#x27;t sit not using my hands for anything at all for two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did recently ruin a fresh manicure because I made the bed within about 20 minutes of applying Seche Vite, which smooshed the polish at the tips, so I now have a pretty good idea what I can and can&#x27;t get away with. I got over-confident because it felt completely dry to the touch, but actually it remains a little soft for a few hours while it cures, so you still need to be a little careful. Ideally, I do my nail polish sometime before bed, let it dry for about 15 minutes and after that I can go to bed and not get sheet marks.</li>
            <li> This is the best fast dry top coat I have tried. Buying it this way is a great deal for the amount you get.</li>
