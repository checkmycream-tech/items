    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best Grass scent since Gap Grass.</li>
            <li>Great value, awesome scent!  </li>
            <li>so Demeter Grass is a nice alternative.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you are sure to find something to fit your personality!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not as potent as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>I love all Demeter Fragrances.</li>
            <li>I used to love the GAP scent &amp;#34;grass&amp;#34; and they no longer make it, so i gave this one a try.</li>
            <li>when scent fades it is more pleasing and smells more like grass but not for about an hour after spraying it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t agree more.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>It has a light, airy, lily scent.  </li>
            <li>Demeter products are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>A close friend stated that this smells like a light \\&quot;bug spray\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of fresh cut grass, and this is about the closest I&#x27;ve ever smelled.  </li>
            <li>However the fragrance wears off quickly and easily, leaving a \\&quot;rancid\\&quot; type of smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This would be a good perfume for a woman in her early 30&#x27;s, who is artistic and idealistic.</li>
            <li>To me, the top notes smell exactly like a freshly mowed lawn.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad scent...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like a freshly mowed lawn.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a lightweight and fresh scent.</li>
            <li>The grass scent is sickeningly sweet and almost makes me choke when i first spray it on.</li>
            <li>This does not smell like fresh cut grass as it claims.</li>
            <li>I know that sounds weird, but it smells so unique and wonderful to me.</li>
            <li>Demeter Grass is one of the few grass perfumes that you&#x27;ll probably be able to find years down the road and not have to pay 5 times the original price for and its nice that the demeter website also has this scent available as a body oil,lotion, bath gel, oil roll on etc.</li>
            <li>Love the Tomato fragrance from Demeter but the Grass scent is a little too sweet for me.</li>
            <li>The variety and unusual colognes offered by Demeter can&#x27;t be found anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really smell like grass</li>
            <li>Was very musky on me, not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li>They really do smell as described.  </li>
            <li>and I can close my eyes and really envision being at my in-laws ranch.</li>
            <li>It really smells like a ground up stink bug....</li>
            <li>Think of this as its lighter, cleaner, airier cousin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, not related to this product, but Lush Cosmetics makes a Grass scented shower gel, which I highly recommend for those who love this scent.</li>
            <li>In my opinion grass totally reminds me of freshly cut grass!</li>
            <li>It is a clean green scent without being sweet or chemical smelling.</li>
            <li>If you love the smell of anything grassy and aren&#x27;t expecting something as beautiful or complex as Gap Grass than you will probably enjoy this scent so don&#x27;t let the bad reviews deter you from trying it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s closer to the scent of day old hay.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad smell, but certainly not fresh and springy.  </li>
            <li>Similar to Gap Grass (which is why everyone seems to be buying this), but not as strong, and the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last very long - in fact it fades almost immediately, and settles down to a slightly creamy, sweet but clean scent (imagine that)...imagine a small scoop of vanilla ice cream on the freshly printed pages of a paperback book.</li>

            <li> I bought this in a desperate attempt to replace the Gap fragrance \\&quot;Grass\\&quot; which was just recently discontinued.</li>
            <li> Not pleasant at all.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like a freshly mowed lawn.  It has a light, airy, lily scent.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews prior to purchasing this perfume.  One of them said that it should be called &#x27;Meadow&#x27;.  I sort of agree.  It&#x27;s not a bad scent...just not what I&#x27;d expected.</li>
            <li> To me, the top notes smell exactly like a freshly mowed lawn. It doesn&#x27;t last very long - in fact it fades almost immediately, and settles down to a slightly creamy, sweet but clean scent (imagine that)...imagine a small scoop of vanilla ice cream on the freshly printed pages of a paperback book. I know that sounds weird, but it smells so unique and wonderful to me. I have not smelled this from anywhere else. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a good perfume for a woman in her early 30&#x27;s, who is artistic and idealistic. Ha. That&#x27;s just what I think...</li>
            <li> Great value, awesome scent!  The variety and unusual colognes offered by Demeter can&#x27;t be found anywhere else.  Check it out and you are sure to find something to fit your personality!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell like grass but it&#x27;s a lightweight and fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Similar to Gap Grass (which is why everyone seems to be buying this), but not as strong, and the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long. I use it to spritz throughout the day but it&#x27;s not as potent as I&#x27;d like. I still love it, but if you order expecting the classic Gap fragrance, don&#x27;t be disappointed! Think of this as its lighter, cleaner, airier cousin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, not related to this product, but Lush Cosmetics makes a Grass scented shower gel, which I highly recommend for those who love this scent.</li>
            <li> If you think this may be close to Gap Grass, do not purchase. It does smell like a bug repellant. Not pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> I love all Demeter Fragrances. In my opinion grass totally reminds me of freshly cut grass!</li>
            <li> Was very musky on me, not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> Demeter products are fantastic.  They really do smell as described.  I would like to get the tomato next. a o.k.</li>

            <li> I used to love the GAP scent &amp;#34;grass&amp;#34; and they no longer make it, so i gave this one a try. The grass scent is sickeningly sweet and almost makes me choke when i first spray it on. when scent fades it is more pleasing and smells more like grass but not for about an hour after spraying it. the spray bottle also was leaking when i opened it and leaks every time i spray it.</li>
            <li> I bought this in a desperate attempt to replace the Gap fragrance \\&quot;Grass\\&quot; which was just recently discontinued. I expected at least some similar smell. However the fragrance wears off quickly and easily, leaving a \\&quot;rancid\\&quot; type of smell. A close friend stated that this smells like a light \\&quot;bug spray\\&quot;.

            <li> I love the smell of fresh cut grass, and this is about the closest I&#x27;ve ever smelled.  It&#x27;s closer to the scent of day old hay.  Not a bad smell, but certainly not fresh and springy.  It does help stave off the winter blahs and I can close my eyes and really envision being at my in-laws ranch.</li>
            <li> This does not smell like fresh cut grass as it claims. It really smells like a ground up stink bug.... I was gagging.</li>
            <li> I like the grass scent and wear it a lot.It is a clean green scent without being sweet or chemical smelling.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. I just wish it would last longer. The best Grass scent since Gap Grass. Check out Bring Back Gap Grass on Facebook.</li>
            <li> Love the Tomato fragrance from Demeter but the Grass scent is a little too sweet for me.</li>
