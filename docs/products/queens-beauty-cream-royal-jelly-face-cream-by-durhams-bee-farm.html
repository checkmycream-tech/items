            <li>Nice and smooth</li>
            <li>Durham&#x27;s beauty cream is the best facial cream on the market.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many beauty creams.</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered more.  </li>
            <li>Durham did throw in some candies in my package which were phenomenal though :)</li>
            <li>5 years ago she found this cream and has been in love since.</li>
            <li>It seems like this company would be more clued-in to the trend of using safer preservatives like vitamin E, for example.</li>
            <li>I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am in LOVE.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>My face felt better the minute I used this product.</li>
            <li>Great that this product is made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>skin breath easy .</li>
            <li>and i love the fact that it&#x27;s natural and actually good for my skin without a lot of chemicals.</li>
            <li>It can calm sensitive skin (even seems to temper Rosacia) and is great after sun because your skin drinks it up...</li>
            <li>Will not erase deep lines, but a great product.  </li>
            <li>In 90 degree heat my skin feels comfortable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to skew the ratings for this product since I&#x27;ve never actually used it, so I&#x27;m giving it a happy 3 stars.</li>
            <li>Family and friends have actually commented that my skin looks great and asked what I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li>This cream feels soothing and light.  </li>
            <li>It was cheap but it didnÂ´t became a favorite.&lt;br /&gt;woman 48 yearsold.</li>
            <li>It reduces puffy eyes and really is smooth, light and again  non greasy...</li>
            <li>I like this cream, price good, very good, just a little pull not open feeling, but the overall feeling is very good</li>
            <li>Must use at least three to four weeks for best results.</li>
            <li>Super-</li>
            <li>I also can&#x27;t live without Queen&#x27;s delight!!!!  </li>
            <li>It even helps my skin to stay fresh looking with a glow.</li>
            <li>such nice cream .</li>
            <li>It would be great for normal or dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many expensive products costing much more and promise everything using the most advanced technology serums to hydrate the skin.</li>
            <li>But I loved that its not greasy as most of home- made natural creams usually are.</li>
            <li>The only thing for my skin is that it needs more moisture right now, so I need to combine this product with another to get that.</li>
            <li>its feels a bit think on the skin at first</li>
            <li>Ordered some of their other products as well like bee pollen and royal jelly, they put in a few pieces of candy with our order, they are soooo good that we are also ordering some more!</li>
            <li>Today is actually my first day using it, so I can&#x27;t tell much.</li>
            <li>Fine lines disappear with this product within ten minutes.  </li>
            <li>the raised, ropy line was now a fine line the same tone as my skin.</li>
            <li>my mom~&lt;br /&gt;she was very happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very like</li>
            <li>it is very lifting  and contouring .</li>
            <li>but it is really helping and</li>
            <li>Too much coconut oil will make it greasy.</li>
            <li>Love Durhams Bee Farm&#x27;s other products as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been interested in more natural products lately, and was excited about this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I used Oil of Olay Regenerist for years, and there is still a half of a jar of that in my cabinet, but I keep bypassing it for the Queen&#x27;s Beauty Cream, as it does a much better job of moisturizing, tightening, and giving me a radiant glow.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to use this product long enough to really give a knowledgeable rating at this time.</li>
            <li>I guess you can say i got my hopes up a bit too high about this product.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>As an Esthetician I&#x27;m not excited about parabens, but they &amp;#34; potentially&amp;#34; harmful, no for sure.</li>
            <li>I ordered this on a lark - and WOW, let me tell you this is something that really works.  </li>
            <li>I was going to purchase this based on the reviews, but after checking out the ingredients decided not to due, primarily, to the methylparaben and propylparaben.</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t live without this beauty creme.  </li>
            <li>It get super dry in Idaho in the winter</li>
            <li>I also love how inexpensive this is compared to what I usually buy.</li>
            <li>I have been using a $$$ face cream and it is not helping soften my skin or clear it up.</li>
            <li>conscious about health vegans get cancer,</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than it has for at least 10 years.  </li>
            <li>the product does keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li>why did they use it if company put natural benefit to work- why to poison  it?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons of different moisturizers and never had something work so fast.</li>
            <li>I am 48 years old and have no pimples but the cream has something that give me a breakout.</li>
            <li>This is heavy but it absorbs quickly, works all day,</li>
            <li>I am a 66 year old woman who has recently lost about 75 pounds.  </li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and people tell me that I look much younger.</li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin</li>

            <li> I am 60 years old and people tell me that I look much younger.</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far the Queens Beauty Cream has done both, I am not promising clear skin from this product as there are other factors in the acne issue</li>
            <li> I ordered mine directly from the Durham&#x27;s Bee Farm website a little over a month ago.  </li>
            <li> It gets stuck, and I&#x27;m actually afraid to rub it in, because I think I might be doing more damage to the delicate skin on my face by how much it pulls at my skin when I&#x27;m trying to get it to distribute.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried expensive ones and cheap ones.</li>
            <li> It leaves the face feeling soft and firm.</li>
            <li> , it would make it less sticky, and I could try it as a lotion, but I&#x27;m too paranoid about my facial skin to use it again on my face.</li>
            <li> She is 76 years old and has ran San Francisco half marathon in the past 2 years.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very, very sticky, and difficult to distribute</li>
            <li> I have ordered this and other products from Durham&#x27;s Bee Farm.  </li>
            <li> and I believe it is lightening my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> do a lot of research before I buy any product on Amazon, so I rarely write bad reviews, and I like other Durham&#x27;s products, but this one needs a little bit of work before I&#x27;ll even think of buying it again.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on well and leaves my face feeling tight.</li>
            <li> and I was too lazy to go get the other ointments.  </li>
            <li> I mix this with just a little coconut oil and everyday coconut lotion and use it for day and night cream.</li>
            <li> and i need a heavy cream.</li>
            <li> this cream is too heavy for my skin.</li>
            <li> She said no other expensive cream can do the trick.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin that gets even worse during the winter.</li>
            <li> My bad for not reading the whole ingredient list.</li>
            <li> I was so looking forward to this product, but each time I used it, I woke up with scaly skin as if I had been peeled, but worse because it was also itchy.  </li>
            <li> - I know it&#x27;s a bee/honey product, but it&#x27;s just not pleasant to put on!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really disappointing, though, that the ingredients aren&#x27;t safer since the royal jelly itself is so beneficial.</li>

            <li> Fine lines disappear with this product within ten minutes.  Will not erase deep lines, but a great product.  One of the best products I have used.</li>
            <li> Today is actually my first day using it, so I can&#x27;t tell much. But I loved that its not greasy as most of home- made natural creams usually are. In 90 degree heat my skin feels comfortable. It has very good consistency, absorbs well. I will see how it goes. As an Esthetician I&#x27;m not excited about parabens, but they &amp;#34; potentially&amp;#34; harmful, no for sure. Super- conscious about health vegans get cancer, so....I think we can put more blame on technology than parabens. For now.&lt;br /&gt;And cream smells like apples for sme reason. Very refreshing!</li>
            <li> I am a 66 year old woman who has recently lost about 75 pounds.  Age and weight loss did not do my skin any good.  I ordered this on a lark - and WOW, let me tell you this is something that really works.  My skin looks better than it has for at least 10 years.  Will not be without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+++++ in my book - definitely 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great product very good price I recommend .</li>
            <li> Got it on time. Nice and smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been interested in more natural products lately, and was excited about this purchase.  I have used about a quarter of this jar, and have finally given up :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very, very sticky, and difficult to distribute - I know it&#x27;s a bee/honey product, but it&#x27;s just not pleasant to put on!  It gets stuck, and I&#x27;m actually afraid to rub it in, because I think I might be doing more damage to the delicate skin on my face by how much it pulls at my skin when I&#x27;m trying to get it to distribute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do a lot of research before I buy any product on Amazon, so I rarely write bad reviews, and I like other Durham&#x27;s products, but this one needs a little bit of work before I&#x27;ll even think of buying it again.  Maybe if I mixed it with some sort of oil (Vitamin E, perhaps?), it would make it less sticky, and I could try it as a lotion, but I&#x27;m too paranoid about my facial skin to use it again on my face.</li>
            <li> I like this cream, price good, very good, just a little pull not open feeling, but the overall feeling is very good</li>
            <li> I buy it for my mom~&lt;br /&gt;she was very happy.&lt;br /&gt;she very like it.&lt;br /&gt;I feel it a good give for my mom~</li>
            <li> Durham&#x27;s beauty cream is the best facial cream on the market. I&#x27;ve tried many expensive products costing much more and promise everything using the most advanced technology serums to hydrate the skin. It goes on well and spots on my skin have disappeared. Been using it for over a year and will continue for years to come.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many beauty creams. I tried expensive ones and cheap ones. Queen&#x27;s Beauty Cream is the best. I use it under my makeup and at night. I am 60 years old and people tell me that I look much younger. I buy 12 jars at a time because it is cheaper. If you try it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> Great that this product is made from natural ingredients. My skin responds beautifully to it. The only thing for my skin is that it needs more moisture right now, so I need to combine this product with another to get that.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  Great price. Love Durhams Bee Farm&#x27;s other products as well.  My parents have been their customer for years.</li>
            <li> the product does keep my skin soft. I use it every morning. It even helps my skin to stay fresh looking with a glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had multiple surgeries and used cocobutter, mederma then Vaseline all on the recommendations of the surgeon and dermatologist.  While changing the bandages (2 weeks post op), this was in the second bathroom and I was too lazy to go get the other ointments.  I used this and the next day when changing bandages, the discoloration was GONE.  the raised, ropy line was now a fine line the same tone as my skin. (I am a red head with freckles)......I just ordered more.  So happy I happened on this!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I thought this would be a great addition to my beauty regimen but this cream did nothing for me. It almost feels kind of waxy when putting it on. It doesn&#x27;t go on well and leaves my face feeling tight.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and neck. It get super dry in Idaho in the winter and i need a heavy cream. This is heavy but it absorbs quickly, works all day, does NOT make me break out and i love the fact that it&#x27;s natural and actually good for my skin without a lot of chemicals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  made with alot of royal jelly but I have  oily skin and this cream is too heavy for my skin. It would be great for normal or dry skin.</li>
            <li> such nice cream . i like the texture it is very lifting  and contouring . its feels a bit think on the skin at first but yet you dont have sensation that face is sealed- skin breath easy . the one thing I did not like is parabens in the ingredients .  that make me wonder- why did they use it if company put natural benefit to work- why to poison  it? thank you</li>
            <li> I guess you can say i got my hopes up a bit too high about this product. I will say that i noticed that the product does tighten the skin for a bit and does do good with moisturizing. However I won&#x27;t order again, it didn&#x27;t have me head over heals. Durham did throw in some candies in my package which were phenomenal though :)</li>
            <li> So simple. So well priced. So AMAZING.  This stuff should be in every beauty arsenal.  It&#x27;s a moisturizer that actually smoothes, blends/softens skin tone and mattifies in one fell swoop.  Almost acts like a BB Cream without needing any pigments.  It can calm sensitive skin (even seems to temper Rosacia) and is great after sun because your skin drinks it up...it won&#x27;t &amp;#34;sit on the surface&amp;#34; but truly soaks into skin. Definitely has a tightening and firming effect on skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WANT TO REALY HELP YOUR SKIN?! (and the rest of you as well) Starting taking Durham&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Delight Supplement and just fix things from the inside out! But that&#x27;s another review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WISH THEY MADE A BODY MOISTURIZER!!! AND A HAND &amp; FOOT TREATMENT AS WELL (USING BEESWAX TO SEAL IN MOISTURE PERHAPS?).</li>
            <li> I order Queen&#x27;s beauty cream for my mother who lives in Japan and visit US during summer. She is 76 years old and has ran San Francisco half marathon in the past 2 years. She doesn&#x27;t like to spend either lot of time or money for her skin care, but she has amazing skin for her age. 5 years ago she found this cream and has been in love since. She said no other expensive cream can do the trick. Every summer she takes enough jars to last till her next visit.</li>
            <li> I ordered mine directly from the Durham&#x27;s Bee Farm website a little over a month ago.  I love this this cream!  It&#x27;s consistency is perfect, and it leaves my skin feeling soft.  I used Oil of Olay Regenerist for years, and there is still a half of a jar of that in my cabinet, but I keep bypassing it for the Queen&#x27;s Beauty Cream, as it does a much better job of moisturizing, tightening, and giving me a radiant glow.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my mom, she loved it! Now she&#x27;s having me order more! Ordered some of their other products as well like bee pollen and royal jelly, they put in a few pieces of candy with our order, they are soooo good that we are also ordering some more!</li>
            <li> I was going to purchase this based on the reviews, but after checking out the ingredients decided not to due, primarily, to the methylparaben and propylparaben. All of the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products out there these days do not contain these potentially harmful preservatives. It seems like this company would be more clued-in to the trend of using safer preservatives like vitamin E, for example. I don&#x27;t want to skew the ratings for this product since I&#x27;ve never actually used it, so I&#x27;m giving it a happy 3 stars. It&#x27;s really disappointing, though, that the ingredients aren&#x27;t safer since the royal jelly itself is so beneficial.</li>
            <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second purchase of this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I put the product on I can feel it start to tighten my skin. It also has brightened my skin and I believe it is lightening my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is so simple and yet so effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> tHIS  Queen&#x27;s Beauty Cream is a wonderful nourishment  for a face that is in need of mousture, without causing any blemishes to appear.</li>
            <li> Great product, my daughter loves it</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE. This is the best face cream I have tried. I have been using a $$$ face cream and it is not helping soften my skin or clear it up. So far the Queens Beauty Cream has done both, I am not promising clear skin from this product as there are other factors in the acne issue but it is really helping and my pores seem to be getting smaller. The only gripe I have is that they do not sell a larger container of this. It would be nice if it came in 4oz size too. Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> I love this. I have very dry skin that gets even worse during the winter. After using this just three times, I could actually see a difference in my skin. I&#x27;ve tried tons of different moisturizers and never had something work so fast. Family and friends have actually commented that my skin looks great and asked what I&#x27;m using. At this point, four people I know have ordered it for themselves. I also love how inexpensive this is compared to what I usually buy.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to use this product long enough to really give a knowledgeable rating at this time.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this and other products from Durham&#x27;s Bee Farm.  Now I can&#x27;t live without this beauty creme.  It leaves the face feeling soft and firm. My face felt better the minute I used this product. Must use at least three to four weeks for best results. I also can&#x27;t live without Queen&#x27;s delight!!!!  It is a must!!! It will make you feel like a king or queen!!!</li>
            <li> This cream feels soothing and light.  It has a pleasant, light smell.  It&#x27;s a great product that feels pure on your skin.</li>
            <li> I mix this with just a little coconut oil and everyday coconut lotion and use it for day and night cream. Too much coconut oil will make it greasy.</li>
            <li> I was so looking forward to this product, but each time I used it, I woke up with scaly skin as if I had been peeled, but worse because it was also itchy.  It may be the lanolin, which, as I understand it, comes in all grades.  My bad for not reading the whole ingredient list. Am using it on my feet, a bit spendy for foot creme.</li>
            <li> Second time to rate this. It is good</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin but when I use this, after 2-3 applications I get pimples. I am 48 years old and have no pimples but the cream has something that give me a breakout. It was cheap but it didnÂ´t became a favorite.&lt;br /&gt;woman 48 yearsold.</li>
            <li> This is the smoothest, non greasy cream I have used in ages.  I had royal jelly years ago and never even thought to look online for beekeepers!!! I am so happy I found some again.  This is the best wrinkle cream ever.  Goes great under makeup and great night cream too.  It reduces puffy eyes and really is smooth, light and again  non greasy...</li>
