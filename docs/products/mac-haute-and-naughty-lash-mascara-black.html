            <li>I love MAC products.  </li>
            <li>Better than most mascara, but like their blackest version better</li>
            <li>Yoy can get some cheeper, thats better</li>
            <li>They are the same brush, which is nothing impressive in itself either.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Much better.</li>
            <li>Again, NOT THE REAL THING!!!!</li>
            <li>It is super easy to work with and gives awesome lush lashes:)  </li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased with the quick response and understanding agreement.</li>
            <li>* easily--</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap brush that clumps your eyelashes.</li>
            <li>This is a genuine MAC mascara.  </li>
            <li>but you had to apply 3 to 5 coats for light coverage.</li>
            <li>But I used it anyway thinking something had happened during the manufacturing process and thats why it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>, i have the original one</li>
            <li>by far my favorite mascara!</li>
            <li>I love it, but it dries out so fast</li>
            <li>Still works as an okay mascara, but nothing close to the real thing.</li>
            <li>Considering the many counterfeit products, I am really thinking twice.</li>
            <li>The only reason this product deserves one star is for the amazing customer service.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s upsetting because it use to be by far my favorite brand mascara.</li>
            <li>i started to clump up right after the first use.  </li>
            <li>You have to put on a few coats, but stick with it, it&#x27;s worth it!!!!</li>
            <li>not the real thing - threw it away!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara with 2 different brushes!</li>
            <li>and I dont think it is worth it to pay that much.</li>
            <li>So pretty.</li>
            <li>I do love the double brush.</li>
            <li>It was very clumpy and came off on chucks when washing it off!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I purchased it online from this seller</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, when I previously complained about this product, the distributor gave me a full refund without having me return the mascara (although I gladly would have!).</li>
            <li>Since I am a huge fan of the real MAC Haute and Naughty Lash Mascara, I have many old bottles lying in my makeup container.</li>
            <li>It is very runny</li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this mascara.  </li>
            <li>really</li>
            <li>Buy the real stuff from the MAC store/stand.</li>
            <li>I looked like I had 3 really fat, clumped lashes.</li>
            <li>Just go to a counter or somewhere that sells the real thing and buy it there.</li>
            <li>It made me ponder if it was real MAC product.</li>
            <li>If you just want a good mascara, save yourself half the money and buy one for $10 at your local drugstore.</li>
            <li>and I was less than satisfied.  </li>
            <li>and now i dont know if it is really new or used..</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t live up to the my expectations I had from the hype.</li>
            <li>so this was the first and last time I bought it.</li>
            <li>With a quick glance, you would not be able to realize that this product is fake.</li>
            <li>I will buy MAC until I get old.</li>
            <li>The formula never dried and it was clumpy.</li>
            <li>The real product is only $20.</li>
            <li>I ordered a haute and naughty mascara and got a complimentary one in addition to what I order.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every mascara on the planet over the past three decades (really!), and I&#x27;ve never been happier with anything as much as with this product.</li>

            <li> Way less money, and they dry out equally as fast.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful opening it and applying it.  </li>
            <li> The mascara is extremely gooey.</li>
            <li> The actually mascara is no better than one that is bought from a dollar store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not real MAC!</li>
            <li> This product is not worth $5, let alone $15.</li>
            <li> With a closer look though, you will notice that the coloring and shape of the bottle is slightly off.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;night&amp;#34; version is not as dramatic as I&#x27;d like and it is *impossible* to put more than one coat on (due to the clumping problem).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I do feel its a little bit overpriced.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Truly delivers the exaggerated length you looking for on your natural eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Definitely  go for the Mac false lashes.</li>
            <li> The large opening clumps your eye lashes together bad.</li>
            <li> The product comes out too thick and messy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that it is</li>
            <li> This is my go-to mascara, but usually I purchase it from the MAC store/stand.  </li>
            <li> Works just as well, if not better than the one I bought at the store.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews that complained that this one was fake--</li>
            <li> Also when i opened the box and got my product out the bottle was a little dirty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with the product at all.</li>
            <li> Not happy, but that will teach me to try to find a bargain on a product like this.</li>
            <li> Nasty not Naughty!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I asked for a refund for the fake product, shipped it to the address given, and the seller hasnt responded at all.</li>
            <li> this is a fake Haute &amp; Naugthy mascara!</li>
            <li> It also clumps really badly.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is crap.</li>
            <li> I had to take off all my make-up because this crap had gotten everywhere.</li>
            <li> I look like I have fake eyelashes on!!!  </li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s just that the mascara&#x27;s awful.</li>

            <li> not the real thing - threw it away!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara with 2 different brushes!</li>
            <li> I love it, but it dries out so fast and I dont think it is worth it to pay that much. Rather spend the money on drugstore brands like Maybeline and Covergirl!! Way less money, and they dry out equally as fast.</li>
            <li> I love MAC products.  They last and last and since it is the professional line you know you are getting the best there is</li>
            <li> The product comes out too thick and messy.  I have to be careful opening it and applying it.  It was recommended by a friend abut I will not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product through another seller called Las vegas style and when i recieved my product the box looked damaged and was taped at the bottom.. Also when i opened the box and got my product out the bottle was a little dirty i was kind of dissapointed because the desciption for this product said NIB and now i dont know if it is really new or used.. However i dont have any issues with the quality of the product itself i will never order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Better than most mascara, but like their blackest version better</li>
            <li> It is very runny but I really like it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I look like I have fake eyelashes on!!!  So pretty. You have to put on a few coats, but stick with it, it&#x27;s worth it!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed. It doesn&#x27;t live up to the my expectations I had from the hype. It is nice and applies easy. I do love the double brush. I do feel its a little bit overpriced.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I thought it would be....so this was the first and last time I bought it. Yoy can get some cheeper, thats better</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this mascara.  However, it smudges *really* easily-- I have to avoid blinking for several seconds after I put it on or it will get all over my lids.  It also clumps really badly.  The &amp;#34;day&amp;#34; version doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing any mascara at all.  The &amp;#34;night&amp;#34; version is not as dramatic as I&#x27;d like and it is *impossible* to put more than one coat on (due to the clumping problem).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I bought this from an actual MAC counter.  I read several reviews that complained that this one was fake-- I&#x27;m not sure that it is, I think it&#x27;s just that the mascara&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> Have purchased this product in store, but the product delivered to my house was not the same. Still works as an okay mascara, but nothing close to the real thing.</li>
            <li> This is not the same product you buy at the Mac store! The wand is different as well as the mascara it self! It was very clumpy and came off on chucks when washing it off! Nasty not Naughty!!!</li>
            <li> Best lower eyelash I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Crumbles and flakes throughout the day.😖</li>
            <li> The mascara is extremely gooey. Almost like slime. I&#x27;m not happy with the product at all. And it&#x27;s upsetting because it use to be by far my favorite brand mascara.</li>
            <li> this is a fake Haute &amp; Naugthy mascara! please DO NOT BUY THIS, i have the original one and you CANT compare this product</li>
            <li> The only reason this product deserves one star is for the amazing customer service. I bought this item thinking I got a great deal on my favorite mascara. However, what I received in the mail is a fraud! Since I am a huge fan of the real MAC Haute and Naughty Lash Mascara, I have many old bottles lying in my makeup container. With a quick glance, you would not be able to realize that this product is fake. With a closer look though, you will notice that the coloring and shape of the bottle is slightly off. Then, after opening the mascara, you will notice that the brushes do not actually come apart into \\&quot;day\\&quot; and \\&quot;night\\&quot;. They are the same brush, which is nothing impressive in itself either. It&#x27;s a cheap brush that clumps your eyelashes. The actually mascara is no better than one that is bought from a dollar store. This product is not worth $5, let alone $15. If you want the real MAC, go purchase it for $20 at Macy&#x27;s and save yourself the trouble. If you just want a good mascara, save yourself half the money and buy one for $10 at your local drugstore. So disappointed. HOWEVER, when I previously complained about this product, the distributor gave me a full refund without having me return the mascara (although I gladly would have!). I could not be more pleased with the quick response and understanding agreement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best makeup brand Ever. I will buy MAC until I get old. I hope the y never change.</li>
            <li> I ordered a haute and naughty mascara and got a complimentary one in addition to what I order. This company knows how to sweeten a deal. THE PRODUCT IS AWESOME!! Came in a timely manner! I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to mascara, but usually I purchase it from the MAC store/stand.  This is the first time I purchased it online from this seller and I was less than satisfied.  The mascara is nothing like the type that I use in the store.  The consistency is incredibly liquidy.  Waste of money.  Buy the real stuff from the MAC store/stand.</li>
            <li> This is a genuine MAC mascara.  Works just as well, if not better than the one I bought at the store.</li>
            <li> This is a really great mascara. It is super easy to work with and gives awesome lush lashes:)  This is definitely my favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> by far my favorite mascara! it makes my lashes huge and holds ALL DAY and over night!!</li>
            <li> This is crap. I love mac false lashes so when a rep at belk recommended this I bought it. There is two openings for the brush to come out of. The large opening clumps your eye lashes together bad. I looked like I had 3 really fat, clumped lashes. The smaller opening did okay but you had to apply 3 to 5 coats for light coverage. This mascara gives no length what so ever. Definitely  go for the Mac false lashes. Much better.</li>
            <li> I asked for a refund for the fake product, shipped it to the address given, and the seller hasnt responded at all. Not happy, but that will teach me to try to find a bargain on a product like this.</li>
            <li> Truly delivers the exaggerated length you looking for on your natural eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Considering the many counterfeit products, I am really thinking twice. Currently living abroad, but I may have to find a MAC store over here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every mascara on the planet over the past three decades (really!), and I&#x27;ve never been happier with anything as much as with this product. Other mascaras would either have a good brush, but a lousy formula - or vice versa - a great formula with a bad brush.

Other mascaras would either have a good brush, but a lousy formula - or vice versa - a great formula with a bad brush.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before and loved it. So when I saw it here at this price, I couldn&#x27;t say no. I thought the product looked different and when I took the wand out, it was clearly not the real thing. But I used it anyway thinking something had happened during the manufacturing process and thats why it was so cheap. Nope, not the case. The formula never dried and it was clumpy. I had to take off all my make-up because this crap had gotten everywhere. It&#x27;s not real MAC! The real product is only $20. Save yourself the time and stress. Just go to a counter or somewhere that sells the real thing and buy it there. Again, NOT THE REAL THING!!!!</li>
            <li> i started to clump up right after the first use.  it was a disapointing, i wouldnt order it again. It made me ponder if it was real MAC product.</li>
