            <li> super heavy tho over all would total recommend!</li>
            <li> They sent an extra rubber base edge which I thought was very nice</li>
            <li> The foot lever is different and the seat is a little different.</li>
            <li> My daughter is very pleased with the &amp;#34;Mae&amp;#34; Black Classic Styling Chair with Round Base.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to setup and even came with an extra ring for the base.</li>
            <li> I cant put it together completely because they sent me a few of the wrong pieces and some screws are missing, I also have assumed because the instructions they sent are also for a different chair.</li>
            <li> had a little trouble with the pin that stabilizes</li>
            <li> As a note, the package arrived promptly but was missing the hardware and the foot rest.</li>
            <li> One call to Salon Guys and the missing parts were shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> Even with a refund, this contraption wasted my time and money.</li>
            <li> The instructions are very bad, for the most part there are just 10 very small pictures to use as instructions.</li>
            <li> There were a few bad ones that made it sound like the wrong accompanying hardware was shipped with the chair.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my wife to set up a small shop here at the house.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to turn.</li>
            <li> instructions are horrible, washers don&#x27;t fit where they are supposed to be.  </li>
            <li> The chairs are hard to turn and they make a popping noise!!</li>

            <li> Well as for this barbers chair it was a great add on to our game room since I have six boys and Buzzz there hair to save when we can. works great :residential yes: Commercial use it might hold up but the cost for this one was great well worth it and the feet support makes this one a winner</li>
            <li> Love my new cutting chair, it is very comfortable and was fairly easy to assemble for my husband and I.  Make sure you follow the directions and the only tricky part was the hydraulic pump portion.  They sent an extra rubber base edge which I thought was very nice and it was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Was gift for daughter-in-law. She loves it so i guess I love it. The price was very reasonable, and with free delivery was a good bargain.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife. She works at a salon. The chair she had before had seen better days. The New chair has been a very good purchase for the price. It has been able to fit a lot of different body shapes. So far outstanding chair.</li>
            <li> It seems to be ok, I have used many chairs and it does the job. The only thing, maybe because it&#x27;s brand new it&#x27;s hard to turn. I started working from home as a stylist and like I said it does the job. It&#x27;s very comfortable with carved out seating.</li>
            <li> Great chair. Pump easy to operate. Doesn&#x27;t spin to easily which was a problem with the old chairs having to lock them constantly to keep them from turning.</li>
            <li> This is a great chair, easy to put together and light weight. I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking to get there money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> Very professional looking chair. Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I love the chair. Was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Quick deliver.  Sturdy and functional!</li>
            <li> The one in the picture is slightly different from the one I was sent. The foot lever is different and the seat is a little different. These are not the issue, it&#x27;s still a good quality chair... I think. I cant put it together completely because they sent me a few of the wrong pieces and some screws are missing, I also have assumed because the instructions they sent are also for a different chair. It did arrive quickly but I wish they&#x27;d spent more time checking I was getting the right stuff instead of getting it to me sooner than expected. I&#x27;ve contacted them and will try to update my review once I get the right stuff.</li>
            <li> My customers like this chair so bad</li>
            <li> Great chair! Only thing is it didn&#x27;t come with instructions so trying to put it together was kind of difficult. Once chair was put together it definitely looks great.</li>
            <li> Bought this chair as a Christmas gift for my son... He loved it. Good quality and great price.</li>
            <li> Great product, I just had one issue when I set it up, it came one piece that didn&#x27;t fit in as in the instructions, so I didn&#x27;t put it in and it worked.</li>
            <li> Great chair, easy to ensemble. Some of the screws were already in place. I&#x27;m a stylist working from home so it&#x27;s perfect! doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space, yet it&#x27;s light enough to lift and move. I love it!</li>
            <li> The chairs are hard to turn and they make a popping noise!! I have to lock the chair in order for it to stop</li>
            <li> I purchased this styling chair for my daughter who has recently graduated from beauty school.  I is a very solid and quality built item.  Some assembly was required.  My daughter is very pleased with the &amp;#34;Mae&amp;#34; Black Classic Styling Chair with Round Base.</li>
            <li> I went through all the reviews before ordering this chair. There were a few bad ones that made it sound like the wrong accompanying hardware was shipped with the chair. The instructions are very bad, for the most part there are just 10 very small pictures to use as instructions. There is a pin that goes into the hydraulic tube that needs a large pair of pliers the squeeze it to get it started and then a hammer to drive it most of the way in. To install the hydraulic pump handle there are two set screws that need to be backed out before the handle can be inserted. Considering the price this chair exceeds my expectations. It is comfortable, goes high enough for small children and has held a 6&#x27;3&amp;#34; 275lb man just fine. Everyone who has sat in it says it is comfortable. I like this chair.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my wife to set up a small shop here at the house. Excellent price with free shipping. Arrived super-fast. Chair was perfect. My wife loves it. Works perfectly and does everything she needs.</li>
            <li> the chair  shipped in a timely manner. pretty easy to assemble. had some help from a friend. one arm was a little wobbly but for the most part no complaints. good price. good quality and i would buy it again.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews I decided to order this chair and I am so glad that I did.  It was really easy to assemble and I have had no problems using it.  It is comfortable to sit in and easy to raise and lower.</li>
            <li> instructions are horrible, washers don&#x27;t fit where they are supposed to be.  After responding once their customer service has abandoned me and will not respond to multiple emails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware</li>
            <li> It is a super cheap chair do not waste your money on it.  There is plastice parts and they break the moment you get it out and the leg rest is super cheap cheap cheap.</li>
            <li> I bought this chair to go in an in-home salon. Our daughter is currently taking cosmetology in high school. She&#x27;s always practicing on her sisters in the kitchen. We decided to setup a mini salon in our basement to give her a more practical space to work in. This chair is perfect for our needs. It arrived on time, in perfect condition. It was very easy to setup and even came with an extra ring for the base. It goes up and down easily. The price is excellent. I would deinitely recommend this chair to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to put together, took about 20 mins from opening the box to sitting in it! Good deal, especially for the unbeatable price!</li>
            <li> i so love this chair was kinda scared buying it but im glad i did have no regrets the chair is super heavy tho over all would total recommend!</li>
            <li> My chair shipped quickly and arrived quickly, and when I got the mae chair in black my husband put it together quickly and easily. It&#x27;s sturdy, looks good and heavy enough to not flip over but light enough to move around easily. My clients have loved it so far and say its very comfortable. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this chair. It might not be top quality but it&#x27;s decent for the price and gets the job done. I have it in my room that serves as a mini salon xD</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the chair, for the price it was everything that I expected ...</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moAU6SUBEFVKCZ]]Save yourself the time, effort, and frustration. I paid $74+ just to return this product. Even with a refund, this contraption wasted my time and money.</li>
            <li> Love this chair. Very simple to put together. All that have sat in it so far has enjoyed the experience of having a comfortable chair while receiving their service.</li>
