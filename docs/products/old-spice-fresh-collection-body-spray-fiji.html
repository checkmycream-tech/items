    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It is a great price!</li>
            <li>I should have ordered wolfhorn which is exquisite and musky as against the damp-y fragrance of Fiji.</li>
            <li>I thought that getting the body spray would be perfect.</li>
            <li>Excellent product with a great scent.</li>
            <li>Great smelling body spray.</li>
            <li>so I am happy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective in deodorizing, and my nephew says it lasts through out the day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;body sprays; I am sure you will be impressed with this product:</li>
            <li>Wonderful Product; I look for the best deals when making my purchases; And Old Spice has expanded with body washes, deodorants.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work and smell just as good as axe products with a cheaper pricetag.  </li>
            <li>This smells really good</li>
            <li>how good I smell.  </li>
            <li>This is my sons (age 21) favorite fragrence!</li>
            <li>The scent is OK.</li>
            <li>I like being able to buy it in a multi-pack</li>
            <li>I love the shower gel too.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this scent.  </li>
            <li>I just love this product period.</li>
            <li>the spay top sucks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments when wearing it, and the fragrance lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I get much better reactions to this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Ok</li>
            <li>I like this one better than the newer packing.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of being on vacation; summer, sunshine and cool ocean breezes -- and who couldn&#x27;t use more of that in their life?!  </li>
            <li>This is a very good price comparing to getting this at a Big Box retailer.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best fragrance out there by Old Spice.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a big fan of the Old Spice &#x27;Sport&#x27;  scent, but the Fiji scent is wonderful sort of nice blend of spices and some blood orange.  </li>
            <li>This scent is light and fruity.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, not thick or overpowering.</li>
            <li>Old Spice Fresh Collection Body Spray, Fiji Scent smells good, not overpowering but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always nice when Amazon has a coupon, and naturally, Subscribe &amp; Save helps too.  </li>
            <li>to sweet smelling dont like the scent</li>
            <li>Seems to run out fairly quick.</li>
            <li>this fiji fragrance is cool, fresh &amp; comfort ^^</li>
            <li>Kind of smells like apples mixed with the \\&quot;ocean\\&quot; fragrances.</li>
            <li>I prefer de aqua fresh one.</li>
            <li>I use Old Spice Fiji deodorant and love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, it is a little sweet, but not too strong like Axe products that my friends use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still using the first can</li>
            <li>With my two teenage boys living with me, smelling good is not only a must but a requirement.</li>
            <li>Feels very fresh right after you use, but the freshness doesn&#x27;t last for a while compared to the AXE sprays.</li>
            <li>Also, and this is true for all Old Spice body sprays, the mist is dispersed in a way to where it seems to bounce off of you or it doesn&#x27;t quite reach you, or it misses you all together.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is ok nothing special but it just doesn&#x27;t last as long as the Axe body spray.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t really pick out which ones.</li>
            <li>girlfriend absolutely loves the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest buying it if you want to stick out from all the rest.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this as a gift or for yourself if you are in the market for a new deodorant!!</li>
            <li>I usually buy Axe body spray but decided to give Old Spice body spray a try and they are average at best.</li>
            <li>It seems this had more scent and less propellent</li>
            <li>but it is ok after a half hour or so.</li>
            <li>As mentioned in the title, I love the small of these Old Spice fresh collection body sprays.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure what the folks who put together this formula were thinking, but this puts out something that looks more like a powderized spray instead of the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; deodorant one would expect.</li>
            <li>smells a little strong</li>
            <li>Made a switch from axe to old spicy just to try something new, I like the scent</li>
            <li>Its one of my favorites by old spice but wolfthorne beats it.</li>
            <li>I use old spice and it eliminated a trip to get it</li>
            <li>This is my fave Old Spice body spray.  </li>
            <li>If you are not sure of the smell, I would compare it to a more moderate Hawaiian Tropics sun tan lotion.</li>
            <li>I took one star off due to the small size of this product (I&#x27;ve seen other men&#x27;s deoderant sprays sold at 10oz, but the Old Spice line is just great).  </li>
            <li>On top of that the fragrance smell is quite weak and a tad too floral...</li>
            <li>It leaves some white residue on dark/black shirts, and I feel like 80% of what I spray avoids direct contact with the skin and blows off in the air.</li>
            <li>In terms of usability as well as the actual purpose, Old Spice gets defeated by Axe.</li>
            <li>Well, silly as it sounded, it did kind of encapsulate how I felt about this scent.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but I do use it liberally as it&#x27;s not that strong (once you leave the cloud of spray) and it usually doesn&#x27;t last all day, though sometimes it does for some reason.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nothing compared to the other varieties offered by old spice.</li>
            <li> Only difference is they  don&#x27;t seem to last as long.  </li>
            <li> It last for a long time on the body.</li>
            <li> Other than that, if you want something to just spray on before work if you&#x27;re a blue collar guy or leaving the gym etc</li>
            <li> goes away fast and leaves an odd smell after about an hour and a half to two hours would recommend other scents</li>
            <li> not much else to say about a body spray.</li>
            <li> Smells very fresh, like a cold morning after camping in a forest,</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s other fruity smells to it</li>
            <li> Most women I talk to absolutely hate Axe</li>
            <li> Just wish it cost a bit less.  </li>
            <li> so I can save a little money!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You have to press so hard to get so little.</li>
            <li> Also the thumb space to exert the quirt is very less making it inconvenient at times.</li>
            <li> Also the twist cap on the edge of this bottle is annoying at times since you have to look for the position all the time.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This smells like an island breeze. The problem is that you have to use about a third of the can to get the scent to linger longer than an hour. Also, and this is true for all Old Spice body sprays, the mist is dispersed in a way to where it seems to bounce off of you or it doesn&#x27;t quite reach you, or it misses you all together.</li>
            <li> The scent is OK. would prefer something not so fruity. Seems to run out fairly quick. I would prefer a body spray instead of an areosole.</li>
            <li> Product as described. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> As mentioned in the title, I love the small of these Old Spice fresh collection body sprays.  They work and smell just as good as axe products with a cheaper pricetag.  Only difference is they  don&#x27;t seem to last as long.  Other than that, if you want something to just spray on before work if you&#x27;re a blue collar guy or leaving the gym etc I&#x27;d go with this product.</li>
            <li> This is my sons (age 21) favorite fragrence! It is a great price! I like being able to buy it in a multi-pack so I can save a little money!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nothing compared to the other varieties offered by old spice. I should have ordered wolfhorn which is exquisite and musky as against the damp-y fragrance of Fiji.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, not thick or overpowering. Would purchase again to work in concert with the body wash of the same scent.</li>
            <li> This scent is light and fruity. Kind of smells like apples mixed with the \\&quot;ocean\\&quot; fragrances. There&#x27;s other fruity smells to it but I can&#x27;t really pick out which ones. Its one of my favorites by old spice but wolfthorne beats it. I like fruity sprays especially on my boyfriend but its not girly.</li>
            <li> I use old spice and it eliminated a trip to get it and the cost was the same so the value is not having to go get it</li>
            <li> goes away fast and leaves an odd smell after about an hour and a half to two hours would recommend other scents</li>
            <li> I had to chuckle when I read the description of this scent:  \\&quot;Smells like palm trees, sunshine &amp; freedom.  Where Freshness Smells From.  Inhale the Adventure\\&quot;  Well, silly as it sounded, it did kind of encapsulate how I felt about this scent.  It reminds me of being on vacation; summer, sunshine and cool ocean breezes -- and who couldn&#x27;t use more of that in their life?!  This is my fave Old Spice body spray.  I love the shower gel too.  Just wish it cost a bit less.  It&#x27;s always nice when Amazon has a coupon, and naturally, Subscribe &amp; Save helps too.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent.  Smells very fresh, like a cold morning after camping in a forest, only sweeter.  Only problem is that you can only smell it for an hour or s, after that its gone.  Perhaps it&#x27;s by design, but I&#x27;d like it to last longer than my commute in to work.</li>
            <li> I just love this product period. It last for a long time on the body. I Recommended this product to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> to sweet smelling dont like the scent</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the folks who put together this formula were thinking, but this puts out something that looks more like a powderized spray instead of the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; deodorant one would expect. It leaves some white residue on dark/black shirts, and I feel like 80% of what I spray avoids direct contact with the skin and blows off in the air. On top of that the fragrance smell is quite weak and a tad too floral... so not tooo &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> i like it.&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t know realy fragrance of fiji.&lt;br /&gt;but this fiji fragrance is cool, fresh &amp; comfort ^^</li>
            <li> This body spray smells like what it advertises itself as; palm trees, sunshine and freedom.&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend absolutely loves the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest buying it if you want to stick out from all the rest.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Product; I look for the best deals when making my purchases; And Old Spice has expanded with body washes, deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;body sprays; I am sure you will be impressed with this product:</li>
            <li> With my two teenage boys living with me, smelling good is not only a must but a requirement. Old Spice Fresh Collection Body Spray, Fiji Scent smells good, not overpowering but the spay top sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to press so hard to get so little. Product design is the only flaw.</li>
            <li> This smells really good and I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of comments  how good I smell.  This is a very good price comparing to getting this at a Big Box retailer.</li>
            <li> Excellent product with a great scent. However,the scent declines as the day goes on.&lt;br /&gt;I still would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best fragrance out there by Old Spice. If you are not sure of the smell, I would compare it to a more moderate Hawaiian Tropics sun tan lotion. It definitely has a coconut fragrance and is not over powering at all. I have received many compliments when wearing it, and the fragrance lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this as a gift or for yourself if you are in the market for a new deodorant!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell, it is a little sweet, but not too strong like Axe products that my friends use.</li>
            <li> Great smelling body spray. Not musky or overbearing like Axe Body Sprays. Most women I talk to absolutely hate Axe so I get much better reactions to this. Actually never had a compliment wearing Axe but plenty with this.</li>
            <li> I bought to test, and approved. Definitely i recommend... I prefer de aqua fresh one. But i will buy again... It&#x27;s Ok</li>
            <li> I like this one better than the newer packing. It seems this had more scent and less propellent</li>
            <li> My nephew loves this scent!  He&#x27;s a big fan of the Old Spice &#x27;Sport&#x27;  scent, but the Fiji scent is wonderful sort of nice blend of spices and some blood orange.  I took one star off due to the small size of this product (I&#x27;ve seen other men&#x27;s deoderant sprays sold at 10oz, but the Old Spice line is just great).  It&#x27;s very effective in deodorizing, and my nephew says it lasts through out the day.  My nephew says the girls at his school often compliment him when he uses the spray.</li>
            <li> I use Old Spice Fiji deodorant and love the smell of it. I thought that getting the body spray would be perfect. I like the smell of the body spray, however, it is not the same smell as the deodorant. It&#x27;s similar, but not the same. But, I would still buy this product and use it because it still smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using the first can and it&#x27;s been about 4 months of use. I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but I do use it liberally as it&#x27;s not that strong (once you leave the cloud of spray) and it usually doesn&#x27;t last all day, though sometimes it does for some reason.</li>
            <li> smells a little strong but I like it. but it is ok after a half hour or so. not much else to say about a body spray. but it comes when it is supposed to without problems. so I am happy.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Axe body spray but decided to give Old Spice body spray a try and they are average at best. The fragrance is ok nothing special but it just doesn&#x27;t last as long as the Axe body spray. If you spray it on after a shower in the morning by mid-day the fragrance is gone unlike Axe which last all day. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Made a switch from axe to old spicy just to try something new, I like the scent and it does its job well</li>
            <li> Feels very fresh right after you use, but the freshness doesn&#x27;t last for a while compared to the AXE sprays. Also the twist cap on the edge of this bottle is annoying at times since you have to look for the position all the time. Also the thumb space to exert the quirt is very less making it inconvenient at times. In terms of usability as well as the actual purpose, Old Spice gets defeated by Axe.</li>
