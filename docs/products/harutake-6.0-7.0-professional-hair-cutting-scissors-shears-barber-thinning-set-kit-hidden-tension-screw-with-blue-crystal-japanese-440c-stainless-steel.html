            <li>These are absolutely lovely shears!</li>
            <li>I  must admit that the packaging was nice.</li>
            <li>My feeling is that these scissors should be in the $30 range for the set (all because of the nice leather case) not anywhere in the $200 range.</li>
            <li>they come nicely packaged too.</li>
            <li>We are quite pleased.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used $10 scissors that are better than these.</li>
            <li>They are outstanding and cut very clean lines.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>product is exactly what I was looking for and I very, very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Light and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>I was uneasy with ordering shears from the internet but everything about them is fantastic.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t help it with such a great deal.</li>
            <li>However using these scissors made me think of cheap pharmacy type ($9.99) scissors.</li>
            <li>Who has time to look for the cheap tool to tighten mid-haircut.......</li>
            <li>They cut smoothly and almost effortlessly.</li>
            <li>i brought this back in november and they are still working great.</li>
            <li>I thought I would take a chance on this set and was pleasantly surprised there every bit as good as shears twice the price</li>
            <li>Theses shears are good enough for most hair types.</li>

            <li>Did not try it yet, but definitely looks good.</li>
            <li>SUPER VALUE.</li>
            <li>Enjoy it very much</li>
            <li>very high quality and easy to control.</li>
            <li>Considering the price... worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>My wife cuts my hair---not so much to save money, more because she knows exactly what she wants and I, in the fullness of wisdom, allowed her to (as if I really had a choice!).</li>
            <li>The reason for this purchase was to have an emergency back-up for my regular shear set and these, for the price, are more than adequate.  </li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>and I love the different sizes that come with it.</li>
            <li>I would prefer to afford authentic Japanese steel.</li>
            <li>And so far, I absolutely LOVE my new shears.</li>
            <li>These are high quality shears for a very reasonable price...</li>
            <li>Better than I expected them to be.</li>
            <li>I was nervous because of the inexpensive price tag, but I really couldn&#x27;t be happier at this point.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone who is interested in purchasing new shears.</li>
            <li>They are a full 25 grams heavier than my regular shears</li>
            <li>Though it is very expensive as scissors, but it is really perfect.  </li>
            <li>Those scissors are top notch, razor-sharp and nicely profiled to allow efficient hair cutting.</li>
            <li>I tend to buy high end shears .</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>My only problem is they are fit for very thin fingers, which makes them much more comfortable for my wife than for myself.</li>
            <li>Very Sharp and would love to order other available scissors.</li>
            <li>If your thinking of getting new shears I would highly recommend these to and stylist or barber.</li>
            <li>Thinning shears add a new element to the cut.  </li>
            <li>They cut like razors, but dull very easy.</li>
            <li>Paying $200 for 3 scissors that require a tool to tighten for the first use is totally unacceptable.</li>
            <li>Such smooth cutting &amp; I totally love the ergonomic design.</li>
            <li>:  Not sharp, heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are looking for a good sharp set of shears, you cannot go wrong with these.</li>

            <li> you are looking for a good sharp set of shears, you cannot go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> But I had grown weary of the ordinary, dull scissors she was using---they pulled my hair more than they cut it.</li>
            <li> only issue i had was with the screw getting loose, but after i tightned it back up, it was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They pulled my clients hair on the first snips, to the point that my client left mid-haircut while annoyed at all the pulling.</li>
            <li> I have seen the same set sell from other dealers for over $400.  </li>
            <li> They have replaced his other daily use scissors.</li>
            <li> i have owned a few cheaper shears that start to dull out quickly and start pulling on hair after a few uses.</li>
            <li> The finger rings could be a little larger.</li>
            <li> Though they are not very sharp they still cut and I am used to using dull shears anyway.  </li>
            <li> I was also worried that they would be too small or too big for my fingers</li>
            <li> I am a full time barber and have been cutting hair for 30 years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;they are sharp and well made.</li>
            <li> they are very sharp, and the off-set thumb relieves a lot of tension from your thumb.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, no hair pull.</li>
            <li> you cannot go wrong with these</li>

            <li> Very fast delivery. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and very sharp. Light and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> As advertised. This is a very nice set of scissors. My wife cuts my hair---not so much to save money, more because she knows exactly what she wants and I, in the fullness of wisdom, allowed her to (as if I really had a choice!). But I had grown weary of the ordinary, dull scissors she was using---they pulled my hair more than they cut it. These are a welcome relief. We are quite pleased.</li>
            <li> Ordered this set for my husband who is not a barber or hairstylist but loves to cut hair and is in fact very good at it. He enjoys using them and although they are not the quality of the $400 scissors that are out there, they definitly come close.</li>
            <li> These shears are awesome. They are outstanding and cut very clean lines. I was uneasy with ordering shears from the internet but everything about them is fantastic. And the colors are awesome.</li>
            <li> These scissors are awesome, fast shipping! Worth every penny!! Better than I expected them to be. If your thinking of getting new shears I would highly recommend these to and stylist or barber.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely lovely shears! I was a bit worried about purchasing shears off the internet but I couldn&#x27;t help it with such a great deal. I was also worried that they would be too small or too big for my fingers but they seem to fit perfectly! yay! hehe&lt;br /&gt;These are a great quality and I love the different sizes that come with it. I would recommend these to anyone who is interested in purchasing new shears.</li>
            <li> I tend to buy high end shears . I thought I would take a chance on this set and was pleasantly surprised there every bit as good as shears twice the price</li>
            <li> These shears are AWESOME!!!  ...I am a full time barber and have been cutting hair for 30 years.  This is the best set of shears I have ever purchased. These are high quality shears for a very reasonable price...I have seen the same set sell from other dealers for over $400.  The quality is excellent...they are very sharp, and the off-set thumb relieves a lot of tension from your thumb.</li>
            <li> Pros:  High-end design style, feel, balance and mechanical function.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Not sharp, heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is exactly what I was looking for and I very, very satisfied.  The reason for this purchase was to have an emergency back-up for my regular shear set and these, for the price, are more than adequate.  Though they are not very sharp they still cut and I am used to using dull shears anyway.  They are a full 25 grams heavier than my regular shears but, again, for the price and design, look, feel this is not a big issue.  I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my father in law who is a barber for 30 years and he loves them. They have replaced his other daily use scissors. He is very, very pleased with this set.</li>
            <li> They cut like razors, but dull very easy. The 7 inch shears dulled when i used it on a client with coarse hair. The 6 inch shears did stay sharper though. They&#x27;re okay i guess</li>
            <li> I  must admit that the packaging was nice. However using these scissors made me think of cheap pharmacy type ($9.99) scissors. Paying $200 for 3 scissors that require a tool to tighten for the first use is totally unacceptable. They pulled my clients hair on the first snips, to the point that my client left mid-haircut while annoyed at all the pulling. Who has time to look for the cheap tool to tighten mid-haircut....... My feeling is that these scissors should be in the $30 range for the set (all because of the nice leather case) not anywhere in the $200 range. I&#x27;ve used $10 scissors that are better than these.</li>
            <li> Theses shears are good enough for most hair types. I like the extended tang. Lots of weight in the blades. I would prefer to afford authentic Japanese steel. Considering the price... worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, no hair pull. Thinning shears add a new element to the cut.  The finger rings could be a little larger.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Very Sharp and would love to order other available scissors.</li>
            <li> Those scissors are top notch, razor-sharp and nicely profiled to allow efficient hair cutting. They cut smoothly and almost effortlessly. My only problem is they are fit for very thin fingers, which makes them much more comfortable for my wife than for myself.</li>
            <li> The processing &amp; delivery time was fewer than 2 days. And so far, I absolutely LOVE my new shears. Such smooth cutting &amp; I totally love the ergonomic design. I was nervous because of the inexpensive price tag, but I really couldn&#x27;t be happier at this point.</li>
            <li> Bought if for a friend who is hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality and finish.  Did not try it yet, but definitely looks good.</li>
            <li> you cannot go wrong with these shears!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they are sharp and well made. i have owned a few cheaper shears that start to dull out quickly and start pulling on hair after a few uses. not a problem with these. they come nicely packaged too. i brought this back in november and they are still working great. only issue i had was with the screw getting loose, but after i tightned it back up, it was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you are looking for a good sharp set of shears, you cannot go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughter who just graduated from Mario Triccoci Scholls of cosmetology. SUPER VALUE. SHOVES THEM!</li>
            <li> Though it is very expensive as scissors, but it is really perfect.  very high quality and easy to control. Enjoy it very much</li>
